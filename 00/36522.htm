<p>Liguei meu xbox 360 slim, deu luz verde normal e depois de alguns segundos apareceu uma luz vermelha no meio do botão de on/off, não aparece nada na tv, nenhum código, nada, eu reinicio e as vezes volta ao normal, mas depois de um tempo aparece novamente,
 já mudei de lugar o xbox pensando que era a ventilação que estava ruim, mas nada, tirei da tomada e naaadaa!!! Se alguém sabe a solução, por favor me ajuda, pois preciso saber do que se trata isso antes de levar a assistência técnica.</p>

<p>Cara, já passei por uma situação bem parecida, e talvez (talvez) seja o mesmo problema. No meu caso, foi erro de Hardware, e ali no botão Power, só a luz central ficou vermelha. Seu Xbox tem HD e/ou vc usa pen drive? Se tiver, tenta tirar o hd e recolocar,
 limpar o cache do sistema do hd, e mesmo com o pen drive se tiver tbm. Comigo aconteceu umas 4 ou 5 vezes, e depois que eu passei a limpar o cache do hd, pelo menos uma vez por semana, nunca mais aconteceu. Pode ser esse o problema, se não for, eu não sei.
 Mas tente isso. Espero ter ajudado. Abrass!</p>

    <title>Why does Microsoft keep on making changes to Windows version, as well - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> piansa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Microsoft keep on making changes to Windows version, as well as having various Office versions&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Like when they came up with Windows 8, it was such a disaster.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t know but it seems that Windows 7 is the best version.<span>&nbsp; </span>
So I don’t get this on having to come up with many versions, that it only brings more confusion and more opportunities for disaster.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Whenever there’s need for improvement, that can already be addressed by updates.</span></p>

<p><span>If they’re changing the version thinking it’s something similar to updating versions of a car model, that is completely different as a car model would be a change in the looks of it, whereas Windows
 would deal with information, and any issues to improve it can be installed via updates, and these version changes only make everything complicated, like having the associated help version for Office version, if whether the suggested improvement would already
 be covered by the given version, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>Well, if it would be an issue of money, Microsoft being a business, then that could easily be arranged by having a license for renewal.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But to keep having new versions simply makes everything complicated!</span></p>

            Right you are, and Microsoft hears you. That's why Windows 10 is the last version of Windows ... that's what Microsoft says. There will be no Windows 11, 12, etc. Just updates. See, who says Microsoft doesn't listen to its customers?

            <p>The reason is that no one can forecast what future systems might be able to do so you can't build a system that will never need to be changed. Every now and then, a complete redesign is needed to take advantage of new technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we didn't get new versions, Windows would not be able to see more than 4 MB of RAM. That was the limit in the 90's and the only way to go past it was to completely redesign the system. There is no way you can do an update that replaces the core of the
 OS to this extent. These changes are not going away, so despite what MS say at some point in the future, there will be another rewrite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it 10 years and I suspect we'll be looking at CPUs with dozens if not hundreds of cores running at 10's of GHz. We'll see terabytes of RAM in PCs. A little while after that we'll see the disapperance of separate disk and memory as drives reach the same
 speed as RAM is now, you won't need RAM anymore, so no opening and saving files anymore. You can't effectively use all that power given the current design of the core of Windows. And that's not even considering more dramatic advances like quantum computing
 that will change the whole paradigm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are still a lot of things that a top of the line desktop cannot do, so we obviously need to keep building faster and more powerful computers and they will need smarter OSs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I can't wait.</p>

            <p>MS have certainly been moving to different architectures like Phone, so given that phones have different characteristics to desktops and tablets, changes are needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I gave explains why they might be <strong>forced</strong> to change. Reasons they might
<strong>choose</strong> to do so are more numerous. New UI concepts, new functionality that wasn't considered in the current design, bigger screens (and smaller screens) are all reasons they might have to update the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently there seems to be a strategy of simplifying everything to make it easier for MS to support. Personally, I think that's a crock... MS built the system, so MS should support it in all it's variety. That means they need to start hiring smarter people
 in support roles. Doing it well is not a matter of scripts and canned responses, it's about really understanding how Windows works on the inside and using that knowledge to investigate the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always want to be able to do more and do it better and easier as time goes by, so I'm all for new versions and new interface concepts. What I'm not for is removing any functionality. What's given should never be taken away!</p>

            And also about Office most especially, that there would be new versions instead of updating one.&nbsp; It simply causes confusion, like you one can't tell whether a suggestion is already applied to the subsequent version, and they would have different styles
 concerning the help function.

            <p>It's the same thing. MS could not possibly think of all the things anyone might ever want to do in Word when they wrote the first version in the 1990's. As time goes by we think of new things to do with our PCs so we want more functionality. Sometimes that
 needs a complete rewrite to include, so new versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we never had new versions, we'd still be using text based monochrome screens and not have a mouse. I suggest people that don't like change go and use DOS with a mono screen and no mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also keep in mind that while you and most other people probably only use 5% of the capability of the applications, there are a lt of us that use a lot more of it and often find it's limits. We are always on the lookout for new features that enable us to
 do things that are impossible or impractical on the current versions and hardware.</p>

            Because it only gets confusing if you made a suggestion with respect to an earlier Office version (i.e. 2013) and can't tell if it was already implemented in succeeding versions.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
type<strong> services.msc</strong> into the startmenu search and launch the tool. Search the
<strong>Superfetch</strong> entry and make a double click on it. Now change the start type to "automatic" and click on start. The service now starts and you should be able to use ReadyBoost.<br />
<br />
Btw, you should never disbale Superfetch, it slows down your PC!<br />

    <title>Exception&#58; DLL Not Found in UWP application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaditya nerkar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exception&#58; DLL Not Found in UWP application</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've recently get to know about the Microsoft's Project Centennial. I have a Win32/.NET application which I want to convert into UWP application. So for this, I used Desktop App Converter and the application Setup exe. The setup exe is created using
 Inno compiler and I'm packing the Spoon packed exe with it. After processing it through the Desktop App Converter, I created an app package using 'makeappx.exe'. Now whenever I install the application it gives me an error and application doesn't get launched.
 So I checked the LocalAppData folder of the application and found a 'SkipErrorLog.txt' file which says, "Could not load file or assembly "System.Data.SQLite.dll" or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the path specified." I've checked inside spoon
 and this DLL is getting packed&nbsp;properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So is there any solution, so I can solve this error and my UWP application runs properly? Is there any other limitations which are related to UWP applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I get an error message 0xC19000101-0x30018 when updating to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have attempted to update my machine three times now from Windows 7.&nbsp; The last attempt I thought it was going to go, the new Windows 10 screen was up, had 25% completed then the machine rebooted and said it was restoring my machine back to the original
 Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run WindowsUpdateDiagnostic, which it says it couldn't fix two things.&nbsp; I also ran MicrosoftFixit50123 which didn't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, a friend of mine suggested I use the file: MediaCreationToolx64 to install Windows 10.&nbsp; I got the farthest with this but still only 25% completed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read an article that said I need to disable my peripherals and even a SATA drive if I have one to make the install work.&nbsp; Does this really need to be done, especially the SATA drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?</p>

White open envelope is an icon for read message. It means that the message is already read.<br />

            <p>Hi Kent,</p>
<p>I already&nbsp;knew that the white open envelope meant "read message". My question was about an icon that
<em>looks like</em> the "read message" icon, but with the bottom right corner folded upwards (wish I could paste&nbsp;an image here). From what I've observed since first posting my question, it seems to represent a
<strong>new, unread</strong> message that's been detected, but not fully downloaded. When I get a message with such a icon and do a Sync, the icon turns into the standard yellow "unread message" closed-envelope icon. Is my guess correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Ron,</p>
<p>I have the entire messages, not just the headers. And I've seen the icon with several messages from several different sources - some I trust; others are spam/etc.&nbsp; I'm just trying to get some verification of exactly what the icon means.&nbsp; As I said earlier,
 I think it'd be a HUGE help to you&nbsp; folks if I was only able to post an image of the icon.</p>
<p>Maybe more information would help: my account is an IMAP account (gmail). And repeating: whenever a message comes in with this icon, it turns into a yellow "unread message" closed-envelope icon after I do a Sync on the account.&nbsp; I'll try to illustrate it
 with characters:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;/\<br />
&nbsp;/&nbsp; \<br />
/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \<br />
|\&nbsp; /|<br />
| \/ |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- This is the typical open-envelope "read message" icon.<br />
| /\ |<br />
|/&nbsp; \|<br />
----</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; /\<br />
&nbsp;/&nbsp; \<br />
/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \<br />
|\&nbsp; /|<br />
| \/ |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- This is the icon I see sometimes with new messages.<br />
| /\/<br />
|/ /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- The bottom-right corner appears to be folded.<br />
--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-----<br />
|\&nbsp; /|<br />
| \/ |&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- After I click Sync, the icon above becomes a closed-envelope "unread message" icon.<br />
| /\ |<br />
|/&nbsp; \|<br />
-----<br />
</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps a little. Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the issue description you are unable to boot and getting the error
</span>un-mountable boot volume. While repairing you are getting black screen. <span>
The issue could be if there is some system file corruption. So I would suggest you to perform Automatic repair before reinstalling the OS. For performing the task I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you use the Recovery Environment (Windows RE) to troubleshoot startup issues, first try the
<strong><span>Startup Repair</span></strong> option in the
<strong><span>System Recovery Options</span></strong> dialog box. If this does not resolve the issue, or if you have to manually troubleshoot additional issues, use the Bootrec.exe tool.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since you are unable to boot the computer, you may have to create a bootable Windows&nbsp;installation media and then perform an Automatic Repair and if it doesn't help then you may
 try to restore your computer to the previous date.</span></p>

<h2>            WiFi channels available on Surface 3</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro-surfnetwork/wifi-channels-supported-on-surface-pro/e97fb1d5-c5d4-4760-a0c1-36e8d271588d" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I am traveling for a year and using my Surface 3 for internet. I am connecting to other peoples routers. I do not have the luxury of changing their router config to channel 1 to 11. Why limit the device from reading these channels. Is the onus not on the
 router devices themselves? This limitation makes the Surface 3 unreliable and hence useless for international travel. You should either fix this or notify users up front before they spend their money.</p>
<p>My husbands Galaxy S5, Nexus 7 and my kids IPod 3's can all connect to router channel 13, but not my Surface 3.</p>
<p>The only way I can get internet consistently while traveling is by USB tether to my husbands S5.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the Surface 3 but between the WiFi channel limitation and the fact I have to do a System Restore every 3 weeks to get the network adapter to work again I'm not sure I can recommend it to anyone.</p>

            <p>It's the governmental bodies in the various countries that set these requirements. In the US, the FCC has mandated 1-11 only. Microsoft has followed the requirement to NOT enable anything else out of the box and has not made optional configs available for
 travelers. There are similar differences in channel availability in the 5GHz band.

            SSE2 is built in processor, you can not "add" or "emulate" it in any kind. You can check your processor's features in Cpu-z or Aida64 programs

            <p>I am having this problem too ever since "upgrading" to Windows 8.&nbsp; I couldn't figure out how to fix it, so I settled with using a "local" account every time I signed in.&nbsp; Since installing 8.1, my local account no longer has access my files (documents, music,
 pictures, my old desktop etc).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I want is this - the computer doesn't require a user to be logged in but rather it just boots up to the desktop where I/anyone has access to anything on the harddrive and/or desktop.&nbsp; If anyone wants to log into their email, they can open up explorer
 and go sign in themselves - I do not want to have to login into anything at startup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help me find these settings so I can switch my laptop back to the settings I actually enjoyed before I made the mistake of installing Windows 8.</p>

            <p>You can use a PIN to login, a four digit pin for example, once this is set you simply enter the pin and no need then to press enter, once the login accepts the pin it logins in directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To setup a PIN instead of a password go the start screen, type the word PIN, you will see setup PIN appear in the results, after setting up sign out and sign back in.</p>

    <title>WMR Headset has no display, no matter what I do. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WMR Headset has no display, no matter what I do.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working on this issue for literal HOURS at this point. I'm at the emotional level of a two year old from the frustration and am gearing up to throw this WMR headset off of my balcony and forget about it's existence. But, I also hate not fixing
 technological issues, so I'm hoping those of you here can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the (what appears to be) infamous black screen in my Acer WMR headset. I bought the stupid thing in November of 2018, so I've only had it for sixish, maybe seven months. I had noticed last year that occasionally, the display within the headset just
 would refuse to turn on... however, restarting my computer A LOT or unplugging it/plugging it back in (a lot) would fix the issue for a while, so I didn't think much of it. Like with all shiny, new tech, I grew bored of the like three VR games I had available
 to me at the time and stopped using it for a few months, occasionally picking it back up and playing it without issues in January, February, and March of this year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally just kept the headset plugged in and occasionally the stupid thing would turn on and open the Mixed Reality Portal when I picked up my drink from in front of it. Note, the display within the headset also would come on. So, I turned the headset
 away from where I keep my drink and that stopped the issue. Fast forward to today (or several days ago, really.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My headset had been plugged in as per usual. I picked it up to put it on my head and the Mixed Reality Portal came up like normal... but the display didn't turn on. No big D, I'll just unplug/plug it back in repeatedly until it works. It didn't work. So
 I tried restarting my computer a bunch. That didn't work. So I tried updating every driver known to man. ...That also didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-AH101-D8EY-Windows-Reality-VD-R05AP-002/dp/B075PVLN2P" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Yes, it's true.">
My Exact Headset</a>. I have an Acer WMR headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Google to see about other fixes... these are the things I've done thus far:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Made sure my graphics card drivers and WMR drivers were all up to date. (They are.)</li><li>Made sure Windows is entirely up to date. (It is.)</li><li>Uninstalled all WMR drivers/programs, including SteamVR and it's related components to make SteamVR work with WMR, and reinstalled them.</li><li>I tried unplugging the headset, restarting the computer, and plugging the headset back in.</li><li>I turned every EVERY SINGLE Windows power option for turning off my USB devices to save power. This includes Windows' fast boot crap.</li><li>I went to see if my Nvidia Control Panel had the Stereoscopic 3D section to turn that crap off. Mine does not have this section.</li><li>I've made sure my monitors (I have two of them) were both at 60hz with their native resolutions. (They are.)</li><li>I tried changing the WMR headset display settings to Automatic, 60hz, and 90hz.
<ul>
<li>Automatic and 90hz allowed me to see tracking on my computer, but not within my headset.</li><li>60hz made me unable to see tracking on my computer AND the display was still off. Mixed Reality Portal simply says "Ready," even though audio for the cliff house is still playing.</li></ul>
</li><li>My cord connections are solid. I am using the 3.0 USB port on my computer. I have three 3.0 ports and they've worked for me in the past. I have one HDMI port (that isn't my motherboard HDMI port) and it worked at one point. None of the ports are loose and
 all ports work with other devices.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>My HDMI port works to use my TV as a display.</li><li>The 3.0 USB port on top of my computer is often used for charging my Note 8</li><li>The two 3.0 USB ports on the back of my computer both work with my external speakers.</li><li>My headset's cords are straight, unkinked, with no signs of them being wonky from the outside.</li></ul>
</li><li>I've tried unplugging my second monitor to see if that was causing the issue. No change.</li><li>Dynamic Screen Resolution is off in my NVIDIA control panel. It's never been on.</li><li>Attempted to update my BIOS via the Lenovo tool to do so. It told me my BIOS was up to date.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Things I can't currently try:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I do not have a HDMI to Displayport adapter to attempt using my third displayport. I actually hate the fact that I even have to consider this a "fix."</li><li>I do not have another HDMI port to try switching to.</li><li>I do not have a 3.0 USB Hub to attempt using.</li></ul>
<p>Things I haven't tried, but really don't want to unless I have zero choice:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I haven't rolled back my Windows version.</li><li>I haven't rolled back my graphics card driver version.</li><li>I haven't reset my PC. It basically deletes every single video game I own and I'll have to reinstall every single one of them after the reset.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to mention again that&nbsp;<strong>this WMR headset did work</strong> at one point
<strong>on this&nbsp;</strong><strong>computer</strong>. It's never been dropped, beating, thrown, or otherwise harmed. Nothing has been spilled on it. I just didn't use it for like two months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a picture of my dxdiag:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea535124-dcdd-4e0c-8f04-5394caed7ef4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea535124-dcdd-4e0c-8f04-5394caed7ef4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 10 Version 1809. I checked for updates, again, at 6:57am, and it still says I'm entirely up to date.</p>
<p>My NVIDIA Graphics Driver is version 430.64, which is the latest download according to the GeForce Experience program.</p>
<p>I'm on a Lenovo computer, so I do not have Dell's TrueColor thing to turn off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a picture of my device manager currently with the headset plugged in (but the display inside said headset still off). I also included the properties of the headset where I've unchecked the power management thing. I've also gone into the properties
 of all USB devices and unchecked that box, if Power Management was available:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73fa95c5-7bd8-4955-9dac-5d3a760f7347?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73fa95c5-7bd8-4955-9dac-5d3a760f7347?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I'll note that all of the WMR things in Device Manager says the device is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked within the Event Viewer to see if there were any errors that may be causing this. The event IDs I see giving "errors" are 411, 10016, and 1000, none of which&nbsp;<em>seem</em> to be related to the WMR headset based on very fast Google searching, but
 I know close to nothing about diagnosing errors from the Event Viewer. None of the errors are thrown repeatedly and they don't seem to appear from me unplugging/replugging the headset in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what my task manager looks like with the Mixed Reality Portal open:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26ce8d6a-2404-4440-88d9-f060fbd3acad?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26ce8d6a-2404-4440-88d9-f060fbd3acad?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically, I have no idea what's wrong with this headset short of it actually just being broken. I'd really like to HOPE that isn't the case and hope maybe one of you lovely people here can help me fix this headset so I can return to enjoying this headset
 as I did before Tuesday of this week where it became my nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate ANY advice, suggestions, or tips I can try to fix this!</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those of you wondering, my computer is named DeathCube because I bought a Lenovo cube early last year and I decided it looked like an angry, square helmet with tiny legs. So I named it the DeathCube.</p>

<p>You have done a lot of work trying to get the headset to work.&nbsp; I will mention, I do not leave my headset plugged in all the time.&nbsp; I am also not running two monitors in addition to the headset.&nbsp; If you are also using USB ports to run a sound system, you
 might disconnect that to see if USB power was sufficient for the headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, something to check, in the Device Manager, set the view to show hidden devices and check if there are duplicated devices which are greyed out.&nbsp; Uninstalling the greyed out ones may have an effect, but just the duplicated ones.&nbsp; When they are greyed out,
 it means those devices are not currently connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you uninstalled the Software and reinstalled, did you uninstall all the WMR software and have to set the headset up again?&nbsp; If so, did it work for that setup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not currently running the Steam software on my WMR system so I do not know if there are any problems with that configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember when I first got mine about a year ago, there was a problem downloading the WMR software after you plugged in the headset for the first time.&nbsp; As far as I know, I did not have that problem recently after rebuilding my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also remember a comment about one type of headset which mentioned the connections
<em>on the headset</em> were having a problem so you might investigate that end of the cables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not see where you checked for Bios updates on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was in your situation, I would go back to the basics.&nbsp; Uninstall everything related to the headset and start the process over.&nbsp; Try setting it up to see if it works consistently before you start adding other devices and software.</p>

<p>Thank you for these suggestions! I'm going to be trying these things right now.</p>
<p>I'm actually a BIOS noob entirely, so I'm going to have to look up some guides on how to mess with that. So I should actually add that I haven't done anything within the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have to look up my headset. I should have likely mentioned that I'm using an
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-AH101-D8EY-Windows-Reality-VD-R05AP-002/dp/B075PVLN2P" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="My exact headset">
Acer WMR headset</a>. Because of where the cord is, it's hard to check, but I'll get a light in there and make sure it isn't gimpy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently working on uninstalling literally everything again, in case I messed up at some point or forgot something somewhere. I'm going to go slower and fully document it. If I find the fix was something stupid obvious, I'd love to be able to put that
 here for others who might have this issue in the future. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have to re-set up the headset after the first uninstall, the display on the headset just never came on during it. It popped up telling me I had to install the Mixed Reality Portal to use my headset and upon install, it started having me do all the
 boundary things again and whatnot. I'm hoping doing this all a bit more methodical might be more successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did read on one thread that someone with dual monitors had luck unplugging one of the monitors... but I'd like to find a solution that doesn't involve me unplugging something to use something else, if I can. I may mess with it with one of my monitors unplugged,
 just to rule this out entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, I had long since unplugged my external speakers because I only ever wear my headset. However, I'm also going to try unplugging everything that isn't my keyboard and mouse... I might even unplug my keyboard/mouse and use a not gaming keyboard/mouse
 for the time being, in case it's my Razer stuff or my Corsair mouse. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Something I realized a few minutes ago was that the only piece of hardware that's changed is my mouse. My Razer mouse broke and I replaced it with this Corsair one I fell in love with. It COULD be the iCue software, potentially, but I haven't gotten to checking
 that quite yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to get everything uninstalled and check into the BIOS before going into the driver things. Thanks again! :3</p>

<div>Okay, so some updates, I guess. None with success.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I updated my original post, but I'll make another one with my extra attempts:</div>
<div><br />
<ul>
<li>I uninstalled EVERYTHING related to WMR.</li><li>I did as Saltgrass suggested and viewed the hidden devices within the device manager. There WERE duplicates. I deleted the grayed out dups that were there while my headset was UNPLUGGED and everything was uninstalled. I thought. After the dups were gone,
 I restarted my computer.</li><li>I downloaded Lenovo's BIOS update tool thing and ran it. It told me I was up to date.</li><li>I reinstalled all drivers and the Mixed Reality Portal.
<ul>
<li>It did indeed send me through the full setup. It downloaded some stuff. Told me about my headset, had me choose what kinds of controllers/keyboard/gamepad I was using. The display inside the headset never turned on.</li></ul>
</li><li>After the re-installation, I restarted again for good measure to no avail.</li><li>I unplugged all USB devices from my computer, except my headset and nothing changed.</li><li>All SteamVR related software is NOT on my computer currently.</li><li>Interestingly enough, when I unplugged my second monitor along with all of my USB devices (including keyboard and mouse), Mixed Reality Portal gives me error code 14-2. However, upon plugging my keyboard/mouse back in, Mixed Reality Portal opens/runs exactly
 like I've been describing. Unfortunately, still with no display in the headset.</li></ul>
<p>And since none of that stuff worked, I did something that wasted six hours of my time and made me hate my life:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided that I was going to roll back Windows to a previous version. Probably shouldn't have done that, as my computer decided to literally sh*t itself and go into a boot loop. I ended up having to soft format (reset) my whole PC just to get back to my
 desktop. And now that that's done, I naturally wanted to see if this headset would like to make my life better aaaaaaand, nope. Even RESETTING MY COMPUTER didn't make this stupid thing work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something I noticed, however, is that my drivers in my Acer's properties say they're from 2006... which is absolutely incorrect. I literally just downloaded the driver from the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb4673dc-4d58-44d1-97bc-a56dc2f1d06d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb4673dc-4d58-44d1-97bc-a56dc2f1d06d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The highlighted driver is the most up to date one, so I have zero idea why it says 2006 and not 2019. So, I obviously installed the one I downloaded from Microsoft's website and not those other two. Now that I noticed a discrepancy, I checked the three devices
 that pop up for the headset:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Acer AH101 under Mixed Reality Devices</li><li>Mixed Reality Headset under Monitors</li><li>HoloLens Sensors under Universal Serial Bus Devices</li></ul>
<p>Both the Acer AH101 and Mixed Reality Headset show the most up to date (10.0.18362.1024) driver. However, the HoloLens Sensors shows the driver 10.0.17760.1000 and I'm not really sure why.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/858a7303-460b-4cda-85ab-d6452d3e44ee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/858a7303-460b-4cda-85ab-d6452d3e44ee?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't quite figured out how to update the HoloLens Sensors or if the driver version for this is correct. Updating with Windows automatically says it's the most up to date, but it also said that about my headset when it was clearly not up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my computer is still recovering from the reset and I'm downloading a million and one Windows Updates, I'll see if the version changes once I'm back to current... and then I'll post more updates. Unfortunately, the headset display is still black, despite
 showing tracking and having audio, same as before. Mixed Reality Portal did throw some errors as it kept coming up while I was doing driver things, but I'm ignoring them as valid errors because I was doing driver things.</p>

<p>All three of my drivers show 2006, that seems to happen quite a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it would seem to be an HDMI situation or even the display has failed.&nbsp; I don't suppose you have another system to check it on?&nbsp; I can't remember is it ever gave me an error if the display did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the WMR window is open on the desktop, does it show anything beside the small headset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will use mine and see if I notice anything.&nbsp; Is there a website for the Acer headset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might even try wiggling or flexing the cable and connections to see if any signs of life appear.</p>

<p>I did manage to get all three sections to have the same drivers. I just had to manually install the drivers onto the HoloLens Sensors... however, despite that, nothing works still. I did learn that a lot of Microsoft drivers show the 2006 date and learned
 to basically ignore it for the version number, which was helpful to know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did attempt wiggling around the cables while I was wearing the headset to see if maybe there was a short in the cable connected directly to my headset, but alas, no luck. No life, no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Mixed Reality Portal, it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcf8c696-2303-468c-95ab-cdcfedd861bf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcf8c696-2303-468c-95ab-cdcfedd861bf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything shows up 100% fine on the desktop. Tracking is fluid and perfect, audio is synced and perfect. There's just no display inside my headset, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did attempt turning on developer mode and trying to force the display on by telling it to stop displaying to my PC and only display on my headset, but that was met with no success as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer does have a website for the headset. I supposedly have a 1 year limited warranty I didn't know about, so I presume that'll be my next step. I never registered or was even aware I had a warranty and only found out via investigation on Amazon, so I hope
 that just proving I bought the headset Nov. 2018 is enough to get them to fix it. Better to send it off for a month than almost brick my computer again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last ditch effort is going to be to plug this headset in on my husband's computer. If it works on his computer, then Windows definitely broke something on mine. Which will be really irritating, since I don't want to, and am not going to, completely reformat
 my computer for this headset. I think I'd prefer it actually be broken... everything in my life is done on my computer, so losing access to it for several hours + losing all of my files (or having to spend several hours moving my files to an external) isn't
 something I really want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update with whether or not this headset works on the husband's PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This headset is just broken. I tried it on my husband's computer, which has never had WMR on it and the display wouldn't light up despite the tracking/audio working on there, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe that the headset display just literally died for zero reason during the 2 months I didn't use it. I'm off to Acer's website to complain heavily about my wasted time and money.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The headset was amazing and perfect while it worked, so I'm just bummed out. I'm currently in wait to see if they'll repair/replace the headset, since it's not even a year old.</p>

                    Windows 10 is not allowing me to login on my laptop. I've reset the password many times on my mobile device and tablet, and can access it through those same devices but it WILL NOT allow me to login on my laptop.

            I am having the same problem. I tried to input my password using the on screen keyboard, using various language options, new updated password, old password.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; When revealing the password it is ok and without any typo or mistakes. I CAN login
 using a different computer through the account.live.com site, indicating that my user name and password are functional.&nbsp; How can I login my computer now?
<br />
<br />
In the meantime I found this :<br />
<br />
https://4sysops.com/archives/reset-a-windows-10-password/<br />
<br />
It sound like the way to go but I haven't tried it yet.&nbsp; I'm very dissapointed that MS has not taken the time to help us solve this yet. I wrote the Microsoft Help Desk about 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; The "suport engineer" from the Microsoft customer support wrote me that
 this was obviously a Windows 10 related problem but that "...unfortunately the Windows support you ask is not within our competence and we have no way, internally , forward your request directly to the Windows Support Team."&nbsp; He suggested that I use the Microsoft
 Community instead.<br />
<br />
I replied vigourously that this was unacceptable and that he should do what was needed to make sure that my request be transfered to someone competent.&nbsp; He replied that it was simply not possible.&nbsp; All I want is an approved step by step procedure or dowloadable
 patch from Microsoft.&nbsp; Is that really to much to ask?

            <p>My daughter is having the same problem.</p>
<p>We have tried to call Microsoft technical support three times in the past week, but was not able to solve the issue.</p>
<p>We were&nbsp;put on hold ,&nbsp; disconnected , or was told they are not able to resolve it. Last night we were on hold for one hour 30 minutes, when finally we just wouldn't hold&nbsp;on any&nbsp;longer. Tomorrow we are going to a Microsoft store. I will tell them, they should
 post a solution. If we are able to resolve, I will let everybody know. I am very disappointed!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cursor may be disappearing when you are using Google Chrome because of a driver problem. This may also be due to the browser itself. The current browser version you have may not be compatible with the trackpad driver. We recommend you check for updates
 for both the trackpad driver and Google Chrome. Refer to the instructions below to update the trackpad driver:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>Windows </strong>icon on your home screen.<br />
</li><li>Choose <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Human Interface Devices</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>HID-compliant touch pad</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Update driver</strong>.</li><li>Restart your device.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To learn about updating Google Chrome, we suggest you browse for Google's online guide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

    <title>Dual Boot of Windows 7 and 8 very slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjb4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Boot of Windows 7 and 8 very slow</h2>
                    My dual boot set-up with Windows 8 and 7 pro 64 bit takes forever to load. &nbsp;After a re-boot or cold boot it takes almost 60 seconds to reach the selection screen for the two operating systems. I cloned my current Windows 7 set up from an Intel SSD to a
 Samsung 500GB SSD with 2 partitions. &nbsp;I then did a fresh install of Windows 8 on the 2nd partition. &nbsp;After both were working I refreshed Windows 8 Pro with no effect. &nbsp;This is a home built system using a Asus&nbsp;P8Z68-V PRO motherboard which does not support
 safe boot. Any idea how to fix this?

            Yes your loading of Windows 7 will be slower. &nbsp;You went from a Solid State Drive to a mechanical hard drive. &nbsp;A mechanical HDD is slower to boot and operate than a SSD. &nbsp;This is information supported by all documentation provided about SSD's at this time.
 &nbsp;So you cant expect the same boot time with that fact not being taken into account.
<div><br />
<div>It sounds more like your system is taking longer to get through the POST, or Power On Self Test. &nbsp;This is not something that is controlled or can be controlled by Windows. &nbsp;It is all controlled by the BIOS. &nbsp;Maybe the battery for the CMOS is dying and
 needs to be replaced?</div>

            No I went to a faster SSD (samsung 840 500GB) so should be faster boot times. &nbsp;I don't think its the battery.

            Dual booting with win 8 can be problematic and is not recommended. It also can be a violation of the license agreement. If you upgraded from win 7 on the home built computer you can no longer use or transfer windows 7. From the license agreement--
<div><br />
<div><span>Windows 8 EULA</span><br />
<br />
<b>What about upgrading the software?&nbsp;</b><br />
<span>The software covered by this agreement is an upgrade to your existing operating system (</span><b>XP SP3</b><span>,&nbsp;</span><b>Vista</b><span>, or&nbsp;</span><b>Windows 7</b><span>) software, so
 the upgrade replaces the original software that you are upgrading.&nbsp;</span><b>You do not retain any rights to the original software after you have upgraded and you may not continue to use it or transfer it in any way.</b><span>&nbsp;This agreement
 governs your rights to use the upgrade software and replaces the agreement for the software from which you upgraded. After you complete your upgrade, additional software will be required to playback or record certain types of media, including DVDs.&nbsp;</span><br />

            <p>Hi KimberlyHALLINAN,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message while printing?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How long have you been facing this issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to print the jobs stuck in the queue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>services.msc</b> in the Start search box and hit Enter.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate <b>Print Spooler</b> from the list of services.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click <b>Print Spooler</b> and select
<b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The "deleted" jobs will disappear and any queued jobs in your print queue will print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft article for solutions to some common problems with printing:</p>

            Hi Jack,<br />
<br />
this driver belongs to AsIO.sys Asus Probe. Try to uninstall Asus Probe and if you need it, install it again. If this doesn't help, uninstall Asus Probe and use other monitoring tools like Speedfan. and open the registry editor (regedit.exe) and search for
 AsIO.sys and delete all entries you can find.<br />

</p><p>I upgraded my Windows 7 Home Basic edition to Windows 10 Home edition (?). Now when I create a new user (normal - not administrator) and restrict access to certain drives to this user, the same is not enforced because the user is still able to access the
 drives on which no permissions exist for him.</p>

</p><p>Now when I go to settings there is no option to set login restrictions. there is no where i can find such controls. what am I missing?</p>

            <p>Hay Niranjan, thanks for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this and checked for setting access rights - didn't make any difference. Or am I missing something?</p>

            <p>Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior could be due to incorrect permission issue from the administrator account to the local user account without permission.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to check the settings you can manage to permit other user account to access locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to: <strong><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/br230781%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage users and permissions</a></strong></p>

            <p>I got you but the problem is there's no way I can set access controls. There is no option visible anywhere under user management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked on Windows platform extensively and intimately aware of UAC - the interface I am seeing in Windows 10 Home edition is so rudimentary and frustrating</p>
<p>

<h2>            HP G60 Laptop - BSOD, Won&#39;t Start</h2>
                    My friend is having an issue with her laptop.<br />
<br />
She had a movie paused on Netflix, and was talking to someone. She was not touching her laptop at all. Suddenly, the blue screen of death popped up. She shut the device off and closed it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Upon trying to restart it, she was brought to the Windows Recovery screen, informing her that her computer failed to start. She was given two options - to start the laptop normally, or launch startup repair.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
She chose to launch the repair, which brought her to the Starting Windows screen.The computer remained on that screen for a while, before turning black and bringing her back to Windows Recovery. This happens every time she chooses to launch the repair.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There is no indication that the computer is attempting to run. No sound is coming from the laptop at all. She has tried removing the battery and leaving it unplugged for a few minutes. We are unsure of what steps to take now.<br />
<br />
Her laptop is an HP G60. She is running Windows 7.<br />
<br />
What might be happening / how can the issue be resolved? Is her computer recoverable?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you made any hardware or software changes to your computer recently?<br />
2. What is the complete error message or code when you say, "computer failed to start"?<br />
3. Does your computer still receive bluescreen error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your computer does not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned that startup repair failed, I would suggest you to use bootrec.exe tool and check the issue.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Use Bootrec.exe in the Windows RE to troubleshoot startup issues</strong><br />
