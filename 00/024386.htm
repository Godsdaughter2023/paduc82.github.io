                    <p>I have had this issue for a while now. I get to the installation and at the point of the first reboot it tries a few times then reinstalls insider preview 16199. I have tried help desk a couple times and this last time they just referred me here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            N95 crashes when reconnecting BT handsfree device</h2>
                    Hi Everyone...<br />
<br />
i've been using the N95 since early Apr and the problem starts about 1.5months ago..<br />
<br />
the phone used to hangs and restarts itself 3-4 times a day when i answer a call, but off late, it's been restarting once i re-connect my BT handsfree device to it.<br />
<br />
if i were to switch the handsfree device off completely and then re-connecting it, there will be no problem. It only happens if the connection were lost and i try to reconnect them whilst both device are turned on.<br />
<br />
fyi, i'm using the original firmware V10.0.018.<br />
<br />
anyone having similar problem?<br />
<br />
btw, i used to be able to redial my last dialed number using my BT handsfree device, but i can't do that now..strange strange strange...oh, i'm using Sony Ericsson's HBH610a.<br />
<br />

            I had exactly the same problem until i updated the firmware.<br />
<br />
Random restarts, bluetooths crashes, locking out of bluetooth devices, people were unable to hear my conversation but I could hear them fine... the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Back up your contacts and data and upgrade the firmware, it seems to be faster and I have only had a 1 restart in 3 weeks<br />
<br />
Guess that is a a measure as was getting 5-6 a week.<br />
<br />

<br />
PS also the bluetooth sw is not that well written the redial function works on some headsets only<br />

<h2>            is it legal or illegal to install Microsoft Office to thin clients or Windows Embedded OS&#40;WES 2009 or WES 7&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I have found comments on some forums that says it is illegal to install Windows Office to thin clients or Windows embedded OS. I need to verify this to avoid any violation with Microsoft. I tried searching through EULA's but i could not find any.

            I am NOT a MS lawyer, so this is just my interpetation (good grief I hate these d..m disclaimers ... )<br />
<br />
What it boils down to is that the "MSLT", the MS License Terms (formerly known as EULA) represent the terms you agree to with MS to use the application. If something is not mentioned in the MSLT you can do it.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Links to MS 2010 License Terms:<br />

<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<br />
<br />
&lt;snip from MSLT&gt;<br />
<div>3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS
<div><br />
d. Use with Virtualization Technologies. </div>
<p>Instead of using the software directly on the licensed device, you may install and use the software within only one virtual (or otherwise emulated) hardware system on the licensed device.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>e. Remote Access. </div>
<p>The single primary user of the licensed device may access and use the software installed on the licensed device remotely from any other device. You may allow others to access the software to provide you with support services. You do not need additional licenses
 for this access. No other person may use the software under the same license at the same time for any other purpose.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think the "remote access" clause clearly says that you can install Office on a Thin Client system as long as you limit use to the allowed number of users in the following MSLT section extract. In other words, running a licensed/activated installation on
 the server for use by one person at a time on a thin client connection appears to comply with the license.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&lt;snip from MSLT&gt;</p>
<div>2. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. </div>
<div>a. <span>One Copy per Device</span>. </div>
<p>You may install one copy of the software on one device. That device is the “licensed device.”</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>b. Licensed Device. </div>
<p>You may only use one copy of the software on the licensed device at a time.</p>
<div><br />
<p><span>You may install another copy of the software on a portable device for use by the single primary user of the licensed device</span>.</p>
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
I don't see any restrictions in the MSLT about OS. So I think it is reasonable to say that if you can make it run one those OS's you are free to do so as long as you stick to the other terms of the license.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I don't see mention of the embedded OS's in the system requirements:<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
</span>Windows XP (must have SP3) (32-bit), Windows 7, Windows Vista with Service Pack (SP) 1, Windows Server 2003 with SP2 and MSXML 6.0 (32-bit Office only), Windows Server 2008, or later 32- or 64-bit OS.<br />
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
So MS won't provide support to make it work there. But if you can find some way to beat Office into submission to work on them, more power to you.<br />
<br />
If you are talking about Thin clients, it seems to be safe to assume you are situation where you will be running many licenses. If you haven't already done so, look into "Volume Licenses". For installations that use 5 or more licenses you can get a better price
 on the purchase.<br />

            If you want to insert a PDF as an object, you will have to split the PDF so that each page is a separate file and then insert each page separately.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, since Word 2013 can open PDF files, you can insert the PDF as text (Insert tab | Object | Text from File).

            <p>Instead of "inserting" the PDF file into a separate Word document, use the Open dialog to open the PDF file. Word 2013 will attempt to create an editable Word file from the PDF original (which won't be changed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should work if the PDF was create from text (such as a Word or Notepad file). However, if the PDF was created by scanning paper pages, the content of the PDF will be pictures of the pages, which Word will drop into your document as pictures. To create
 editable text in that case, you'll have to use optical character recognition software to "read" the pages and output text. If you have OneNote, you can use that -- see

            To split a PDF, you will have to use third-party software. But if you insert it via the Insert File dialog box or open it (both methods will work equally well), splitting won't be required, of course.<br />
<br />
You can open the Open dialog box by clicking File tab | Open | Computer | Browse.

            In Word's Open dialog (not from Windows Explorer, which will likely open the PDF in Adobe Reader), select the PDF file and open it just as you would any Word document. Once it has been opened in Word, you can copy the portions you want and paste into your
 other document.

            This may seem like a silly thing to ask ¿but did you check if you have enough load (Filipino-English for the money on the card, other dialects' words are unknown to me)? As you're sending to a group you might go through money faster than usual. But it's
 silly to ask as it's probably the first thing you checked.

    <title>With Nuance Power PDF Advanced installed, I can no longer use the PDF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zszabo2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            With Nuance Power PDF Advanced installed, I can no longer use the PDF import feature in Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Power PDF Advanced (PPA) comes with its own PDF conversion add-on for Office and whenever I attempt to open a PDF from within Word, it automatically loads Nuance's Convert Assistant. I've personally found the importer built into Office to be more capable
 -- especially when importing documents that contain multi-column text with inline images, tables, and/or equations. I would like to go back to using the Office converter, but I also want to keep PPA for other uses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to disable the two Nuance-related add-ins ("Nuance Office Addin" and "Nuance Convert PDF Word Addin") via Options / Add-Ins / COM Add-ins in Word and they were both subsequently moved from the Active to the Inactive Application Add-ins list. However,
 this hasn't had any effect on Word's behavior, which continues to delegate opening/processing of PDF documents to Convert Assistant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get the built-in importer/converter working again?</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried re-opening Word after disabling the add-ins, which had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now, I also went ahead and completely removed all Nuance add-in references from&nbsp; Word (Options / Add-ins / COM Add-ins: I selected each entry, then clicked on Remove; I had to launch Word under the Administrator account before it allowed me to carry
 out the removal). The behavior remained unchanged after restarting Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I should ask: when attempting to open a PDF document via Word's open document dialog, what is the mechanism by which it (Word? Office? Or perhaps Windows itself?) delegates this task? For example, if I try to open a PDF, Nuance's PDF conversion tool
 is loaded, rather than e.g. the main Nuance PDF editor application itself. So I'm guessing that it is the OS itself which handles the request -- and that it picks the convert assistant executable because there is a registry entry that references the executable
 (or its corresponding GUID -- although I haven't managed to locate that) which needs to be run to service the request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to request help from Nuance -- although I suspect my chances are slim, since I don't have a service contract and since they've recently updated their software to V3 (mine is V2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your suggestions.</p>

    <title>Need to automate SQL Server login for accdb - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galla_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to automate SQL Server login for accdb</h2>
                    These accdbs have a sql server back end that resides on a server outside of the network.<br />
When an accdb front end is started and tries to access data, it displays the following error:<br />
<br />
Connection failed: <br />
SQLState: 'S1000'<br />
SQL Server Error: 0<br />
[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Cannot generate SSPI context<br />
<br />
When I click OK, I'm presented with the SQL Server Login box where "Use Trusted Connection" is checked and the login id field is prefilled with my windows id. I then have to uncheck this box and enter my sql server id and password for the front end to be able
 to access the data.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to automate this sql server login? The users find it quite cumbersome to have to go through this each time they fire up a front end. Maybe storing the user credentials in an encrypted file and the front end automatically accessing that info when
 starting up?&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

                    At this address commerce.microsoft.com, it won't let me update or change the billing info or payment option because the country is set to Philippines. I'm US American citizen and live/work in the USA. I visited the Philippines but that's about it. I'm
 not sure why the country is set to the Philippines, beautiful country, but I have not Philippine address or Philippine credit card or other payment info to offer. I chatted with MS Billing Support, who told me to call MS Billing Support, who then told me they
 can't change the country and should post the question here.

            Thank you all for the pointers. I found the solution. It's a hidden drop-down menu in the upper right corner, where one can select the country. It has a gray on gray color theme. It looks more like an info box than a field one can edit.

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I select a single word in the text by double-clicking&#63; &#40;using MS Word 2011 on a new Mac Book Pro&#41;</h2>
                    Am working with MS Word v. 14.2.4 for Mac on newly purchased Mac Book Pro running OS X 10.7.5. I've been using Word for over twenty years now, and I think I have always been able to highlight-select a single word in the text by double-clicking on it. For
 some reason, this little feature is not functional on this computer. (I am running the very same version of Word on an older iMac, with the same OS - and am able to select by double-clicking, no problem).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am able to double-click-select a single word in other applications on the Mac Book Pro - when I type a mail message, for example - so I doubt there is something I need to change in the computer's System Preferences.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been poring through preference settings for Word, and posing this question in the help menu to no avail. There is no reference to double-click-selecting anywhere in Microsoft Word info.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone out there have a solution??</div>

            Well, you're quite right that the technique <i>should</i> work :-) And there is no preference or setting to disable it.<br />
<br />
Since Office &amp; OS X are fully updated the most likely cause of nuisances like this is that the program and/or the Mac have been allowed to run constantly over an extended period of time.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you first Quit all apps, run <b>Disk Utility</b> to <i>repair disk permissions</i>, then do a power off shut down. Hopefully that will correct it, and launching apps daily (or as needed) along with at least a weekly restart of the Mac will
 help prevent similar behaviors.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists or recurs don't hesitate to reply here to pursue it further.<br />

</p><p>My browsers have been hijacked. Internet Explorer is not visible anywhere on my menus or in the control panel where programs can be uninstalled. When I search for it, options to changes certain settings come up, but not the exe file, so I can't repin to
 task bar. When I open by typing in the exe file in search and go to add ons, dollaarsaver is in the list, but it does not allow me to disable.

<p>
</p><p>There is an additional file that I clicked ok on in an effort to locate IE, which is internetexplorerdefault, which I am concerned is virus related as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been getting hits in windows defender for the last several weeks, but each time I delete one another seems to pop up. the most recent are browsermodifier:win32/diplugem and trojan dropper:win32/blakamba (the second has shown up several times over
 last month).</p>
<p>

    <title>Navigation Form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim omnicorb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Navigation Form</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, using Access 2010. My problem is teh following:</p>
<p>I have a form("Income Form") where the user can fill two fields: DateFrom and DateTo. Then there is a button on the form to display results. When a user enters data into fields and clicks button I have a clickevent that opens a Report("IncomeFromDateToDate
 Report). When that report is called the query ("IncomeFromDateToDate") on which its based on, is called. The query gets data from a Customers table and the correct result are presented in the report. So far so good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then to make things more user friendly I make a menu for my forms using the ("Create-&gt;Navigation"). One of the tabs is the "Income Form). I click on it and enter information(date from, date to) in the fields and then click the results button(which opens
 the "IncomeFromDateToDate Report"). What happens is I get a popup box saying "Enter parameter value" and underneath the name of the corresponding field on the Income form. If i enter the date again it works fine, but it should get the values from the income
 form as entered by the user.</p>
<p>So when i run th income form oniots own it works fine but when i embed it in a menu using the Navigationform i get the popups asking me to reenter the data that i already types in the fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!!</p>

<p>That message is saying that Access can not find [Forms]![MainMenu (Navigation Form)]![Income Form]![Text26]</p>
<p>Double check that all the names are typed exactly the way they are in the form.&nbsp; Of course form MainMenu (Navigation Form) must remain open until after the report is closed.</p>
<p>Note: I used [Income Form] on the assumption that the subform <em><strong>control</strong></em> that displays the Income Form object is named the same as the form object.&nbsp; The control's name )on the main form)&nbsp;can be different from the object's name so doublw
 check that too.</p>
<p>Late flash, after Jorn reminded me that you are probably using the Navigation Form (as its name implies), the subform control name is probably the default NavigationSubform.&nbsp; If you haven't figured it out already, try:<br />
Forms![MainMenu (Navigation Form)]!NavigationSubform!Text26</p>

 the only choices are .htm or .html and neither of those subdirectories have a shell or open or command file in them.</p>

<h2>            Help - How do I use a lookup formula when i have two lists that are close but not exact matches and i need to lookup information&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Help please?</p>
<p>I have 2 lists with names and account numbers, 1 list is old account numbers and names and the second is new account numbers and new names: eg</p>
<p>List 1</p>
<p>Column A&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Column B</p>
<p>Acme Inc Brisbane&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200005</p>
<p>Power Up Ltd Sydney &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200006</p>
<p>List 2</p>
<p>Coumn A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B</p>
<p>Acme Brisbane &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31062545</p>
<p>Powerup Sydney &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31062546</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been trying to use a v lookup to return the new account number to the column next to the old name, except the v lookup is not going to work as the names are not close enough and some of the variations in the names are actually in the middle of the
 name rather than on the end.I have tried using the closing argument as true and false neither of which works.&nbsp; I am guessing that i may have to nest a function in a lookup formula ( such as match or index) Can someone please give me some leads on the best
 way to acheive this.&nbsp; Thankyou</p>

    <title>Pivot Table - Exclude Values - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leahfdz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot Table - Exclude Values</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create a column that excludes values that have HOLD in column C.&nbsp;below is my pivot table:</p>
<p>I encounter the following problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Under "<strong>calculated field"</strong> the formula I am using is: =IF('Closing Date',"&lt;&gt;HOLD",'I/A/O' ). It does not work. what it does is: whenever I have&nbsp;a date in, it&nbsp;brings #VALUE! and whenever there is HOLD, it brings the actual value (which is
 the one I don't want)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) the other problem I am having is: my database has names that are equals with very few differences. how can I do to show every single item as my database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) how can I remove the (blank). I used "conditional formatting" which works but whenever I refresh or enter new data it goes back to (blank)</p>
<p>below is my Pivot table.</p>
<p>

    <title>Groove worst music app&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denisnaumov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove worst music app&#63;</h2>
                    Ok this may be a long rant from me but it has to be done because this is ridiculous. I was rooting for Windows, Windows phone and the new Windows 10 os, but Mostly for the new groove music app. Let's just start in the begining I started using zune music
 service back when the zune hd launched which was and imo still is the best standalone mp3 player to date easily beating out any other on the market to this day. I also loved the zune software which was very well organized had every option a music service could
 ask for and a bonus of ten free songs to keep every month. This approach to the music subscription was PERFECT with you being able to accumulate music for yourself if you ever quit the service and at the same time being able to listen to any song in the library
 at any moment. This was the peak of music software and service for Microsoft because with every update after this was a negative one with me hoping for better applications and every update just being a sad let down.
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp; The next update was Xbox music which still performed quite quickly on my computer and my Windows phone. I have since lost my zune hd
 and have moved to&nbsp;</span>some use on my Windows phone. Which was a great thing so I didn't have to have two devices but my&nbsp;zune was still more responsive and much better audio quality than any Windows phone or other phone I have used no matter the software.
 So this new Xbox music brought a whole new look to the app which at first I thought was great because I could now play music on any of my devices including Xbox pc Windows phone and zune were it still around but the ten free songs have been lost which was
 sad to see go but I looked at it from a business perspective and realized it was most likely costing money so shutting that down was a correct way to go even though it was sad to see. This app worked quite well even though some small bugs were always apparent
 it was overly a decent app.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp; Then a new update was added with Windows 8 which made the app lose playlists, stop seeing devices, horrible responsiveness, and even less options to play with. This made me quite frustrated with this app
 and started to think of quitting but at the time and still to this day is the only subscription service I will use cause I will never send a dime to another company that you may all know. So I would have thought that maybe Microsoft saw that this was being
 a problem and come up with some fixes and eventually some fixes with updates which fixed playlist errors and not seeing devices however the app never became any more responsive and was still annoying to use. However I stuck with it knowing nothing was better
 out there. Then Windows 8.1 came around I hoped this would finally make Xbox music what it was when it started but nothing changed other than it becoming even slower yet.</div>

<div>&nbsp; This is my device breakdown throughout all these updates</div>

<div>
<div>Zune hd: zune software</div>
<div>HTC trophy : Xbox music Windows7</div>
<div>Nokia Lumia&nbsp;822 : Xbox music with Windows 7 version, Windows 8 version and Windows 8.1 version</div>
</div>
<div>HTC one m8 Windows: Xbox music Windows 8.1 version</div>

<div>So as you can see I have had lower end phones all the way to flagship phones and the apps just got slower and riddled with more errors than should ever be ok to release an app with. I have recently broke
 my HTC one m8 and couldn't find an inexpensive replacement of same specs in the Windows phone market so I ended up buying an HTC one m8 but in android version.</div>

<div>&nbsp; So now we get to the serious problems. Windows 10 is upcoming with free upgrade and a whole new music app called groove. I updated my newly built gaming pc with Windows 10 and am mostly pleased with the
 understanding that this is freshly released and will be buggy until a large update in the future and most of the os was working just fine with little problems that I found workarounds and again was mostly pleased. However the new music app groove was a complete
 mess. First I was not able to plug in my old Windows phone and transfer the music over via usb&nbsp;it had to be done over the internet only which took over ten times as long than over usb&nbsp;not only that it wasn't able to download all the songs that I had on my
 library on my pc. So here I am using my app with very little of my album and random sign issues and random issues of music not playing and all these problems were apparent on the pc, Windows phone and my new android phone. However on the android phone my library
 is even smaller saying that due to media rights this song can not be played on this device I have tried many different ways of making this work but no luck whatsoever. So now finally update 1511 which drastically fixed the Windows 10 os and some major problems
 with groove as well. Yet no new options were added to the app and it is still a pain to use with nothing where it needs to be and Microsoft says it's to simplify it but it just makes it less useful. So the pc app at least works now without errors but on the
 phone it is still the worst music I have ever used. So in February my subscription for groove is up and I will not be renewing it uninstalling the app from my pc and will use a third party software I will go back to buying&nbsp;<span>cds</span>&nbsp;and
 ripping them taking the songs I want and adding them to my playlists though this may cost me ten times the money the headache that I will save will be worth every penny.&nbsp;</div>

<div>End rant</div>

            <p>Let me start by saying my hardware experience is very close to yours. I still have and use my Zune HD, however. Had a Trophy, still have an 822 (my tester for Win 10) and also a&nbsp;Lumia Icon. &nbsp;Second, not all the changes are because they benefit Microsoft.
 The record labels have much say in DRM and if you want your service to provide a lot of variety, you have to satisfy the labels.
</p>
<p>Starting with Xbox Music, the Microsoft music service became a subscription service and did not really include a media management component. You still had it with Zune and/or WMP11 until a few weeks ago, but now that is retired (along with the older DRM
 it used). </p>
<p>The major problem with Microsoft music, as I see it, is it continues to evolve a lot faster than its loyal users can keep up with. Combine this with the legendary (cough) Microsoft documentation and you have confusion, frustration, etc..
</p>
<p>To eliminate some pain, try to forget about a USB cable and syncing. It is only an afterthought since Windows 8 and Xbox Music (as you may know). Today, your "collection" is in the cloud and you draw from that for portable devices. Xbox Cloud Match died
 quietly, too (never really acknowledged by MS). I read it caused many sync issues and generally MS will can something that screws up that much. Your local collection has to be either manually tagged again from the catalog (add your own mp3 tracks to your "collection"
 if they are in the Groove catalog) OR now you can upload stuff to OneDrive and make your own cloud collection (I have the entire Beatles catalog there, for one, as everyone knows there is zero Beatles stuff online except for iTunes).
</p>
<p>Modern (Groove, Spotify, Apple Music) music services work mostly the same way---they need your device to acquire DRM after downloading from them, at least initially and then periodically to maintain it and make sure you're still paying. No more plug in,
 sync and go. Only Rhapsody still has this and those days are probably numbered. </p>
<p>Zune software features have been largely re-created in a different form in Groove. Smart DJ is now "Radio", but "Radio" is only catalog content (not the mix of catalog and "owned" like Smart DJ could do). You can fix this, though. Create a "radio" station.
 Save as a playlist. Sprinkle in some of your own stuff. Pretty similar function, but a different way to accomplish. The CD burning, tagging, etc. functions are not in Groove. Since Groove is the front-end of a music subscription service, it is irrelevant for
 burning or tagging---since you can't do either one with subscription tracks anyway. If you want to burn, tag, do advanced auto playlists, etc., you are going to use your own music and Windows Media Play, MediaMonkey or any number of other programs that still
 function well in Windows 10. Groove is a player---period. If you have tons of music not in the Groove catalog, upload it to OneDrive. Groove plays it fine, just like stuff in the subscription catalog.
</p>
<p>Not to nit-pick, but that latest Groove update did add many features. Re-organizing playlists is a big one. Several other things.
</p>
<p>This is the new Microsoft system, apparently. They release something that is at least basically functional, then constantly release improvements. Is this better than waiting for one huge update every year? In my opinion, it is FAR better this way.
</p>
<p>I can't comment on how Groove works with an Android phone, since I only use Lumias. It's basically fine with Lumias. Offline music works well, downloads are fairly fast, I rarely have a problem I can attribute to Groove (I am running pre-release Windows
 Phone 10, and updates to that have screwed things up now and then which is not the fault of Groove).
</p>
<p>I have also though Groove works much better on my Xbox 360 than Xbox Music did. Playlists sync and play faster, for example.
</p>
<p>This is really just different than the old way of doing things. You can still get it all done, but it happens in a different way now.
</p>
<p>It can probably never be truly simple to sync music anymore, because it would then be a lot easier to steal music and the labels are not going to allow this.
</p>
<p>Ask on this forum---there are enough of us now who can probably address specific issues.
</p>

<p>I am with you. I went through all the same thing. Zune which I loved and Win phones. I mostly skipped Win8 because I work on computers all day and know how poorly it was designed. I went from Win7 to Win10. I have a very good desktop that I built myself
 and love the Xbox. Now comes the rub. I have 39Gig of music and it is almost impossible to get it to work on my stuff. I have to survive by using one drive and paying the $2/mo to get enough space but when it comes to playing Groove REALLY BITES. All MS tries
 to do is get me to reactivate my music pass. This feature works great but I do not need to spend $10/mo when I have tons of music already. Now I cannot buy even one single song from my computer. I cannot get Groove to work very well on the Xbox either. I am
 sick of spending hours trying to get one single thing done with my music. I spend so much time trying to figure out what to do that by the time I do I do not have time when I am done to listen to the music. My son has moved to Apple and I have split out an
 old WinXP computer and put ITunes on it. Guess what? It works. Takes me less than 5 min and I am off and running. I am super tempted to switch (and I HATE Apple). MS - get your act together. Quit changing things around. You have some amazing software (Zune)
 and then you go an hose it up and make everything extremely difficult to use that everybody jumps ship. Work with what works and what people like and quit shoving new, broken apps down peoples throat and quit trying to force everybody into monthly subscriptions
 by making it so that its the only way people can get your software to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zune was as he said, the best music devices and software i have ever encountered. I hàve been using Microsoft products faithfully since zunes came out. (Even though they massively downgraded thier products by trying to mimick the low quality, overpriced,
 low storage apple ipods) i was very sad/angry when these were discontinued and the software became relatively useless. I had many seriously frustrating problems with xbox music which caused me to stop using it despite the fact it did has some very good qualities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which bring us to today, now. Microsoft groove seemed promising. Though I cannot add many songs because they do not have rights to them. Not only could i not subscribe for several months because Microsoft could not get themselves together, i do finally subscribe
 and the mobile app wont even play unless the phone is open,unlocked and even then it doesn't work very consistently. I am about to quit also and i been faithful to Microsoft only products for more than 10 years</p>

<h2>            Live versus Built In themes</h2>
                    When choosing a theme from the theme gallery that is not one of the fist nine (apparently they are the only "built-in" themes) it resaves the theme in a live content folder,&nbsp;and you can never access the original live theme again.&nbsp; E.g. I chose the 'Basis'
 theme and did some customization to it.&nbsp; I started a new presentation and wanted to start over with the Basis theme, but it was no longer in my theme gallery and I could not find it in an online search.&nbsp; How to I access live themes more than once?

<p>I can save the customized theme with no problem.&nbsp; The problem is that I cannot access or find the "original" themes (other than the built-in themes) after I customize them.&nbsp; For example, Basis, Wood-Type, etc.&nbsp; These themes were available in my gallery,
 presumably from Office online theme, but once I use/customize them&nbsp;I cannot get the originals back in&nbsp;the gallery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Janine&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<p><br />
After customizing the theme, how are you saving the theme?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>To save a customized theme, click on <b>Design</b> tab &gt; click on <b>
More</b>(v) dialog box option beside <b>Effects</b> and the click on <b>
Save Current Theme</b> and select <b>Desktop &gt;</b> click on <b>
Save </b>and verify if you’re able to access the save customized theme<br />
Note: The revised theme is saved as a .thmx file in the Document Themes folder on your local drive and it is automatically added to the list of custom themes on the
<b>Design</b> tab in the <b>Themes </b>group.</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued efforts.&nbsp; As mentioned, it is not the revised, customized .thmx file that I am having trouble finding; it is the original live content .thmx file that is the problem.&nbsp; The live content themes are originally stored in the ...\live
 content\managed... folder.&nbsp; Once you select one of those themes, whether or not you choose to save it, it is automatically moved from the ...managed... folder to a ...\live content\user... folder or in some cases, a ...\customized themes\ folder depending
 on what you do with it.&nbsp; In most cases the original theme still appears in the themes gallery, but instead of the tip displaying the name of the theme, it displays the path to the customized theme.&nbsp; Thus, if you want to start a new presentation with the
<strong><u>original</u></strong> theme (not the customized theme) you cannot see the theme name and in some cases it may not even appear in the themes gallery.&nbsp; I have been working with Microsoft support to resolve the issue and the developers now have enough
 information to fix this issue.&nbsp; We are expecting an update in the next 2-3 weeks to&nbsp;resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Janine&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Janine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you ever resolved this issue. I am having a similar problem with 2013 where all I see are the "built-in" themes not the other live content themes. I can't seem to get them back.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I know Microsoft escalated the problem to Tier 3 support.&nbsp; I was not notified when it was fixed, but after testing it today, my problem has been fixed.</p>
<p>

<h2>            after installing Outlook, important E-mail sent never arrived.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>last week I installed outllok on my computer.</p>
<p>After installation, I sent a very important mail (100% sure that I sent it, since I checked in sent items whether the attachment was included). After the deadline passed I found out that the e-mail never arrived.</p>
<p>No I read that sometimes e-mails tend to either float for some days or that they never arrive.</p>
<p>Is there a way to retrospectively solve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>
