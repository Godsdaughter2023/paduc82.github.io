    <title>Windows 10 Backup&#47;System Image creation and Errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danehidden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Backup&#47;System Image creation and Errors</h2>
                    <p>Howdy All,</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 Pro with the latest (April 2018) update</p>
<p>Apparently for some reason at some time a user account named "RDV Graphic Service" was created.</p>
<p>When this account was created "Automatically" by windows two directories were left out in the user&nbsp;</p>
<p>sub-folder, Contacts and Searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across this when trying to make a system image, The process failed citing the following.</p>
<p><strong>Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C:\Users\RDV GRAPHICS SERVICE\Contacts. Error:(STATUS_WAIT_2 (0x80070002))</strong><br />
<strong>Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C:\Users\RDV GRAPHICS SERVICE\Searches. Error:(STATUS_WAIT_2 (0x80070002))</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the first thing I could think of, Google "RDV GRAPHICS SERVICE". There was a bunch of stuff about how it's used for Hyper-V and remote apps, or some such thing, on windows server. Ok so it's probably not some malicious account. Puzzling that a Windows
 10 install has this as I have a pretty fresh install and have yet to enable Hyper-V services, But, Whatever, maybe windows enabled that user in the expectations that I would enable those services since they are on in bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I did the next logical thing, navigate to <span><strong>C:\Users\RDV GRAPHICS SERVICE\ .</strong> So those directories (Contacts, Searches) were indeed missing from this automatically created user account, I added them and tried to make a restore image
 again, Success.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then started a chat up with Microsoft Tech support and explained it all to them. But I deleted those directories to illustrate and recreate the problem. I was bumped to tier2 support, Tier1 Support just didn't understand what was happening. I re-created
 the failure for tech support so they could see what was wrong and how I fixed it. They were apologetic and appreciative of my efforts and ensured that they would pass it on to the developers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Synopsis( I know put this at the beginning :p </span><span>)</span></p>
<p><span>1. RDV GRAPHICS SERVICE user account is created by windows for some reason or another.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In creating that account Windows fails to create directories that the windows backup application relies on</span></p>
<p><span>3. backup "fails" (not really a total failure but enough that most non-computer-literates would be lost)</span></p>
<p>4. I recommended to tech support that a hotfix be rolled out that either ignore that account on backups</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; or add those directories to the user accounts subfolder.</span></p>
<p><span>Why did I go though all of this? I'm migrating my fakeraid 10 HDD to a realraid 10 HDD on an LSI HBA.</span></p>
<p><span>I followed this article&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869</a><span style="color: rgba(176, 0, 0, 1)">
 .&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It's a good article. One point of curiosity though, Why Win7 backup and restore in windows 10?&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways I had the Error with the missing files from an account that windows created and realized what a trap it would be for someone like my Mother,</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(176, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Brother, Father, Sister, Etc... They would either fall victim to some kind of crap/malware or an unscrupulous/(god forbid unskilled) tech shop.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(176, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this helps anyone with the problem I faced, AND I hope Microsoft rolls out a fix for this Quickly.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t remove windows.old because of point64.sys</h2>
                    In Windows 10, I've run Disk Cleanup as Admin and told it to remove previous Windows installations. &nbsp;However, there is still one file left named point64.sys that I cannot remove. &nbsp;Even if I take ownership and give myself personal Full Control permission,
 I can't remove it. &nbsp;I've also tried using Safe Mode and the cmd prompt. &nbsp;The file is&nbsp;C:\Windows.old\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\point64.inf_amd64_neutral_b9b5a5957793dde6/point64.sys.

    <title>Stop forcing updates that won&#39;t install correctly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stop forcing updates that won&#39;t install correctly</h2>
                    <p>I am on a Acer Predator G3610 with windows 10 installed running version 1707.</p>
<p>Acer states that the Fall Creators Update (1709) is not supported on my computer, yet this update is being forced on my system.</p>
<p>What happens is, it starts the download and proceeds with the install which eventually freezes.</p>
<p>This leaves me with having to manually shut down my computer and wait for it to restore to the previous build (1707).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;have blocked windows updates in a crude way for the time being, but this shouldn't have to be necessary.</p>
<p>I am not looking for a fix or workaround for this since the update is not supported on my computer and will likely lead to other problems.<br />
What you need to do on your end is stop forcing updates that won't install correctly on certain systems.<br />
</p>
<p>By the way I have not "fixed" this by blocking updates - Windows Upgrade Assistant is still interrupting me every so often so no this thread can never be marked as solved as long as you are forcing this update on my system.<br />

            There's no such thing as Windows 10 version 1707. What version is the device actually on, version 1507, 1607 (or maybe 1703)?

<p>Version 1607</p>
<p>Well I'm on Anniversary Update and am unable to install updates past this point.</p>
<p>To be clear I don't wish to do so. I have used the 'Show or hide updates' tool to hide:</p>
<p>- Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709</p>
<p>- 2018-02 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4077525)</p>

<p>In this case, let's try to check if there are any pending updates that needs to be installed. To do this, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Check for updates</strong>. If it says no updates are available, we suggest that you perform the steps below to reset the Windows Store cache:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press<strong> Windows + R</strong> keys to open the run command box. </li><li>Type <strong>WSReset,</strong> then try launching Store.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Store will open and you’ll get a confirmation message saying "<strong>The cache for the&nbsp;Store&nbsp;was&nbsp;cleared. You can now browse the Store for apps."
</strong>Try signing back in after receiving the message and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update this thread with the result.</p>

<div>Got <span>fable</span> 2 free, year or so back. But you had to buy&nbsp;episodes to unlock achievements ,and to progress to other areas. I got all&nbsp;episodes 2-5&nbsp;and See the Future (Premium) . Now its been replaced
 with the full game and no episodes. I went on my download history and redownloaded the free game (1.7 GB in size) that works .But it comes up with a error (cant download) &nbsp;when i try and get my&nbsp;episodes back. So now i have a small area (demo) of the game and
 i cant get achievements from. What i lost:</div>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
For some reason it seems the Fable II episodes were pulled and replaced with 2 (Premium) packs. In this sort of situation, I would contact XBOX Support for the UK and speak with them about any possible way to get these downloads back or maybe alert them that
 they are gone. If they can't bring them back they may try and give you some sort of compensation but I can't guarantee anything.<br />

<h2>            Congratulations to the vociferous &#40;and some hat-eating&#41;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Over the past many days, I have participated in several threads where the general (and highly sanitized) message was, "we don't like it." As one of the apparent minority who saw the promise of an all-online software delivery and licensing mechanism, I most
 often argued points in favor of the new architecture of the Xbox One, or at least tried to illuminate a different side of features that were mostly seen as Bad Things by others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to offer a sincere congratulations to the posters here (and around the world) who reasonably and politely expressed their concerns and their views on how Microsoft could improve its offering. I'd only ask that you give Microsoft its due - many if
 not most people thought that Microsoft "didn't care about gamers" or somesuch. It seems maybe they listen, and care, more than some thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd also like to eat part of my hat, because in more than one thread I expressed my opinion that it was probably too late for Microsoft to change the architecture. Obviously I was wrong wrong wrong on that point. So, nomnomnom who doesn't like a nice sweaty
 ballcap?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, to the people who were disingenuous and insincere in their arguments against the 24-hour check-in and limits on disc-trading/selling (these are clearly visible in the "NOT GOOD ENOUGH!" and "DON'T BELIEVE IT!" threads that are now popping up) -
 please feel free to find another forum to re-plant your goalposts. The honest critics of the Xbox One have earned a victory for themselves today; let them enjoy it in peace.</p>

            <p>I'm back on board and happy to be so. I'm still not happy about the always on Kinect stuff but I'm willing to deal with that for two reasons...</p>
<p>1: I'm optimistic that MS will do things to ease my concerns in that area.</p>
<p>2: If I'm that concerned with it I can workaround it (cutting power and/or Internet when not in use).</p>
<p>I applaud MS for listening (even though it's in their best interest IMO) and I'm glad I didn't pull the trigger on that PS4 pre order yet.</p>

            <p>Well, I wouldnt be so quick to say they changed "because they care about gamers" just yet. Im sure they lost tons of money in potential preorders and other things unseen to the layman. So I think its more "because they didnt want to get sunk" than their care for us. But Im glad they did change, but really...did they have a choice?</p>

    <title>Show Desktop button size same as windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickz101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Show Desktop button size same as windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Why did the 'show desktop' button get shrunk&nbsp;in&nbsp;Windows 8.1 and then&nbsp;carried over to Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The size of this button is the size of the space between the main taskbar buttons.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Human-Computer Interaction design,&nbsp;it lacks the&nbsp;efficiency and utility as&nbsp;it is badly implement, it is&nbsp;painfully hard to get the mouse onto it without overshooting onto the secondary menu button on the secondary&nbsp;monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does&nbsp;Microsoft have Interaction Design experts to deal with these types&nbsp;of issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a registry hack to make it wider?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>I did some digging into the settings and it looks like you can shut of the syncing of e-mail, people and calendar. I think this is the best choice for customers as it is a waste of bandwidth to be downloading e-mails in an app you don't want to use. Thank
 you for creating this option development team.</p>

<h2>            Restoring Lost &#34;Set Aside&#34; Tabs and History on Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>So long story short, is it possible to restore lost (not closed, lost) "Set Aside" tabs? If so, where do I go to do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little while ago there was a 2018-04 Cumulative Update, specifically April 10th, 2018 (KB4093112). I installed this update on my main desktop and it caused abnormally high disk usage which made my computer barely usable (it prevented me from doing anything
 due to how long things would start up and not respond etc.), it was at the point where if I restarted the computer, it would fail to start up and it would take me to the advanced started up options where it asked if I wanted to do the usual stuff like repair
 disk, factory reset, refresh, (I saw that option once and used it which fixed it until I restarted the computer to see if the issue would arise again, it never showed up again when this issue happened) etc. I've used the repair option and it didn't find anything
 to fix. So after eventually getting through all the shenanigans of logging in (this simple task of logging in and waiting for my desktop to load up was painfully slow as I watched the disk usage light and noted how it wasn't a flashing light, but a flat light),
 I thought I'd head to google to see why I have such high disk usage. Well UNFORTUNATELY every time I clicked on the Microsoft Edge icon, it wouldn't open up at all. Great. I tried every other browser I had (Firefox and Chrome), they opened up fine (except
 they have a lot of tabs so I'd rather no use those browsers for fear of more stress and potential loss of data in a potential failure). So my main computer is basically rendered useless due to 100% disk usage at all times for no apparent reason causing everything
 to be incredibly slow or not work at all, I shut it down (properly and not just holding down the power button or worse, pulling the power) resort to a backup device to continue on with life. Maybe a week or two later I decided to get back on, see if it works,
 no difference, went back to other device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward to April 26th, an update comes out, I got back on the computer to my surprise it actually started up at a decent pace, everything responded just enough to get the updates to which I did, everything appeared to be fixed. I reinstalled a program
 that I had originally uninstalled a week or two prior to the April 10th update, I know some programs when you finish installation, it tends to open a page thanking you or something, it opens up in Microsoft Edge, and I noticed that Edge seemed quite different,
 in a bad way. Normally I have Dark Theme on, home button enabled, and a translator extension, I looked slightly further and noticed my settings had all been reset which is worrisome. I click on the button that shows all set aside tabs, NOTHING. I remember
 prior to the April 10th update, my browser was working just fine, I had a lot of tabs set to the side. Everything was gone as if I had just bought the computer and installed Microsoft Edge, the only things left were my favourites/bookmarks which are synced
 across all devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I want to add that, during the time between April 10th to April 26th, when I was trying to get the computer to work, there were some programs (namely Steam) that opened links in browsers (pressing "Read More" in the news section of a game now opens
 up in a browser instead of in Steam), you could see the Edge icon open, but the page doesn't show up and after a few minutes of what I assume is Edge trying very hard to open up, it eventually just gives up and closes. I'm not really too sure if this was the
 cause of all my set aside tabs being lost or my browser being reset to factory settings in general so I'd thought I should mention this just in case the attempted opening and closing of Edge was what caused it (similar to how if you restore tabs on Chrome
 and it crashes during restoration, it'll ask to restore tabs but it'll restore nothing because the stuff you tried to restore was lost during the crash in the restoration process).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been a victim of losing tabs across many devices due to all sorts of reasons, losing at this point thousands upon thousands of tabs because I clearly have a bad habit of not bookmarking often enough or sorting through and organizing the literal tens
 of thousands of bookmarks across various browsers (namely Chrome) s,o this isn't the biggest of losses because its not like it was anything important, but obviously like anyone who loses lots of tabs (or loses anything in general), I'm not very happy about
 it and would love it if I could somehow restore the set aside tabs ESPECIALLY since the history was cleared out and the browser was back to its factory state. I've opened the browser a few times after trying some things so I'm not sure but I feel like that
 may have ruined all chances of recovery if it was even possible in the first place.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Project153</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, have you checked if System Restore is enabled on your PC? If it has been enabled before the disappearance of your Set Aside tabs, then we can restore it by extracting these data from the restore point. You can refer to
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/i-lost-all-of-my-favorites-in-edge-after-an/7878ac58-bab8-460a-94cd-fa3100a5ccad">this thread</a></strong> and look for
<strong>graye</strong>'s answer for more information and steps.</p>

<p>I've tried that method a few times, I keep getting the same Error that says "System Restore failed while mounting the registry from restore point. An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x8007031f1)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's currently the oldest restore point I have (4/26/2018) which might not even be far back enough because as I've said, during the period of 4/10/2018 to 4/26/2018 (according to the update logs at least) was when I couldn't really access Edge to see if
 things were working properly. I've also tried the method with selective restoring and it didn't seem to work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to think its not recoverable at this point.</p>

<p>Thanks for following up and apologies for the delayed response. If the restore point fails, then unfortunately there's no other way to retrieve Set Aside pages. In the event that you need to work on websites and save them accordingly, it is best to use the
 Bookmark option instead, so you can sync your Edge settings and Bookmarks to your Microsoft account.</p>

</p><p>There may be something wrong with your System Restore but depending on your Windows version it seems the System Restore technique is no longer valid when user data is involved, so it would not have helped with your quest anyway.</p>

            just got off the phone with lenovo technical support. very interesting conversation. when i mentioned this error, i was oddly asked, "do you like your machine?"
<div><br />
<div>then i was told i have two options: 1) return my machine for something else or 2) wait a day or two for an update. i then asked about the "day or two" reference--does it mean lenovo is aware of this issue and is actively working to fix it? the response
 i got was "yes and an update should be coming very soon".</div>

            Hi PA Bear,
<div><br />
<div>I think this pertains to Windows Update functionality in that a Windows update is needed to correct the issue. This issue is somewhat distinct from the sticky discussion you referred to (as well as a bit unrelated to "Security" in Windows 8). Regardless,
 my recent response was to inform others who had originally responded on this thread (and/or those that may be experiencing the same&nbsp;0xd0000225 error) that my recent tech support call to Lenovo has led me to believe Lenovo/Microsoft may have have patch coming
 in the near future that will resolve the issue.&nbsp;</div>

            <blockquote>I think this pertains to Windows Update functionality in that a Windows update is needed to correct the issue...</blockquote>
<p>With all due respect...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, this is not the venue to request such an update or to tell MS that you need one.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If update's released, it should be installed via Automatic Updates (assuming Microsoft will offer any "updates" for only Lenovo computers) - otherwise, the fix will come from Lenovo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming KB2727528, KB2761226, KB2729462, KB2737084 and possibly KB2756872 are all listed in
<strong>Installed Updates</strong>, your computer is fully-patched as far as security-related updates are concerned (at least until tomorrow). If you suspect that one or more of those updates has caused your problem, no-charge support is available. Ditto if
 one or more of those updates has <em>not </em>been installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, I've seen quite a few threads about totally-horked, brand-new Lenovo (Win8) computers in the past few weeks. Many of those similarly-frustrated users availed themselves of Lenovo's Option 1 (i.e., "return [your]&nbsp;machine for something else")
 and ended up very happy with their new Lenovo Win7 computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: If it involves a Microsoft account and/or a local account, it <em>is </em>
a Security-related issue.</p>

            Same problem here.
<div>I purchased a new Lenovo Laptop N580. I setup my Admin account at first run.
<div>I can Add local user, and can logon using it.</div>
<div>But when &nbsp;I try to switch this local user to MS account it gives me error 0xd0000225 after I enter msn email address.</div>
<div>So, it does not allow me to go to MS Store.&nbsp;</div>
<div>From one hand, I am happy - it save me money, but from another hand I feel sorry for MS, Lenovo, their products, their tech support staff, their policies, their customers who paid money to get headaches.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, Google helped me to find a solution: Ubuntu ! &nbsp;</div>
<div>It is Free of charge, Free of headaches, runs Fast, and has many Flavors.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go Ubuntu!</div>

<p>If you installed a later version it is quite possible that the later install removed the earlier version for you automatically as part of the setup.</p>

To check the JRE version that is running, use the `java -version` command in a Command Prompt.</p>

<p>And do you mean an app that was created using Java or do you simply mean Java(TM) from Oracle? If the latter the update from Oracle automatically uninstalls the earlier version prior to installing the latest version, which is Java (TM)7 Update 5, and JavaFX2.1.1</p>

            Hi JT.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try from Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  If you then the problem is probably with the age of this app.  What you can try is reinstalling it for the purpose of getting it to uninstall.  If you need the download it is here:  <a href="http://www.oldversion.com/windows/macromedia-dreamweaver-4-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oldversion.com/windows/macromedia-dr...</a>.
<br />
<br />You may need to install in Compatibility Mode now if it's survived through repeat Version Upgrades:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work then you can force install the program via it's c:\Program File - check both folders, right click the app folder to Delete,  If necessary kill the app's processes still running in Task manager reached by right clicking Start button, then Show More details, then Details tab, scroll down to find any processes.  
<br />
<br />If that isn't enough then Take Ownership of the folder first using this handy shortcut:
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />And if that doesn't work you can delete any file from boot mode when WIndows has not say over it.  Use this same method from the Command Prompt at boot as for rescuiing files when Windows won't start, except delete it.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
