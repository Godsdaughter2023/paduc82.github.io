<p>2. unchecked the download shared folders from advanced tab under more settings under account settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. outlook /resetnavpane</p>

<p>Thanks Iry but there's no impact with this too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even i have removed office 2016 renamed all outlook folders from appdata user folder and have configured the profile for the user again but the folders for the attached mailbox are still coming in alphabetical order where it should give inbox sent draft
 and deleted at top which is needed by the user.</p>

<p>Hi Rohit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know if it just happened all folders in shared mailbox? And did you mean that the folders are sorted by alphabetical rather than the messages in folders are sorted by alphabetical?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, please click the shared mailbox and check if you choose the option as below capture:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/695899a2-31fb-486e-b419-61829fe99f2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/695899a2-31fb-486e-b419-61829fe99f2d" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, may I know your version of outlook? For your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Rohit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try to update the version of your office to the latest. For your reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If the issue is just happened to a shared mailbox, please try to disable the auto-mapping of the shared mailbox, please run commands as below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell</a></li><li><em>Remove-MailboxPermission -Identity &lt;Mailbox ID1&gt; -User &lt;Mailbox ID2&gt; -AccessRights</em> FullAccess &nbsp;(Mailbox ID1 is your shared mailbox email address, Mailbox ID2 is your email address)</li><li><em>Add-MailboxPermission -Identity &lt;Mailbox ID1&gt; -User &lt;Mailbox ID2&gt;-AccessRights FullAccess -AutoMapping:$false</em></li></ol>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>After run above commands, exit the outlook client, and then re-open it. When you cannot see the shared mailbox, it means the auto-mapping has been disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then please try to add your shared mailbox from the account settings in outlook:</p>

<p>Hi GeorgesGames!</p>
<p>Thanks for posting here. We're working to fix this! There's a multitude of ways contacts could have gotten into your contact list and many of those ways do not involve you manually adding them. For example, if you have an outlook.com account tied to your
 Skype account, your Outlook contacts might be shown in your contact list. Or if you synced your address book in the past and contacts got imported that way - the contact might have changed their display name to something unrecognizable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand our users often don't like seeing these contacts in their contact list and want control over who shows up, so we're making sure some of these contacts aren't added automatically moving forward. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2>            Outlook slowness - asking for best troubleshooting steps.</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are all in O365 Exchange Online. From always we were facing issues with Outlook freezing / hunging etc. We were also facing issues with calendar sync - between asistants and managers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just recently I've done change and unchecked - "download shared folders" for few assitants - and now the sync seems to work for them, when putting change on behalf of one guy - whan hacing other atendeed caledar opened - meeting appears in all calendars
 - so it is good! However the freezing and hunging of Outook is now even more often and often it is unable to do you duties because of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is my question - am I really stuck between these two possibilities?:</p>
<p>1. Outlook hungs and freezes all the time on shared mailboxes and calendars, but calendar sync works</p>
<p>2. Outlook works not so bad - still freezes but not so much, but sync is not working and many times events that asistants create in people calendars, in their view does not appear and that creates HUGE chaos on the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone that supports assistants/people who work on shared maiboxes/calendars in the company and has experience in this stuff? I am wondering about two things</p>
<p>
</p><p>One: Whether there is at least one person with well wokring Outlook :D </p>
<p>Two: What are the best troubleshooting steps to find reason of such behaviour - either sync issues or hunging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've heard that I am not able to analyze Outlook logs as MS has their internal tool called "Timber", which is not accessible outside of MS. I've been once watching them with snooper - Lync log analyzer tool, there was something but as I could have as well
 read a newspaper in mandarinian - have not undestood a single thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>J</p>

<p>Hello Pawel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. I understand that you added some shared mailboxes and the and Outlook sometimes freezes all the time when working on the shared mailboxes and the shared calendars.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to narrow down the issue, it is suggested to try the following suggestions:
</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Open Outlook in safe mode</a> to exclude if the issue is caused by the add-ins. </p>
<p>2. Double check if all the users have the same issue. If yes, remove one user from all the shared mailboxes. Then check if he work without the shared mailboxes, the issue will persist. If no, the issue is caused by one of the shared mailboxes.
</p>
<p>3. You can also download <a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365</a> to see if it helps.
</p>
<p>4. Make sure that the Outlook client updated to the latest version. The latest version in Monthly Channel now is Version 1807 Build 10325.20118.

                    <span>
                    <span>
<div>MY PRIMARY CONCERN AFTER I UPDATED XP COMPUTER TO OUTLOOK IS THAT&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A. &nbsp;IF AN EMAIL I RECEIVE IS MORE THAN 1 PAGE,&nbsp;<u><b>ONLY 1 PAGE WILL PRINT OUT</b></u>..(THIS NEVER OCCURED BEFORE WHEN I USED MSN.COM) &nbsp;..IS THIS NORMAL AND DOES THIS REPRESENT THE NEW OUTLOOK.COM? &nbsp;IF NOT WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET MORE THEN 1 PAGE
 OF AN EMAIL OR ATTACHMENT TO PRINT.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>B. &nbsp;EVEN THOUGH I HIGHLIGHT EVERYTHING FROM THE EMAIL OR THE ATTACHMENT OR &nbsp;CUT AND PASTE.IT. &nbsp; WHEN&nbsp; DOING 'CONTROL P' OR CLICKING 'PRINT ALL' IT WILL STILL ONLY WILL PRINT THE FIRST PAGE PLUS IT ALSO WILL PRINT THE WHOLE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES OF THE OUTLOOK
 SCREEN WHICH I DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>C. &nbsp;IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I CAN VIEW AND PRINT EVERY ASPECT OF AN EMAIL THAT I RECEIVE ON MY OUTLOOK.COM OR IN THIS CASE MSN.COM EMAIL OF MINE. OTHERWISE THIS PROGRAM IS USELESS TO ME!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP.</div>

<h2>            MS Office Outlook 2007&#58;  Unknown Error 0x80040201</h2>
                    <p>Recently, MS Office Outlook 2007 (running on Windows 7 Home Premium), when doing an automated send/receive, generates an error called:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 'my email address - Sending' reported error (0x80040201): 'Unknown Error 0x80040201'</li></ul>
<p>Never happened until the last day or 2.&nbsp; Ran the scanpst.exe on all my PST files (I use PC at home, no Exchange Server), and while there were some errors that were corrected, they did not resolve this issue.&nbsp; Created a new profile, same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is my only solution to uninstall MS Office 2007 and reinstall it again (and then do all the MS Updates required to get it current)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other possible solutions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything else on the PC runs flawlessly.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note: </font></span>There is space between Outlook and /</p>

Your recommendation is incomplete. You say how to get to a particular profile key location, but you don't say what to do once I get there. What am I supposed to do once I get to this profile key location?</p>

            I encountered this same problem. I created a new profile and used the same .pst from the original profile and got the same error. It turned out the e-mail was trying to be sent to a contact that didn't have a valid e-mail address associated with it. Once
 I corrected this it worked fine. Hope this helps!

            <p>I have tried all of this with my customer.&nbsp; I deleted his company email profile and recreated it, but he has several GMail accounts also.&nbsp; He is still getting the same sending error 0x80040201.&nbsp; Do I need to remove ALL email accounts and re-create every
 one??&nbsp; Also when recreating the account the test message sent without errors and he did receive it in his Inbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the two emails were in the Outbox were from yesterday and day before, I created a NEW message and copied the details from each email into a new message.&nbsp; One sent successfully,&nbsp;but one did not; but he is sending this from a different account.&nbsp; I'm
 going to recreate that account and see what happens. </p>

            <p>Here is what happened to me.&nbsp; Back in June 2014, I transferred my contacts from a work PC to a home PC.&nbsp; The work PC e-mail was part of an exchange.&nbsp; My home PC was a POP3 acct.&nbsp; I am just now discovering that the e-mail addresses of my work associates do
 not work on my home PC.&nbsp; The home PC uses outlook 2013 on win 7.&nbsp; When I sent an e-mail to a work contact I would get the error message described above.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, (here's the real problem in this whole story)&nbsp;the e-mail would not be sent.&nbsp; It remained in my outbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not get any other error messages (something telling me the message was NOT sent).&nbsp; Only the&nbsp;very cryptic "0x0 unknown error" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A month or so later,&nbsp;I tried to send a message to about 10 people.&nbsp; One of those folks was an old work contact.&nbsp; The result was that the e-mail was not sent to anybody.&nbsp; I only had the annoying 0x0 error message that came up when I acknowledged the "send/receive
 error" notice in the bottom bar of outlook 2013.&nbsp; Again, very cryptic and not representative of the&nbsp;severity of the malfunction.&nbsp; To get the message to go out, I had to interrogate each person's address in the to: field.&nbsp; I didn't&nbsp;see any dissimilarities in
 the properties screens.&nbsp; Either in "contacts" or from the To: window of the message.&nbsp; The only thing I found that was different was when I right clicked the addresses in the To: window I got a dialogue box of choices.&nbsp; The addressee that was the offender had
 an extra choice in the box.&nbsp; the 9th choice said "open outlook properties".&nbsp; Now I had narrowed the list of suspects to one.&nbsp; I deleted that contact's information in the contacts folder.&nbsp; I then re-enterer the information as a new contact.&nbsp; From the To: field,
 I selected the contact.&nbsp; I resent the e-mail and it&nbsp;went thru to everyone.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have absolutely no explanation as to what happened or why.&nbsp; An explanation from a professional would be extremely helpful (I think) to all on this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Nick</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on last reply I Just removed the ' characterers that remain from your old contact list on the name of each contact and resend. I think Outlook 2013 does not follow the field name structure from previous versions of outlook contact database. Hope it
 helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a general solution and will require you to erase the ' marks at the begibbining and end of each name, but is quick andhelp when pushing an urgent e-mail. If you save the new name then you will fix this over time.</p>

    <title>Outlook.com account temporarily suspended - likely mistaken identity, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chengjohnliu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com account temporarily suspended - likely mistaken identity, but no resolution in sight</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read all similarly titled threads in the first three pages of results that come up for "account temporarily suspended", so I am aware of all the solutions suggested and have, in fact, tried them all prior to posting to this forum. Here is a summary
 of my journey thus far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A week ago I suddenly found my account had been suspended, without any warning. Believing this to be a mistake, I hastily found some online support forms and submitted unblocking requests; I did not provide any detailed information at that time (simply "unblock
 me please" or similar), since I assumed this was an error on Microsoft's part and it would be easy for them to realise this and unblock the account. However, after a couple of days of not hearing back from anyone, I submitted additional forms with more detailed
 descriptions of how the problem came about, and even attempted to recover the account with the online tool (https://account.live.com/acsr).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I received a reply from one of my earliest support tickets (one where I did not provide much incident detail). In it were the following two paragraphs (bolding is mine):</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)"><em>Thank you for contacting Microsoft support regarding your account.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft disabled your access to your account due to a violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Serious violations of the Microsoft Services Agreement, such as using your account for illegal activity; to spread malware or to view/distribute child pornography result in your account being permanently closed. We do this to protect Microsoft customers and
 the integrity of our services.&nbsp;</em></span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<em><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">We have evaluated your appeal and have verified that a serious violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement occurred on your account. To read the Microsoft Services Agreement, please visit:</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/microsoft-services-agreement?woldogcb=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/microsoft-services-agreement?woldogcb=0</a></em><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)"><em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Due to the nature of this violation, and pursuant to the terms of the Microsoft Services Agreement, Microsoft can neither grant you access to the contents of your account, including access to your files, nor return any data to you that was associated
 with the account.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; For any subscriptions associated with this account, Microsoft will immediately cease charging the credit card on file for recurring charges.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was left absolutely speechless and terrified by this reply. I can categorically deny that I have knowingly done anything illegal on my account, and the only explanation I have is someone else had obtained my account details somehow and committed the offenses,
 or there had been a fault in the Microsoft fraud detection algorithm. To give more perspective about my account:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I have had this account for years (not sure exactly how long, probably four or five years); before this account, I had other Microsoft accounts for more than a decade.</li><li>There are emails saved in the mail folders which date back at least a decade, from when Outlook was still Hotmail; these were transferred from an old account.</li><li>This account was used to activate Windows 7 and Windows 10.</li><li>I have used the account for Skype.</li><li>I have used the account to purchase items from the Microsoft Store, most recently Ad-Free Outlook and Office 365.</li><li>There are multiple emails in there which are obviously work and study-related (I am a doctor and PhD student, and so they are of a medical/scientific nature).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that serious infractions to the Microsoft Services Agreement may result in an account being permanently blocked. However, does the above look like someone who willingly uses an account for illegal purposes? There is too much at risk here. If
 I am knowingly using it for illegal purposes, instead of going through these many agonising and distressing days without access and trying to regain access, would it not be easier to just create a new account?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I believe there had been a mistake, or that my account had been accessed by a third party which then performed actions that resulted in the suspension, and now I am suffering the consequences. However, there does not seem to be any recourse for this -
 I have fought tooth and nail to try to get my account reinstated, but all support channels (online chats and forms) do not seem to offer any means of pleading my case, or directly communicating with a Microsoft Online Safety officer to explain what may have
 happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I emphasise that I am yet to hear back from the later tickets</em>, where I provided much more detail (similar to what I posted above). I guess I am not expecting any solution from this post directly. However, given the number of very helpful people
 around, some from Microsoft, maybe someone will know someone with the power to unblock accounts, and direct him/her to my post? I do not know what else to do. Maybe the community will offer more than the online tickets and chat support I have received thus
 far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading this all the way through. Have a nice day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>You are lucky.</p>
<p>I have to create a new account about every month because the account gets "temporarly suspended" and can't be unblocked. The only thing I use the accounts for because I use a Microsoft software which requires me to be logged in with an account and I don't
 use them for anything else and I still get suspended. The simple solution is to get used to it and use only throw away accounts and don't use them for anything important or store important files on it. If the software wouldn't require me to have a Microsoft
 account, I wouldn't have one anymore.</p>

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I by no means intend to trivialise your issue, I can't help but think our problems are slightly different. In your case, it's definitely a case of mistaken identity and error with Microsoft's algorithm. Your many recently-created accounts will be "clean",
 and won't have much attached to them. In contrast, see my original post for details on how much I've invested in mine. What upsets me the most is what happens once a suspension occurs. If the Online Safety team deems the error is on your part, there's virtually
 no way to do anything about it, to plead your case or to appeal. If it was hacked, used by someone else because you forgot to sign out at a public place, or whatever else, you're the one who receives the blame and suffers the consequences. I find it depressing
 that, for such a large, multinational and multicultural corporation, Microsoft seems to not understand that unintended errors occur, either on their part or the user's, and it's not anyone's "fault".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I do agree that now I have no choice but to be extremely cautious with Microsoft accounts. To do exactly what you do, never attaching more data than necessary to the account. I'm hesitant about also starting another Outlook email account, given
 now I see it can be arbitrarily banned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of interest, what did the Online Safety team say when you explained your situation? Did they ever get back to you on your attempts at explanation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>In the rare cases I got a reply (after weeks), it didn't relate to what I wrote and it just said to stick to a link which described what I already tried and didn't work and I wrote that already in my support request.<br />
I also use Thunderbird to access email accounts which stores all emails offline so I can access them when the account gets suspended.</p>
<p>I understand your pain to get a big part of you digital life get erased.</p>
<p>We would need to change Microsoft to change it or we would need that there would be a competent person working at Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might be able to help you here - you may not have been talking with the right people. You can fill in the various forms from the support page and, whoever they end up with, they'll balk and say they can't do anything for you if they discover your account
 has been suspended from higher up. Sometimes in that situation they'll offer to direct you to the "actual" people with power to unblock accounts, at the following page:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/getsupport?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wfname=capsub&amp;productkey=wlfoldersabuse&amp;locale=en-us&amp;ccsid=636080686130860304&amp;wa=wsignin1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>This form goes to the true Online Safety team. <strong>Try to provide as much details as possible in the box</strong>, which may sway their decision. This hasn't worked for me but may work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two other forms you might want to try before that one are as follows (although I have a feeling you probably tried them already):</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">https://account.live.com/ACSR</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">https://account.live.com/password/reset</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I learnt through all these awful days is that, despite the forms saying a reply will be within 24 hours, it's more like four days. Patience, optimism and luck are all essential.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have a better outcome than me the next time this happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>The last 2 links only reset my password and I resetted the password multiple times using my alternate email and my 2-factor token and my old password(which should clearly prove that it's really me) but after login the accounts are still suspended.</p>
<p>I tried another submit with your first link, maybe it works this time.</p>
<p>Is it only me or is the captcha unreadable? I needed 3 tries to get it right. Maybe just a method to keep the number of complains low because then people can't complain and can't complain that they can't complain. :D</p>
<p>The answer to my last reply was after 10 days and said that they think I haven't already tried to recover my account and that they can't help me otherwise and that I should try<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://account.live.com/acsr</span></span></a></span>.</p>
<p>This time I asked them for the reason they suspended my last account because I didn't use it other than to register Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition. Let's see what their answer in 1 month will be.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah, that's where your problem differs from mine. I cannot even reset my password. I never get a response back with ACSR, and with the other link I always encounter an error during the process. The captcha does seem to be on the difficult side for me as well
 - the text is often distorted/obscured in such a way as to make several tries necessary. I honestly hope things work out for you this time!</p>

            <p>Yeah, I've learnt to now not trust Microsoft with important personal information whenever possible since they are able to shut down your account without warning. No matter what you plead nothing will be done, even when you're not at fault. It's still frustrating
 and painful to think back to the 10+ years of correspondence I lost with the account, but you live and learn.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've done is migrated to Gmail for all emails, and created a separate Outlook account which is used only for signing into Microsoft services. That way if the Outlook account gets banned I can just create a new one without much trouble. I've also gotten
 into the habit of periodically backing up my Gmail to a local site, since I suspect Gmail also has the ability to close your account out of nowhere.</p>

            Mine wasnt even email related. I used my account solely for xbox live. I have been told time and time again the exact same thing they've told you. I have lost over 1 thousand dollars in purchases. Will not buy the next xbox and have migrated to Sony. Save
 yourself everyone reading, and steer clear of scammersoft.

            <p>I agree with you there. The truth is Microsoft has such a monopoly on digital services and, let's be frank, for the great majority (&gt;99%) of users there're no issues. They can just ignore the complaints of the &lt;1% and still make bank. I mean, before this
 happened to you, have you ever heard of other people complain about being **** over by Microsoft in this way? Not common things like Windows compatibility or installation errors, I'm talking about lifestyle-altering, money-burning, privacy-compromising stuff.
 I certainly haven't; however, if you look around online on forums such as this one, there're plenty of people affected. Just no-one pays any attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll take some major error on their part, such as having this problem affecting someone rich and famous, or involving an entire company domain contracted out to Microsoft, for anything to (potentially) be done. We're just small people here with no voices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have better luck with Sony and PS4.</p>

 themselves remain bright blue (i.e. new data to viewed) just can't view anything against the 2 tabs. The others such as run work fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also noticed that the app hangs for ages quoting "downloading" and forcing a sync to the band is often the only way to refresh data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experiencing this. I'm about to assume its my app that's corrupted in some way and will have to uninstall &amp; reinstall to resolve.</p>

<h2>            calling a fortran dll created in vs 2008 in a third party machine which does ot have vs2008</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have created a FORTRAN dll using Intel visual FORTRAN compiler 11.1 and compiled it using vs2008.<br />
I am calling this Dll in an excel maro. Now when i call it in my machine it works completely fine but when i call it in a third party machine which does not have Intel FORTRAN or vs2008 installed i have an error file not found.<br />
I have eliminated the Intel FORTRAN dependencies by adding the required run time dlls but i am unable to run the dll in a machine which does not have vs 2008.<br />
kindly help me out as i am working on a deadline.<br />
Thanking you in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Shiveni<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for asking. It is unfortunate that you are not able to run the dll file in a machine which does not have Visual Studio 2008 installed.
 I would recommend you to post your query in the following MSDN Forum for better results:</p>

<p><br />
In XP that diagnostic does not have the same effect as the one on W7 now has.&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially all it is good for is proving that you have an Internet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular it does nothing to test the host that you are having trouble with (unless that host
 happens to be one of the microsoft ones which&nbsp;are tested).</p>

            <p>I downloaded the nirsoft tool and noticed its not listed for use with win10... I ran it on 10240 and it marked same items I mentioned above as not found plus some others so a simple search and thinking discovered&nbsp;that most were originally part of a intel
 driver install as not found, but also not needed, plus the mirrorcast item which hasn't been installed.. its still in sxs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some others still in sxs but the path to install is in the registry - so of course nirsoft found &amp; marked those as not found. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't fully waste lots of time on the handful not found here as I'm sure nirsoft makes good programs and either hasn't taken the time to update that for windows 10, nor have I taken the time to fully read his web page about that&nbsp;&nbsp; asterisk&nbsp;&nbsp; and what
 it really means.</p>

            <p>Multiboot system - the above and the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>XP Pro x64 w/SP2 and RegDllView v1.58 - no missing files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win7 w/SP1 and RegDllView v1.58 - missing follow:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I must say here that I believe the RegDllView program is accurate in what is determines is missing.&nbsp; My comment now is what is with the missing /sta in Win7, 8.1 and 10? Anyone have a clue?</p>

<h2>            Making selected appointments Not appear by default</h2>
                    
<p>I'm coming to WM6 from Palm and wonder if there's a way to "hide" some appoinmtents/ events so that they don't appear on my handheld unless I actively seek them out.&nbsp; There are some recurring appointments that clutter
 my screen--I'd rather not see them by default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, is there a way to assign appoinments to a category and color code them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>This is not possible with the default application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can assign appointments to a category using the Categories field. However you cannot color code them. Pocket Informant has this feature -

    <title>Difficult Excel Formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atlbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Difficult Excel Formula</h2>
                    <p>I have a difficult challenge.&nbsp; I am attempting to develop a formula that will count the times a value appears in a column range, starting at the bottom of an excel data worksheet and looking for matches moving up the column.&nbsp; Here are the specifics:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The number will be placed in column K of a worksheet titled "Mojo Masters" beginning with cell K2</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The count will be taken from the last 225 data populated rows of a worksheet titled "DataSheet"</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Column C of Mojo Masters contains the key for the calculation to be placed in K of Mojo Masters.&nbsp; In each cell of column C, beginning with C2, is a unique name (only in a cell once in the column)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; For the C starting in row 2 of Mojo Masters, I would like to count each match of C in the lowest most 225 data containing rows (not empty rows) found in column E of DataSheet.&nbsp; The tricky part is that data is added to DataSheet each week (15 rows of
 new data each week).&nbsp; So each week the data field gets 15 rows longer.&nbsp; Below the most recent set of 15 entries are empty cells in E of DataSheet.&nbsp; Another complicating factor of this formula is that the data in DataSheet does not actually begin until row
 18.&nbsp; There is a table above row 18 in DataSheet.&nbsp; One nice thing is that the first 225 rows of DataSheet are entered prior to the first set of 15 weekly rows, so there is no need to be concerned that the formula will calculate into an area outside the data
 range (E18:E962). Those first 225 rows are actually the final 225 rows from the previous year's data, and the formula will begin by using those rows for the formula calculation.&nbsp; So the formula must find the first empty cell in column E of DataSheet after
 row 17 (starting with row 18) and then count how many matches there are for C of Mojo Masters in the 225 cells of E of DataSheet above this first empty cell (again...the first empty cell after row 18 of DataSheet).</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Formula will be placed in cell K2 of Mojo Masters</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will need to be able to pull down the formula, so that the formula will return the count in the corresponding K for each cell in column C of DataSheet.&nbsp; I would like also for the default number to be 0 if there are no instances of the name found in DataSheet,
 rather than a blank cell.&nbsp; I have a formula, but it returns the wrong value.&nbsp; It returns a value in a cell containing the most recent instance of the name.&nbsp; I need a counter instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mojo Masters is straight-forward, but DataSheet has a table at the top.&nbsp; That's why the formula must start looking for the first empty cell in row E of DataSheet starting with row 18, instead of row 1.&nbsp; I guess it's sort of like a 17 row header of sorts.&nbsp;
 If it helps DataSheet is like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column E</p>
<p>row 1</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>*****table***** (shifts down the beginning of the formula's search for the first empty cell in column E of DataSheet)</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>row 17</p>
<p>row 18</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>*****15 sets of 15 rows of automatically added data from the end of the previous year, which is added to these cells at the beginning of each new year*****</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>row 242</p>
<p>row 243</p>
<p>,</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>*****sets of 15 rows of data added each week during the year*****</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>row 962 (end of DataSheet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have been able to explain this.&nbsp; It makes my head spin a little bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any help.&nbsp; This is the final element of a spreadsheet workbook I have sunk several years preparing.&nbsp; I am most looking forward to finishing the project!</p>

            <p>Yes, Its doing what you require. My formula OFFSET will select the last 225 cells range in E18:E962, ending with last cell having value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have assumed that in between your filled cells there will not be any blank cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may see the behaviour of formula, how its working by selecting the cell where formula resides and then going to Formula/Evaluate Formula/clicking Evaluate button one by one and seeing how formula is calculating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still if its not as per your requirement then either post screen shot/Error/expected result. Better if you share a sample file by uploading it in Onedrive.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to compress a spreadsheet&#63;</h2>
                    I have one spreadsheet that I have now split into three spreadsheets.&nbsp; For one of them, even though I have removed 3/4 of the data, it still remains the same file size (5.4Mb).

            Extra formatting such as cell shading can also add to the file size, try to format the spreadsheet very simply and see if that helps.&nbsp; Of course, upgrading to Excel 2010 will dramatically cut the size.

<h2>            WindowsUpdate dt000 OR 80072EFD error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running build 9926 and I'm getting WindowsUpdate_dt000 OR 80072EFD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reverting back to the old update style as we use WSUS and had the same result. Since this is not recommended I have gone back to the Windows 10 update application. Before checking for updates, I clear the WSUS GPO settings from the registry
 and restart the Windows update service. I'm able to check for updates but on download I get to 0% and the update application seems to retry a few times and eventually I&nbsp;get the message "There was a problem downloading updates", clicking Get more info takes
 me to WindowsUpdate_dt000 OR 80072EFD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried resetting the Windows update software by running the manual steps from this article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using IE I can access the Windows Update site without errors.</p>
<p>I have tried from a LAN without a proxy server as our corporate LAN requires a proxy. Both fail.
</p>
<p>I have turned off the local firewall and Windows Defender to test without any luck.</p>
<p>I have added these to IE trusted sites:</p>
<p>http://download.microsoft.com</p>
<p>https://download.microsoft.com</p>
<p>https://*.update.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 trouble-shooter reports "troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried selecting just one of the updates to see if it was something to do with volume of downloads. Same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Arvind,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><div>As suggested I ran <strong>netsh winhttp reset proxy </strong>with these results<br />
Current WinHTTP proxy settings:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct access (no proxy server)</div>
<div>
<p>Rebooted the computer, cleared the WSUS GPOs from the registry and restarted Windows Update service and checked/downloaded updates and got this error:<br />
WindowsUpdate_dt000 OR 80200056</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Tried again and got this error:<br />
WindowsUpdate_dt000 OR 80240034</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Tried again and got this error:<br />
WindowsUpdate_dt000 OR 80072EFD</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>So back to where I started.</p>
<div>
<p>By the way this same pc using the same network connection when running Windows 8.1 was able to download updates successfully.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Running <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> from an elevated command prompt fails with Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation. A look at the cbs.log shows this message:<br />
Cannot repair member file [l:20{10}]"secdrv.sys" of Macrovision-Protection-SafeDisc<br />
Could it be related? I haven't tried chkdsk /r yet as I'm remote to the pc and worried that t will not reboot properly, but chkdsk /f shows no errors.</p>

            <p>Hi Arvind,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from clearing the BITS queue I had already tried everything else (following http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I had some positive results though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the SCCM client from my PC, removed the GPOs relating to Windows Updates and tried updating Windows without success. I have then monitored the firewall and I noticed that Windows Updates were trying to&nbsp;go directly to the Internet and being blocked.
 As a test we allowed my PC direct access to the Internet and this worked. So now I have updates working but I'm not 100% sure why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I had tried using an Internet connection without a proxy server without success - why is it working now? Is it because I removed the SCCM client? I had already tried with the policies removed and no success.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why are Windows 10 updates ignoring the proxy? This works with Windows 7 and 8.1, not mention working with Server 2003, 2008 R2 and 2012 R2. With Windows 10 the proxy seems to be completely ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your help and suggestions, I think in the end was a combination of SCCM client, policies, proxy server and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For information my Windows 10 is a clean install: I booted of a USB image, repartitioned the HDD and installed. The USB image was built with the Windows 7 DVD download tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>zx</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. Glad to hear that the Windows is Up to date after bypassing the connection.
</p>

<h2>            Lumia Storyteller Accidental Photo Deletion No Recovery No Settings To Protect Photos In Gallery</h2>
                    <p>Here goes, I thought some other bug in Windows 10 Mobile had attacked my phone because one day I had all the photos from my site visit to our new workplace, the next day everything is gone?! Ok, i tried all sorts of stuff to recover my photos to no avail
 until I remembered deleting a big story of the month with all my photos from Lumia Storyteller. I switched off backing up photos to onedrive because it is 94% full, kinda useless too. Now the phone is encrypted so there is no way to recover my stuff. Why in
 God's name would the programmers of this app not think of a situation like this happening huh? An option to "Protect Accidental Photo Deletion From Main Photo Library" would be very easy to implement. Also all the clever chaps at MSFT never thought of a homebrewed
 app that installs on the PC to recover one's deleted files in case this is needed, encryption or not. I still own the device and if it is this weak in functionality, why doesn't someone advertise it's weakness (remember its 2016! not 1786) so we don't slap
 our hard earned cash on the ground for nothing. This stupid app is getting a boot from my phone, anyway the automatically created stories are not necessary, one would create this themselves if they needed it....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So clever people: how does one recover accidentally deleted photos/files from a lumia phone that has only built in storage? Can't will not work for me, I'm looking to buy from a manufacturer with a simple solution to simple problems than no solution at all</p>

            <p>Ok, thanks for pointing that out. The damage has been done. It's a good thing this app was removed from the store. Thing is I still had it on my phone... good riddance I suppose :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that still remains is: How do you recover deleted files from a lumia device with only internal storage, if those files are not backed up on the cloud or somewhere else? I guess the answer is still the same, "You can't!" and I do not see MSFT thinking
 of a plan regarding such things...&nbsp;</p>

 delete all tiles on the start screen, just to make sure the tile did not end-up in a folder. Furthermore, if your issue is not with ‘Phone 1’ like in this thread but with a missing tile ‘Phone 2’, please, double-check: All apps » Phone » Options » Unlink tiles.</span>

            if you don't wish to uninstall the whole pc suite, a stand alone installation can be done by downloading the drivers from here.<br />

<br />
in case the pc suite you had on was the one supplied on your 7610 CD, then i guess it's old. and Petrib's suggestion of downloading and installing a complete new version will be more beneficial to you.

<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>As per my understanding you are unable to open the website "</span><span>Mathletics" in your Internet Explorer 11 as well as your Chrome v44.</span></p>
<p><span>Before I could assist you with your query, please answer the following questions so that we can help you resolve your issue:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Did you create a child account on your system?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you try to access the website "Mathletics" from a child account?</span></p>

<p><span>4. Does the issue persist only for the above mentioned website?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to add the website to the trusted sites in your Internet Explorer.

<p>
</p><p><span>2.In the <strong>Add this website to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click
<strong>Add</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3.</span><span>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4.</span><span>Click <strong>OK </strong>two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
