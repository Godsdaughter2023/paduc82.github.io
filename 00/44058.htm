    <title>Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter screen stays black - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattcummins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter screen stays black</h2>
                    I installed Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, and once I had installed everything I opened the program up on my desktop then my screen changed resolution and then it just&nbsp;completely went black and stayed that way and the game made no progress at all. Then
 I checked the games properties and it says that it is not compatible with windows 7. I then checked on the system requirements and it did say that it was compatible with Windows 7 but in brackets said that I needed an administrator account for full compatibility.
 So what my question is, is "how can I make this game compatible with Windows 7"?&nbsp;

<p>but the answer I got from real player did.</p>
<p>it was to install </p>
<ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<li>K-Lite codec:<a href="http://fileforum.betanews.com/download/KLite-Codec-Pack_Full/1094057842/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://fileforum.betanews.com/download/KLite-Codec-Pack_Full/1094057842/3</span></a></li></ul>
<p>then reboot</p>
<p>it worked on my system with both real player and win media player. </p>
<p>win 10 must not have old style codec required.</p>
<p>it seems like every time we upgrade we&nbsp;something gets lost.</p>

            <p>Arun, we all appreciate your understanding of our concern. &nbsp;However, this is an issue that is apparently affecting all Windows 10 users that work with video. &nbsp;I purchased my Windows 10 computer primarily for video editing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we need is not understanding, but a FIX. &nbsp;This is obviously a reproduce-able problem that should be easy for Microsoft to analyze and correct. &nbsp;Let's get a software person to spend the 20 minutes or so it would take to provide a Microsoft-authorized
 download to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can certainly use other video players, but why should I have to?</p>

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be due to missing Codec. You can use the free VideoInspector tool to find which
<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/determine-codecs-needed-to-play-audio-video-file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Codec</a> is needed to play a media file, and installing that Codec is what all you need to do.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>That's a very good answer, and, frankly, it's what I have suspected. &nbsp;However, I ran VideoInspector and it reports that the codec is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded another video player and it plays the .mpg MPEG2 videos just fine. &nbsp;My PowerDirector video editor handles them as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'll just point the files to the other video player and forget Media Player.</p>

<p>I completely agree. &nbsp;It's ridiculous that Microsoft can't or won't resolve something this simple and repeatable. &nbsp;I guarantee if it impacted their beloved anti-piracy systems, they would be all over it. &nbsp;But then, this is just their customers that are affected.</p>

<h2>            Network Permissions on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have several computers here at the office and all&nbsp;had been&nbsp;on Windows 7.&nbsp; The network worked perfectly then.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could open and save all files and folders from&nbsp;any file in any computer to any file in any other computer.</p>
<p>Since I upgraded to Windows 10 the network has become <strong>totally useless</strong>. Now, I have to save and transfer all files through the cloud or a thumb drive.</p>
<p>I get the message "<strong><em>You do not have permission to access \\[computer name]\c. Contact your network administrator to request access</em></strong>."
</p>
<p>I have spent many hours on every computer in the office using &nbsp;"advanced sharing" making sure that all files are shared and all permissions granted, but we still are told we do not have "permission".
</p>
<p>What do I need to do to get permission to access my own files from&nbsp;the various&nbsp;computers I own?</p>
<p>One of my computers can actually save files to the "users" folder in one other computer, but then I still have to&nbsp;move the file to where I want it.</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>As an initial step, I suggest you to disable antivirus software (and any other security software) and firewall on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong><span>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable
 your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software
 is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You may refer to the below article to boot your computer into safe mode with networking and check if you face the same issue.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - Asus Radeon R7 - No Sound &#91;SOLVED&#93;</h2>
                    <span><span>
                    <span><span>
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just installed Windows 8.1 on my desktop.&nbsp; Initially I was using an Nvidia Quatro graphics card and both sound and graphics were fine.&nbsp; I've now installed the Asus Radeon R7 240 graphics card and installed its drivers from disc.&nbsp; The graphics are fine
 but there is no sound now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speakers icon says "No headphones or speakers are plugged in".&nbsp; In Device Manager under Sound, video and game controllers there is one entry: AMD High Definition Audio Device.&nbsp; The drivers for this are up-to-date.&nbsp; In Sound the AMD High Definition Audio
 Device status is "Not plugged in".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing it's a driver issue and from reading similar problems it appears to be something to do with HDMI?&nbsp; My monitor isn't HD (It's an HP L1906) and my motherboard is a HP 0AA0H X38 with an Intel 2.2Ghz CPU.&nbsp; I don't have any sound card installed.</p>
<p>Any help with this would be appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Code 52: Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Run the <b>hardware and devices troubleshooter</b> and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refresh device manager and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on&nbsp;<b>Start.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Run</b> and type&nbsp;“<b>devmgmt.msc</b>” (without quotes), and then Enter. The&nbsp;Device Manager&nbsp;window opens.</span></p>

<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the&nbsp;Action&nbsp;menu, click&nbsp;<b>Scan for hardware changes</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Close the Device Manager window and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall drivers from the device manager and try reinstall them by downloading from manufacturer’s website in
<b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></b> mode:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on <b>Start</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “<b>Device Manager</b>” without quotes in the search bar.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on <b>Device Manager</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Select the device you wish to uninstall in the Device Manager window and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>e. You can also uninstall by right clicking on the device and selecting <b>
Uninstall</b> from the context menu. A dialog box will open asking if you really wish to uninstall the driver. Click
<b>Yes</b>, then <b>OK</b> in the next window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure you put the computer back to normal startup after the troubleshooting.</span></p>

            You do not say if your copy of Office came pre-installed on your Computer, and has suddenly stopped working.<br />
<br />
Or, if you bought and installed Office, and it has suddenly stopped working.<br />
<br />
If you have a paid version of it, you will get Office Help at the Office Newsgroups links below.<br />
If Office came pre-installed, and you have NOT paid for it, read further down in the answer about buying Office.<br />
A trial version of Office only gives you so many days use of it, or so many uses.<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/community/en-us/flyoutoverview.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

 and sell them online, but my webcam doesn't get the colors and just makes it look likes it's practically in black and white.</p>
<p>I reset the settings to default and restart my computer but nothing changes,</p>

<h3> chris111cc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Welcome to the best Windows ever......&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so almost 30 hours since the disastrous April Windows Update destroyed my laptop, after rebooting endless times to try and get something to work, after fiddling with BIOS and BOOT settings of which I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, after being
 blamed apparently because the failed update was because there is a fault with my laptop and also apparently the hundreds of thousands of other laptops/desktops which suffered the same fate after The Update From Hell, and after reading hundreds of helpful and
 not so helpful (thanks to everyone anyway who did try to help on the community forum) I finally had to resort to a clean install of Windows 10 from a bootable media stick. &nbsp;And even that wasn't straightforwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen I am now looking at proudly states "Welcome to the best Windows ever", which actually just feels like a slap in the face after what it took to get it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I am scared to even use it. &nbsp; This has been the worst two days I have ever spent trying to get my previously pre-April update perfectly running laptop back up and running, and I now have no trust nor confidence that my laptop won't be trashed again
 very soon when the update or a future forced update, attempts to do the exact same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well done Microsoft, for completely ruining my online experience. &nbsp;PLEASE do not enforce future updates on your unsuspecting end users. &nbsp;Another exercise like this and I will bite the bullet and replace my 18 month old laptop with an Apple Mac. &nbsp;Seriously.
 &nbsp; This has been way too stressful.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t enable Dolby Atmos for Headphones&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yannickberinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t enable Dolby Atmos for Headphones&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since I bought Dolby Atmos, I haven't been able to enable it in the spacial sound settings. Instead of enabling it, selecting Atmos for Headphones just opens the Dolby Access app, which in turn asks me to open the spacial sound settings. So I am stuck in
 a loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried contacting the support a few days ago, but I still haven't heard from them. For a software that cost 18€, I think that is really disappointing. Is there anything I can do to get a refund, since Atmos for Headphones has't worked a single time since
 I bought it? Or is there a solution for my problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running the audio troubleshooter as well as the hardware troubleshooter. I also performed a System File Checker scan, without success. I also uninstalled and reinstalled the audio driver. Nothing helped.</p>

<p>Yep, same here. In Audio settings, the selection for Dolby Atmos, just jumps back to windows sonic.... In germany, there are special regulations, and if I'm buying something, that does not work, I should be able to undo and get my money back.</p>

<h2>            My pc keeps on restarting when windows 10 boot up screen is finished.</h2>
                    After installing a gpu, my pc keeps loading into windows 10 and restarting after a red blank screen. I have previously installed the same gpu and had the same problem i have now. Fortunately, i found a solution online that had to do something with taking
 out a stick of ram, the day after that, i had the same problem, just i didn't have the time to fix it again. Fast toward today i forgot the technique and can't find it.&nbsp; It would be greatly appreciated that someone help me out with this.

            Hi there,<br /><br />Do you have an alternative option for connecting a display? If so use this to boot to windows and remove all drivers relating to the new GPU. reboot and try again<br /><br />Failing this, remove all power from the machine, wait 30 seconds for this to discharge. Remove the ram sticks for the same amount of time, pop them back in and try again <br /><br />Let me know how you get on, but it seems driver related as this is the latest addition to the machine unless the hardware is faulty

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode to repair Windows..
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up

<p>They don't mostly. Game disc sizes have increased to around 8.5GB IIRC. Batman AC is 7.7GB when installed from disc whereas LA Noire installed from disc is way over 20GB but the digital download is nearer to 14GB as it streams assets across the entire game
 without the need to have them installed multiple times.</p>

            <p>Try rolling back your video drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, like me, you: (1)&nbsp;upgraded to&nbsp;Windows 8 from a Windows 7 laptop, and (2) upgraded your ATI video card drivers directly from AMD's website, then rolling back the drivers should do the trick.&nbsp; I had an "old" (2009 vintage) HP with ATI 3500 series graphics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was having the exact same 97% problem with Netflix.&nbsp; The circle just kept spinning, and eventually dumped me back to the movie title screen.&nbsp; I attempted as many of Sharief's&nbsp;debugging steps&nbsp;as I could stand, then went web hunting elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saw somewhere on the webs that 97% from Netflix is an indicator of a DRM hangup somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 7 from XP</h2>
                    I bought a copy of windows 7 and tried to install it over my XP - did not work. It said it could not be installed on my computer. So I checked with windows 7 upgrade advisor and it said: the driver for my Intel(R)82915G/GV/910GL express chipset family
 was not the proper driver for windows 7. Is that what is causing me not to be able to install windows 7? Why wouldn't the install cd for 7 put the proper driver for the video card on for me at the time of installation?

            <p>The problem is with your chipset, not just the graphics card. The chipset is the set of all major chips and hardware on the motherboard, yours is unsupported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your only solution if you want to upgrade your OS is to get a new computer. I generally don't recommend Linux because of its lack of compatibility with popular file formats, and it's not very user friendly.</p>

            I wrote to Speedbit about this frustrating SBUpdate problem and they wrote back&nbsp;with the following solution—that worked. This was their response:

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t start&#47;startup repair cannot repair automatically</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, so I wanted to restart my computer today because some programs were running slowly and I thought this might help. After about 10 minutes&nbsp;I was still waiting for IE to close, so I force closed it. After that Windows shut down.</p>
<p>When starting up again I got the message that either my computer was unplugged during start up, then I should start Windows normally (which wasn't the case) or I should do a startup repair (which I did). "Your computer was unable to start. Startup repair
 is checking your system for problems. Attempting repairs...." with the result that startup repair was unable to repair automatically. So I tried again and again - same result. Then I did a system restore to before I installed a Java Update. This worked, but
 upon restart, I got the same message as the first time.</p>
<p>1 root cause: Unspecified changes to the system configuration might have caused the problem.<br />
---------------<br />
Repair action: System files integrity check and repair. <br />
Result failed. Error code = 0x2. <br />
Time taken = 281316 ms<br />
---------------<br />
Boot status indicates that the OS booted successfully.<br />
all other tests: completed successfully.</p>
<p>Last thing I tried was to repair Windows with the installation CD which didn't work either.</p>
<p>First of all, I really have no explanation for why this suddenly happened. Was it because of the forced shutdown? Also why is the installation disc unable ro repair it? Is there another solution than to reinstall Windows 7?</p>
<p>thanks for your answer in advance!</p>

<p><span><span><span>As Shekhar stated, this issue could have been caused by hardware or software.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Without knowing the exact blue screen errors or having access to the events from the previous installation, it is hard to tell.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I already stumbled upon this problem several times now. It is neither a hardware nor a software problem, but a Windows 7 problem. My hardware is new and thoroughly tested for problems (Core i7 960, 12GB Ram, 500GB HDD, Asus Rampage MoBo). Even installing
 Windows 7 (64Bit, Professional Edition ) only the problem appears. It can be tracked down to some symptoms:</p>
<p>- system has been shut down (normally) and one tries to start it again</p>
<p>- windows tries to boot and for a very short time a blue screen of death flashes the screen</p>
<p>- in the second boot run windows starts into recovery mode (takes a while)</p>
<p>- there restoring old system states does not solve the problem</p>
<p>- using a boot cd and running chkdsk C: /F /R i found several lost indices, orphaned files, wrong cluster assignments etc. so the system partition is trashed</p>
<p>The last point clearly indicates to me that data has not been written back correctly to the system partition before shutdown. Thats very bad! So could you guys at Microsoft please have a look at Windows 7 shutdown procedures and roll out a fix so this won't
 happen in the future again and again?</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw. using chkdsk solved the problem...</p>

                    <p>Hey all,</p><p><br /></p><p>Been having a lot of trouble with my Xbox. I'm a big Destiny player, and naturally when the new game came out, I was pumped to play. However, I had an issue right away. Every 30 or so minutes I&nbsp;would get the Canary error, which is a total loss of internet connection that boots me to the home screen. This means I&nbsp;have to log in again, and try and get back to whatever activity I&nbsp;was doing. I realized Destiny isn't the only thing to have this problem. Overwatch also kicked me out regularly, and during Netflix streaming, there would be occasional significant dips in streaming quality, and occasionally I&nbsp;would have to pause and allow a video to buffer.</p><p><br /></p><p>The bigger issue here, is that these problems have occurred in no way on my other devices, such as my computer and phone, meaning the problem isn't in the network, it's in the box. I've had the Xbox about 2 years now and the only other issue it's had is that it won't always pic

            <p>Not sure if this is relevant, but my Xbox also sometimes doesn't connect wirelessly to my controllers and I&nbsp;have to hard reset. Occasionally if I&nbsp;connect via cord, it gets done and I&nbsp;can detach the cord and it stays connected. But more often than not, even after getting positive feedback from the controller on a wired connection, the Xbox still won't recognize the equipment and refuses to connect. Repairing obviously doesn't work here either.</p><p><br /></p><p>If the Xbox is using the same tech to connect to the wifi and the controllers, could this also be a problem?</p>

<p>Ran this right after I&nbsp;got kicked from Destiny 2. Unfortunately if you compare this to the previous diagnostic I&nbsp;ran both when I&nbsp;first logged on, it is actually better, not worse. Interestingly, the disconnections have been more sporadic. I&nbsp;logged on soon after my last post, which was 21 minutes ago as I&nbsp;type this. I&nbsp;have also observed it disconnecting sooner than 30 minutes before.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Not sure how this one helps really. :/</p>

<h2>            Usable Maintenance Programs for Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Laptop that is running Win 8.1 stock.</p>
<p>I have already reserved my Free Upgrade to Win 10.</p>
<p>And everything according to it's compatibility check everything is cool lucky me. A first in many Windows Upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I was wondering if anyone could suggest "THE BEST" System Maintenance Apps for Win 10 that are Free preferably off of Cnet.</p>
<p>Although I will consider pay for apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ricky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly is your purpose of using System Maintenance app?</li></ul>
<p>Windows always have had System Maintenance troubleshooting program in-built and so does Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type troubleshooting in search bar - &gt; Click Troubleshooting - &gt; System and Security - &gt; System Maintenance</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also do have option to use any third party software if Windows program does not meet your requirement. However:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><em>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved.

<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
