<h2>            Asus Zenbook Infinity - Blue Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased the Asus Zenbook Infinity UX301 about 2 weeks ago, but since then, windows has been countering some unknown problem that's been causing the laptop to restart every 2 days or so while in sleep mode. This is a&nbsp;link to the minidump file
 that was created during the most recent restart event (<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=CF3D791926B74A75!108&amp;authkey=!AGg7bg45NWKE2vM&amp;ithint=file%2c.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=CF3D791926B74A75!108&amp;authkey=!AGg7bg45NWKE2vM&amp;ithint=file%2c.zip</a>).
 There have been problems with other program encountering problems as well (e.g, explorer.exe, IE, USBChargerPlus, Reader, etc), and since it is a very pricey laptop, I would really appreciate all the help that I can get on this matter. Thank you very much!</p>

This one crash was Related to <a href="http://www.runscanner.net/file/btmhsf.sys.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
btmhsf.sys</a> Bluetooth HighSpeed Filter Driver from Intel Corporation.&nbsp; The uptime (time since the last reboot) was almost 6 days.&nbsp; That in itself will exasperate the issue<br />
<br />
I would run a system file check and update to win 8.1<br />
<br />

Since it is a new laptop you might also want to keep Asus in the loop.<br />

    <title>AUTOCHK and CHKDSK endless loops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reallywildstuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            AUTOCHK and CHKDSK endless loops</h2>
                    Question:&nbsp; How to fix AUTOCHK and CHKDSK loops when all else fails?<br />
<br />
Summary:&nbsp; a new HDD, with a cloned image of malware-infected WinXP that was thoroughly cleaned, continues to show C: Dirty file system bit set.&nbsp; A forced 5-stage CHKDSK /f or CHKDSK /r is not resolving the probelm.&nbsp; System appears to be 100% clean and runs
 very well except for the "stuck" Dirty bit on C:.&nbsp; Dirty bit can be effectively ignored using CHKNTFS /x c: but Scandisk and Defrag can't be run - probably other problems too.&nbsp; Still trying to solve this issue without wiping it and starting over.<br />
<br />
HP Pavilion zd8000 w/ WinXP 2005 Media Center.&nbsp; Would not boot - ran an endless cycle of 3-stage AUTOCHKs and reboots.&nbsp; If AUTOCHK was cancelled, WinXP would sometimes load, but very slowly...HDD was almost certainly failing.&nbsp; Mounted the original 4200rpm HDD
 on another box and successfully copied some data from it.&nbsp; Recieved warnings from host that disk may have errors. Used Ghost to clone a new 5400rpm HDD.<br />
<br />
Installed new HDD in laptop and used MBAM, HitMan, RKill and ComboFix to fix numerous and varied viruses and Trojans (but unsure exactly which Trojans or Viruses, sorry).&nbsp; Possible that one of these viruses caused BSOD 0X0000007b error when trying to boot to
 Safe Mode; this was resolved during further virus removal and by deleting specific Windows Updates here:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-windows_update/blue-screen-error-0x0000007b-in-windows-xp-after/73cea559-ebbd-4274-96bc-e292b69f2fd1
<br />
<br />
and here:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/windows-xp-sp3-boot-to-safe-mode-stop-0x0000007b/8347d3ea-8351-4709-9580-b692feeacb77<br />
<br />
Once infections were gone, and after successful booting to Safe Mode, WinXP continued to report corrupted files ("exception processing message c00001012") along with Event ID 55 ("The file system structure on the disk is corrupt and unusable. Please run the
 CHKDSK utility on volume C:\") and the same 3-stage AUTOCHK loop on every start.<br />
<br />
Performed Repair install using original media.&nbsp; WinXP was SP3, now SP2 after repair.&nbsp; Delaying further updates pending resolution of this issue.<br />
<br />
The laptop now runs great - except that the Dirty bit seems to be permanently set for C: - Defrag won't run because it says a CHKDSK /f is scheduled.&nbsp; No more "exception processing message" errors either (suspect that some Windows files were in fact corrupted,
 possibly by Virus, possibly by previous HDD disc error, but were then repaired by Repair install).<br />
<br />
FSUTIL always reports that C: is dirty.<br />
<br />
I've set CHKNTFS /x C: and that's preventing AUTOCHK from running on every boot - now it boots and runs seemingly without issue, except that the Dirty bit is still set.&nbsp; I'm not clear whether CHKNTFS /x C: should be prohibiting the AUTOCHK from running on every
 boot, but that is what its doing regardless...in other words, I&nbsp; don't have to reset CHKNTFS /x C: before every boot, it seems to be "permanently" set.&nbsp; I don't think this is the designed function of the switch...<br />
<br />
I've run both CHKDSK /f C: and CHKDSK /r C: under this condition (with CHKNTFS /x set) and both the 5-stage and 3-stage CHKDSK seemed to run successfully each time and respectively - however they also result in an endless loop of CHKDSKs at boot.&nbsp; These are
 not the same as the "regular" AUTOCHK loop that the system is stuck in with FSUTIL /d set.&nbsp; I interpret this to mean that both the regular AUTOCHK and the manually-invoked CHKDSK are not able to successfully unset the Dirty bit despite not finding any errors.<br />
<br />
After resetting FSUTIL /d C: the system still exhibits the same 3-stage AUTOCHK loop on every boot.&nbsp; Event ID 55 continues to be logged when booted under CHKNTFS /d , is not logged when booted under CHKNTFS /x.<br />

            <p>Hello ReallyWildStuff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If chkdsk is not removing the dirty bit, it would be my recommendation to format and perform a non-imaged installation.</p>
<p>At that stage, it would be the only way to definitively say that there are no hardware issues on the drive or controller. &lt;What if a faulty controller is actually writing a bad bit(s) or if there is some miscommunication occuring within a kink in the cabling&gt;</p>
<p>As you have an image of the previous install, I presume that all of the data is safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know what the results are.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Matthew_Ha</p>

<h2>            Power brick upside down, dangerous&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello there! I have my power brick since day one, my xbox is working fine, the only thing is that my power brick is making the famous fan noise. The noise is so annoying that i have to turn off the xbox completely during the night. Ive notice tho that if
 I put the power brick upside down, the noise is almost completely gone.<br />
<br />
Is doing so dangerous? keep in mind that my power brick sits upside down, ON A FLAT WOOD SURFACE WITH NOTHING TOUCHING IT, the air vent are not blocked and the whole thing can "breathe" well.</p>
<p>--since I am posting here ill try to ask a second question since we are at it, my xbox is making a crackling noise, only audible when my ear are almost touching the console, the console is also just doing this sound when its idle or on the dashboard, when
 I start up a game the ventilation hide the little noise completely, normal??</p>

<p>Thank you and sorry for my bad english it is not my main language</p>

<p>Heat rises and vents are on top of power brick so i would say it could possibly be dangerous or at least damaging to the psu to keep it upside down.</p>
<p>And the crackling sound is probably the hard drive which is completely normal.</p>

    <title>Updated instructions on repair using Media Creation Tool - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vermontlaura  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updated instructions on repair using Media Creation Tool</h2>
                    Have the instructions for repair Windows using the Media Creation Tool been updated? The most recent I was able to find was from 2015. Using this tool is very scary, and I want to make absolutely sure that I'm not going to lose my settings and data before
 attempting this. Updated instructions would make me feel much more comfortable. <br />

<h2>            Newsletter issue</h2>
                    
<p>I already did the newsletter thing, where I insert my e-mail and check the boxes indicating that I want to receive any e-mail from Xbox. The onçy e-mails I receive are when I buy something, but I can't receive any newsletters telling me the weekly news and
 promotions.</p>
<p>What can I do to fix this and be back to continue receiving the newsletter?</p>

<p>-</p>
<p>Go to My Account on Xbox.com then click on Contact Preferences and update your email. If you have already done this it may take a little while to update as when I did it I didn't start recieving my Rewards emails for some time.</p>

<p>Yes, it is the same e-mail I used and I never changed it as far as I remember! It's the same e-mail I use as a Microsoft Account and to login to my gamertag!</p>
<p>Do I really have to create a whole new e-mail for this to be fixed? I just don't understand, why all the sudden the newsletter stopped coming?</p>

<p>Hmm, it's definitely weird that they stopped all of a sudden. &nbsp;It might be worth trying to send them to a different email, in case they are being filtered from yours for some reason. &nbsp;You could also try turning them off and saving that, and then turning
 them back on.</p>

<p>I'm not completely sure, but I think your advice "You could also try turning them off and saving that, and then turning them back on." was put in good use. After I did this, I received a new Xbox Newsletter, after so many months!</p>
<p>The Newsletter's subject is "It’s the Big Sports Weekend on Xbox, and you’re invited‏".</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">One of the possible reasons why your language key sequence are not working properly can be due to the keyboard settings of your device. To help us determine the appropriate troubleshooting steps, we’d like to ask the following
 questions:</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Amazon Prime Video App no longer working on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Within the last several days my Prime Video app stopped working. I've since uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it. However, since reinstalling (even if I wait several hours before clicking on the app to launch it) all it does is pop up the "Getting your app ready. This may take a minute or two" thing, and then after 30 seconds or so gives me an error code I can't find support for - 0x80073cf6.</p><p><br /></p><p>I've tried uninstalling AGAIN, I've tried a complete power-cycle of the box (over 20 minutes with the brick unplugged, and none of it works.</p><p><br /></p><p>Suggestions?</p>

Why does MS force users to update a functioning software version and then they should figure out how to fix the latest crap version with some cryptic 11 steps and at &nbsp;the same time MS throws a add into our face. You all must be out of your mind. The time since
 MS has purchased Skype I have had only problems. Well, I already bought MACs for wife and children.&nbsp;

<p>Hello from Paris </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same issue I t seems that Skype doesn't work any more on Windows Vista .<br />
<br />
Many Windows Vista users are in the same case as us .<br />
<br />
Microsoft has forced users to upgrade Skype to version 7.36.66.150 when they knew full well that this application will no longer work!&nbsp;&nbsp; Its unfair !<br />

<p>I have Windows Vista with Service Pack 2 installed on two separate machines .&nbsp; I am able to place a call from the latest version 7.36.x.150 to echo or&nbsp;7.40.x.103 on my Windows 7 and above machine.&nbsp; I am able to hear myself just fine no matter how many tests
 I run.&nbsp; The issue would not seem to be a compatibility issue with Windows Vista itself.</p>

</p><p>If you are experiencing audio issues the issue will either be audio/other driver related or network related.&nbsp; Both the Skype audio protocol and network connectivity has changed in the last few versions.&nbsp; To ensure compatibility you may need to update your
 audio drivers and make any changes to your network or firewall software to ensure Skype functions properly.&nbsp; I personally made no changes to my existing setup&nbsp;and Skype works just fine.&nbsp; Make sure your existing version of Skype is not generating any errors
 on startup and has not been modified to ensure it functions properly.&nbsp; If automatically adjust microphone/speaker settings&nbsp;are checked, make sure that you uncheck them and move the sliders all the way (when available) to the right or High to make sure the
 audio is not muted due to automatic settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype profile resets are generally performed when corruption exists.&nbsp; Sometimes this occurs when people bounce back and forth between versions or jump from a really old release to the latest.&nbsp; Other times brought on by hardware of software failures.&nbsp; Mandatory
 resets would result in people losing their data, for this reason I believe,&nbsp;it has never been a&nbsp; part of the Skype install/uninstall/upgrade process.&nbsp; When things do not work as they should, profile resets help create a clean slate in that area.</p>

<p>Hello from Paris </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same issue I t seems that Skype doesn't work any more on Windows Vista .<br />
<br />
Many Windows Vista users are in the same case as us .<br />
<br />
Microsoft has forced users to upgrade Skype to version 7.36.66.150 when they knew full well that this application will no longer work!&nbsp;&nbsp; Its unfair !<br />
<br />
Pleasure to read your comments </p>

<p>Hi Willy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>so I took the time to go through those 11 steps and now it works. But again, I don't see the point of upgrading when in fact the version does not work and I have to spend time and effort to search for a solution and then perform &nbsp;tasks within the Skype folder
 that an upgrade script should do. It's a shame that the MS engineers don't test their upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Au revoir.</p>

<p>To :<strong>Techfreak</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much for your advices&nbsp; </p>
<p>However I am not willing to change anything in the configuration of my PC ...it works perfectly&nbsp; .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype was working properly before the latest update ....<span><span>it is therefore up to MS to resolve this problem.</span></span></p>

<p>Hello everybody !&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that I found a solution&nbsp; I downloaded an older version skype (7.34.0.102.exe) of Skype on this site :&nbsp;
</p>

<br />
I uninstalled&nbsp; the 7.36 version and installed 7.34&nbsp; …. and it works perfectly <br />
<br />
Skype echo sound test works normally <br />
<br />
I can hear my contacts and they can hear me .<br />
<br />
Video works as before .<br />

            I cannot recommend that solution as it bypasses the main problem, in turn, creating a much bigger one.&nbsp; That version of Skype will not work properly on Windows Vista.&nbsp; You need to be running an XP/Vista version of any 7.3x release including 7.34.&nbsp; By running
 a Windows 7-10 version you will run into issues even if it appears to be functioning.&nbsp; I partially covered why in one of my other responses located

    <title>How do I completely remove a user account from Windows 10. Only option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> celinego  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I completely remove a user account from Windows 10.  Only option is &#34;Block&#34;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My husband and I want to remove his user account from my laptop.&nbsp; I thought I knew how ... ie, Settings/Accounts/Family &amp; Other People, click on his user name and then Remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Remove isn't an option any more, only Block, which says it will block him from signing in and using the PC but I can allow him again at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds to me like it is literally just permanently blocking him, rather than removing him and all his folders from my laptop which is what I really want to do to get more space back for me too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way I can do this?&nbsp; Do I have to edit the registry and if so, how please?&nbsp; Why can't you offer both options ie Remove or Block?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<br />Open the Settings App

<h2>            Deal Of The Week&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Good news guys and girls (and BIG Mass Effect fanboys/fangirls)! Your votes for the promotion a while back has given victory to Mass Effect 2! Selected DLC for Mass Effect 2 have been discounted by 50%. Don't miss out on this sale.</p>
<p><b>Arrival:</b> 280 points <i>(from 560 points) - 50% off</i></p>
<p><b>Kasumi - Stolen Memory:</b> 280 points <i>(from 560 points)</i> <i>- 50% off</i></p>
<p><b>Lair Of The Shadow Broker:</b> 400 points <i>(from 800 points)</i> <i>- 50% off&nbsp; &lt;------------------ I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS DLC IF YOU DON'T OWN IT!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nor has http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-us/Promotion/dealoftheweek been updated, it is still showing the GTA4 DLC.</p>

<p>everyone that wants this dlc better buy it this week. i passed up voting on some good deals i wanted just to help ppl get this deal. all three are superb content and absolutely necessary for big fans of ME2</p>
<p>Lair of the Shadow Broker tops Bring Down the Sky and [imo] is the best ME DLC to date. next up, kasumi stolen memories: having kasumi early in any playthru is golden, her mission is fun and her shadow strike is clutch</p>
<p>arrival is ok but if you dont play you might not understand whats goin on when ME3 starts. i still dunno where it fits in my game but stickin it at the end of ME2 works, i prefer to play thru my dlc during the main story line</p>

<p>yeah i just saw this on ign. i would be thrilled if i hadn't just gone on a shopping spree yesterday and picked up the arrival, &nbsp;the firepower pack, and the kestrel pack. had i waited i could have also bought the halo reach defiant map pack on sale.

<p>shouldn't there have been a memo or something that i could have ignored, or was there one and i ignored it?</p>

<p>[/quote]Lol what, and how?<br />
<br />
Lair of the Shadow Broker is considered to be one of if not the best DLC offered for either Mass Effect 2 or Mass Effect 1. That's not just my personal opinion, as of course it is, it's what many others say as well because of what it actually offers in terms
 of story, interaction with a key ME 1 squadmate in Liara, and a much different mission structure and for lack of a better term,
<i>better</i>/<i>different</i> than any other mission in ME 2.<br />
<br />
So I don't see how it can't be worth the discount let alone the full price, the discount is/was a steal.&nbsp; You won't find many on here or elsewhere that would agree with that sentiment that it's not worth it, whereas Arrival, while still decent is nothing but
 a shooting gallery, with minimal story and interaction other than the impending Reaper invasion which we had already known from the ending of ME 2.<br />
<br />

    <title>Unable to move data from one external HDD to another - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to move data from one external HDD to another</h2>
                    <p>I have an external hard drive with around 1TB of work and personal data on it. I wish to copy this to another external drive to serve as back up. I have tried 3 separate windows 10 machines (one brand new and the other 2 working perfectly well in daily use).
 On all of them the same thing happens, that files are recognised and file explorer allows the file transfer process to start. However, transfer speeds are extremely low and crash to 0 before the end of the process. Sometimes the copying process does not even
 begin, the copy window appears and says that it is preparing to transfer, scans to 100% and then disappears without any files having moved. I have tried transferring both folders and individual files and hit the same problem again and again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having spend some time searching online it appears that I am not the first to have come up against this issue, but none of the suggested fixes have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            Have you tried using PowerShell to copy data over?
<br />This is what i use when I need to move\copy large amounts of data.
<br />See link below with examples on how to use this program.

            The same problem is occurring with that, unfortunately. Thank you for your input :) No idea why there is a problem, I have always used file explorer to copy memory sticks and external hard drives previously. Online digging seems to imply it is a windows
 10 issue, and it's true that it's the first time I've had to use machines running windows 10 to do it. Thanks again!

            Break your copy process down to smaller subsets.  Pick folders rather than the root.
<br />ie instead of copy D: to E:
<br />copy d:\folder 1  to E;\folder 1
<br />copy d:\folder 2  to E:\folder 2 
<br />copy d:\ ....
<br />
<br />Try using a CMD window and XCOPY.  Again, break the copy down into chunks using folders rather than whole drive at once.
<br /> Use the /V (verify) parameter.
<br />in the CMD window, use XCOPY /? to see the help for the command.
<br />
<br />In the CMD window you may also want to research using ROBOCOPY.  Again the /? parameter will display the help for the command.
<br />
<br />Both XCOpy and ROBOCOPY are more robust that simple drag and drop in File Explorer.

            If you turn the monitor off and then on again, does that help? Or if you unplug the monitor cable from the system, and plug it back in, does that make any difference? &nbsp;If you wait longer than an hour (say, 4 or 5 hours, or let it go overnight), does it
 eventually complete, with a reboot of Windows?

<h2>            GT 610 driver install fails with Code 43</h2>
                    Hello, I have a GT 610 that I need to set up in Windows 10. I have tried everything I can think of, including using the Nvidia installer and Device Manager, rebooting numerous times, uninstalling in Device Manager before installing the drivers, and dusting
 off my PCIe port and contacts and reseating, all from a clean install of Windows 10. Tell me if there is anything else to try or anything else to list here, and I will try to get back to you.

            I tried Method 1, and it just showed me that it was having problems, which were the same as before. Attempting to run the Nvidia driver installer resulted in it saying that it is not compatible with this version of Windows, which makes sense, as it was
 designed for Windows 10. If there is anything else to try, tell me, although at this point I think it is just an issue with either the drivers or Windows interpreting the drivers.

            <p>I'm in the same wagon than you guys. I've got a GTX780 as my primary card and a GT610 for PhysX. Although the card was working super fine under Windows 8.1 x64 since i updated to Windows 10 it as a constant issue with drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the drivers ever worked either Windows one or the latest from nVidia website. Maybe someday ill do a fresh install of Windows 10 but for now ill keep it like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found that even if you disable Windows update it keeps pushing their graphic drivers, so from that point its hard to clean up the whole thing to diagnose the issue since there is no way i can get rid of all the drivers to get the Microsoft basic one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe a GT610 is kinda obsolete for Windows 10, i had to force nvidia's drivers to work as a&nbsp;physx dedicated card.</p>

            I found my problem, which is that my card had gone bad. I got a new one, the low profile one from MSI, and it worked as it is meant to. Sorry I couldn't help you or @Scyatic, but I hope yours gets solved. I fyou can, though, try getting a new one, as they
 are only $40, and if you have a GTX 780, that has to be something you can afford. Sorry again about my lack of help :/

<h2>            iTunes doesn&#39;t show, play or import CDs</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 64-bit and the latest iTunes v9.0.1.8<br />
<br />
When I insert a CD into my drive, iTunes starts but will not show the CD, nor can I play it or rip the tracks. If I run the diagnostics it says it can find and read the CD, but yet I cannot see or play it. Weirdly, I can burn audio CDs in iTunes with no problem
 at all. I have given iTunes all of its permissions, I've tried it in admin mode, I've also tried reinstalling it. Windows can see the CD fine, as can Windows Media Player and any other audio program but not iTunes.<br />
<br />
I've always had this problem on this computer for some reason, even when I had Vista installed. Please help!

            Hi Meghmala, thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I followed your steps but unfortunately there was no Lower Filters registry entry, so I restarted the PC anyway and iTunes said the registry entry it used to read CDs was missing and to reinstall iTunes, so I completely uninstalled and reinstalled. I did another
 diagnostic check from within iTunes and then it said there was no CD at all, so I also merged the backup.reg back into the registry. That also made no difference and in the end I had to use System Restore. Unfortunately, it seems I'll just have to live with
 the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help anyway.<br />

    <title>Recovery Disc problems with Windows 7 64-bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> btwice80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Disc problems with Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    Two part question:<br />
<br />
1. Is it necessary to boot from the System Repair disc, or is this simply a way to get to the boot and system repair menus in case Windows is so corrupted you can't otherwise access them? I've read things that indicate booting from the disc is mandatory, and
 other things that imply it's just an alternate path to the menus, which I can access the usual way, but when I try to boot from the disc, I don't get the "Press any key..." message that is said to appear; my cpu just starts as always with the "Del: Enter Setup
 F12: Boot Menu" on the lower left. It's not a problem with my optical drive either; it reads and plays discs just fine and the System Repair disc shows as such in the D: drive in Windows.<br />
<br />
2. So I tried reinstalling with my Recovery discs anyway, with the "install from image you made" option from the Advanced Recovery methods... but even when I insert disc 3, it still says "unable to find System Image, insert the final DVD and click retry." I
 tried the 1 and 2 discs as well and get the same message every time. Is it because I can't boot from the System Repair disc, or is it a problem with my Recovery discs?
<br />
<br />
I'm stuck, can't get the darn thing to reinstall and don't want to pay the Geek Squad $130 to do it for me and then have them tell me my discs are faulty or something.<br />
<br />
Note: I've already done the Restore Factory Settings method and it didn't take care of the problem. Geek Squad ran diagnostics and the hardware checked out fine. They said restoring factory settings is not a full reinstall which is why it didn't do the trick,
 and that reinstalling from the Recovery discs should take care of it.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Well its simple enough to do. Download the Win 7 ISO from this link:&nbsp;<span><u><font color="#0066cc">Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit SP1 ISO</font></u></span>&nbsp; . Then using either Windows built in Imaging Tool, or downloading this one from freeware ImgBurn
 - <a href="http://download.cnet.com/ImgBurn/3000-2646_4-10847481.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/ImgBurn/3000-2646_4-10847481.html</a>&nbsp; (use the Direct Download Link only) - convert the ISO file to a Windows 7 DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you've burned the ISO file to a DVD, leave the DVD in the drive and reboot the computer. As it nears the end of the booting screen, press and hold the F12 Key until the Boot Menu screen shows up. Scroll down the list till your CD / DVD drive is listed
 as the first boot device (this is a one time setting), press Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Full Install process will start. I'd recommend you do the upgrade in place option (Repair Install). If successful, you'll have saved all your programs and settings. If your not successful, we'll do the start from a bare bones, freshly formatted computer
 with nothing on it. But at this point, the process is self-explanatory, follow the on-screen prompts, and when asked, enter your Product Key..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Post back here with your results and how&nbsp;you fare.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
