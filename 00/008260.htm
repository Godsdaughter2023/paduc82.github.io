    <title>Outlook 7 won&#39;t read .eml files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 7 won&#39;t read .eml files</h2>
                    
<p>Have Windows 7 (64 Bit), Outlook 2007&nbsp; (12.0.6539.5000) SP2 MSO (12.06545.5004).</p>
<p>I have saved emails (from Incredimail) as a .eml file and then dragged into a folder in outlook 7. When i highlight the email in outlook 7 the preview pane says "this file cannot be previewed as there is no previewer installed for it". When I click to open
 the file, a dialogue box opens and asks whether i want to open or save file. I request open and it comes up with another dialogue box asking if i want to open or save the file&nbsp;- there is also another dialogue box behind this saying 'downloading file' which
 is waiting for me to respond to the other box. When I select open nothing happens. Any advice ? I notice reviewing the support section it talks about activating&nbsp;a hotfix for reading .eml files in Outlook but the instructions only refer to Vista and as it requires
 a registry edit am reluctant to do this if it's not suitable of Win 7.</p>

<p><span>Please take all necessary precautions such as doing back-up of the registry before editing it.</span></p>
<p><span>I got this working with outlook 2007 but I am using Windows 7 so this might not work under XP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The first thing I did was right click on a saved .eml file and associated it with OUTLOOK (which opens a new email with the .eml file as an attachment)</p>
<p>Now on my computer <strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.eml</strong> points to <strong>eml_auto_file</strong> .&nbsp;</p>
<p>I changed <strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\eml_auto_file\shell\read\command</strong> to call<strong>"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\outlook.exe" /eml "%1"</strong> like the other solution above.</p>
<p>Next I created the keys <strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\OUTLOOK_eml.exe\shell\open\command</strong></p>
<p>In the command key set <strong>(default) REG_SZ </strong>value to <strong>"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\outlook.exe" /eml "%1"</strong></p>
<p>open <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.eml\UserChoice</strong></p>
<p>Change <strong>Progid </strong>to <strong>Applications\OUTLOOK_eml.exe</strong></p>
<p>If you get access denied when changing Progid check the permissions on the UserChoice key.&nbsp; There might be a deny flag set which you can unset (I would set it back when you are done).</p>

<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>I have some webpages with drop dow list and textbox and they look fine in my pc browser, but when I use my pda to display the webpages, those drop down list and textbox will auto resize according to the "size" of my text in the
 drop down list and textbox. My pda got windows mobile 5.0 installed. I used another pda with windows CE installed and the drop down list look fine.. so my question is mobile 5.0 or PIE "have problem" with the drop down list and textbox?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cheers</strong></p>

<p>It looks like PIE is just resizing your webpage to fit on your pda's screen. Have&nbsp;you tried the viewing options in IE menu - View. Was the webpage designed with mobile devices in mind?</p>

<p>then, why does not happen in my other pda? with the windows CE installed on it?</p>
<p>I tried the view and almost all the settings in the IE-tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But imagine you have&nbsp;4 drop down list with 10 of weight and all looks "pretty" in your pc browser but when you displayed in your pda, one will have 4 of weight, another with 6 of weight, another with 8 of weight and the last one with 10 of weigth..&nbsp;
 not very nice...</p>

            Windows CE and Windows Mobile are different products. I have no experience at all with Win CE, I think
that IE that it&nbsp;runs is very much different from PIE.

            It seems that you need to write your code to make your page to fit on Pocket PCs. I suggest you try MSDN forums or Windows Mobile engineers blog at http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsmobile. Keep me posted.

    <title>Autosum and copy does not behave as it should - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phildab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autosum and copy does not behave as it should</h2>
                    I have 2 spreadsheets with the same data in. When I autosum a column I can copy the formula along the row to the other columns and in one spreadsheet it works correctly. In the other it copies the value of the autosum in the first column to the other cells
 in the row? I cannot see why one spreadsheet behaves differently from the other.&nbsp; When I check the formula, it appears to be correct. ie if I copy the first sum in column A (A11){with range 5:10 =SUM(A5:A10)} to column E {Cell E11} the formula is =SUM(E5:E10),
 but the value is that of column A? Anyone got any ideas why it should do this. I cannot see what I have done or any difference between the setup of the workbooks.&nbsp;

<p>I created the VBA code below as a work-around.&nbsp; What I can do is go to the Sharepoint page, right-click and select view source, select all, copy to clipboard, and paste within a new Excel worksheet.&nbsp; I run the macro and have a worksheet created with all
 hyperlinks beginning with "http" and "mail". Keep in mind, I am not a programmer and only dabble with VBA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a better way for me to do accomplish the task of finding broken hyperlinks within Sharepoint links lists?&nbsp; If not, is there better VBA code I can use?&nbsp; I tried writing VBA to also include the hyperlink name, but there were too many variations within
 the source code (e.g. &lt;nobr&gt;, &lt;font", etc. all in different locations within HREF). So if I encounter a broken hyperlink, I can simply find the hyperlink within view source and determine the hyperlink name on the Sharepoint site that needs to be updated.</p>

<h2>            Office Professional 2013 install from disk</h2>
                    When I go to install this program from the disk it asks for the product key which I did not receive with the disk.&nbsp; There was a note saying "use the key found in the "Install from a disk" link under the account Options section on the Office My Account

    <title>Word section breals and bullets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill osx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word section breals and bullets</h2>
                    <p>I must declare that I hate word with a passion.&nbsp; I have yet to find a single redeeming feature of the entire thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that every version of word released (at least since the 1990's when I was forced to start using it) never fix a bug these are only ever reinforced.&nbsp; The bits that worked are the ones that get bug introductions.&nbsp; My latest issues (Word for Mac current
 release):</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a string of bullets.&nbsp; I press enter to get the next bullet for the list.&nbsp; Word decides that this bullet should be green (the others in the list being black).&nbsp; I select the bulletted list, choose format select black - still green.&nbsp; I delete the string
 and reinsert.&nbsp; Akll black except the last this remains green.&nbsp; I print to see whether it was just a screen issue. NOPE.&nbsp; I choose format painter doesn't work, I try every vombination of formats (even changing the bullet types and back again.&nbsp; Still Green!</li><li>I insert a section break (next page).&nbsp; I get the section break and two (yes two) Section breaks continuous inserted for free.&nbsp; These cannot subsequently be deleted. If I select these and press delete I remove the section break (next page) and retain the
 two section break continuous that were inserted.&nbsp; Of course when the section break (next page) got deleted word decided to screw up the headers and footers, because every version of word that has ever been written takes the format from the end of the paragraph
 not the start.I do not know why this would be the case but it seems locked in and cannot ever be changed.<br />
</li><li>Every time word releases an update it resets the preferences, so every month you have to reset where you want a graphic inserted or whether you want to select the whole word or not and every other setting.&nbsp; There seems to be no permanent fix for this.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever you do anything in word it seems to take 30 minutes to type and 4 hours to convince word that you know how you wqnt it formatted.</p>

<p>When a single bullet character has a specific color, that color has usually been applied to the paragraph mark of the affected paragraph. To avoid this problem altogether, make use of paragraph styles consistently. To work around the problem after it has
 occurred, remove direct formatting from the paragraph mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, the only time when Word inserts two section breaks is when you add section-level formatting (such as newspaper columns or new margin settings) to a selected text range.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>This question doesn’t have anything to do with scheduling a scan, and having to explain the sorry situation with Microsoft's new method for scheduling a scan is getting&nbsp;pretty old. Any reference to that method is
</span><strong>confusing and </strong><span><strong>counterproductive,</strong> and the page&nbsp;really needs to&nbsp;be taken down. The basic problem is that there's no&nbsp;need at all for adding a trigger to the
</span><em><span>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan</span></em><span> task, because that task is already being&nbsp;triggered&nbsp;daily by&nbsp;<strong>Windows
</strong></span><strong><span>Automatic Maintenance</span></strong><span>. And y</span><span>ou can also schedule
</span><span>Automatic Maintenance</span><span>&nbsp; for a specific hour of the day in the Security Center:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right-click on the Start button &gt; Control Panel &gt; </span>
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Change maintenance settings</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But the </span><span>Automatic Maintenance</span><span> Quick Scan isn’t really designed to run on a schedule; it’s designed to run when you’re not using your computer – in order to prevent the scan from interfering with your work. So if you schedule
 a scan by adding a trigger to the </span><em><span>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan</span></em><span> task, as per the method in the link above, what you’ll actually get is just a&nbsp;scheduled Quick Scan that doesn’t run on schedule, just like the Automatic Maintenance
 scan. But once again, </span><span>Automatic Maintenance</span><span> is already running a daily Quick Scan that doesn’t run on schedule
</span><span>– </span><span>every day of the week – so what’s the point of&nbsp;replicating that scan?&nbsp;Frankly, I think the people that came up with this dandy little ditty for scheduling a scan in Windows 10 either didn’t know how Automatic Maintenance works –
 or were maybe just looking for a way out of actually having to explain how it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want a scheduled scan that actually runs at the scheduled time; and that runs without interruptions; and that also includes options for things like an unattended Full Scan – then this is the method that you'll have to use:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/how-do-i-set-windows-defender-to-a-custom-auto/ec19aab4-10ce-4f41-9990-343056fd104f"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/how-do-i-set-windows-defender-to-a-custom-auto/ec19aab4-10ce-4f41-9990-343056fd104f</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also use this method to schedule a Custom Scan, but that option is only available for the Command Line Interface. There's no&nbsp;option at all for scheduling a Custom Scan or a Full Scan with the Microsoft method.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As for the original question; you would use a Custom Scan when you want to scan specific drives or folders. Just click on the “plus” to expand the drive/folder, and then check the box for each of the folders that you want to scan. There's no option
 for scanning specific files here, but i</span><span>t wasn’t long ago that we witnessed the long-awaited return of the
<strong>right-click context menu </strong>scan for Windows Defender; so now we once again have&nbsp;an easy way to scan&nbsp;a specific file or&nbsp;folder, or&nbsp;group of&nbsp;selected files or folders:</span></p>

<h2>            font size when reading RECEIVED emails is too small - Can we PERMANENTLY change the viewing font size</h2>
                    <p>Using:&nbsp; Windows 7 and Office 2010 Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see this all over the information highway and am checking to see if there is a REAL (and fairly simple) solution to this.</p>
<p>I have a client who has several thousand users and about 90% of those users are saying that the display is too small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is NOT about the Reading Pane.</p>
<p>Open a received email and the font display when reading the received email&nbsp;is too&nbsp;small to comfortably read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users <strong>DO NOT</strong> want to have to press Ctrl +/- or use the wheel on their mouse for
<em>each and every email, </em>as one can imagine<em>.</em></p>
<p>Is there a global way to change this as&nbsp;a SETTING?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I have seen nothing solving this problem on the internet and the consensus seems to be that Microsoft dropped this feature from the Beta version of Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell you that this is a HUGE deal for a lot of people, especially given the resolution of monitors these days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance would be appreciated or I guess at least a confirmation that Microsoft does not have this available for its user population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Why are Symbian &#39;smartphones&#39; not as smart as their - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrianb4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are Symbian &#39;smartphones&#39; not as smart as their predecessors&#63;</h2>
                    I used to have a Nokia 6230i, which I was really pleased with – the operating system (S40) was pretty much a perfected evolution from what I used to have on my 5140, and before that, the 5210. Recently I was offered an 'upgrade' to the 6120 classic, one
 of the newest Symbian S60 'smartphones' (reasons for quotation marks to follow). I took the 6120, lured mainly by the Nokia Maps application.<br />
<br />
Whilst I have been impressed with Nokia Maps and a handful of other applications, I have to say that on the whole the move to Symbian has been a very frustrating one, and now I'm wondering whether I can really be bothered to keep the 6120 just for the sake
 of a few applications. The worst thing is that in general the OS seems to have taken a step backwards from my old phone – incredible really that Nokia have simply ditched so many of the tweaks that they had perfected with the 6230i (and, I understand, the
 6300).<br />
<br />
So I've made a list here of ways in which the new phone is actually much worse than the old one. I'm by no means the first one to spot all of these problems, but I thought I'd list all my problems in one place. Until Nokia sorts these out I shall probably ditch
 the 6120 in favour of a 6300 (I rarely use 3G and never use video calling – it's just too expensive), or maybe a non-Nokia phone altogether. Some of you may not agree with my preferences below, but I think we should at least be given the option to change them
 ourselves. I've been using the latest firmware (3.83) for the 6120, and some of these may not apply to other S60 phones.<br />
<br />
1. You can't have a shortcut to the Inbox! Surely (maybe after Contacts or New message) this would be the most frequently used shortcut ever? It is totally ridiculous that you have to go through Messaging every time. The list of shortcuts is very poor in general
 – other obvious ones missing include:<br />
Active standby – so I could switch it on or off as I need;<br />
Personalisation – so I don't have to go through the whole Settings tree to get to the options I change most frequently;<br />
Alarm clock – you shouldn't have to go through Clock, instead you should be able to get straight to 'New quick alarm';<br />
Network settings – so I can turn 3G on and off as I need it.<br />
<br />
And yet for some reason Nokia think that we need shortcuts to About product, Welcome, Tutorial, Device Manager and Activation keys – hardly features that you use very often! Also the shortcuts list isn't alphabetical – wouldn't this be the easiest way of finding
 the shortcuts you want? Basically the whole system of shortcuts needs sorting out – a much better way of doing it would be to have the ability to make shortcuts to anywhere you want in the menu tree (I think this is how Sony Ericssons work?).<br />
<br />
2. Can only have up to 8 shortcuts – 2 on the selection keys and 6 active standby. The old 'Go to' list could have as many shortcuts as you wanted. Why couldn't we have more active standby shortcuts to scroll though? Or a single shortcut to a 'Go to' submenu/grid
 that we could customise ourselves?<br />
<br />
3. Can't customise Active standby modules – you should be able to remove the calendar and add modules (e.g. Inbox, Contacts) that you use more often (I think you may be able to do this on some other S60 phones?).<br />
<br />
4. Contact searching by last name – when I search for someone's name, I always look by first name. Having additional results show up for last names just means it takes that much longer to find what I'm looking for – we should really be able to turn this off.<br />
<br />
5. Imported contacts put names into last name – most of my contacts are listed by first name only, with a surname only when there are two people with the same first name (surely this is the way most people file their contacts?). So when I import my old contacts,
 it would make much more sense to import names into the first name. Couldn't it also split two-word names into first name and last name?<br />
<br />
6. No option to turn off startup tone – the 6230i had this, so why now does everyone around me need to know when I turn on my phone?<br />
<br />
7. Can't turn off camera shutter sound – another annoying sound you now can't get rid of, even in Silent mode.<br />
<br />
8. Can't set alarm clock snooze interval – on my old 6230i you could change the snooze time, now I'm stuck with it going off every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
9. Can no longer snooze with any button – you could do this on the 6230i, but now you have to make sure you hit the right button (and not Stop by mistake). Not so easy when you've barely woken up.<br />
<br />
10. Can't scroll down to text message details – you used to be able to keep scrolling down after a text message to get the details (such as date &amp; time) but now you have to go through yet another annoying menu.<br />
<br />
11. Can't use number shortcuts in Profile list – you used to be able to use the number buttons to shortcut through your list of profiles. For example, I could just hit Power -&gt; 4 to get to my 'Office' profile, but now I have to scroll through the whole list.<br />
<br />
12. Limited number shortcuts in menus – you can only use the numbers on the keypad to shortcut through to a certain depth of menus. For example, within Phone settings you can't use the numbers to navigate the menus any more.<br />
<br />
13. Only time of last call from a caller is shown in missed/received calls – previously you could go into the Missed calls list, select a caller and go to 'Time of call', which would show you when all the calls were from that person. Now if you want to do this
 you have to go into the Log, find the person you're looking for, and then filter out that number.<br />
<br />
14. Volume button can mute call – previously when you turned the volume down all the way during a call it would go to the lowest voume, useful for when someone is shouting at you down the phone. Now if you do this it mutes the volume entirely, which is a lot
 less useful (depending on whether you actually need to hear what they're shouting!).<br />
<br />
15. No conversions or calculations from standby mode – on the 6230i you could type a number straight in on the main screen (as you would a phone number) and then go Options -&gt; In domestic to do a currency conversion. No sign of this on the 6120.<br />
<br />
16. No countdown timer or stopwatch – I actually used the countdown timer quite often. Now I have Nokia to blame for my burnt pies. :-(<br />
<br />
So come on Nokia, sort it out! Surely it can't be that difficult? And next time, why not pay attention to improvements that have been made so well in other product lines?

            Think of your smartphone as a computer with Windows. You have the option to install all the apps. and programs you need from third parts deverlopers like any other computer.<br />

            As for #5,I thought so too but given the syncing with various PIMS, no-one is 100% sync'ed first time. My entire 500 contacts got reversed first to last name.<br />
<br />
As for 6. You can - turn off warning tones.<br />
<br />
As for 7. Privacy<br />
<br />
As for 11. There is a shortcut to silent profile<br />
<br />
Sill love my 8800. But boy can my N95 be useful!

            You are absolutely right adrianb4. I was surprised how the S60 phones are both as a generic phone and the SMS part of it. It is serious lacking especially when you come from the A200 Sony Ericsson platform (k850).<br />
<br />
I know we have the option to install expensive overpriced applications but where we have no guarantee that it does not slow the whole system down or causes issues.<br />
<br />
But it is NO excuse for Nokia not to get the minimum basics right.<br />
<br />
Must biggest issue is the WAY to small information box when calling, receiving messages etc. It is almost useless. And the whole call log, contacts (adding a street address takes forever) and call information is so lacking it is almost absurd.<br />
<br />
And when there is a number that is used for two different contacts (people CAN live together) it shows no contact information at all when they call from the shared number. Why not pick the first contact like SE? The same goes for using quick dialing where it
 is more focused on showing the number it is going to dial rather than the contact. Again a rather dumb move considering people don't really remember phone numbers anymore (and quite inconsistent with the rest of the interface).<br />
<br />
The ringtone selector - What a nightmare. This is a SMART-phone. Why display all available sound files in one list that does not even support typing the start letter? (And too many songs will simply make sure the list cannot be displayed at all).<br />
<br />
And don't even get me started on texting. My K850 showed me what messages that had been replied, in the sent messages it showed the status of the messages (delivered, failed, awaiting etc.) and of course there was the recently used receiver list. Texting was
 of course with smileys (which is used by EVERYONE these days) and the T9 uses a optional dropdown-list for the alternative word selecting. S60 is so basic even Nokia's own S40 is way ahead even though the platform is "inferior" with less processing power.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am totally surprised to see the mess the whole interface is and the inconsistency that is everywhere. When you are used to SE's feature phones it is really steep step down the ladder.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I have to admit I love all the features of the Smartphone but I have to agree with adrianb4 - Smartphones are not very smart at being phones.

            Strange that author didnt mention the lack of possibility to set Profiles for a deffined time period - the thing that annoyed me most long time ago than I bought my first S60 phone. This feature will be in Symbian ver. 9.3 - WOW Nokia - even my 8310 could
 ve done that seven years ago (and BTW, good thinking about the caller image displaying on the whole screen and not on one square sm - that really impressed me! :) ). However, to be frank - despite that S60 doesnt have some minor tweaks which exists on S40
 or some of them are done differently (after all those are separate platforms which are developing by different Nokia devisions) - any S60 smartphone can do SO much more than any S40 phone, that there is no point to even compare them.

Hi Trentors, I quite agree!!<br />
<br />
I will NEVER see the logic of displaying neither contact when duplicate numbers are found. Either contact will be fine, I don't care which. But not NEITHER!!!

            @marty3, smoketoomuch, v204tmonow – I see what you're getting at – being able to use all these Symbian applications is a Good Thing – but shouldn't it try to be a good phone first? And why not just carry across the great functionality from previous phones?
 I'm also talking about some fundamental problems with the OS that you can't usually sort out by installing applications.<br />
<br />
@valleyforge – Yes you're right, there are a few workarounds for some of these problems, but I'd prefer my phone to be easy to use (and I like having warning tones on, so I know when the battery's about to run out).<br />
<br />
@gordonshowers – Yes that might be a good app, but basically what it amounts to is that now I have to pay a 3rd party developer for basic features that were included on my previous phone for free.<br />
<br />
The reason for my post was not just a pointless whine – these problems could all be easily fixed with some simple firmware updates and then the 6120 would be a fantastic phone. Or maybe the guys working on the S60 phones could try and look at what the rest
 of the company is doing well (e.g. the 6300) in the first place before rushing out another 'smartphone'.

    <title>Audio is sometimes painfully loud when starting a call. How do I stop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaydunlap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio is sometimes painfully loud when starting a call. How do I stop this from happening again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Maybe once in every 7-10 times I place a call (I make skype calls multiple times throughout the day) or when someone calls me, the volume level for just the call will be extremely loud to the point where I have to take my headset off because it actually
 hurts my ears and is overblown. If I am the one making the call, sometimes the ringing sound will have the same problem and I will cancel the call before it starts. Hanging up and making the call again has always solved the problem. But it is happening frequently
 enough that it's really interfering with my skype experience, and with so many other voice and video chat options out there, I'm just ready to be done with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my audio drivers and my volume settings, etc. Even when I quickly turn the computer's volume down very low, the call volume is unbearable. I HAVE to hang up and restart the call. It never randomly happens in the middle of a call, it either
 happens at the start or it doesn't happen at all. It just happened a few minutes ago again, and my head is absolutely pounding. If this happens again, I'm ready to uninstall, so I could really use some help.</p>

<p>More than likely the volume levels are related to something in the Synapse software or drivers automatically adjusting the audio levels. See if you can install the headset with the generic "USB Audio Device" drivers and nothing else. You can also go into
 the enhancements tab of your playback device and disable all enhancements or try out the different options individually to see if it changes anything.

            Thinking you are doing&nbsp;a clean install with a new virtual machine, VMware Player is doing an easy install, and that is not working with 10162 it appears (I have used it on a previous build, and just tried it on 10162 and it failed in the way you described).
 Remove the 'autoinst.flp' floppy disk from floppy disk drive (select the floppy disk to use physical drive or just remove it) and Windows 10 will do a normal install. You will need to answer all the questions yourself but that will let it install.

<h3> beverleyelliott1  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot access my skype accounts &#40;i have 2&#41; both with in credit.  My passwords are not recognised and now I am blocked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good morning</p>
<p>I closed down my email address attached to the 1st skype account and since then (Jan 2018) I have not been able to access using my correct password.</p>
<p>I then created a new Skype account and put credit on it and yesterday I logged out of it and then tried to log back in and it didn't recognise my password and said I have tried too many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have on several occasions since Jan completed the questions to verify who I am and the response has been that I didn't provide enough information that recognises me to my accounts?&nbsp; In my opinion I did so please, what is going on?&nbsp; I have 2 Skype accounts
 both of which I cannot access and both in credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not send me a standard link . I would like a personal answer and reasons why this has happened.</p>
<p>With kind regards</p>
<p>Beverley</p>

<p>Hi Susan</p>
<p>thank you for your message.</p>
<p>I will explain in detail my situation.</p>
<p>My only Skype account (up till Jan 2018) was&nbsp;******** with email;&nbsp; 
****@******.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a monthly renewable subscription (last one was</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><strong>Transaction date:</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Dec 2, 2017<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Order number:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> 8074000004526755397<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Order status:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Delivered&nbsp; )</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I did not renew my domain and therefore no longer have ****@*******.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I also cancelled my direct debit .&nbsp; I then for some reason had to sign in again and it didn't recognise my password which was correct.&nbsp; I then sent several requests to recover my account</span></p>
<p><span>We've received the recovery request for your Microsoft account *****@******. Your issue number is:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>317825890
</span></p>
<p><span>All came back with not sufficient info to activate again.</span></p>
<p><span>I then set up a new Skype account in the name of&nbsp;******** &nbsp;and set up a monthly subscription which has been charged to my bank account.&nbsp; I signed out of it on Sunday to try and re-activate again the&nbsp;********* &nbsp;account and then it made the same error
 not recognising my password.&nbsp; So I tried to recover it and it said my email address was not recognised. The email Microsoft have registered is NOT mine and of course I don't know this unknown one so I was in the same situation as before.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>I then created an account with Microsoft from the link Norman sent me and created Skype name ******* but of course this is brand new and doesn't relate to the 2 previous ones which have a list of contacts and or/subscription attached.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I AM WANTING TO RECOVER BOTH&nbsp;******** &nbsp;AND ******* OR HAVE THEM BOTH TRANSFERRED (ALL DATA) TO MY LASTEST SKYPE ACCOUNT&nbsp; ********
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope all that makes sense.&nbsp; Such inconvenience for myself here particularly as there is a monthly ongoing subscription attached to the account ********.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please help me to finalise so I can get on and use Skype as it is intended and phone those who I need to now contact urgently.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you in advance.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Beverley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the urgency in getting this issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the first account you want to recover, there is nothing we can do unless you were able to verify your identity as the real owner of the account. Even if the original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the
 account originally. <em>(There is no limit on the number of times you can submit the recovery form).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Kindly consider below tips when answering the
</span></span><span><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">"Recover your Microsoft account"&nbsp;</span></span></a></span><span><span>form.
 This has helped my previous customers:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<span>Fill out the form from a computer and from a location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where the previous successful sign-in occurred.</span></li><li>
<span>Make sure that you use an alternate email address that you have access with in order to receive the security code and not the email address of the account you want to recover.</span></li><li>
<span>The 4 basic information <em>(First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity).</em></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge. You don't need to fill out everything,
 but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity -
<strong>as long as it matches the system.</strong></span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With regards to your newly created account, were you able to received a confirmation email from Skype that you have purchased a new calling subscription? Also, were you able to view the said purchased from your Purchase history?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you! I look forward to your response.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Morning Susan</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Re my&nbsp;************* &nbsp;account. I cannot believe that there isn't a human override to the standard computer response.&nbsp; I can clearly justify that I am the owner. Isnt there a department that I can contact re this?&nbsp; I saw there was a chat online option however
 it came up with an error when I was waiting for a response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding my second new account ************* I didn't receive a Skype confirmation re my payment. I saw the subscription had been taken from my bank account.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if the purchase was shown in my purchase history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I await your response and thank you for your time and effort.</p>
<p>regards</p>

<h2>            Kin 2 and Zune- sync from phone to computer quit working. Please HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Kin 2.&nbsp; I use the Zune software sync pics, videos, and music between my phone and computer. Recently the sync from my phone to computer quit working. The sync from my computer to my phone still works. Zune does not have contact support by phone
 but I did a live chat tonight and they said Zune dose not support this phone. Well, why did I get this free Zune trial with my phone if my phone is not supported by the company? Besides the point I guess. I just feel like this is an issue that could be fixed
 because it all of a sudden quit working. With Zune saying they can't help me, I don't know what to do. Should I try to redownload the Zune software, risking losing all the pics and videos I have on my page? (i think i have them all backed up in My Pics file
 on my desktop)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

            I don't have a Kin and don't know anything about the device, but if the Zune software is syncing data to the Kin, but the Kin isn't sync data back to your computer, then it sounds to me like the problem is with the Kin and not so much with the Zune software
 on your computer.&nbsp; I think the first thing I would try is resetting the Kin to factory settings to see if this restores the syncing functionality back to the device.&nbsp; If you factory reset the device, you will lose any data on the device that has not been synced
 to the computer.<br />

<h2>            Why do excel pop up windows open in the background on OS X Yosemite&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I password protect a lot of excel documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open a PW protected file, the dialog box asking for the password or asking if I want to open the file read only opens behind other open applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I end up having to minimize everything to find it...super annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how I fix this?</p>

I've seen this issue resolved for Excel on windows either by turning off your preview pane or by opening the file from within Excel app. You could probably try the same.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Tisky,</p>
<p>Thanks for the info.</p>
<p>I have the same problem as Brad. &nbsp;We are using Sharepoint Online, and I am trying to make site templates so I can use / reuse them. &nbsp;I created the template via Save Library as Template, as I don't seem to have the Save Site as Template (maybe you can help
 me figure out why that is). &nbsp;Under main site, Web Gallery, Solutions, I see the template I want to use, as I have uploaded the STP file... but the Activate button is 'faint', ie. not available. &nbsp;It says it's disabled. &nbsp;I am the site owner.. and inherited this
 Sharepoint site from vendors. &nbsp;How do I turn on the Activate function.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to do is create a subsite/site. &nbsp;Save it as a template then use it when creating a similar site. &nbsp;I have about 35 sites to create!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Purnima Oza</p>

            Hey there Sailor (sorry, I couldn't resist)...

My name is Ron.

Your "license key" is officially called the "Product Key". The HUP is just a special way of purchasing the product key.  The actual install is the same no matter how you do the purchase. 

Since you have the key, you will log in to the MyAccount site, and submit your product key there to activate the license. Then you will start the install, also from myaccount. 

Here is the HUP FAQ page that gives you a high level over view:
https://www.microsofthup.com/hupca/faq.aspx?dwnldinfo=true 

Here are the detailed MS instructions for activating a subscription and installing:

                    <p>I have windows 8.1 and for some time now my internet explorer tile has been gone, also the entire app appeared to disappear, the only way I could open the app rather than the desktop version was to open a link from mail, I went in to a remote control session
 with a Microsoft support member who tried a few things and then created a new account on my computer, in this account the internet explorer app was there, is there anyway I can bring the app from that account to my main one?</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice but it's the windows 8 app that has disappeared from my account, not the desktop version. If I make a new account on my computer the app is on that profile but not mine, anyway I can copy it from that account to mine?

<h2>            Outlook Account &#47; Custom Domain &#47; Email in ios7 &#47; Unable to verify account information</h2>
                    <p>I am using outlook.com with a custom domain through live.com. &nbsp; I understand that new domains (now) and new accounts in currently registered domains (in July) will no longer be permitted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that when I try to link an outlook.com account using the ios7 (iphone 5) e-mail client, I simply get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Outlook Account"</p>
<p>"Unable to verify account information"</p>
<p>
</p><p>My user name is of the form "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", &nbsp;not "@outlook.com"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried on mutliple ios7 devices (3 different iphones and an iPad) in order to rule out a device-specific problem. &nbsp;This error occurs regardless of the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also happen to have an outlook account that is of the form "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". &nbsp; For this account, I was able to access the account with the ios7 e-mail client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to access the problematic account at outlook.com using a web-browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I do have 3 accounts that are of the form "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" that are successfully operating in the ios7 e-mail client. &nbsp;Those account were linked about 5 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using the 2-step verification in the problematic account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>

            I am having the exact same issues. &nbsp;I have about 5 custom domains all with emails successfully syncing with ios. &nbsp;I was attempting to add a new one for an employee and I cannot get outlook.com to verify the account. &nbsp;I have tried setting up two step verification,
 changing passwords, etc.

            <p><span>Hi StevieT&amp;A,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you're having issues setting up an Outlook.com email account on your device. We're sorry for the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Newly created accounts will be limited. Some features may not be accessible to new accounts as stated&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/features-turned-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, ensure that the account has tried accessing Outlook.com at least once otherwise, what you've created is just &nbsp;a Microsoft Account without a mailbox.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This has something to do with account reputation. As these accounts are used regularly and in accordance with our Terms of Use, the reputation will build up overtime unlocking features enjoyed by old Outlook.com accounts. Verifying the accounts through
 SMS may speed this up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Should you have further/other concern, please let us know.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>The account still won't verify using the ios7 e-mail client.&nbsp; It seems unlikely that this issue will be resolved by just waiting and using the account for a while.&nbsp; The account has been in regular use for over 3 weeks now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is something else going on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>StevieT&amp;A:&nbsp; were you able to successfully validate using the ios e-mail client?</p>

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned by Joey on his post, you may have to verify the new accounts through SMS to increase their reputation. Please go to https://sms.live.com to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the issue would still persist after doing so.</p>
<p>

The problem seems to be caused by the user not being given the opportunity to accept the MS Terms and Conditions.</p>

The following worked login to Outlook.com webmail, and attempt to go to OneDrive, I had to click on the

            <p>Hi RAMESHG.R,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with additional information which is essential to our investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the challenge you are having in verifying your account but let me assist you with your concern. I was able to verify that the account you&nbsp;have provided does not exist in our database. Please check if it was not mistyped. If you are sure of the
 Microsoft account the it is possible that your account has been already inactive. The account will be removed if it has been inactive for 365 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further investigate the issue, please answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When was the last time you were able to access your account?</li><li>Are you signing in on Outlook.com web based mail or email client like Windows Live Mail or Microsoft Outlook Mail Client when you last accessed your account successfully?</li><li>Were there any attempts of changing the primary email/alias or closure of the account or changes in the account settings before the incident?</li><li>Have you tried to register the same email address? If so and you're unsuccessful, please provide the exact error message that you are getting.</li></ul>
<p>We are looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Apologies for the delayed response.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer the following question so that we can help you.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does the issue occur when you use a different&nbsp;computer or browser?</span></li><li><span>Do other Microsoft accounts encounter the same issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>One of the possible reasons why you are encountering this problem is that there are corrupted cache/cookies/browsing history stored in your browser. As an initial troubleshooting step, we recommend that you clear your browser's cache/cookies/browsing
 history.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let’s try to clear them using the following steps:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>For&nbsp;<strong>Internet&nbsp;Explorer</strong>:&nbsp;Press&nbsp;<strong>CTRL+SHIFT+DEL</strong>&nbsp;simultaneously and click&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>.</span></li><li><span>For&nbsp;<strong>Google Chrome</strong>:&nbsp;Press&nbsp;<strong>CTRL+SHIFT+DEL</strong>&nbsp;simultaneously and click&nbsp;<strong>Clear Browsing Data</strong>.</span></li><li><span>For&nbsp;<strong>Firefox</strong>:&nbsp;Press&nbsp;<strong>CTRL+SHIFT+DEL</strong>&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Clear Now.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>(other browsers are similar)</span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>If you are using Internet Explorer (IE), you may need to&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">run it in “No Add-Ons” mode</span></a></strong>.&nbsp;This
 will totally eliminate the idea that the performance problems and errors you are experiencing is not due to your browser.</span></span></p>
