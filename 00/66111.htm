    <title>Very high CPU utilization due to werfault.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> googol_plex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very high CPU utilization due to werfault.exe</h2>
                    
<p>My machine is extremely slow because of werfault.exe.&nbsp; Task Manager shows the CPU utilization at 100% all the time.&nbsp; The Processes tab shows 2-3 instances of werfault.exe using up all CPU resources.&nbsp; This continues indefinitely and a reboot does not fix
 it.&nbsp; The only way that I've been able to make my computer usable is by stopping the Windows Error Reporting service.&nbsp; However, I am concerned that this merely eliminated a symptom and not the real underlying problem.</p>
<p>I also encounter very high disk activity.&nbsp; I disable "Run on a schedule" in Disk Fragmenter (after I had done a full defrag) and I also eliminated Super Fetch.&nbsp; It did reduce disk activity significantly, but there are still occassions where the hard drive
 gets very busy and I cannot see any reason for it.</p>

<p>You go into "Services" to disable werfault.exe.&nbsp; Click on the Windows button or whatever it is called in Vista (the thing that replaced the XP "Start" button).&nbsp; Enter "Admin Tools" in the Search box.&nbsp; Right-click on "Services" and then click "Run as Administrator".&nbsp;
 After "Services" opens, look for "Windows Error Reporting Service".&nbsp; Double-click it and then you can stop it and disable it.</p>
<p>I am not having any luck with this either.&nbsp; Right now as I type this, there are 2 instances of werfault.exe&nbsp;running and each consuming more than 40% utilization.&nbsp; "Problem Reports and Solutions" shows nothing.</p>
<p>This started shortly after I had installed Vista.&nbsp; I had not even completed installing all applications - perhaps it started after I installed SP2.</p>
<p>I think that I am going to reinstall Vista.&nbsp; If the problem returns, I'll have to go back to XP.</p>

<p>and to prevent people from contacting your son please change the privacy settings via this link: <a href="https://account.xbox.com/Settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.xbox.com/Settings</a> you can set up that only friends are allowed to message your son.</p>

            Hi Nipuni.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Community Forum.<br />

The microphone plug is next to where you plug you headphones or external speakers into you r machine.&nbsp; Usually on the back of the tower for a PC and on the left side for a laptop.<br />

Thank you,<br />

<h2>            Homegroup and Sharing Problems after Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I just installed Win 10 on 4 PC's which were in a HomeGroup before Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three of the PC's still share folders amongst themselves, however, one (PC4) has problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to connect another PC into PC4 homegroup, as that was where te HomeGroup was initially created. It tells me that the
</p>
<p>HomeGroup was created on PC4, but cannot find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to connect PC4 into its HomeGroup, but it tells me it cannot find the HomeGroup. Then it can find, then it cannot,...etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried sharing the root of PC4's C:\ drive, it asks for my Network Credentials, but whatever I try, it always tells me I entered an invalid id or password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really&nbsp;need this fixing ASAP as I am currently unable to backup PC4...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can offer.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I ran the trouble shooter although I had already tried it, it told me it does not know what the problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on the webpage you sent me&nbsp;for more information&nbsp;came up with a message that it was for windows 8...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think we have two problems here, first, the HomeGroup on the PC4 node seems to be broken.&nbsp; The other three PC's still try to connect to the HomeGroup on the 4th PC, but cannot find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing the HomeGroup, from that PC, but it still tries to go out and tries to connect to join&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem, which may be connected to the first, is that I am trying to share the root on Drive C:/ of PC4, it asks me for my credentials, I tried various combinations of userid/password, but none of them seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this is a problem that could be fixed by Microsoft Online?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some serious help on this one, as I am unable to run my backups across the network to my backup PC.</p>
<p>The problem is that I had four PC's in a HomeGroup. Then I upgraded all four PC's to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the HomeGroup will not work. If I try to join a homegroup, it tells me that there is a HomeGroup on the PC where it was before the upgrade. So, it tells me to join that one, and I try, it thinks about it for 5 minutes, then asks for the HomeGroup password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I give it the password, and it thinks about it for a further 5 minutes, after which it tells me there is no HomeGroup on that PC and I should create one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is, when I try to create one, it thinks it can still use the original HomeGroup, and so starts looking for it again....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the basic stuff, like TroubleShooters, which cannot seem to find anything wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to share the root directory of the PC that used to own the HomeGroup, and that is unsuccessful too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get rid of this broken HomeGroup and create another, possibly on another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bryan.</p>

            I have identical problems after installing Windows 10 on two PCs, a laptop and desktop. The desktop believes a HomeGroup exists on the laptop but the previous password does not work. The laptop recognises no HomeGroup. I cannot delete the HomeGroup to
 start again and troubleshooters reveal nothing (I don't recall one ever being of help at all). I synchronise certain files between the two machines and this no longer works.

            <p>OK, mostly by good luck, I have partially fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to create the HomeGroup on my laptop. I received a message that a HomeGroup could not be created on a laptop, but it would create it on another PC in the Group. And, it did, I was really surprised when it popped up with a new HomeGroup password.&nbsp;
 So, I joined the other 3 PC's into the HomeGroup, and it mostly worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I just have one problem - when I try to connect to&nbsp;a couple of folders on what was the original HomeGroup host, I get a pop-up dialog:
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Enter Network Credentials</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Enter your credentials to connect to 'user'</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>password</strong></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>domain</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Where "<em>domain</em>" is the domain name I am trying to connect from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody tell me what credentials these are, because whatever I enter gets rejected.</p>

 for weeks now and I just don't understand. The problem is that my Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface driver is not showing up.

<h2>            Corel WinDVD Pro 11</h2>
                    <p>I hoping someone can help me out. I have a Surface pro 2 and I attempted to install Corel WinDVD Pro 11 on it.... I say attempted because it took several tries before it would even install and now that it is installed&nbsp;its not functioning properly. I'm able
 to open the application and play a DVD but that is it. I can not play a BluRay (media not supported) or a VOB file (Application crashes).</p>
<p>I reached out to Corel's help desk and was told that WinDVD would not work on a Surface Pro because it is a tablet... yet I've found other articles (some here) that state the opposite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any idea's/suggestions I'd really appreciate it. I bought WinDVD because I'm away from home a lot and its more convenient to travel with VOBs than discs.</p>
<p>Thanks!!!!</p>

            <p>That program is a resource hog "big time".&nbsp; So is CyberLink's PowerDVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of these programs are poorly written even though they work on desktops and laptops.&nbsp; That is the real reason why WinDVD won't work.&nbsp; It also installs a bunch of junk that runs at the same time and kills some of the performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a program called VLC which you can download from <a href="http://www.videolan.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Finding a Homegroup Password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> explengineer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Finding a Homegroup Password</h2>
                    <p>All of the instructions that I seem to be able to find in reference to View (find) the password for a Homegroup give me instructions such as "1. Click Start &amp; then click Control Panel"; "2. Click Network and Internet and then click HomeGroup"; 3. View or
 print the homegroup password" HOWEVER. when I do as instructed in #2, THERE IS NO SUCH OPTION AS "VIEW OR PRINT HOMEGROUP PASSWORD" so that answer is essentially useless on the computer on which the homegroup was created, OS=Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW can I RECOVER THE PASSWORD AND PRINT IT on the computer that created the HomeGroup if the location indicated in the instruction does not exist, e.g. there is no "VIEW OR PRINT on the screen that appears after following Steps #1 &amp; #2, which sends me to
 the screen on which I am supposed to find the correct place to "click" but that location DOES NOT EXIST on that computer?</p>

<h2>            My Mail App in Windows 10 has stopped working.</h2>
                    My mail app in Windows 10 has suddenIy stopped working. I can access my email account but have not been able to receive/send emails since 9th October. My wife (who uses the same laptop) cannot even get into her emails. I&nbsp;contacted Microsoft Support for
 advice and was told&nbsp;that&nbsp;our laptop needed to be 'cleaned'. They said that this would, initially, cost&nbsp;us £50 and that&nbsp;we could pay extra to take annual cover with them for any future problems. Is this standard practice with Microsoft? All&nbsp;we want is to be
 able to&nbsp;use our&nbsp;Mail Apps!

            <p>Why so difficult?</p>
<p>And why go through the several pages of all apps info when you don't actually&nbsp;use it at all in step 4 of sol. #2?</p>
<p>

</p><p><em>For&nbsp;all 60-plus&nbsp;apps in Get-AppxPackage do register microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps

<p>The first three possibilities to consider are all hardware problems: a problem either with the monitor and the video graphics card, or a loose video cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First make sure the monitor cable is firmly attached at both ends. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't fix the problem, borrow a monitor form a friend and replace your faulty one with it. If that fixes the problem, your monitor is bad and you should buy a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't fix the problem, try your monitor of a friend's computer. If the results are the same on his computer, you need to buy a new video card.

    <title>hardware raid without dynamic disks and &#62;2TB support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> an-engineer  say:</h3>
<h2>            hardware raid without dynamic disks and &#62;2TB support</h2>
                    one of the problems with windows' NTFS is that it cannot handle partitions over 2TB. &nbsp;<br />
I wish microsoft would fix that. &nbsp;<br />
it is so ridiculous, especially since we are at the 2TB drive point right now, and disk manufacturers are probably chomping at the bit.<br />
I mean using hardware raid and not using dynamic disks.<br />
<br />
I think it's time we had a serious OS, don't you think?&nbsp; 2TB limit tells me windows is not a serious OS.<br />
<br />
plus, people are losing their data thanks to dynamic disks (microsoft software RAID).&nbsp; like my friend, and other folk.<br />
this happens when stuff happens like they have to reformat their OS drive. <br />
(but their RAID drives are still supposedly intact, well they aren't anymore).<br />
<br />
a real hardware RAID solution would solve this.&nbsp; something where the card manages hot plug drive insertion (oiptional) and array rebuilding.&nbsp; things like, you tell it you have a new replacement disk, and it preps it.<br />
and the hardware tells you of a failure and manages it for you (and doesn't leave it up to windows).<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember nice things like this about the old Mylex RAID controllers.&nbsp; stuff like this ought to be brought back.<br />
<br />
I would like to see this for XP and 8 as well as 7.<br />

            <blockquote>one of the problems with windows' NTFS is that it cannot handle partitions over 2TB. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
The NTFS limit is 256TB. <br />
<br />
You can install 64 bit Windows 7, Windows 8, and Vista on a partition larger then 2TB.<br />
<br />
2TB is the limit of the hard drive MBR, not Windows limit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s possible to boot from a 3TB+ hard drive with a ﻿GUID Partition Table (GPT) if you have 64 bit Windows 7 and a computer that supports UEFI.<br />
<br />
﻿It’s also possible to use the entire 3TB+ for storage, but you need hardware that supports it. You can find more info below.<br />

<br />
Both Windows and NTFS do not have a 2TB limit, so apparently Windows is a serious OS.<br />

<h2>            Flixster movies on Surface</h2>
                    So I have dozens of digital copies of movies on Flixster that I would love to be able to watch via the flixster app or download and save them to watch when I don't have an internet connection. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However at this time when I have an ultraviolet digital copy I can't connect that to my Xbox video account, and the Flixster app for Windows 8 doesn't support streaming or downloading movies that are in my collection yet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions or idea of when MS or Flixster are going to get this issue resolved? &nbsp;It sure would make the device appealing to more users if it did this.</div>
                </div>

There is a Flixster app, but it still will only allow for streaming of movies in your collection, there is no download option yet. &nbsp;It can be done on the Pro via their website but not via the app.

<p>I am totally new to Xbox...I don't understand how much things cost.&nbsp; I am interested in Pinball FX2 and it displays that it costs 800 Somethings ? of a symbol after the number 800?&nbsp; It also says no refunds. Is this 800 dollars, or 800 thousand...nothing
 is clear. is this for all of the tables in the game or just the one? Is this good forever or a week or month of use? I don't find this explained anywhere, where would you look to understand this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&

<p>The symbol you see stands for Microsoft Points. So it would be 800 points. Everything you purchase is yours forever, or as long as you have the account and can use the content, it's not a monthly fee.
</p>
<p>I believe for Pinball FX2, what you're seeing for 800 points is actually considered an add-on. Add-ons require the actual game in order to be played. In the case of this game, Pinball FX2 is free to download, but the tables (the add-ons) are what you would
 pay for. </p>
<p>I hope that makes sense. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.</p>

<p>Microsoft sells most downloads on Xbox Live in points called Microsoft Points.&nbsp; Points are available in various denominations and are valued slightly differently depending on your region.&nbsp; So, 800 points is about $10, USD £6.80 in GPB or €9.30 in Euros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you purchase a download from Xbox Live it is yours for good and can be deleted and downloaded again at no extra cost as long as you keep the same account.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update has broken my laptop. Error 0xc000014c</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought I'd try this new great free Windows 10 upgrade on my lovely working laptop. Unfortunately all it has done is broken it. All I get now is a blue screen with the error code 0xc000014c and the message the boot configuration data for your PC is
 missing or contains errors. I can't even press F8 to enter the Advanced boot options to restore factory defaults for some reason. I've spoken to the support team twice and they couldn't help. I've been trying to sort this all day and with the help of the support
 team I haven't gotten anywhere. So what now Microsoft!? I can honestly say that if I don't receive some support from someone who actually knows what they're doing I will avoid Microsoft products in the future like the plague.</p>

<h3> sdelay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello and PIN sign-in both &#34;locked for security reasons&#34; on Surface Book</h2>
                    <p>When I restart or wake-up, instead of getting the normal Windows Hello sign-in process I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows couldn't sign you in.</p>
<p>This sign-in option has been locked for security reasons. Use a different sign-in option or connect your device to a power source for at least two hours, then restart it to try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a similar result using my PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sign in successfully with my Microsoft account and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried following some advice elsewhere to delete the PIN, reboot and then re-set it up. But it gets as far as me putting it in the new PIN and then just does nothing, reverting back to the add new PIN option. I've also tried changing my account to a local
 account and setting up the PIN there but again, it does not register.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In effect my problem has become "My Surface Book won;t let me set up a new PIN". But I;ve tries all the standard solutions for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As background - my machine is fully updated and the big Windows 10 update was successfully done a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only slightly unusual thing preceding the problem was that yesterday I was using the machine on battery power and it ran down to about 20 minutes left. I then hibernated it and plugged it in. The problem started when I first started to use the machine
 this morning</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is fully charged up and there are no signs of over-heating and the Reliability Monitor shows no problems in the relevant period.</p>

            <p>there aren't alot of folks reporting this - but there are scattered reports. If DISM restorehealth didn't get this fix, I'm guessing that only a reimage will possibly resolve. I know that the nuclear option isn't what folks want to hear, but...<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<h2>            Slow start and buggy performance with Windows Vista Ultimate 32 bit</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am at a loss as to what is wrong with my personal PC. I have been running Vista for 3 years with no problems. &nbsp;The only I had in these 3 years is would occaisionally not detect my DVD drive.</p>
<p>Around the beginning of December it started to act a bit strange. &nbsp;Coincidentally, it seems to have started when I installed whatever windows updates were available at the time. Here is a list of it's symptoms in the past month:</p>
<p>1. When taken out of sleep mode I have gotten a blue screen about 3 times</p>
<p>2. The start-up of windows has become painfully slow. Once even taking 45minutes to get to the sign-on screen. &nbsp;This is every time I start my machine.</p>
<p>3. On a few&nbsp;occasions&nbsp;windows fails to start and I had to dig up my installation disc to even boot.</p>
<p>My steps to cure this started w/ doings some thorough virus scanning, even though I had a pretty liable program in Avast for some time now. &nbsp;I also attempted to&nbsp;restore&nbsp;my PC to an earlier date, and now it seems to be slower and hung up in a loop about windows
 updates. Every time I restart/shutdown I get the Vista screen that says it's installing/initializing updates. &nbsp;This can't be the case - but none have been downloaded. &nbsp;This happens on every restart/shutdown.</p>
<p>Ever since I restored, I also can't get windows update to work. It shows me updates, but none will download. I went to the support website and downloaded them manually, but the standalone installer won't work either. It just churns and churns...</p>
<p>Also, since the restore, I can't uninstall any of my programs. I barely have any programs as it is, but I was just trying to create as clean as slate as possible during this&nbsp;troubleshooting, but I can't. It just does nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have downloaded and installed a new antivirus (AVG) just to be extra thorough and it shows nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>This leaves me with something is buggy with windows, my registry, or some other sort of conflict.</p>
<p>As for windows update in general - it had never prompted me to download SP1, so I didn't know it existed. Not until I received the first blue screen a little of the month ago did I get a windows suggestion to download it. Of course, I can't install it. I
 have it downloaded on my desktop manually (the huge 435MB file), but can only look at the pretty icon.</p>
<p>SIGH</p>
<p>Any ideas or suggestions?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Keep Avast and ditch the AVG.<br />
<br />
You are only running one antivirus right? More than one will interfere with each other and cause<br />
strange issues. Added AVG has been causing a lot of issues lately so I would uninstall it and run<br />
the AVG Removal Tool to prevent remnants which can also cause strange issues. If you have or<br />
had others on the computer, even if uninstalled, check their makers' sites for Removal Tools or<br />
for special instructions. Below are recommendations to use while testing, even better permanently.<br />
<br />
AVG Removal Tools<br />

<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>Thank you Rob.</p>
<p>Correct - AVG wasn't installed until well after my issues began. AVAST is no longer on my machine. AVAST was the only program installed when everything went south. I honestly don't believe it's the AV. I think my problem is with Vista. I don't get any of
 the buggy issues that viruses bring - this is strictly performance of Windows.</p>
<p>Thank you for the SP1 links. I have reviewed most of them before. I noticed that it stated SP1 would appear in my automatic updates<strong>&nbsp;only if&nbsp;</strong>I had every necessary update it needed installed prior to it's release. I am wondering if there is
 a random update I still need before I can even install SP1. Considering my machine was custom made only about a month or two before SP1's release in March 08, I find it hard to believe my PC wasn't ready for it.</p>
<p>I looked back into my update history and noticed a few failed automatic updates - should I try to download these manually and attempt to reinstall? I am in a bit of a catch-22 b/c my standalone installer doesn't work either.</p>
<p>I will review many, if not all, of the links you provided tonight. I appreciate the information.</p>
<p>I am very tempted to reinstall windows and start over. This mystery/puzzle has been exhausting.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I understand the issue was present when you installed AVG however AVG is likely to make the issue<br />
worse as it is known to cause the same type of issues. If you remove the AVG try installing SP1 before<br />
you add the Avast back. <br />
<br />
Try downloading the updates and re-download SP1 and make sure its the correct version for your<br />
system.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Use the methods in the previous troubleshooters to try to correct the system issues.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
If needed try a InPlace Upgrade/Repair Installation which allows you to keep the programs and data<br />
though redundant backups are always a good idea.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key. It has to be the same 32 or 64 BIT OEM version of Vista. Also the System<br />
maker will usually sell the disk cheap since you already own Windows. Be sure to do a<br />
good backup or 3 (safety in redundancy).</p>
<p>In-Place Upgrade<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Well I did quite a few things last night with attempting to diagnose what is going on...</p>
<p>I started with a clean boot which resulted in an hour of waiting for the logon screen...then a bluescreen, restart and logon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I did the sfc /scannow. It started and told me it would take awhile and then quickly said it couldn't continue b/c a repair was in process and to restart and try again. I did this 3 times with no success.</p>
<p>Finally, I started in safe mode today to remove a few programs (hopefully) and received an error that my installer is not correctly installed. I'm not sure when/how that could have happened. I guess it explains why nothing has downloaded/updated in the past
 few weeks.</p>
<p>I am patiently working with someone in support as well but don't get a response from him for 36hrs or so with each string...I have send him my msinfo32 info and am awaiting his reply.</p>
<p>I am tabling the SP1 install 1. because my installer doesn't work and 2. b/c if I installed it my original vista disc wouldn't work to do a repair install since it doesn't have the sp1.&nbsp; That way, if a reinstall turns out to be only option - I still can.</p>
<p>Thanks for your ideas and help.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The System Maker will usually sell the Windows Installation Media cheap since you already own<br />
Windows. That will allow you to do a CLEAN install which wipes everything off the drive and then<br />
whether you had SP1 or not would not be an issue.<br />
<br />
You have a Recovery Disk it seems and a Repair Disk will allow other options when repairing<br />
Windows.<br />

<p>Actually all I have are the original installation discs (both 32 and 64 bit).</p>
<p>I will have to do a repair installation, but am unsure how. I started the install yesterday, but backed out when it appeared it was doing the full install and I would lose everything. Hopefully I just prematurely exited the install before I got to the screen
 that gave me the repair option. I am assuming I can do the repair from my installation disc.</p>
<p>Do you have any useful links for doing the repair from the installation disc? Screenshots would help so I know I'm doing this correctly.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Here are the steps from MS tech to fix my corruption issue. I guess I don't need any screenshots.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In-place Upgrade</span></p>
<p><span>=============</span></p>
<p><span>1. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Start and choose Computer.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Please find the "setup.exe" file in the DVD-ROM and double click it.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Install now.</span></p>
<p><span>5. When we are prompted to input the product key, please click Next without inputting any key. The setup wizard will prompt and ask if you agree to install Windows Vista without the key. Please
 choose to confirm.</span></p>
<p><span>6. When you reach the "Which type of installation do you want" screen, click Upgrade to upgrade the system files of Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: While performing the In-place Upgrade, the system will restart automatically (several times) to merge the files and programs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please leave the computer alone and do not configure it until In-place Upgrade is completed. The system will start Windows Vista once it is upgraded.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the In-place Upgrade finishes, please check the original issue again.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Notice the InPlace Upgrade and Repair Installation links in the reply above.<br />
<br />
The instructions you were given are essentially correct for doing an inplace upgrade.<br />
<br />
If you ever need to run StartUp Repair you can use either a true Windows Installation Disk<br />
or a Repair Disk and the methods are in the troubleshooter below.<br />
<br />
=============================================================<br />
<br />
These are if you ever need to run them and not to do instead of the InPlace Upgrade/Repair<br />
Installation which seems to be the right course now.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do<br />
not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also<br />
your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Try StartUp Repair from Recovery Options and/or a Vista disk.<br />

<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can try System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

            Thanks again.... Sure enough once I got home to start this project my pc would not load Windows anymore. Can I try to load it from my dvd drive? Also what may I need to reinstall or redirect on my system once I hopefully get this started. There goes my
 idea of taking several screenshots of my settings before doing the repair. Oh well. Thank u.

<h2>            Says im always in a party but im not....</h2>
                    
<p>I dont really know which category this belonged in, so I put it here. Anyways, the issue is, for the past 4 or 5 months, it always says im in a party, even when im not. The little icon with three people that indicates that someone is in a party, is always
 next to my name according to all of my friends, regardless of whether or not im actually in a party. Its sort of a small issue, but its annoying because people wont invite me because they think im already playing with someone. If im not in a party, the "join
 party" option will just stay grayed out as if its on invite only or whatever. It works just fine if im actually in a joinable party. Its just that, when im not, the icon is still there. And this has been going on both before and after the New Xbox One Experience.
 Before the NXOE, it would always say I was in a party with one particular friend 24/7. And Ive hard reset my console, ive re-installed my profile more than once, and Ive even factory reset twice (not all with the intention of getting rid of this issue, its
 just happened). So im just wondering what could be causing this and/or if I can fix this.&nbsp;</p>
