                    <p><span>Original Title: Blue Screen Of Death</span></p>
<p><span>Hello,<br />
<br />
Im having quite alot of trouble with my computer at the moment, Everytime i try and install something or download something or even run a virus scan i get the BSOD. I get different blue screens such as sometimes ill get IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PFN_LIST_Corrupt
 or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NON_PAGED_AREA. These are really starting to become quite annoying now. Ive done a memory ram test using Memtest86+. I left it over night and it passed with no errors so it cant be the RAM. My computer specs are&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Windows XP Professional&nbsp;<br />
Service Pack 3&nbsp;<br />
AMD Athlon XP 2400+ 2Ghz<br />
1GB of RAM (Brand New)<br />
PNY Nvidia GeForce 6200 (512MB) With the latest drivers from the Nvidia website<br />
ASRock K7S8X Motherboard<br />
<br />
I hope that is enough info, If you need any more info on the computer please let me know and ill do my best to find it out,<br />
<br />
Thanks In Advance,</span></p>

<p><span>You have given us a general indication of the nature of the problem but specific error reports make finding a solution so much easier.</span></p>
<p><span>When a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) system failure occurs for most users there is insufficient time to note down in full what it says; the exact
 text is important to anyone trying to diagnose what is wrong. You can gain the time needed when the error next occurs by following the procedure described below.</span></p>
<p><span>If you haven't done so already disable automatic restart on system failure. This should help by allowing time to write down the Stop Error code
 and related information properly. Right click on the My Computer icon on the Desktop and select Properties, Advanced, Start-Up and Recovery, System Failure and uncheck the box before Automatically Restart. Do not re-enable automatic restart on system failure
 after getting this information as this setting is best left to not to allow Automatic Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>If the system failure occurs during the booting of the computer you need to try a different approach. You can access the Windows Advanced Options
 Menu on many computers by constantly pressing the F8 (Function) key during Start-Up and selecting the option - Disable automatic restart on system failure. This method is not always easy to use as it can be difficult to depress the F8 at exactly the right
 time. Try again if it does not work first time. On some computers a different key has to be used.</span></p>

            Thank you for the advice, I have done what you have said and it has worked, I just got a BSOD saying "IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Stop Code: 0X0000000A (0X00000004,0X00000002, 0X00000000, 0X804E662F)" Hope this helps now :)

<p><span>Information relating to Bug Check Code: 0xA</span></p>
<p><span>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff560129(v=VS.85).aspx</span></p>
<p><span>The advice suggests getting driver updates through Windows Update. Many users think it is better to get drivers from the computer suppliers site
 e.g. Dell or from the motherboard manufacturers web site. I suspect they are right but getting the right driver can be tricky at times. Some of the techniques mentioned in the Article need a higher level of skills and knowledge which many do not possess. Using
 debugging tools is a skill I do not have. There are other regular contributors to these forums who do.</span></p>
<p><span>One tool which can help with getting clues from memory dump reports is BlueScreenView. It is easy to use and provides further clues towards resolving
 the underlying cause. You need to careful regarding other utilities offered on this site which include Registry Cleaners and Optimisers which are best not tried even though they appear to offer quick fixes.</span></p>
<p><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</span></p>
<p><span>Check Device Manager for question marks against individual devices. It can point directly to a driver problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Are any devices malfunctioning? Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, System Information. Open Components under System Summary
 and click on Problem Devices. Is anything listed there?</span></p>
<p><span>Are there any yellow question marks in Device Manager? Right click on the My Computer icon on your Desktop and select Properties, Hardware, and
 Device Manager. If yes what is the Device Error code?</span></p>
<p><span>Have a look in the System and Application logs in Event Viewer for Errors and Warnings and post copies here. Don't post any from than more than
 48 hours ago. </span></p>
<p><span>You can access Event Viewer by selecting Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, and Event Viewer. When researching the meaning of the error,
 information regarding Event ID, Source and Description are important. </span></p>
<p><span>A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. You will see a button resembling two
 pages. Click the button and close Event Viewer. This places a copy of the report into your Clipboard. Paste into the body your message. Make sure that this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>

            Thanks for the reply, I have updated all my drivers, And i think i may have got rid of the IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL problem however now i am faced with a new problem, A new BSOD "PFN_LIST_CORRUPT Stop Code 0X4E, Any ideas on that one?, No Devices are listed
 in Problem Devices, No Yellow question marks in Device Manager, Well there are LOADS of errors and warings in the event viewer about 607 in the past 24 hours!!!, Here is just a selection of them, "DCOM got error "This Service cannot be started in safe mode

<p><span>Your latest reply was very difficult to read, whereas your original post created no problems. You have reverted to posting clues and not complete reports as I suggested
 earlier. Proper reports are far more helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Information on Bug Check Code 0x4E</span></p>
<p><span>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff559014(v=VS.85).aspx</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This error brings malware, hard disk errors and possibly defective memory onto the scene. Please post a complete copy of the 0x4E report. That report may help narrow
 down the search field.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What are your anti-virus and anti-spyware arrangements? How old are the versions installed and are definitions bang up to date?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding Event Viewer reports I can unfortunately only make educated guesses from the clues you have provided.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Judging by reports in Google the DCOM error suggests you might be using an early version of Internet Explorer 6. The problem was fixed in 2006. What version of Internet
 Explorer are you using? Is it your default browser?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The report listing drivers not loading is typical of a “for information” report generated when the computer is booted in safe mode. A copy of the report would enable
 me to tell you whether I have guessed correctly. If it is what I suspect it to be, it can be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The reference to “crash dump driver” is new to me but nevertheless interesting. An inference which might be drawn is that your system is not capable of creating memory
 dump reports. If this is true then the opportunity to debug the reports and gain clues regarding the cause of blue screen errors is not available. A copy of the Event Viewer report would make it possible to comment further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The best way forward, given that you say there are lots of reports, would be to restart the computer making a note of the precise time. When the reboot has completed
 look in Event Viewer and post copies of the Warning and Error reports from the System and Application logs in the sequence they appear starting from the time the computer was restarted. Don’t post more than 12 reports. This may take some effort on your part
 but it means that I can look at each report in turn. Tackling the early reports first often eliminates the need to research the later reports.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            If I had these problems, I'd immediately run the "chkdsk" utility.<br />
<br />
Type <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pdZ81R5jlg40svpjCSdGkUO3FEWUM9tGLLT_Dr2vxk9t6Jo-wvVt3RO8A4q_mOVxMP7_7MF7MbCRGAvPP4cj0aQ%2fwinkey.png" /> +R<br />
When the "Run" window opens, type: cmd&lt;enter&gt;<br />
<br />
Then type: chkdsk /r %systemdrive%&lt;enter&gt;<br />
<br />
(cmd.exe will substitute %systemdrive% with the drive letter of your system disc (usually C:))<br />
<br />
If chkdsk.exe complains that it cannot lock the drive and asks if you want to schedule a check on the next restart, type: y<br />
and then reboot.<br />
<br />
During the reboot, after the Windows® Logo appears, Windows® will switch to a&nbsp;<em>light</em> blue screen and say something like "type any key to stop chkdsk from running" and proceed with a countdown.&nbsp; DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING!&nbsp; Chkdsk will then be run.&nbsp; I suspect
 your disc will have errors....<br />

KB315265 - How to perform disk error checking in Windows XP</a> <br />
<br />
The same function can be performed with the System Recovery Console (boot the Windows® installation CD-ROM and type "R" at the first prompt).&nbsp; Tell it where your system root is (usually C:\WINDOWS), type in the Administrator password if you have one (or just
 type &lt;enter&gt; if there isn’t one),<br />
and then type: chkdsk /p /r x:<br />
(you must substitute the correct drive letter for x: yourself).<br />

<p><span>These are two errors are what I think we should try to eliminate first. They point to an inability to create the memory dump reports which can help resolve BSOD errors.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Event Type: Error</p>
<p><span>Event Source: Ftdisk</span></p>
<p><span>Event ID: 45</span></p>
<p><span>Description:</span><span>The system could not sucessfully load the crash dump driver.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Event Type: Error</span></p>
<p><span>Event Source: Ftdisk</span></p>
<p><span>Event ID: 49</span></p>
<p><span>Description:</span><span>Configuring the Page file for crash dump failed. Make sure there is a page file
 on the boot partition and that is large enough to contain all physical memory.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select Start, Control Panel, Folder Options, View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected
 operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the size of your pagefile on C? The file name is pagefile.sys and should be located at the root of C . Select Win+E and Windows Explorer opens with the cursor
 on C. Right clicking on the file and selecting Properties will give you the file size.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Would you also please&nbsp;check the settings for&nbsp;your pagefile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Select Start, Control Panel, System, Advanced tab, Performance, Settings, Advanced tab, Virtual Memory, Change. The window should disclose the location and size of
 all pagefiles on the computer. Most computers&nbsp;have the pagefile on C drive (partition if the drive has been sub-divided), and&nbsp;are managed by Windows. An alternative is to specify minimum and maximum sizes. The third option is "No page file". If you have no
 page file on C you have&nbsp;found the problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The solution is to change the pagefile setting. Place the cursor on C&nbsp;to select the drive / partition and click in the box before "System managed size". Click on
 Set and OK. In the next window click on Apply and OK. Exit and restart the computer. After the computer&nbsp;has rebooted verify that the&nbsp;new pagefile setting has been accepted by revisiting the location where you made the change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When replying please tell me the size of your hard drive&nbsp; and whether it has been partitioned. Also the size of C and the amount of free disk space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Win+E and Windows Explorer opens with the cursor on C. Right clicking
 on C and selecting Properties will give you the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please let me know how you get on and we can then consider what to do next.</span></p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After I submitted the above question / post, I self-resolved the issue.&nbsp; I deleted the empty 'Documents' folder that was in my 'Libraries' folder, and several minutes later Windows "repaired itself" by putting the correct, fully populated Documents
 folder<span> (with all of my 'Documents' subfolder structure and file content) back into the 'Libraries' folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rick Fine</p>

            Windows 10 is seriously not well up to our expectations. It just keeps showing new errors every other day!! This is so frustrating man! and if compared XP was more promising.

I don't claim to be an expert but I do expect the Win 10 email Outlook account to work. I cannot see how to get into it to adjust servers, ports&nbsp;etc. It works fine on Linux because I wasn't treated like an idiot. We shouldn't have to pay (and I did) to put
 up with this.

            The playlist only says Cast to Device and doesn't give a list of devices, if I right click on just a song it allows me to pick the device. I did try to make another playlist but that didn't work either. I have been trying to Cast to Samsung smart tv, WD
 Live and Roku, nothing works. Thanks.

<h3> janicew_u  say:</h3>
<h2>            ScanScanp ix500 blue light blinking, not working</h2>
                    <p>I am using a ScanSnap ix500 on a Windows 7 Enterprise environment. I had previously been using the ScanSnap on a different computer with no problems, and it is not working on the new computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The computer identifies ScanSnap. The icon is blue, and says "Ready to Scan."
</p>
<p>2. Put a piece of paper in and it scans about 1/8 of the page before stopping - the blue light blinks for about 1 minute or so and then a message pops up:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5044066-a24f-41f4-b0eb-49ed5addbfac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5044066-a24f-41f4-b0eb-49ed5addbfac" height="292" width="462" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I choose Continue Scanning and it hangs on this screen for approximately 1 minute or longer:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f8903a7-b3de-4fe9-9db7-b080e5f928fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f8903a7-b3de-4fe9-9db7-b080e5f928fe" height="299" width="449" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And then it brings up the Previous message again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some troubleshooting I've already done: </p>
<p>
</p><p>-uninstalled and reinstalled software</p>
<p>-restarted computer</p>
<p>-logged in under a different user and tried the scanner</p>
<p>-plugged the computer in to a different power outlet</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were successful in trying the ScanSnap on a different computer - it worked on two separate computers. So it is something with this particular computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I'm also having this issue. &nbsp;However, I noticed the same entry in my event viewer every time I go to stream:</p>
<p>BITS has encountered an error communicating with an Internet Gateway Device. &nbsp;Please check that the device is functioning properly. BITS will not attempt to use this device until the next system reboot. Error code: 0x80004005.</p>
<p>I've restarted my laptop a few times but it's always the same result. &nbsp;Furthermore, I've stopped/started the BITS service as well as cleared out the 'qmgr' files from ...\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Downloader but I'm still experiencing this issue. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            diablo 3 freezes</h2>
                    
<p>My diablo 3 game freezes quite frequently. This started after I'd put in about 150-200 hours into the game.&nbsp; After checking the diablo forums I noticed that there were several reports of this occurring and the answer that Diablo is providing is clear your
 cache, make sure your xbox can vent heat. I cleared my cache and never had anything around the xbox so it should be clear enough.That doesn't fix the problem, and it seems obvious it's a problem with the game.&nbsp; Any advice since it seems obvious diablo is not
 concerned with fixing the problem.?</p>

<p>Hi Player,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the Diablo III troubles. You sure have put in a lot of time. Let's see if we can get this working.
<br />
<br />
<strong>I would suggest starting out with our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/console-freeze/xbox-360-screen-freeze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox 360 Screen Freeze</a>&nbsp;tool.</strong> There are some great some steps in there that may get this working.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dear Srimadhwa</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no luck with my Excel and Word Files.&nbsp; I have Microsoft Office 10 installed.&nbsp; This is my personal laptop and everything on it is mine.&nbsp; All my Excel and Word files are coming up&nbsp;as 'read only' and this has only happened since installing Windows 10
 last week.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all my details as Administrator and they are correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have checked the security on the individual files and I am listed as in full control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to save an edited file by saving it in to 'Downloads' but all files in my folders are 'read only'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you find a solution for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Geraldine</p>

            <p>I still have no way to edit and save a file without it turning into a 'read only' file.&nbsp; Even new files I create in Excel or Word are coming up as 'read only'.&nbsp; Also, I cannot save them in my own folders.&nbsp; I am told I need permission from the 'administrator'.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent these files to another computer with Windows XP and they can be opened, edited and saved.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Randolph, can you also answer the questions Srimadhwa asked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try taking ownership of the files and folders using the instructions or GUI utility from
<a href="http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-take-ownership-and-get-full-access-to-files-and-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Also try repairing Office.</p>

 receive equal punishment.&nbsp;

            Just block and report, retaliating violates the code of conduct. In my case if I ever get spammed a bunch of really salty messages I just keep replying with the laughing till crying emoji and the messages stop pretty quick.

            ur windows key can be found on your computer I'm sorry I cant tell u how to do it,someone on here should be able to tell u how to do it,but I know it can be done as Microsoft found my key on pc,only problem with that is even tho they managed to get the
 key and it was a genuine windows key when it came to reinstalling windows it wouldn't accept the key because all the outlets in uk not sure where u come from have stopped issuing keys so I don't think they work anymore,microsoft found a key from a foreign
 country to be able to install it.depends I think from where your from.i know this doesn't help much but it may give u more of an understanding.<br />

hi andrea,taking a photo sounds good and enlarging it,trouble where manufacturer is concerned is I contacted them when Microsoft mucked up my pc and they said they wasn't giving keys out anymore,if the system hes using is an oem no. even if he got it from inside
 the pc mine wouldn't work so Microsoft found one from abroad as they made a mess of my windows 7 it was up to them to reinstall it and they used a key that worked this happened on the 29.10 this year so its not that long ago.<br />

<h2>            microSD card slot not working during reboot</h2>
                    <p>Using Win10 Stream HP notebook.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since the internal memory is so limited, in order to install the large MS update 1709, I need to use space on my micro SD card.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However, during installation and then reboot, when data on the card is presumably needed, the micro SD card reader slot&nbsp;does not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I receive an error message saying, "Insert media into slot and click OK".&nbsp; I do so but the error message remains.&nbsp; I end up needing to click on cancel and the 1709 update fails.</p>

            Hi r-hayashi, honestly that method will not work on a HP Stream, you will still need to have the hard drive space to install 1709 . . .
<br />
<br />You would be amazed how many users with HP Streams ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Windows 7 on MAC says this copy of windows is not genuine</h2>
                    Installed Windows 7 on MAC computer a year ago and it was working fine.&nbsp; Did not use for the last 6 months and now when I open, it says, "This copy of Windows is not genuine.".&nbsp; I bought the Windows software from Fry's eletronics in San Marcos, CA.

<h2>            Skype display confusing</h2>
                    I use Skype, but my display does not look like the one in the support docs. There is no top toolbar menu. I have a "contacts" button, but can find no way to add a contact (except after making a call). I would like to add contacts without having to call
 them. I would also like to export contacts.&nbsp; (win 10, desktop)

            Thats how it works, you search for the contact, when you find them, you click on them and it will automatically add them to your contact list. 
<br />
<br />You don't necessarily have to start a converation, but doing this will initiate them as a contact. Its jarring, but thats how it works.

<h2>            catalyst control center&#58; host application has stopped working</h2>
                    hi
<div>catalyst control center: host application has stopped working error appears when i try to open catalyst control center or the switchable graphics program. &nbsp; this has happend twice and was resolved with a fresh install of windows.</div>
<div>i am fairly sure it is caused by a windows update because problem started after installing updates.</div>
<div>i have contacted dell and reinstalled the drivers a few times with no fix.</div>
<div>my laptop now seems to auto control graphics by itself and can still play some games. graphcs card does still work, just seems to be a software issue . pretty sure the problem is from a windows update</div>

            There is a simple solution<br />
<br />
Just go to C:/users/(your_user_name)/AppData/Local<br />
and delete the ATI folder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Go to desktop and right click and open AMD Graphics Properties and it will recreate the folder and voila catalyst control center just opened for you and started working again.<br />
<br />
It worked for my case, hope it works for you too.

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure I understand correctly, when you correct a spelling/word by entering the correct letter, the letter in front of it gets erased, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, this could be due to the "insert" key being enabled. Insert key allows letters to be erased when you type a new letter to avoid overwriting. In order to disable this, simply press the "insert" key on the keyboard and check again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. </p>

            Hi Gabbygar 
<br />
<br />BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>Thanks for the info on the Dell updates.&nbsp; The Bios one you reference I had done some time ago, but the display driver I did not have. I don't think that either of these will make a difference with the strange bsod screen when we shut down.&nbsp; If I start the
 system in the morning and do things, then shut it down from my side I usually will not get the blue screen. If I start it up a half hour later and shut it down-blue screen always the same one I described.</p>

    <title>64-bit Explorer.exe memory leak - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chipprogrammer  say:</h3>
<h2>            64-bit Explorer.exe memory leak</h2>
                    When I run a Check Disk through the GUI, Explorer.exe consumes all of RAM, leaving me with none for my primary activities; chkdsk was being run as a side task for me.&nbsp; When I cancel the chkdsk part way through, Explorer.exe continues to consume more and
 more RAM.&nbsp; I have read that chkdsk consumes all of memory, save for ~50 MB by design (poor design this is), yet this does not explain why Explorer.exe itself continues to consume RAM even after chkdsk.exe is done and gone.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit
 version, running with 96 GB RAM.&nbsp; There's no valid reason for Explorer.exe or Chkdsk.exe to consume all of that RAM.<br />
<br />
In this instance, I brought a drive from home to check here at the office.&nbsp; I do not want to devote all of my office system and my time to this one task, I do have work to be done and would very much prefer that chkdsk.exe run as a background task with very
 little memory usage.<br />

    <title>UPDATE&#58; Recovery Failure&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maryannmeyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            UPDATE&#58;  Recovery Failure&#33;</h2>
                    <p><strong>UDPATE - 9/26/2015:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchased and received second Recovery USB from HP.&nbsp; Computer ran the recovery software, but it still failed.&nbsp; It goes through the motions of seeming to download and install the recovery software, but still comes back
 to the blue screen and a dialog box not allowing me to close the failure screen.&nbsp; I've reset to factory setting; changed the date back to 2012; changed the order of the boot up options; enabled/disabled settings in F10 Configure Settings; hard booted; ran
 all of the test on F2 (all passed); and tried to run either/both of the recover USBs at least a dozen times over the last week.&nbsp; I've even left the battery out over night, which worked for someone on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>This all started as a result of upgrading to Windows 10</strong></span>.&nbsp; I am not happy and do not recommend anyone else to upgrade.&nbsp; My computer is basically dead now.&nbsp; I've had a lot of very helpful people
 in the forums providing solutions that worked for them, but nothing has worked and I'm spending 4-5 hours every evening working on this with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I don't care if I get the touch screen functionality back (original problem from the upgrade).&nbsp; If I can get this computer working again, I'll live without that ... even though it was one of the main features why I purchased this model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've always been a fan of HP/ Microsoft products.&nbsp; Maybe its time to move to a Mac.</p>
<p>*************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp;&nbsp; After having tried ALL of the recommendations on HP and HP Forum, I have tried to recover my hard drive from the USB that HP sent to me after purchasing my computer.&nbsp; Well... that's not working either.&nbsp; There is an error with the recovery and now
 the recovery system keeps recycling, but doesn't give me an option to do anything else.&nbsp; Just a blue screen and the program from the USB.&nbsp; Computer is worthless like this.&nbsp; Of course, three months out of warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me figure out what's next?&nbsp; I am now using a different computer just to try to find a solution but cannot continue to use this second computer, and really want to get my computer started.&nbsp; At this point, I don't care of the touch screen
 functionality comes back.&nbsp; That was the original problem caused by upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; Don't think I'll be trying that again on any computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MaryAnn</p>
<p>******************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>ORIGINAL MESSAGE:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Pavilion TouchSmart 14-b173cl Sleekbook computer.&nbsp; Upon upgrading to Windows 10, my computer lost the touch screen functionality.&nbsp; I have searched for solutions and tried everything on both HP and Microsoft's websites, but nothing has returned
 the touch screen functionality.&nbsp; In fact, when I search on HP for drivers, it now recognizes my computer as a different model entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I have entirely reset to factory settings back to Windows 8 and am now using 8.1.&nbsp; This has not resolved the issue.&nbsp; Device Manager indicates that it is working correctly and that the drivers are current.&nbsp; On BIOS, TouchScreen does not show
 as an option to run a check on (according to the HP site, it should have been there).&nbsp; I've removed the battery; I've cleaned the screen; I've tried to calibrate the pen and touch&nbsp;(non-responsive)&nbsp;-- nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any other suggestions of how to return the touch screen functionality?&nbsp; It worked great for two years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I had already installed the drivers from HP for this model before posting here, but just repeated the process this evening.&nbsp; It did not help.&nbsp; In fact, the Touch Screen is no longer showing in Device Manager now.&nbsp; It was there
 previously, and indicated that all drivers were up to date and the device was working.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

                    <span>I have a cd with some audio tracks in mp3 format, the latest ones which I added today by opening a directory of tracks in Windows Explorer and then clicking "Send To" the CD drive. They copied
 across correctly and the individual tracks play on the computer.<br />
<br />
Now I wish to close the session, to enable me to use this CD on other players and in the car.<br />
<br />
In Explorer, I have rightclicked on the drive containing the cd, and selected the "Close session" option and after it whirs for a few minutes, I remove the disk - but it doesn't close the session. I have done this step at least 10 times (seriously!) on a variety
 of different cd's which are all CD-R, but I cannot get it to work correctly.<br />
<br />
I am using Vista Ultimate SP1 on a Intel Dual core 6600 @ 2.4GHz with 2GB of ram.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how i can "close the session" to enable me to play this cd on other players?<br />
<br />
Am I missing a setting of some sort?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.<br />

<blockquote>Thanks John.<br />
<br />
My car player (and home HiFi) can and do, play mp3's without any problems. <br />
<br />
The files on my cd are all mp3. I don't have an ipod, but I have even transferred the mp3 files to my mobile phone, and the tracks play perfectly.<br />
<br />
Some of the cd's with mp3's I created last year when I still had a machine running XP, and they seemed to finalise perfectly.<br />
Luckily I still have that old machine, so will try using media player under xp to do the necessary - and hopefully by running through the process again may help me identify any thing I am doing incorrectly on the vista machine.<br />
<br />
(Basically, I am using audiograbber on pc to record my old cassette tapes, which are saved in WMA format.<br />
Then using WMA converter from Jodix software, I am converting to mp3.<br />
Those mp3's are then being copied (via the "send to" option) to the cd writer.<br />
So one album. On one cd. All in mp3 format. But the Close Session does not appear to work.<br />
Should I be burning the cd in a different way?<br />
<br />
Could it be a bug?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

=======================================<br />
OK...your car CD player&nbsp;can play MP3 files. <br />
<br />
Maybe you are using the Live&nbsp;File System format&nbsp;<br />
and should be using the Mastered format.<br />
<br />
Have a look at the followng articles:<br />

<br />
Which CD or DVD format should I use?<br />

Also the following free software might be worth a try:<br />

<p><span>I understand that you are facing performance issues after installing Windows 8. I will definitely help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What do you mean by “</span><span>cannot access anything on my desktop”? What exactly happens when trying to access?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you receive any error message when trying to access?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you performed clean install or upgrade install?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot mode and check if the issue persists.
<br />
A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.<br />
You may refer the following KB article to set the computer in clean boot: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a><br />
<b>Note:</b> After the trouble shooting steps, refer to <b>Step 3 </b>from the clean boot link to place the computer back to normal start up mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> I would suggest you to follow the steps from the link and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Windows hangs or freezes</span></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Perform sfc scan and check.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “<b>cmd”</b> on the Start screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click on it and select “<b>Run as administrator”.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type the following command and press Enter:</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b><span> </span><span>I would also suggest you to download and install all the updated drivers for your operating system.</span></p>
