                    To add a payment method or switch between payment methods
By default, apps are added to your phone bill when mobile payments are offered. To pay with a credit card instead:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>On the phone or on <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">windowsphone.com</a>, tap
<b>Add or switch payment methods </b>on the purchase confirmation screen. </li><li>Add a new payment method or change the payment method.</li></ol>
<p>Like always, things are made difficult for the end user</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>HOW TO REMOVE A PAYMENT METHOD ?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I<b> have removed my visa card, but now have my mobile operator listed as a payment method, how to REMOVE this ?</b><br />

            <p>Hi KingJohnEngland,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Mobile operator payment option is part of the OS when that operator sim is in your phone.</p>
<p>This can't be removed. However you can switch to another payment option you want before the purchase is final.</p>

            Does the button change color when you click it? The words "Work Offline" will not change, just the color of the button background. Highlighted means you're offline. Not highlighted says you're online. Do you see "offline" or "not connected" in the status
 bar at the bottom of the Outlook window? What happens when you try to send a message? Do you never receive any? What mail service are you using?

    <title>4GB miniSD in E70&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sbreit  say:</h3>
<h2>            4GB miniSD in E70&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there!<br />
<br />
I'd like to use a 4GB memory card in my E70. Is there any way to do so? SDHC is just an software issue, so is Nokia going to support SDHC on the E70 in a next firmware release (if there was one)?<br />
<br />
Or can the E70 handle non-SDHC 4GB cards?<br />
<br />
Greetings!<br />
<br />

            As far as I know, E70 supports max 2GB.<br />
And as far as I kow there is a FAT issue (I hope that someone can explane better this issue).<br />

            That being my point exactly: the E70 supports 2GB only. Will this change in the future?<br />
<br />
About the FAT issue: it won't be a problem, if the card had 2 partitions... That would be a workaround.<br />
<br />
I'm experimenting on that already ;)

            I'm afraid that the development will go in the HDD direction (so called flash memory, if I'm not wrong), like iPhone, Samsung and will easily exceed 4GB.<br />
<br />
Two particion on SD card... hm, interesting.<br />

            Actually, there is a 4GB card for the E70. MobyMemory from UK claims to have one:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.mobymemory.com/products/MobyMemory/MobyMemory-4GB-mini-SD-66X-Card.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mobymemory.com/products/MobyMemory/MobyMemory-4GB-mini-SD-66X-Card.asp</a><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the card is out of stock :-(<br />
<br />
I'll try to find out a bit more...

<h2>            How do I get the previous version of office back after a free trial of office 365&#63;</h2>
                    I bought the home and student version of office 2013 when I purchased my computer. I recently tried a free subscription of office 365 to try out publisher. The trial is over and now I want to go back to my previous version, but every time I open one of
 the applications I get a message that says my subscription has ended. I decided to uninstall office 365 thinking it would revert back to my previous version, but now office is completely gone! Help. I had my previous version installed through Dell digital
 delivery. When I try to access this it gives me a message that my software is up to date even though, there is no office software to be found!!! How do I get the previous office version I purchased digitally back?

<p>I uninstalled office 365 via the control panel/uninstall programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No office is completely gone, meaning not in the list of installed programs. Other than publisher which I bought separately after the free trial. -Not apart of my original office for home and student which included only word, excel, power point, and one
 note. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think I associated my purchase of office with my microsoft account because when I log in to my microsoft account there is no record of it, and all I see is the publisher I just recently purchased. &nbsp;</p>

 working and ask to repair it at the next run. When attempting to repair the file it's unable to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When opening the file, we receive:</p>
<p>

2016 8827.2148</strong> or newer are getting the error, users with <strong>2016 8431.2215</strong> or earlier can repair the files, and never get this error themselves on work they're doing. As you can all imagine, this is quite annoying, as the user who's
 having the issue has to ask the user who doesn't have the issue to constantly fix / save a copy of the files in question, productivity isn't doing very well here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another random point here, once the file is fixed, it then becomes locked, and we have to kill the open file from Computer Management. Our infrastructure consists of Windows 7/10 and a 2008 R2 file server which holds all of these files. All clients are Microsoft
 Office ProPlus 2016 from an Office 365 subscription. I've checked basic things like permissions, network integrity/dropouts and file length both locally, UNC and share drive, none of these paths on the files in question are more than 150 characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or further troubleshooting would be great, but it just seems like something changed between 8431.2215 and 8827.2148 which Excel doesn't like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hello Damian,
<br />
<br />I see that you have tried to a recovery file, but some time it does not work automatically, so lets try some other things.
<br />
<br />Review the following link there some steps that probably may help you out

<p>Well isn't that a thing. I've just tested over two computers and this looks promising, we can now repair the file, so thank you for that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why these files might be getting corrupted in the first place? Again it's only happening with users on the later versions of Excel.</p>

            Im glad to heard that, Files get corrupted for so many reasons, If your computer loses power or crashes as you save a file, there's a good possibility that the file will become corrupted. Bad sectors on your hard drive or other storage media can also cause file corruption, not only in Excel.

<p>I have the same problem. The Excel workbook is NOT corrupt - it can be opened using older versions of Excel (i.e. not the most recent build of 2016 but 2016). This is pretty bad - Excel is misreporting these files as corrupt when there is nothing wrong with
 them. Please do not point me at repair utilities because they do not work (because there is nothing to repair) and they leave the file as 'corrupt'. Also latest Excel open from within Excel does not offer the Open and Repair option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to ask, where is the regression testing?</p>

<p>Things are a little different for me, but I gave up on this thread because the point didn't seem to be coming across. For me, the files are being corrupted, but it looks like a conflict between older and newer versions of Excel; if files are created by an
 older version then edited by a newer version it might corrupt it, if they're just used by the older or just by the newer they seem to work fine. The files for us are definitely corrupted, but the actual reason why is the annoying part. The guys on our end
 can work again because of the open/repair option, but it's annoying for them to try and open a file, then get the error, then open Excel and open/repair it .. it's just extra steps they shouldn't have to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our business we use pretty much the same style files all of the time, and I've tried to narrow down what could be causing this internally, but there seems to be no real rhyme or reason, different parts are corrupt, different things are edited when corrupting,
 it's just strange and annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're beginning to look into rebuilding our entire template system just in case something was corrupt, it's good to hear (sorry!) that other people are experiencing the same issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suspect the problem is also related to our use of Flexcel to generate the files so am investigating options there because unmerged Excel files are opening fine, it is just when they are merged (generated) from Flexcel. Am taking it up with Flexcel as well.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.<br />

<p><br />
In this world and the world of tomorrow, we must go forward together or not at all.<br />
- Ms. Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton: Living History</p>
<p><br />
At Microsoft, we're working hard to figure out how to evolve from where we are today to the point where we can unleash the full potential of the new advances in technology. These are exciting times, not only for the companies involved but for everyone who will
 realize the benefits of this revolution.<br />
- Mr. William H. Gates: The Road Ahead</p>
<p><br />
Microsoft certainly has a lot of things that did extremely well. I haven’t been CEO since the year 2000, and the company has immense strengths, but in areas like search or phones, you have Google and Apple who’ve done very well so we were always in a very dynamic
 environment. The fact that we got in and really, created this Windows environment, which drove personal computing to a new level; that meant that we were the centre of attention. Really, understanding what it was that we might be missing, required very good
 management because we were so successful. Yes, you can become confused about what the key elements are, what you need to sustain it, and you have to seek out criticism. Seek out the customers whose needs you’re not meeting. Complacency is typical.<br />

<p><br />
Every great company has an enduring mission. Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.<br />

A page is good only when we turn it and find life surging along and confusing every passage in the book. The pen rushes on urged by the same joy that makes me course the open road. A chapter started when one doesn’t know which tale to tell is like a corner
 turned..., when one might come face to face with a dragon, a Saracen gang, an enchanted isle or a new love.<br />
...<br />
From describing the past, from the present which seized my hand in its excited grasps, here I am, oh future, now mounting the crupper of thy horse. What new pennants wilt thou unfurl before me from towers of cities not yet founded? What rivers of devastation
 set flowing over castles and gardens I have loved? What unforeseeable golden ages art thou preparing, ill-mastered, indomitable harbinger of treasures dearly paid for, my kingdom to be conquered, the future...<br />
- Mr. Italo Calvino: The Non-Existent Knight</p>

Welcome to a future with Windows 10. It can recognize you, respond to you and even learn with you. So you can create and share in ways you never thought possible. Now is the time to do great things.</p>

Go, go, go, Windows and everyone who benefits to it and benefits from it, keep going!</p>

<h2>            How to make a better Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I created a fresh drive and loaded a fresh image drive from windows 8.1.&nbsp; I then installed widows 10 and kept all files and programs.&nbsp; After some two hours later, I get this requirement to verify who I am using a code.&nbsp; Here is just a little problem most
 people will have.&nbsp; If they are using their main PC to load this program, they will not be able to verify who the are until they are able to get online to retrieve their mail</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After verifying who I am, I finally get to view the new desktop.&nbsp; This is very refreshing.&nbsp; However, I see many empty icons in the program menu.&nbsp; This is because none of the programs have been installed from the windows old.&nbsp; This is a big problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most people, I do have an Ipad.&nbsp; When they update their program, they update the program using an update which does not inter-fear with any existing program.&nbsp; The individual is able to go forward with a lot of additional work.&nbsp; This I think is
 the greatest downfall with Microsoft.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to provide a method of going to a new system with out having to reprogram the entire system.&nbsp; Please take a hard look at ways of accomplishing this.&nbsp; If you cannot improve the installation method, I for
 one, would not recommend windows 10 over windows 8.1.&nbsp; Thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my thoughts.</p>

            <p>I understand what you mean. Microsoft should make it easy to upgrade your PC without loosing anything. Look at Apple, OS X Mavericks can be installed on almost any Mac that can run OS X Snow Leopard. What's more, everything stays intact (personal files,
 settings, apps), unlike Windows 8.1, which can only keep your files and not your applications from Windows 7. Big drawback, since OS X Snow Leopard and Windows 7 were released around the same time (2009), and the same goes for&nbsp;OS X Mavericks and&nbsp;Windows 8.1
 of 2013-14. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As for Windows 10 Technical Preview, note that this Preview is an unfinished piece of code that's in it's early stage before being release in mid-2015, so we're bound to expect many flaws from very minor bugs to major, permanent damage to the system(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you understood that Microsoft warned about not installing it on your primary PC...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remember, trying out an early build like this can be risky. That's why we recommend that you don't install the preview on your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files,
 so you should back up everything.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1 - There are other options for receiving the code:&nbsp; text msg or by phone.&nbsp; Also, using your main PC for a beta OS is seldom a good idea.&nbsp; That's why Microsoft clearly recommends against it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - I had a very different experience.&nbsp; I cloned an 8.1 installation onto a spare drive,&nbsp;and then used that drive for the Win10 install, selecting "Keep everything."&nbsp; All of my desktop icons were intact, and all but one of my programs worked under Win10.&nbsp;
 (I didn't expect that one to work anyway, because it is very sensitive to changes in environment.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - Well, then, all your problems are solved.&nbsp; You don't even need Win10.</p>

<p>That's really not true.&nbsp; I upgraded five of my computers from Win7 to Win8, and almost all of my programs continued to run, just like before.&nbsp; There are always some, usually older, programs that won't run under a new OS, but that is why Microsoft provided
 a pre-install program to identify them.</p>

            <p>I know the Windows Upgrade Assistant, but that's from Windows 8. Windows 8 had no problems moving software, but why is it removed in Windows 8.1?</p>

</p><p>And if you customized your software a lot over time, you'll need to do that again, which is very hard for some who don't keep records on what they've changed in the software how they did it.</p>
<p>Not everybody has upgraded to the Clouds of Adobe, Apple, etc., to remember their settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on, Windows 8.1 is not entirely different from Windows 8. It's more like a consequence created for Windows 7 users who hated the Start Screen and were willing dump their PC software and hunt for Mac alternatives if they couldn't stick with Windows 7
 anymore.</p>

</p><p>That is essentially what I did, just not on my "main PC."&nbsp; I put it on the PC in my shop, and still&nbsp;have the Win81 drive in it, so I can BIOS select the boot drive.&nbsp; I used the phone option to get the code because it was quicker than going to another machine

<p>
</p><p>What is also handy is that I can play with Win10 using Remote Desktop from either my office or living room.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1 - The Upgrade Assistant was not part of Win8.&nbsp; It was a separate program to run under Win7, so it wasn't "removed" from anything.&nbsp; It's still available.&nbsp; You don't need it for Win8 to Win8.1 because, as you said, that really not a change in OS, just a
 tweak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - Not really.&nbsp; I had very few things from Win7 that would not run in Win8 (and 8.1) after the upgrade.&nbsp; I had to "deactivate" and "reactivate" a few things, especially my Adobe stuff, but I knew that from prior experience, so was prepared.&nbsp; I change computers
 a lot, so I often run into those problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - Including me.&nbsp; I don't use any of the "cloud" services because my DSL is both slow and erratic (a bad combination!).&nbsp;&nbsp; For a major download, I start it on a spare machine or go do something else.&nbsp; For a major upload, which I often have, it's quicker
 to make a 45-minute drive to my Ladyfriend's house and do it on her Uverse connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 - I remembered it from previous Win8x upgrades, and it was just quicker because the phone was right there, and I was in my shop.</p>

<p>2 &nbsp;- The SETTINGS AND USER CONFIGS, THE GAMING HISTORY AND SCORES is what you'll loose if you upgrade from 7 to 8.1, if you can't save it somewhere else</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3 - the Cloud thing, if you don't know what I was talking about is this:</p>
<p>
Sync settings
</p><p>Sync your preferences, keyboard shortcuts, presets, and libraries across multiple computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Video editing software | Download free Adobe Premiere Pro CC trial</a>&nbsp;as an example. Apple, Google and Microsoft are or already have adopted/adopting this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't export your Settings, etc., you have to create a record of everything you changed</p>
<p>I know Adobe has that option to export settings, but c'mon, I'm talking about software that DOES NOT HAVE THAT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't talking about data storage at all - that's a minor problem for most if you have an external USB 2.0 (or 3.0) drive with enough space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4 - I was talking about me forgetting to mention on how to skip that and do it via PC Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No offense, sorry if I did. The reason I put certain things in ALL CAPS is to make it stand out, it's not intended to show I'm mad, and I'm not.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1 - "Whoosh" is the sound of something going right over my head, but I finally got it -- I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not done an upgrade from Win7 to Win8.1.&nbsp; All of mine were 7 to 8 then to 8.1.&nbsp; Win8 to 8.1 is seamless.&nbsp; My upgrade to Win10 was almost seamless
 -- only my CAD program didn't make it, plus my favorite file utility that is so sensitive it&nbsp;flakes out when I change my shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to have the serial number reactivated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - I understand the "sync settings," but I don't depend on anything that is Cloud related, because of my erratic DSL (I'm a bit rural here.)&nbsp; If it won't sync across my local network, then I figure I have to do it on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - My "off site" backup is the computer in my shop.&nbsp; It is a separate building, so that, for me, constitutes "off site."&nbsp; I have a 4TB drive in it just for data backup.&nbsp;&nbsp; Program backup I accomplish by regularly cloning the C Drive in my "main computer."&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I'm always "messing with" my computers, and sometimes I do dumb things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 - Nah.&nbsp; I've been doing this stuff way too long to be bothered by that.&nbsp; I knew you were doing it for emphasis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take care,</p>

    <title>Open Password Protected Access Database with a script using password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ricks007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open Password Protected Access Database with a script using password in command line option</h2>
                    How can I open a access database (which has a password on the DB) with a script and pass the DB password as a command line option. I searched and found a /pwd switch which is not applicable to the DB password, rather works for Access user security controls
 (not database password).<br />
<br />
For e.g. In a script or on cmd prompt something like: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\MSAccess.exe" /pwd "password"&nbsp; "C:\My Documents\Test.mdb"<br />
opens up a logon prompot (for user access security) and not the DB password. <br />
<br />
Is it possible to open a password protected DB through a script and pass the password as a command line option? Currently I need to enter the password manually on the password prompt I get.<br />

<h2>            Slow sync</h2>
                    
<p>Can anyone explain to me&nbsp;why when I update Outlook 2003 or a file on my PC it syncs straight away with my hp2790b and yet if I update something on the pda first, you have time to go and make a cup of tea before it updates the PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Having done the clean reset, it appears to have made an&nbsp;improved difference in speed. I also downloaded a patch from the&nbsp;HP website for activsync problems, dated January 2007, for my 2790b pda.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say it's as fast as it used to be between my ipaq 3950 and Activsync 4.2, but it's a lot better.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 emails suddenly stopped sending.</h2>
                    My emails suddenly stopped sending in Outlook 2010.&nbsp; They worked this morning, but not this afternoon.&nbsp; I checked to make sure all settings were OK and ran a troubleshooter, but they still won't send no matter how many times I try.&nbsp; I used several different
 email accounts, but this issue is common to all of them.

            <p>I think I found the solution.&nbsp; I stopped my email scanning option of McAfee Security, tried once again to send, and it went out.&nbsp; I then went back and enabled email scanning again.&nbsp; Apparently the AV scan did not like something and stopped all sending, even
 from other emails.&nbsp; Either that, or it just happened to fix itself.... one never really knows how to fix&nbsp;Microsoft programs when they behave so erratically.
</p>
<p>edit:&nbsp; <br />
This did NOT fix my issue.&nbsp; I uninstalled my AV and installed MSE and still have the issue.&nbsp; See the additional posts regarding this.</p>

    <title>Office has detected a problem with this file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewnu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office has detected a problem with this file</h2>
                    <p>I regularly send a particular Word document to a group of people, after updating it for changes relevant to the particular week. &nbsp;Last's weeks file didn't cause any issues, but when I sent out the document this week, several recipients noted a message "Office
 has detected a problem with this file. Editing may be dangerous. To help keep your computer safe this file has been opened in Protected View."</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I sent a completely different Word document - same message ensued.</li><li>I uploaded the file to an online virus check aggregator - and all 55 services reported no issue with the file</li><li>I downloaded several Mac virus checkers and can't find any issues on my system after a full system scan</li></ul>
<p>So what is the cause of the sudden emergence of this message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can think of is that Office for Mac 2016 performed an update between sending last weeks file (which was fine) and this weeks (which was not) - I think that was the 64-bit update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some issue with Word for PC opening files created on Word for Mac after the latest update I should be aware of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help or light anyone can shed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>How do I get my Harmon Invoke device with Cortana fixed?&nbsp; Sometimes it works and then sometimes it loses the internet signal. The Microsoft Store said it only had a one year warranty and it has been longer than that. I'm trying to find out where I can send
 it to be fixed. Also, the stores no longer carry them.</p>

<p>So it does not appear from what you indicated that it is broken but loses it Wi-Fi signal (Internet connection).. The first thing I would try is to move it away from where it is located to see if it gets a better signal.</p>

<h2>            Macros in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    Am I correct that you can no longer record macros in Outlook 2010? &nbsp;We have upgraded (at last) from 2003 to 2010. &nbsp;None of my recorded macros from 2003 are there. &nbsp;I've no idea how to write macros. &nbsp;I
<u>must</u>&nbsp;record them. &nbsp;Why would Microsoft remove a useful tool, i.e. recording a macro in Outlook e-mail message to be available for all new messages, as it was in 2003??

            <p>For Outlook there's never been a macro recorder. If you did it by recording, you probably did it in Word.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook macros are stored in a *.otm file. On Win 7 you find it here:</p>
<p>C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Outlook</p>

            All I know is I recorded macros while is a new email message, which I could use for subsequent emails. Outlook 2003 used Word as it's editor, or something like that. But I never recorded my macros in a Word document, per se, but while in a new email message.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>When I'm back in the office, I will investigate further on seeing if I can't get these old macros to run in 2010. I've had no problem with them in Word and Excel. Just Outlook has been a HUGE disappointment.&nbsp;</div>

            Thank you. I will look into this further when I'm back in the office. Thank you for responding. I will certainly give Microsoft my feedback because they have handicapped me in Outlook. It's quite annoying. Right now, I've retyped some of the things the
 macros were doing for me in the 2003 version, retyping them and saving them in a Word document and copying and pasting them into my email message when I need them. How archaic is that???

            I recorded macros however Outlook 2003 allowed it. It doesn't allow it any more in the same way. Is it that Outlook 2010 doesn't use Word like 2003 did? &nbsp;I will take a look at your link when I'm back in the office. Right now I'm doing copy/paste so I don't
 have to retype the same info all the time. 2010 isn't hard to learn, even going straight from 2003, but this macro business has reduced me to an archaic method right now. I'm not a happy camper with macros in Outlook.&nbsp;

            Outlook 2003 has two completely distinct editors: a built-in one and Word 2003.&nbsp; Outlook 2007 and beyond use only Word as the editor.&nbsp; There is no longer a choice.

            If you are using copy/paste it sounds as though you are using macros to type texts. That being the case you can save those texts as autocorrect entries or autotext/building blocks from the Outlook editor.<br />
<br />
The Outlook editor is a subset of Word dedicated to message creation and works in a similar manner to Word, though has its own master template.<br />

            It won't let me post to the feedback app and said that I need to be an insider, which I am. It's been doing this for days and I have feedback to share! It makes me sad because now I'm afraid they won't be able to fix it! I did what they suggested about
 switching to local and back to microsoft and it didn't work either.

            <p>Dear John,</p>
<p>Thanks for your rapid response.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was managed to log in once (only once!) yesterday after several times of trying. But I received the same error message "This webpage is not available" when I tried to log in again later in the day.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do you remember any changes that has been made prior to the issue? <u>
<b>No changes.</b></u> If you try to log in using a different Microsoft account, do you encounter the same error message?
<u><b>I only have 1 hotmail account. I failed to access to log in page of outlook when I was trying to create a new hotmail account.</b></u></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I don't think this is my internet or browser problem because I can access to my yahoo email and other webpages as usual.</p>
        </p>

            I have just created a new hotmail account but experiencing the same log in issue: "The webpage is not available" on

<p>I usually access my hotmail on Google Chrome.</p>

            <p>if that is not the issue, why do you want to edit the links? you can go to the cells with&nbsp;links (cell with formula contains "\" or a cell with "[").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press Ctrl+F</p>
<p>Find what: "[" (No quotes)</p>
<p>then press <strong>Find All</strong> button. in below, will shows all the cells contains a link.</p>

<p>Does&nbsp;it worked if not please be more specific please...</p>

            Dear Jaeson, <br />
<br />
Thank you for helping me with this issue. It is not related with formulas between the same file worksheets. It is related with links between different Excel or CSV files.<br />
<br />
I would like to explain you, why do I need "Edit links" function.<br />
Let's do an example: 1) open the new excel worksheet without any data. 2) Go to Data &gt; Connections &gt; Add... &gt; Browse for More &gt; (select any of yours *.xls or csv files).&nbsp; Follow steps until you will see in the" Workbook connections" the name of your selected
 file. (it means you have created the linked file). 3) Close the window. 4) Go to Data .&gt; Get External Data &gt;Existing Connections &gt; and you will see the created linked file. Please select it and Open &gt; Place in the =Sheet1!$A$1, 5) You wil see your imported
 file's data. <br />
<br />
Everything was ok and it was possible to "Refresh all" data, if some changes in linked file exist, without opening that file. I have been working with this kind of files successfully for 1 year, It was very useful in my job. Now, I got a new laptop with a new
 installed the same Excel 2007, but there are some settings different and I can not "refresh all" automatically in the same way as in previous version. I was looking in MsOffice help and I found that it could be "broken links". This function "Edit links" helps
 to identify why links between files do not work. Unfortunately, "Edit links" looks like enabled in my Excel....<br />
