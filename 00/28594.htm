<h2>            Word templates not functioning properly in OneDrive</h2>
                    I've created a template (.dotx) in Word. When I save it to my device, then opens, it creates a new document just like the file type is supposed to. However, when the template is saved and shared in OneDrive or SharePoint, only the original file&nbsp;is accessed
 and new copy is not made. Is there a setting in OneDrive or Office 365 that can correct this?&nbsp;

<h2>            WorkDays Function</h2>
                    <p><span>In MS Access 2007, &nbsp;Select DateDiff("d", “7/3/2012”, "7/10/2012") returns 7 as the number of days between those dates.</span></p>
<p><span>Is there an MS Access function &nbsp;that returns the number of working days?</span></p>
<p><span>In this example, 7/4 is a US holiday, 7/7&nbsp; is a US day off (Saturday) , and 7/8 is a US day off (Sunday).</span></p>
<p><span>So the function would need to return 4, not 7.</span></p>
<p><span>In excel, this function is called Networkdays. &nbsp;Is there something similar in MS Access 2007

<h2>            Excel App Can&#39;t Open Files</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, out of the blue, when I tried to open a file (that I've opened every day without issue for the last 5 years), my excel app gives me "Can't open file - File might be locked, in use, or insufficient permission". Same message for every file I
 try to open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone having the same issue?</p>
<p>Can someone help me?</p>
<p>I'm frustrated and my OCD is just torturing me right now : (</p>
<p>I can open versions of the files on OneDrive, but I don't know how up-to-date they are.</p>
<p>

            For whatever reason, it sounds like Windows 10 installed a Boot Manager for you. If you right click on the Start button, there should be a&nbsp;Run option. When you click on it, type in
<em>msconfig </em>and hit OK. This will bring up a System Configuration screen. Go to the Boot tab, there should be a list of available OS's listed in there. Click&nbsp;to&nbsp;highlight&nbsp;the extra Windows 10 OS listing you want to remove and hit the Delete Button, then
 click OK. On your&nbsp;next system&nbsp;reboot, the extra Windows 10&nbsp;listing should be gone along with the boot manager.

            <p>I have this situation but I am running 3 OS's. Although Windows 7 shows twice when booting up, it has only one entry in the msconfig/ boot listing. If you only have one OS the quick solution might be to change the timeout value to zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS drives are O, P and Q but W7 also shows as C. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have a look at this after taking the dog for a walk.</p>

            <p>I've been multi-booting for years and rarely have had issues doing it. I've read about tools such as Easy BCD for fixing boot problems, but&nbsp;never had to use it yet. About the Drive C thing, Microsoft's new boot manager&nbsp;scheme over the last few&nbsp;iterations&nbsp;of
 Windows now sets the&nbsp;currently selected Windows Partition as Drive C at boot up time. It does look a little weird when you look at the partitioning scheme through a disk management utility. In my current setup, I've got Windows XP, 7, 10 and a version of Linux
 setup on my hard drive. Though my Windows 10 is installed into a later partition, I does show up as&nbsp;Drive C when it's the current OS I'm using. When I boot to Windows XP or 7, the designation changes to something you would more expect to see.</p>

<h3> muffin manxm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2013 - how to capture multiple values - multi select boxes without code&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span>Hi<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>I’d greatly appreciate any advice on this, and apologies if this is such a basic question.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>[Please note I’m working on Access 2013 - standalone version – and working in Windows 10.]</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>Intro / context</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>I have been teaching myself how to use basic Access table, form and query functions design and use, and in so many ways it’s fantastic
 for my purposes – I’m launching a small UK business that provides private tuition to students – the business will scale so I want to ge the fundamental database design and mechanisms in place, and I have a workable design that makes things really easy for
 many labels and fields I need. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>I have created various tables to break everything up as much as possible as I understand this is best practice and this has worked well.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>I have no experience of VBA or SQL at all. I've managed to work out how to change the occasional field property code (eg sorting on
 different data in a combo box that's linked to a table), but my capabilities only extend to very basic code adaptation, and it’s usually more a matter of taking hints seeing comments from kind souls like yourself on Access forums offering advice to newbies
 like myself trying to do the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>So ---- I have a Tutors Table, a Clients Table (the parents of the students who pay the fees), a Students Table, Assignments Table,
 Subjects table, Subject age groups Table, Locations Table, Schools (to cover places where students are at school and tutors teach if they're teaching), etc etc. I understand it's best practice to have separate tables for separate data categories and this is
 all logical and great.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>The problem</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>My problem seems to be a basic one that must be really common in database design. How do you use multi select boxes (I’m using ‘extended’
 boxes) on forms to capture and store information about a record that you can come back and refer to and, importantly, run queries on?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>I've created an extensive Tutor Form linked to the Tutors Table and for some of the labels I want to be able to enter data that might
 have one, several or lots of values from a list. (I haven't designed the Clients Form yet, but this will be big issue there also).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If I select several options from my (extended) multi select list boxes, they show up highlighted fine at that time, but when I move away to another
 record in the form, the selections don’t get saved in the form either because it just takes the blank field in the table I’ve linked to.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>I understand that multiple values selected in a multi select box (extended) in a form simply cannot be returned and stored in the Tutors
 Table because no table can store multiple pieces of data in one field (or, it seems, from other forums I’ve seen it cannot do this without applying complex code, and I understand from these forums that using code in this way is very bad practice anyway).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>BUT I thought, okay, the table may not be able to store the different values, but surely it must be possible for companies without an
 experienced Access coder (and there must be many such companies) to capture this info without coding? Perhaps, I thought, you can set it up so that the table just rejects the values coming back to it from the form, but the values still at least get stored
 in the form somehow, perhaps unbound (not that this would be ideal as I really want it in the table too, but if needs must...)?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Now I see this doesn't seem to be possible, and&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>I’ve seen newbies posting about this on other different Access forums and helpful souls come back with advice – but the advice invariably
 involves lots of coding, which I really don’t feel confident about.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Are there any simple ways round this…?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>A couple of examples for illustration</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Sorry if this is overkill, but I thought better to give a comprehensive explanation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>1.&nbsp; Locations</span></span></em></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>There are different locations that a tutor might want to work across – and I want to be able to easily select several choices for each
 record. I have a multi select box in my form that takes a list of choices from my Locations Table (a list of around 30 possible locations).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>&nbsp;2.
<em><span>Tutor availability</span></em></span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Keeping my example simple, in any week (where a day is divided into morning, afternoon and evening), a tutor might be available on Monday
 evening, Tuesday morning, Wednesday evening, Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon. I want to capture that simply.<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I have a multi select box taking data from days in the week – I don’t have a table for these as this seemed
 a straightforward short list that won’t change over time, and I just created my own list in the wizard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>3. ‘Subject and age group’ combinations
</span></span></em></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><em><span>This is really important for me to capture, store and run queries on.
</span></em><span>A tutor might want to tutor up to four subjects. He/she may want to tutor chemistry, for example, as a principal subject. And for that subject, he/she may want to cover some age groups
 but not others – eg “GCSE” and “A-level” but not “General primary” or “11+” or “13+”. I need to be able to capture and store all the ‘subject and age group’ combinations easily and clearly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>The way I've designed my form, I’m currently using four combo boxes – one for each of four possible subjects – “Subject 1” combo box,
 “Subject 2” combo, “Subject 3” combo box, “Subject 4” combo box, and these combo boxes each pull the list of possible subjects nicely from a Subject Table I created.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Then -- for each of these subjects, I’ve created a multi select list box underneath to allow me to enter one or more age group they
 want to cover in that subject. (ie labelled ‘Subject 1 age group(s)', 'Subject 2 age group(s)', ‘Subject 3 age group(s)’, and ‘Subject 4 age group(s)’. And these list boxes take the list of possible age groups nicely from an Age Group Table I created.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>The subjects are captured nicely, but the multi select age groups don’t stick on the form.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>Overall questions</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>- &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Is there any way to make the selections ‘stick’ in the multi select boxes so that
 I can see those selections any time and capture that data for later without having to use complex code? If there is some simple code that can do this, please let me know what code I need to create, where I need to put it, and if I need to create further tables
 to capture the multi select choices. Along with how these tables would need to be linked.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><span>-&nbsp;</span></span><span>Or, if it isn’t possible to use the (extended) multi select list boxes in this way
 without a lot of code that's going to be beyond me, how do non-database savvy people like me capture this information without resorting to really long tables and forms so that they can easily and efficiently capture each piece of info in a Yes/No field that
 a table is then able to store. I imagine all companies want to do this a lot, and there are many companies that don't have people familiar with coding.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>[ie Is there a more efficient way for me than having to re-design the Tutor Table to include 30 separate Yes/No field in the table and
 a separate check box in the form to allow for ticking each of the different possible locations? Is there a more efficient way for me than having to re-design the Tutor Table to have separate Yes/No fields for each of the different possible ‘Subject 1 age groups’,
 each of the ‘Subject 2 age groups’, etc? etc?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>In short, how do non-tech database savvy people cope with the very common databasing issue of having to capture and store multi select
 information for a particular label?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>Any help much appreciated! Thank you very much!</span></strong></p>

            <p><span>The way to do this is to model it by a set of correctly related tables.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What you are talking about are many-to-many relationship types, which, in a relational database are modelled by tables which resolve the relationship type into two or more one-to-many relationship types.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You must represent all the data by values in tables, not by value lists.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is a fundamental principle of the database relational model, The Information Principle (Codd's Rule #1), viz:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>'The entire information content of the database is represented in one and only one way, namely as explicit values in column positions in rows in tables'.</span></p>
<p><span>C J Date - <em>
Introduction to Database Systems</em>; 7th Edition; 2000</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Locations:<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a straightforward binary (2-way) many-to-many relationship type between tutors and locations, so in addition to a Tutors table and a Locations table you'll have a TutorLocations table.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The tables are related as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tutors---&lt;TutorLocations&gt;----Locations</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>TutorLocations will have foreign keys TutorID and LocationID referencing the primary keys of Tutors and Locations respectively.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In combination the two primary keys are the composite foreign key of the table.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The table might have other non-key columns representing other attributes of the relationship type.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp; </span>
TutorAvaialability:<span>&nbsp; </span>Again you need to model the binary relationship type between Tutors and Sessions table by a TutorSessions table in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Subjects and Age Group:<span>&nbsp; </span>You will firstly need to model the relationship types between Tutors and Subjects, and between Tutors and Age Groups in the same way as above, with TutorSubjects and TutorAgeGroups table.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If a tutor does not offer all subjects to all age groups, and vice versa, you will also need to model the relationship type between the TutorSubjects and TutorAgeGroups by another table with three columns TutorID, SubjectID and AgeGroupID, all three
 columns comprising the composite primary key of the table.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the interface forget about using multi-select list boxes, they are unnecessary and you cannot use them without writing code as it is necessary to iterate the list box's ItemsSelected collection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Within a Tutors form embed three subforms, each in continuous forms view, each based on one of the three tables which model the relationship types.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To save space you can place each subform on a separate page of a tab control if you wish.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Each subform is linked to the parent form on TutorID.<span>&nbsp; </span>Taking locations as an example, a row is inserted into the subform for each location at which the tutor is available for work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The location is select from a combo box bound to the LocationID column in TutorLocations, set up as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ControlSource:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>LocationID</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ControlSource:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>LocationID (for a bound control; leave blank if the combo box is an unbound 'navigational' control)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>RowSource:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>SELECT LocationID, Location FROM Locations ORDER BY Location;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BoundColumn:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1</span></p>
<p><span>ColumnCount:<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>2</span></p>
<p><span>ColumnWidths:<span>&nbsp;
</span>0cm</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm afraid that I might not be able to address any follow-up questions you might have in relation to the above as I am about to undertake a major system rebuild, so will be out of action for
 a while.</span></p>

            <p>You can do this without code by using junction tables and subforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, to store the location preferences of the tutors, create a table TutorLocations with (at least) two fields: a field linking to the tutor ID, and a field linking to the location ID.</p>
<p>

    <title>Word 2013 Compatibility Issues&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benpeter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 Compatibility Issues&#33;</h2>
                    I created a document in Word 2007 which i use as the template for creating replica documents. Because these replicas are created on the fly, they use the Word document on the client machine they are being created! That is, if the machine has Word 2013,
 the template in 2007 is copied from the server and reproduced in a Word 2013 format.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem is that, my template in 2007 is extremely modified and does not follow margins of the documents. In fact i use margins which are closer to the edge of the page because i want to produce more than one of the copied templates per page. When i
 try to produce the document in Word 2013, it uses the normal margin thus making my copied and pasted document extend to the right and bottom effectively obscuring its full view.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If Word 2013 open my template in a compatibility mode, everything works fine, but each time it opens it as a normal document, Margins are altered.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is it that i am not doing good!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind Regards</div>

    <title>Word 2016 not starting and slow response to spell check - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valerasmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 not starting and slow response to spell check</h2>
                    <p>For about a week to 10 days I have been having a problem with Word 2016 not starting. The small blue startup screen pops up and just continues to say starting forever or sometimes just goes away after a few seconds. I have tried starting in safe mode but
 this does not work either. Usually I have to reboot the computer and then when I open Word it will start and either say do you want to open in safe mode or if I have tried to open in safe mode before rebooting, it will ask me if I want to repair. I have done
 the quick repair for Microsoft Office and the online repair. Neither worked. There are no add-ins enabled. I use Microsoft Word for my part time work at home and this is killing me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a medical word spellchecker from Dorland's installed. I say this because it seems it is not catching some of the words that it should and if I right click on a misspelled word for suggestions the app is extremely slow to respond and even "goes
 gray" in the window with a "not responding" in the title bar at the top for a few seconds. I have searched support but have not encountered anything that has helped me so far.</p>

<p>No recent changes other than the 2-3 major microsoft updates that have installed in the last few weeks. No new software installed. No error messages because it just never gets fully loaded until i reboot the computer and it requests to boot in safe mode
 because it did not load properly the last time it was started or if i try to open in safe mode and it fails, then reboot, it mentions that safe mode failed to start the last time and would i like to repair.
</p>
<br />
<p>I have been out of town since Friday and just now started the computer. Today Word is loading OK. Will update if there&nbsp; continues to be a problem.</p>

<p>I have been bothered by webpages poping up when I am using the internet. I disallowed all pop-ups in&nbsp;tools/internet options/privacy and still got these pop-ups. I then went to tools/internet options/security and pasted the websites in the restricted sites.
 This did not stop the intrusion either. Can you help?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - Address book is not showing contacts</h2>
                    <p>I've gone through the messages that cover this problem with no luck yet.&nbsp; I used Windows Easy Transfer to copy data and settings from an older Vista computer to the new Win8 computer.&nbsp; After the transfer, everything seems fine except that I can't bring up
 anything in the address book.&nbsp; The contacts folder is good, but using the articles on Folder Propterties for Contacts, then "Show this folder as an e-mail address book", where I should be able to click the check box to use Contacts, the check box is grayed
 out, and I can't click it.&nbsp; Dell tech support spent 3.5 hours remotely connected to my computer and couldn't sort it out, telling me I need to go to Microsoft for an answer.&nbsp; This same situation has happened on 2 Dell Vostro 740 computers under the same circumstances.&nbsp;
 The Dell tech tried creating the new profile and everything else I've found mentioned in other Microsoft articles with no luck.&nbsp; A 3rd computer of the same type, bought at the same time with the same software setup, with the same transfer circumstances, has
 no problems at all with this.&nbsp; Thanks for your assistance.</p>

            I haven't tried yet, but watched while the Dell tech worked remotely and as I go through the instructions I find&nbsp; on "How to create and configure email profiles in Outlook", the procedures there&nbsp;were followed exactly&nbsp;as far as I can tell.&nbsp; The tech went
 through the routine several times, and in the end, said there was a problem there that he couldn't fix, that I needed to contact Microsoft.&nbsp; He worked remotely for over 3 hours, and in the end, he had lost my email files.&nbsp; Thankfully he backed up things, but
 getting it restored took a second call to Dell tech support.&nbsp;

    <title>SAVING email attachments DIRECT to SITE FOLDER APP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windsorinformation  say:</h3>
<h2>            SAVING email attachments DIRECT to SITE FOLDER APP</h2>
                    
<p>I was sent an email via Office 365 Exchange. &nbsp; I was logged in to the SITE. &nbsp; I was emailed &nbsp;25 images. !</p>

<p>The only "download" choice &nbsp;is to download all of themin to the ONE DRIVE MAILBOX. &nbsp; &nbsp;Problem is I want them on my MICROSOFT IMAGE MANAGER that is located on my SITE PAGE? &nbsp; &nbsp;what gives?</p>
<p>What I had to do was: &nbsp;</p>
<p>1) download all off the PHOTOS to my Local drive &nbsp;(where I do not want them), then upload them to my IMAGE LIBRARY &nbsp;(I used file explorer).</p>
<p>2) Next I had to go back and delete these images from my LOCAL FOLDER. &nbsp;</p>
<p>the process is cumbersome</p>
<p>I also &nbsp;tried SAVING TO MY ONEDRIVE FOR BUSINESS - It ONLY puts the attachments in it's &nbsp;SELF CREATED &nbsp;"email attachment" folder, &nbsp;but that folder IS NOT available &nbsp;to upload from from the IMAGE APP that is on my site?</p>
<p>I remind all that the whole point of a CLOUD SERVER product like share point is to virtually SERVE files to people. &nbsp; I must be missing something quite major here?</p>

<p>Hi WindsorInformation,<br />
<br />
Do the Office 365 Exchange mean Outlook Web App (click the Mail tile in Office portal)? If yes, we can only save the image attachments to local drive or personal OneDrive for Business library. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
If we use the Outlook 2016 client, we can save them to the team site library after we have synced the library to our computers.
<br />
<br />
About the image app in the My Site page, I noticed you have posted another thread in our forum, are they the same questions? Is that app designed by your team or from the SharePoint App Store? Could share with us more information about this app?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>hi windsorinformation,</p>
<p>thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>to understand your situation better, may i know if you add the image app via going to onedrive for business site
<strong>&gt; settings &gt; add an app &gt; sharepoint store</strong>?</p>
<p>if so, i try to install it and get a result of many similar image apps. therefore, could you share with the app name or a screenshot about the app so that we can try to install the same app and reproduce the issue?<br />

    <title>Subtracting dates then using vlookup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karischultz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subtracting dates then using vlookup</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a spreadsheet that is to calculate dates within the following time periods of 30 days, 90 days, then 120 days. From there I need to look that up in a chart of weights.&nbsp; I know how to subtract the start date and then get my 30, 90 and 120
 day result, but what I am having trouble with is trying to combine this into one formula so that I can just have it all do it in one "swoop" so to speak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My example is below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start date:&nbsp; 11/20/2016</p>
<p>End date:&nbsp; =Startdate-30</p>
<p>Result: </p>
<p>Based on my result date I would pull from the data chart</p>
<p>Complete my percentage calculations and format accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here is where I mess up when I start into the 90 and 120 day counts.&nbsp; I am also having trouble with the fact that I have the cell automatically converting to a date, when I want it to stay General.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assistance would be requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and have a great evening.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can nest formulas in other formulas. You don't say what formula you use to pull data from the chart, but let's say it's a VLookup formula.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you calculate the date with a formula, and if you would like to use the result in a Vlookup, then you can use something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start date:&nbsp; 11/20/2016 is in cell A1</p>
<p>End date:&nbsp; =A1-30</p>
<p>combine result into Vlookup formula: =Vlookup(A1-30,lookupTable,2,False)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replace the "lookupTable" bit with the range of your lookup table and adjust the column number and fourth parameter as you see fit.</p>

<p>Hi SiddiquiM,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, the problem only occurs when a user schedule a meeting without adding WebEx on the Outlook client. Since the WebEx application and Cisco Jabber is out of boundary, we recommend that you seek help from WebEx support or Cisco
 support as this matter is best handled by their level of support and expertise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Outlook2016 - Setting up IMAP won&#39;t let me enter a login that&#39;s not an email address</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,,, trying to setup an IMAP account in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; &nbsp;First thing it does is ask for your email address but I think it uses that as your login.&nbsp; My login is not an email address so it won't let me enter it.&nbsp; Setup will try to log onto the server
 but obviously can't because it doesn't have my login!&nbsp; Is there a way to manually enter this stuff?&nbsp; The regular "advanced options" "let me set up my account manually" doesn't let me change the login.&nbsp; Any hints?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Close outlook, restart it using the /manageprofiles switch and add the account using the familiar old dialog.  (You can also do this from Control panel - search for mail - but some builds don't have the Mail applet). 
<br />
<br />To use the /manageprofiles switch, right-click on the Start button and choose Run or press Windows key + R to open the Run command.
<br />Type or paste the following into the Open field and press Enter or click OK to restart Outlook. (There is a space before /.)
<br /> outlook.exe /manageprofiles
<br />
<br />Click Profiles to create a new profile or Email accounts to view or edit your account if you only have one profile.

    <title>E52 and 16GB Transcend microSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zlikovski  say:</h3>
<h2>            E52 and 16GB Transcend microSD</h2>
                    
<p>After I upgraded my E52 with Transcend 16GB card phone started to act weird. Much longer time to turn on phone, no startup logo (hands with tone). Even somehow changed time and date by itself.</p>
<p>After removing card (or putting Transcend or Nokia 2GB card) startup logo reappears and it boots up much quicker.</p>
<p>I tried to format card on phone and use it without any additional files on it but same story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone experiencing similar issue?</p>

            Although the E52 is touted as being able to support 16gb SD cards, it most likely is causing the handset to run slowly. Have you got another 16gb card you can borrow/use just to see if it has the same effects when booting up?<br />
You could have a faulty card.

<p>Card is working flawlessly in every other device.</p>
<p>It is Class6 so I don’t think that is slow or that there is problem with card. At the moment I don’t have other brand to try but I tried several 16GB Transcend and it is all same.</p>
<p>E52 hardware also seems to be OK because with 2GB card it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have new problem – my E52 is messing up time and date after being turned off and turned on again.</p>
<p>Also it just freezes and reset itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that E52 doesn't’t have 16GB support (or maybe just support Nokia cards) with current firmware?</p>

<h2>            I want to remove extra lines after signature in replies.</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one know how to remove the extra lines/spaces after you apply your signature in a email your replying to other than deleting the lines each time? I send an email every 15 minutes and its annoying to have to remove this from each email sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I read an email, hit reply, write my message, click the signature most associated with the message, then I must click the last of the signature and hit delete 3 times to bring the below message up (for most people reading my emails they read on
 Blackberry's so these spaces can't be there!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried tons of ways to make this stop</p>
<p>1) went into each signature and made sure there were no spaces/lines blank after my closing message and name</p>
<p>2) Read somewhere online to do a shift/enter for each line- didn't work</p>
<p>3) Also read a tip for ctrl+enter at the end of each line, didn't work&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I have my closing message but there are 2-3 extra spaces below. I need them gone, help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yadda, yadda, Yadda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Me</p>

            <p>I realize it's been over a year, but I was having the same problem and stumbled onto this post and had a gut feeling... that appears to have worked. &nbsp;Yup, just closed and opened outlook (2016 fyi) again and it still works. &nbsp;I uploaded a cropped &amp; blacked
 out screenshot jpeg to show what happens when I hit reply. &nbsp;There is only one space from the bottom of my signature to the slight separator line. Almost feels like it's right on top of previous email. &nbsp;FINALLY.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into my signature to update it. &nbsp;I used the arrow key to bring cursor down as far as it would go...which was about 3 lines below. &nbsp;Then I hit backspace until the cursor came up to the very right edge of my logo at the bottom. &nbsp;I stopped there and
 simply clicked 'save' to save the new signature. &nbsp;And viola! &nbsp;No more spaces after hitting Reply. &nbsp;It only took me 10 years to think of trying that. &nbsp;Stupido! &nbsp;I hope this reaches someone who is annoyed with those spaces. I'm not likely to follow up on this
 post. &nbsp;Best of luck and I hope it works for you! &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Avoid log in every time I start my computer</h2>
                    Up until a few months ago I did not have to log in every time I started up my computer but now it is like it was the first time I used skype; i have to log in, check sound and video, and choose a profile picture. How can I get out of these unnecessary
 steps?

<h2>            0x80070005 Authentication Error for Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>MSE worked perfectly for a while, now it won't install the updates. I can manually download them, no problem, but if I attempt to automatically do it, I get the error</p>
<p>"Error code: 0x80070005 Error Description: MSE wasn't able to access the updates on the server because the authentication failed or the authentication method isn't supported."</p>
<p>My Windows 7 Home Premium is bought and paid for, so I'm not sure what the problem is. Also, MSE along with ThreatFire are the only antivirus programs that have been installed on this computer.</p>

<p>If threatfire provides any overlapping coverage that MSE does (spyware, virus, rootkit, trojans, worms), in realtime, you must remove it.</p>
<p>Also, check the date and time on your PC clock.</p>
<p>And, review this thread:&nbsp; <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msescan/thread/3d297b07-9c99-42c0-904c-3c7fd86f004a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
