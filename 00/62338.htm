Hello,<br />
I sell items on GUNBROKER.com and recently my "item sold" emails from them have been marked as "<span>This message looks very suspicious to our SmartScreen filters, so we've blocked attachments, pictures, and links for your safety</span>"<br />
<br />
As of today they have been blocked completely, and I do not even receive them now. &nbsp;These are legitimate emails and very important to me, as these are notifications that an item has been sold, and how to contact the customer.
<br />
<br />
Gunbroker.com is a 100% legit business site. Can you PLEASE remove the blocks on these incoming emails??<br />
Thank you for your time</p>

                    I need to use a generic USB webcam with W98SE laptop, Windows cannot find drivers. Have loaded webcam software - driverless - which opens as expected on laptop but no drivers means no can find the webcam. Have hunted internet but none listed. Can anyone
 supply me with drivers or point me to a source?

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft is ending support for these products because they are outdated and these older operating systems can expose customers to security risks. We recommend that
 customers who are still running Windows 98 to a newer, more secure Microsoft operating system.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition Support ends on July 11, 2006</span></p>

            Thanks - but I am very well aware 98 is old hat. The driver/software is needed to run a generic webcam on an equally ancient laptop as a security camera monitoring a remote site. No other activity and the laptop will never be connected to internet. My
 request remains the same.

    <title>Boot Loop after Reset on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khanhnguyen1998  say:</h3>
<h2>            Boot Loop after Reset on Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello everyone,&nbsp;<br />
I'm having this issue of boot loop after resetting my computer. The OS is Windows 10. The computer is Lenovo X250.<br />
Yesterday I reset my computer, but its not factory reset. I just wanted to wipe out all of my data because some of them are broken and harmful. Everything was pretty good, the reset part is done and I was on the installation part. Howevet, I left my computer
 at home while I went out to meet my fellas at the library. My mom thought my computer is turned on for no reason - she held the power button and turned it off.I returned home and turned it back on. But first it was a loop saying that it was a installation
 error. I googled it and tried to do the Shift+F10 and changed something from 1 to 3. I solved it but now I'm stuck at another problem. I had this boot loop for 3 hours already. It started up, had the Windows 10 logo and the circle, it said setting up ( configure
 setting ) at 64%. And it started over again and again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Please, how can I fix this problem? I can't get access to my Windows or Computer and any data because of this loop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>It doesn't appear any error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. It starts up ( Think Pad screen ) -&gt; the Windows 10 logo and the circle -&gt; The configuring settings screen which just stops at 64% -&gt; it starts over again just in 2 seconds after the configuring settings screen pop-up.</p>
<p>2. Yes,<span>&nbsp;it does respond when I press BIOS setup keys. It transfers to the Startup Interrupt Menu which tells me to press either ESC, F1, F10, F20.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm downloading&nbsp;</span><span>Windows installation tool, but is it okay if I'm using an USB? Because the file I'm downloading has something to do with dis ( .iso extention ).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you again for your help.</span></p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>An infinite loop with blank screen or commonly called as stop error, will appear if an issue causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help resolve this issue, we suggest checking this link: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot blue screen errors.</a></strong></p>

</p><p>As for the reinstalling Windows, if you still have your Windows 10 installation disk, you can still retrieve your upgrade license.

    <title>Which USB Hub to connect&#47;charge Wireless Controllers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> metaljesus85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which USB Hub to connect&#47;charge Wireless Controllers</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys!</p>

<p>I'm lacking free USB ports on my old 360 and am looking to buy an USB hub.</p>

<p>Now I'm wondering what kind of Hub I 'd need ... Either a passive one which draws it's power from the console or an active one which I need to connect to power supply ...</p>
<p>What I would like the Hub to do is: ....</p>
<p>Being able to connect 1 wired Controller and connect 3 additional wireless controllers via recharge cable simultaniously ...</p>
<p>additionally it would be great if the wireless controllers would not only work but also recharge while being connected to the hub.</p>
<p>also the recharge functionality of the xbox should not be impaired. e.g.: when there is a controller to charge while i turn of the console the controller will continue charging until it's fully charged ... this should be working ^^</p>

<p>thanks for reading my post and also thanks to all those who answer :)</p>
<p>lg</p>

<p>Hello </p>
<p>Sorry you are having this issue.</p>
<p>At this time i do not believe that xbox 360 consoles are compatible with a usb hub. &nbsp; But after some searching i did find out that there some hubs that are compatible with xbox 360 console that are after market and would work for your problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;Just google
 &lt;xbox 360 usb hubs&gt; and you should get some results</p>
<p>But on the new slim xbox 360 consoles they have extra usb ports on them to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>Thanks You </p>
<p>CAP</p>

<p>Well ... I have read some tests about the Battery Charger and found out that it creates a humming sound or pheeping when it charges. since i have places my xbox in my bedroom i don't want to have those annoying sounds while i try to sleep. thus i would prefer
 a USB hub solution where i can directly charge my battery packs while they are still set into the controller.</p>
<p>and therefore my question - to keep it simple - would be:</p>
<p>should i buy an active or passive usb hub ?</p>

            <p>Not entirely sure what tests those were but I can assure you that there is no humming or beeping. &nbsp;I have 2 MS chargers and 5 battery packs and have yet to hear any sounds while they are charging. &nbsp;Perhaps it was 3rd party hardware and not MS licensed hardware that was being tested.</p>

<p>well, actually they weren't tests ... but user reviews and if there are - let's say - about 5 people only on amazon who claim that there is sound coming from the device and maybe others on some other online markets i better think twice about it.</p>
<p>also: i often have friends over to play together where we need all 4 controllers, since one of my controller is wired i have no usb slot left (with kinect and the wireless adapter attached to the xbox) ... i have the wireless adapter for about one week now
 and until now when all 4 controllers where in use none went out of energy ...</p>
<p>you see my dilemma ... even with a quick charger i won't be able to keep all 3 wired controllers running simultaniously ...</p>

<p>Bought an Ultron Sedna USB HUB (link: <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B002USATOM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.amazon.de/.../B002USATOM</a>) and it seems to work.</p>
<p>Funny thing though ... When i plugged the power source into my wall i heard a highfrequence sound ... seems that the power supply cable isn't well build ... hook up another power cable which seems to work fine. The first USB Slot (most upward slot) seems
 to draw it's power from the xbox while all other slots are charged by power supply. i connected everything, plugged my corded controller into the hub and pressed the Xbox Button on the controller ... nothing happened :( i turned on the console the old fashioned
 way and ... tada ! the controller connected to Slot 1 and worked properly. then i plugged a charge cable (with wireless controller) into usb slot 2 (on the hub) ... it turned on, connected as Controller 2 and started charging ...</p>
<p>all in all: works fine for me :D</p>

<h2>            Sign in with a Microsoft account instead creates a new profile in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to convert a Local Account on Windows 10 to use a Microsoft account. When I use the "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead" option, it does not give me the "Switch to a Microsoft account on this PC". I get a "Make it yours" screen. When I
 put my Microsoft account (not a Microsoft email account, a gmail account) email and password and click "Sign in", it spins its wheels for a while and then prompts to Set up a PIN. Set a PIN does not work (Something went wrong) and I have to Skip for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all this I find the Local account has not been converted to a Microsoft account. A second profile has been created for the Microsoft account. I do not want a second profile. I want to convert the Local account profile that has been in use for considerable
 time.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Have you setup a PIN for your local account?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If yes, I suggest you to use the Pin to finish configuring your Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have not set a PIN for your local you may remove the PIN option. You may follow the steps below to remove PIN.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to settings and click on the Accounts option.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now select sign in option and remove the PIN.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also login to your Gmail account and check if you get any verification code while configuring.</span></p>

            <p>Yes, I have set a pin on the local account. I have observed in the forums that the PIN seems to give troubles, so I have tried it with and without a PIN on the local account. That doesn't seem to change the behaviour of trying to convert the local account
 to a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With or without a local PIN, my attempt to convert the local account to a Microsoft account stumbles *after* the "Make it yours" page on the setting of a PIN. I don't know whether this is a symptom of the problem or not. I am expecting to see the "Switch
 to a Microsoft account on this PC" page as documented by many. I never see the "Switch to a Microsoft account on this PC" page.</p>

I know you said you tried some of this - but this is a procedure - so try it in order...</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong> </p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>

<p><br />
Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>How to create basic disk from unallocated space&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> surya012in  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create basic disk from unallocated space&#63;</h2>
                    I have recently brought Lenovo laptop and installed Windows 7 ultimate.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As lenovo took 1 partition and windows took another partition for storing some special files, I had only option to create more 2 partitions to use.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, I installed windows in one partition and left other one which has 360 GB space.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Luckily&nbsp;if you that windows is providing dynamic partitions. So, I shrunk my 360GB drive to 100. Now I have 260 GB unallocated space. Thus I tried to create new drive using that space but windows is showing the following error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Error: There is not enough space to allocate disk(s) -- not exactly the same words but that's the whole meaning.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My friend suggested on idea before installing Win7 before I installed as it allows limited number of disks to partition.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He suggested to first insert a Windows XP CD and partition memory before installing (inserting) Windows 7.&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, when I installed windows XP CD now, its showing an error. (I didn't not that error but I couldn't make it). The error was showed before the setup has actually searched for a installed windows OS.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to create disks on that unallocated space? and how it is possible. I rather like to go for basic disks, so, is there any way to do that?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Your laptop will have been supplied with a hidden recovery partition, you have to access this following Lenovo's instructions in order to make your system recovery cd/dvd disk set. As if anything goes wrong with the Laptop you will be stuck, with no means
 of recovering the system to factory spec. And without wishing to be rude, that scenario looks increasingly likely with the fiddling you are doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And no, as you have been told, you cannot create 4 basic drives as the system allready has 3 and the maximum is 4.</p>
<p>And again no, your friend is giving incorrect information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do yourself a favour, restore the system to factory state, make the recovery disk set, use windows update for important updates and get on with using your PC and stop fiddling - its all going to end in disaster otherwise</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, thanks for your quick answer.</span></p>
<p><span>I did what you suggest but couldn’t find the specific entry.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is what is shown under Administrative Templates:</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Some managers of digital certificate, as the SafeSign, record our request without enabling user type "Insert Smart Card" or something.<br />
Many seek a solution to remove such information from the login screen without removing the SafeSign, but without success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The solution for this case is as follows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">1. If you have a manager smart card to enable your access to digital certificate, follow the steps below. Otherwise remove all of them, especially the SafeSign.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">2. If you use the SafeSign (typically used by Certdsign, etc, to provide access to digital certificate) and are logged into Windows 7, download this remover registration
<a href="http://o-iu.com/del-AETCPSS1.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">at this link</a>, unzip the file and apply the registry change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">3. If you have installed SafeSign is a different version of Windows and tried to remove the file available but the key was not found or did not result in the removal of the registry, and the registry edit (type regedit.exe in the
 search menu in "start") and navigate to the following key:&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Authentication\\Credential Providers\\</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Go there by clicking on the keys that appear (they are files with multiple numbers in brackets. Example: "{232,876,589,380,658}") and look for the key that has defined the word as "aetcpss1". Finding the file, right-click, delete
 the key. Do not delete or change any remaining keys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">4. If you have installed another digital certificate manager, unlike SafeSign, try to locate the configuration file associated with it, and following the step described above, delete the corresponding key. DO NOT ALTER OR DELETE
 the other keys, such as those that contain the terms "GenericProvider", "NPProvider", "VaultCredProvider", "PasswordProvider", "Smartcard Pin Provider", "WinBio Credential Provider" or "CertCredProvider".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">5. Reboot and ...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">...the your problems are over.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">f you have installed SafeSign, try this simple solution: completely remove the SafeSign. Install a newer version of the same. Uncheck the "Credential Provider" option. The latest versions can come with this option enabled or not.
 By default should already be disabled. If it does not work, clean the registry by following the steps above.</p>

<p>I would try:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Remove the existing Canon drivers and software - check in Control Panel-&gt;Progarms &amp; Features and by right clciking on it in Device and Printers and selecting Remove Device.</p>
<p>2. Disconnect your printer form the PC.</p>
<p>3. Download &amp; install&nbsp;the latest Windows 7 drivers from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/imageprograf_series/imageprograf_ipf710#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/imageprograf_series/imageprograf_ipf710#DriversAndSoftware</a></p>
<p>4. Install the other software from the above same link.</p>
<p>5. Reconnect your printer.</p>
<p>There is also a firmware upgrade you may want to install.</p>
<p>Make sure printer is set as default in Devices and Printers.</p>

<h2>            Skype upgrade</h2>
                    I am running windows7 and was told I needed to upgrade my Skype but now nothing works.&nbsp; Initially after the&nbsp;upgrade It asked to update my Skype profile but nothing worked (skip, next or change photo) - it just hangs.&nbsp; After many restarts it got past that
 - without updating (I don't know why) but then appeared to have problems with my webcam and sound system.&nbsp; I get the main welcome screen but can't pick anything (start a conversation or a contact name or even a test call).&nbsp; How do I get a Skype that works?

            Hi  Anthony,
<br />
<br />Uninstall your current version of Skype . . .
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app:

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

    <title>How do I find anything&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I find anything&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm about to lose my mind so forgive me for my near hysteria.&nbsp; I've been searching for a place to find instructions or ask questions about Windows 10 and I keep finding lots of stunning video blurbs about all the great new things. But I have specific questions
 and need a user manual. So I find this forum, which I thought was specifically for Windows 10, and enter my title and a popup is immediately in my face telling me there are answers to my questions about finding things in Windows 8 if I just click here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please: where is my search box to find things on the computer. I want My Computer. All I get is Cortana which does a Bing search for me. I don't want or need a Bing search, I want My Computer. Where is it? And where is my search box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I change the photo setting so that Irfan View opens my photos by default? I tried really hard to find this but all I find is "default apps" to view photos and that simply takes me to the App Store. I don't want an app. I want my good old fashioned
 IrfanView Program that shows me the name of the photo when I'm working on it and shows me the folder the photo is in. The thing called Photos on here is probably very nice but there's no user manual and without instructions, I'm lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see I made a big mistake here by getting Windows 10. I can't find anything, I don't like all the stuff getting in my face.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Edge, I need and want my favorite places/bookmarks close at hand. I'm sure Edge has them somewhere but, again, no user manual or instructions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find Sticky Notes? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I really want to edit my photos. I want to download them into my computer into the folder of my choosing and then I want to view and edit them and then move them to the appropriate folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might start drinking......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, I had to respond to Cortana's introduction before I could get to the options on a search. Thank you for responding because once I knew there was another way, I kept scrolling up and down and finally clicked on "got it" and the whole thing changed.
 (Unfortunately for me, my computer doesn't have the right microphone cuz that would be fun). &nbsp;That said, when I did a search for control panel in "my stuff," it just gave me some odds &amp; ends but not the control panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still can't find a search box when I click the start button. &nbsp;Where might it be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was aware of the one in File Explorer but when I enter control panel or internet settings and select This PC, it just spins and spins and spins. Then I tried control panel in Windows/C but same thing, spin, spin, spin. No results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the saving of pictures/downloads, when I clicked on the download button in the gmail, it scans for viruses and then saves it somewhere. That's why I was looking for the control panel so I could change that setting so it asks me where to store it and
 let me give it a file name as I'm doing it. I'm not sure I explained that very well but I like to download every photo into a file and then edit them and "move" them to their final destination. But I like to name them right away so I remember what they are
 (I get gobs of old genealogy photos at a time) and I wasn't given the option to "save as." I'm sure it's in the control panel settings but I'm struggling to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for adjusting to change - I loved my Windows XP and kept that as long as possible. When I finally gave in, just a few months ago, it was to 8.1 and I struggled with that until someone told me I could just operate it all on "desktop" mode and I was getting
 by but still confused and not happy. So again I thank you for helping a stodgy old lady with ADD who doesn't watch video or like all those bright colored boxes confusing me. &nbsp;I'm trying, I really am. But I would do so much better if I had a user manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I ask one more question: I've checked everywhere I can think of but I still can't figure out what the green check marks on items in OneDrive mean.&nbsp;</p>

=====================================<br />
I don't have a specific answer for your issue but I recently<br />
had a similar issue with an 'svideo to RCA cable' connection <br />
and the solution was to change the computer's desktop <br />
screen resolution to a lower number. Also...I had to open<br />
nVidia control panel and select Clone.

<h2>            Upgrade from Windows 7 and 8.1 Home Editions to Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have several Notebooks with Windows 7, 8, 8.1 running on home editions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we'd like to join them to our Windows domain and have to change the Windows edition to Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anytime Upgrade is no longer a option, so we need to buy Windows 10 Pro OEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 Pro OEM: Is it possible to get a license key to convert Windows 7, 8, and 8.1&nbsp;from Home to Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to upgrade (keeping all data) from this old Windows versions to Windows 10 AND change the Editon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards<br />
Thomas</p>
