<h2>            0x8E5E03F9 in Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to stare up Windows Live Mail I get the message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail could not be started. Closing Windows Live Mail. Your calendar contains corrupt data that is forcing Windows Live Mail to close (0x8E5E03F9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried re-installing Windows Live Mail and also the repair option. It still comes up with the same window and I can't start Windows Live Mail, how do I rectify this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>I ended up doing a search for this error because even after doing the repair and install options I still had the same error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution I found that worked is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Live Mail is still closed, by this I mean that the error window is not still on screen, access the following path, I entered it into the top of the explorer window because some of the folders are hidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Users\????\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you put your user in place of the ????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so in my case that is Andy so the path for me was:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Users\Andy\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should then see a folder named "Calendar" rename this&nbsp; to "Calendar.old" without the quotes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>close the window and then run "Windows Live Mail"</p>
<p>this worked for me, I didn't have to re-boot my computer.</p>

            <blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You shouldn't have to configure a Hotmail account to use POP3. If you do, there will be no synchronization; the program will only download new messages from the inbox. You won't be able to see sent messages on your other computers, for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you perhaps enable two-step verification for this account? If so, you'll have to generate a unique
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
app password</a> to use in Windows Live Mail. Press Ctrl-Shift-T to set up the account again, this time copying the app password from your Hotmail account page and pasting it into the
<em>Add your email accounts</em> wizard. If it now works properly, you can right-click on the POP3 account and remove it. Note that any messages in the drafts, junk, sent and deleted folders will be permanently deleted when you do this, so copy any you want
 to keep to the new account first.</p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community where you can find all the required information about Windows operating systems.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>You get crash dump notification as<b>
</b></span><span>tmetmger.sys driver_unloaded_without_cancelling_pending_operations when the computer is started.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue may happen because of some recent changes to the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To work with the issue, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span>
</span><b><span>Use the Last Known Good Configuration feature</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Method 2: Repair the Windows XP installation</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure that the CD or DVD drive is the first priority startup device. See your computer documentation for information about how to do this.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Insert the Windows XP CD into the CD or DVD drive, and then restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When the instruction to "Press any key to boot from CD" appears, press a key. Your computer starts from the Windows XP CD.</span></p>

Hi Les</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the disk you are using was provided for the computer with Windows 7 installed, that driver may not work with Windows 8. Check with Gateway support for updated drivers.</p>

    <title>Windows Photo Viewer cannot open this file because either the file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kshizzle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer cannot open this file because either the file format is not supported or you do not have the latest updates to photo viewer</h2>
                    When I want to view JPEG images it usually works fine, but for some reason some JPEG images don't work. Like this JPEG picture will be open-able but another won't. On an XP/Vista it would work fine, totally viewable. But on this Windows 7 on Photo Viewer,
 it just doesn't work. Also, is there any way to view GIF animations? It's annoying to have to open them in IE or something. If not, will the old photo viewer from XP work on a windows 7?

            Hi kshizzle,<br />
<br />
As the sentence suggests, the picture file format may not be supported or you do not have the latest updates to photo viewer.<br />
<br />
Check if you don't have file extensions displayed by default, right-click on an offending image and look at the file's name.<br />
<br />
If you have not set it as default program to open images, do this :<br />
<br />
<strong>Change which programs Windows uses by default</strong> <br />
<br />
A default program is the program that Windows uses when you open a particular type of file, such as a music file, an image, or a webpage. For example, if you have more than one web browser installed on your computer, you can choose one of them to be the default
 browser.<br />
<br />
Open Default Programs by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Default Programs.<br />
<br />
In Default Programs, you can:<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set your default programs. Use this option to choose which programs you want Windows to use by default. If you want to use your Windows Live Photo Gallery or Photo Gallery to open all photos, use this option.<br />
<br />
<strong>Refer to this link:</strong> <br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default</a>
<br />
<br />
In order to troubleshoot your issue, I'd suggest you to change a picture’s file type/file format and verify if it helps. Though digital pictures come in a variety of file formats, most of the pictures on your computer probably use the common JPEG format. Most
 digital cameras save pictures in the JPEG format to maintain good visual quality without creating large files. In addition, many programs can only open pictures that are saved in the JPEG format. If you have a picture stored in another file format, such as
 TIFF or bitmap, you can make a copy of it in JPEG format. It's also possible to save a copy of a JPEG picture in a different format. When you save a copy of a picture in a different format, the original picture is not replaced. Please let us know if this helped!<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Notes: </strong>If you want to protect a JPEG picture from additional loss of visual quality, you can save it as a TIFF, which, unlike a JPEG, does not lose small amounts of visual quality every time it is edited and saved. Paint does not work with
 all file formats. For example, you cannot open a picture in RAW format by using Paint. For file types that Paint does not support, you should use a photo editing program.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Is there any way to view GIF animations?</strong> <br />
<br />
Usually Windows 7 and Vista opens any GIF (.gif) images using Internet Explorer. However in Windows 7 you can view the .gif files in Windows Photo Viewer. You can refer the following link to get more information on the supported picture file types in Windows
 7:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Understanding-picture-file-types" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Understanding-picture-file-types</a>
<br />
<strong><br />
You can try to open the .gif files using Windows Photo Viewer by following the below mentioned steps:<br />
</strong><br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on any of the gif image, open properties, click Change.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ‘Open with’ window, open Other Programs and select Windows Photo Viewer as default program to open with.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Ok, all your gif images will open in Windows default photo viewer.<br />
<br />
If you have picture files with .gif extensions, for example, they will not appear in Photo Gallery and can't be edited using the Fix pane. If you want to see these pictures in Photo Gallery, you should change their file type to a format that Photo Gallery can
 display (JPEG is recommended).<br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 S reboots when I sign onto my Xbox Live Profile</h2>
                    
<p>I just got a new xbox 360 S 4gb model, then i ordered a 250gb drive from amazon installed it moved over 100gbs to the drive it then began rebooting over and over sent the drive back got a new 250gb drive downloaded 70gbs of data. I sign onto my xbox live
 profile and the console restarts as soon as it signs me on. Does not do this with other profiles, I deleted my profile and recovered but still doing it. Beginning to think I have a problem with the console, related to data somehow.</p>

<p>it's actually on a flash drive at the moment, it also did it on the 4gb and the HD. It stopped doing it after I formatted the hard drive. I'am now slowly downloading data again a little here and there until i get back up to the 70gb i had on it just incase
 i downloaded to much to fast and overheated the HD and maybe corrupted some data.</p>

<p>got a different console........put in the 250gb Hard drive logged on to my profile. Reboots, tried a different profile reboots. So at this point I'm left with the conclusion that the 1st Hard drive I had became defective somehow, got a new one now it is
 in the same state. Somehow I managed to get 2 hard drives that *** up only when the area of 70+gb's is loaded onto them. Mind you the 1st drive I basically loaded non-stop until it was done and the 2nd drive I took a week over small increments to load the
 same amount.&nbsp; And yeah I've recovered the GT but since other GT's are now doing the same thing, so it has to be a bad hard drive.</p>

I just want to add that we are experiencing this same issue but with Windows Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 R2 servers. &nbsp;We've had about 15 servers with this error. &nbsp;We can workaround it by hitting F8 and disabling driver signature enforcement and the server
 will boot but next time it will bluescreen. This happened after we installed windows updates on May 30th.</p>

<h2>            USB 3.0 disabled backward compatibility with USB 2.0 for Network Adapters in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to install my Ethernet to USB adapter to my ultrabook after upgrading to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I was unable to to use it anymore with the following error message:</p>
<p>
ASIX AX88772C USB2.0 to Fast Ethernet Adapter can’t work properly with USB 3.0.<br />
If the USB 2.0 device is incompatible with USB 3.0, plugging it into a USB 2.0 port can solve the problem.
</p><p>
</p><p>The bad news is, it works fine with windows 8.1 and I cannot downgrade anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following link is the screenshot i have when I troubleshoot:</p>

    <title>Permission issues on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sezze  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permission issues on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title:</strong> My Windows install has unfixable permission problems, what should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One day my taskbar just stopped working, not even restarting fixed it. Looked up about it and I ended up having to reinstall windows (but keeping files and settings). But that almost made it worse, so first of all, the permissions are all wrong in folders
 and many installers can't actually install anything and they just complain saying they don't have permission even though I run them as administrators AND I've changed all of the permissions in the folders which should allow them, but it doesn't. And second
 of all, most programs got wiped out, but nothing on my second hard drive changed, so I have a ton of folders with programs and a lot of then won't run now, and they don't show up as installed programs since the registry and all of that got cleared. But I can't
 remove some of them since it complains that I don't have permission, and I can't reinstall them either since it complains about the same thing. Most programs were easy to just reinstall, but I have multiple programs that I even after tens of hours can't get
 installed, some of those programs I paid for as well and now I can't use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could just do a fresh install, but I have about 1TB of data I don't wanna lose, if I'd really try to narrow it down it would probably be like 500Gb but I for one don't have the patience to upload all of that to some cloud storage at like 2mb/s, and then
 having to download it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to recap, I can not figure out a single way to fix my permission problems even after changing every single folder's permission to were all programs can read and write. And I am now stuck with a handful of programs I'd really need to get installed, but
 I can't. Please help.</p>

<p>Hi Sezze,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are facing permission issues with Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you can answer these questions for a better understanding.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Do you get any error message or error code prompt when try to access the files and folders?</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>What is the exact error message that prompts while stating no permission?</p>
</span>
<p><span><strong>3.</strong> In which account are you facing this issue
</span><span><span>–</span></span><span> Local account or Microsoft account?</span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Problems that prevent you from accessing files and folders after you upgrade to a new version of Windows can occur for one or more of the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The folder ownership has changed. </li><li>The files are being stored in a Windows.old folder from your previous system.</li></ul>
<p>If you recently upgraded your computer to <strong>Windows 10 </strong>from an earlier version of Windows, some of your account information may have changed. Therefore, you may no longer have ownership of some files and folders. You might be able to resolve
 this issue by restoring your ownership of the files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To take ownership of a file or a folder, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>1. Right click </strong>on the folder that you want to take ownership and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Click the <strong>Security tab</strong>, under <strong>Group or user names menu</strong>, select your
<strong>user name </strong>and click on <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click on <strong>Full control </strong>check box under <strong>
Permissions for authenticated users </strong>and click on <strong>Apply</strong> and<strong> OK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Select <strong>Advanced</strong> under <strong>Security tab
</strong>and click on<strong> Change</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password or for confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Type the name of the person that you want to give <strong>
ownership</strong> to, and then click <strong>Check Names</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The account name for the person that you are assigning ownership to is displayed.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> If you want this person to be the owner of the files and subfolders that are contained in this folder, select
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the <strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects check box </strong>
and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recently upgraded your computer to Windows 10 from an earlier version of Windows, and you did not reformat the hard disk, you might still be able to access your old files from the
<strong>Windows.old </strong>folder under <strong>C drive</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for trying to help. I have already taken ownership, and I did it just like you just said but it didn't fix the problem for some reason. At first I thought I was doing something wrong, so I downloaded some for of registry thing which lets me
 right click on folders and select "Take Ownership" (I made sure that was safe first of course). This did not help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier I found a folder that neither me or an installer could change or remove, although I can't find that now. For the most part I do have permission to access everything, it's just that other programs don't. The errors just say that they lack permission
 to do it, some tell me to try running it as an administrator, but I'm already doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For one program called GameMaker: Studio the installer downloads a .zip file but then does not have permission to actually extract the .zip file into a folder in AppData (At least that's what their support said the problem is, and they told me about the
 ownership you told me about). After installing it through another service which seems to does have permission somehow then in the program when I try to compile it gives me this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4610f48-4cf3-4dfd-aefa-4247ee69729d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4610f48-4cf3-4dfd-aefa-4247ee69729d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not really too sure what it means, but I assume it has to do with permissions since this happened when I reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I at first had a Microsoft account, but I switched to a local account in case that was messing something up. The problems still occurred and some Microsoft thing needed me to be using their account instead so I switched back to a Microsoft one. But
 again, problems occurred on both.</p>

            <p>I kinda find it bull crap that I cant curse at someone who is playing an M-Rated game. I don't even care about the "Online interactions are not rated by the ESRB" because for games like GTA, the online mode still has things like cursing, nudity, violence and all those things. And its a fairly new thing, too. Back when I played on the 360 the enforcement team didn't do anything and I would trash talk people in messages all the time.&nbsp; You could have 5 people report you and they wouldn't do anything.&nbsp;Now all of a sudden one kid reports me and I get a communication ban? What the hell? It pains me to say that the enforcement team for xbox is worse than youtube when it comes to giving people copyright strikes.</p>

            microsofts enforcement team is the reason im switching to PS4. They ban you for nothing and are trash, paid to copy paste and deny requests.

<h2>            Windows 7 Update error 0x800B0100</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 HP desktop. I bought an HP Inkjet Pro 8710. It copies but doesn't print from the computer. HP Support says it's because two Windows NET framework updates won't install. These updates are KB2937610 and KB3097989 I get error message

<p>Windows Network Diagnostics comes up with this error message:</p>

<p>You could try this. Turn everything off, then unplug everything. Now hook up everything and plug in everything then turn on your computer. Sometimes this will pick up what is needed to get running. Rex</p>

<p>Hi Gerald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still having the issue. I have spent the equivalent of a 40 hr week trying every fix I can find. Last week I spent 4 hours with 3 different Microsoft support agents (using their chat) and none of them could fix it. One tried to download Windows 7 again
 but used a 3rd party software which they aren't supposed to do but it failed. Another tried to fix using boot start to repair it but it says it won't work on my computer. That guy said Windows 7 is no longer supported by Microsoft so it was impossible to fix.
 The third agent was also unsuccessful. They tried a lot of things that weren't listed as fixes in the forums. The last agent passed the call on to another agent who abandoned the call. At this point I don't believe there is a fix. This printer is not going
 work on Windows 7. It will probably print from the computer if I upgraded to Windows 10. Thanks for answering my post.</p>

<h2>            Permanent Fix to turning off Print Spooler to keep Excel 2013 from locking up</h2>
                    <p>Again, due to a Windows update. My Excel 2013 started freezing when selecting "file Tab". The solution presented to use Excel was to turn off my printer spooler. So now I can't print and printer won't show up when I do turn on Spooler. damned updates have
 been the problem so often.&nbsp; So what is the fix! Or do you care since you want us to go to that lousy Windows 10 or Office 2016?</p>
<p>&nbsp; Its like you are begging me to give up on MS and go to frickin' Apple after working on Windows for 20 years?</p>

            The big deal here is that there is no support for programs we purchase,&nbsp;like Office 2013 which costs about $169 at the time. Microsoft continually makes the users the beta-testers for Windows Updates, Service Packs and new products instead of&nbsp;the "developers"
 doing the proper planning and preliminary testing. As a government employee working in the IT field, we don't ever trust updates from MS. We test and evaluate every update and&nbsp;patch to determine their necessity in the first place. Then whether there are issues
 and/or other programs it interferes with? It just seems like your developers keep changing stuff on products (Excel, PPT, etc.) no one asked for to justify their jobs and never allow users to become experts of the product. Then doing minimal testing so there's
 always a problem to solve. We have had to get rid of systems because of spooler problems that your engineers couldn't solve with common&nbsp;HP printers. Now we have to turn off our print spooler to keep Excel fr

<h2>            Can&#39;t change font size in latest windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Thanks for the tip to get my Control Panel back but my biggest problem now is in explorer the text is far too small for me to read. Until this update I was able to change the text size quite easily. Why the hell would MS remove this function? I'm not prepared
 to get into the registry &amp; make changes. I've always steered away from fiddling with the registry from when reared its ugly head back in win 98 or was it xp days. I've tried two progs to try to adjust what I want but they do NOT change the font where I need
 it. The progs are "Advanced System Font Changer" &amp; Winaero Tweaker.</p>

<p>I recently purchased a 2017 Surface Pro and found the high screen resolution to be a problem. I couldn't use it unless my nose was 3 inches from the screen (I am 64). But all is good after using these two tips I picked up from other forums. You may have
 this already but I thought it might help anyone else that finds this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Change scale of text and icons<br />
rt-click desktop / display settings / Scale and layout / 200%</p>
<p>This made my Internet Explorer and Edge readable as well as many other apps like Notepad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Some apps they will run with tiny font by default; sometimes this will make them readable.</p>
<p>Locate the executable for the application.</p>
<p>rt-click the shortcut / open file location or just look in C:\Programs Files...</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>rt-click the app .exe / properties / Compatibility / Settings (about 2/3 down)
<br />
Override high DPI scaling behavior Scaling performed by / System (Enhanced)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photoshop CS5 was unreadable until I did that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also miss the options of the older Windows. I seems like every week I spend a few hours trying to work around some Windows 10 quirk or feature. But hey, recently they did give us back the custom color dialog for desktop background colors!</p>
