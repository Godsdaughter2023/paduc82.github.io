<p>Hi Janilue,</p>

<h3> barton261  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Red Boot Screen&#47;UEFI Settings greyed out&#47;unselectable</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 that I purchased off of a buddy who inadvertently wiped the hard drive and couldnt figure out how to fix it. I've reloaded Windows 10 Pro and installed all the drivers. Everything is up to date and operating fine once the computer
 is on and Windows is loaded. I have a couple of issues I havent figured out how to fix. When booting the splash screen is bright red with the Surface logo still black with white lettering in the middle of the screen as well as the loading circle on the bottom
 center of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read online the red screen is a warning and it means that the secure boot is turned off or the keys are missing. When I hold Volume up and press the power button to get into the UEFI or BIOS I am presented with a password screen. My buddy whom purchased
 this unit brand new said he never put a password on it. So I simply pressed Enter and it loaded into the UEFI/BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in I can scroll through and only change a few items. I can see that TPM and Secure boot are both off but I cant select either option. I also can't select to change the boot order nor select the administrator password either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why this is? How do I fix it to be able to select all options and get rid of the red splash screen? Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>
<p />

            Hi, <br />
<div><br />
1. Have you made any recent change to the computer?<br />
2. What is the exact error message and error code?</div>
<div><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to disable and then enable games (FreeCell) on expanding games feature from the Windows on or off features option and check if this resolves the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Refer the below link to view the window for disabling and enabling games.</div>

                    I installed the update and my computer immediatel;y stopped responding in a clean manner. It takes 5 to 10 seconds to respond to and pick and click. Then it runs normally till I need to select something... I uninstalled the update and the response came
 back to normal. I have an Ryzen 1700, 32mb ram, R( 390 video card and a SSD. The update just reinstalled and is bugging me to reboot.&nbsp;

<p>Wow. No. This is my current desktop. Ryzen7 1700, 32gb ram, R9 390 video card, SSD. It has real lag issues in the interface with the new 1709 update. I rolled it back and the issues went away.... so the auto update of course just reinstalled it and wants
 me to reboot. Uhhhhh.. No.</p>
<p>P.S. the Dell is working fine now. Dell sent me a bootable usb device and I was able to get Windows 10 on it and it's running fine.</p>

            P.P.S. My other desktop that I use to drive my 3D printer now seems to have USB issues in that Simplify 3D can't communicate with the printer to pass it the gcode. to print... that's another issue. I was going to roll it back to but it seems that that
 is a futile exercise...

            FWIW, I just looked at my storage and it shows about 15 - 20 gb more space since I rolled it back... It's a 250mb SSD with (currently) 164gb of 232gb available. Last night I was trouble shooting thinking that maybe the disk was getting close to it's limits
 with over provisioning&nbsp; or? so I decided to buff it down as much as I could. I got it down to 182gb out of 232.&nbsp; That's why I made mention of the disk capacity status. Don't know if there is relevance, just twiddling my thumbs..

            I did a "neutron" buff on the system SSD and got the used space down to 125gb. (30gb of old AMD video driver install files SMH). I restarted to let the update finish. It seems to be a little better. Gonna install a 500gb Samsung EVO Nvme m2 drive tomorrow
 and move the system to it. Thanks for the time you've spent with me. If the issue continues, I'll post again..

            Frustrating. The issue is back. I click the windows button to hit the power button to put the machine to sleep and it just sits there for about 20 seconds before it pops up the power tool. If i hit esc to get back to the desktop then immediately hit the
 windows button, it responds instantly. Apps are te same. If I try to start an app, it does the same timeout. Try to start it again immediately and instant response..

            AT this point is there a way to roll back and just block 1709? I want security updates so I don't want to block all updates just 1709.&nbsp; I just want to block it till the issue is identified..

<h2>            I can&#39;t buy Minecraft Windows 10</h2>
                    It seems like it won't let me buy anything. I press buy and it loads then refreshes the page and nothing at all has happened, when I see no problems occurring. My wifi is full bar strength, I have $15 in my account for a $12 buy and my device battery is
 fine on charge.

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck on shut down screen after update Toshiba Satellite P755</h2>
                    <p>After some recent updates from Windows 10 my Laptop hangs on the shutdown screen. &nbsp;The only way to shut down my laptop is to hold down the power button. &nbsp;I am worried if I continue this process it is going to cause hardware issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to shut down I go to Windows button and shutdown</p>
<p>Result is a green shutdown screen with update wheel spinning but it never shuts&nbsp;down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Here are my system specifications:</p>
<p>I also have a Samsung 500gb SSD &nbsp;all with current firmware</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure I understand correctly, you are able to hard shut down the&nbsp; computer and start the&nbsp;computer normally, is that correct?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Power Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>Run&nbsp;the Power troubleshooter to adjust your computer's power settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<span>1. Press <strong>
Windows Key +R</strong></span><span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Type

<p><span><span>5. Run the power troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2: Uninstall the update</strong></span></span></p>
<p>As you mentioned that the issue started after installing Windows update, I would suggest you to try uninstalling the update and check if the issue persists. Follow the steps below to uninstall the update.</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></p>
<p>2. Type <strong>appwiz.cpl </strong>and press <strong>enter</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click "<strong>view installed update</strong>".</p>
<p>4. <strong>Right click </strong>on the update and <strong>uninstall </strong>it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So when I power down going to Windows key and choosing power &gt;&gt; then shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop goes to green shutdown screen&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then screen goes black</p>
<p>Wifi light stays on and intermittent&nbsp;flashing on SSD Hard Drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes&nbsp;shut down completely other times it stays in this state. &nbsp;I have to hold down the power button to force the shutdown. &nbsp;I am concerned that this will eventually damage my SSD or laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ma past the roll back date of 30 days. &nbsp;Window 10 screen said it had no problems with my laptop upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned off all power saving settings to see if that helps</p>
<p>I have run the power troubleshooter with no issues</p>
<p>I have looked for firmware updated for Samsung SSD</p>
<p>I have checked that all of my components do not need a firmware or software update.</p>

            <p>Update issue has stopped happening so far (Fingers Crossed) other issues appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a recent Windows update, my system is finally closing down properly! </p>
<p>No Hard resets with the power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even through other problems were created I can live with workarounds vs possibly damaging my hardware.</p>
<p>Problems created: hardware laptop hot keys were not working and Laptop powering on when I open the lid, even though the option is turned off in power settings and some other minor stuff.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I can live with this as at least I will not damage my hardware. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I suspect the cause was:</p>
<p>I suspect that the green screen what not stating powering off was updating. Also I think my screen was blacking out due to screen saver even though it was turned off. &nbsp; I originally ruled this out because I left the laptop on for 1 hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>NOTE TO MIORSOFT: &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I know you are trying to make products that do things without user intervention but the feed back on what the computer is doing automatically is very Very bad. I have been computing for 30+ years and I think your most loyal users are the ones that started
 with Windows 98 or even dos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There need to be an advanced user process windows that show what Windows 10 is doing. Not tasks manager which is big and clunky but tells a lot. But a window that shows if Windows 10 is downloading updated. &nbsp;Or is Windows is going to apply or try to apply
 an update? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is countless time that my connection is running slow and I found out it was Windows downloading an update in the background or performing a some other maintenance item. &nbsp;The problem I had to search or oper multiple windows to find this out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows users are not Apple users we want to know what is going on in the background.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I am having a similar issue, except I cannot move away from</p>
<p>the shut down screen to access anything on the laptop. I updated to Windows 10 a few days ago and now my screen is stuck on the shutting down screen. I have held the power button to switch off, let it run out of battery, each time I turn the laptop back
 on all I get is a blue a screen with shutting down wrote in the middle and 6 dots rotating but nothing ever happens, it just stays on this screen. Nothing I press brings any boxes up or takes me to any other screen. Can anyone please help?</p>
        </p>

            <p>I would try to unplug laptop and hold power button gown until it powers off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then unplug the power from the power outlet</p>
<p>Then take out the laptop battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will assure that the laptop is totally powered off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug back in battery and plug back in power to wall outlet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then boot back up and see what happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that gets you back into the Windows 10 boot sequence.</p>
<p>If it does boot back up turn off all power savings and disable going to sleep.&nbsp;</p>

            I'd been having this issue as well. What Smittychat recommended didn't work for me. I had to sign into my Microsoft account on my browser and go to my Payment &amp; Billing options. For some reason my PayPal was setup there for US purchases. I removed that
 payment option and re-added my PayPal info this time for purchases in Canada. Worked for me, hope it does for you as well. :)

    <title>iTunes keeps crashing in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark_505  say:</h3>
<h2>            iTunes keeps crashing in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10, and regret every decision. I need to use my laptop for playing music on a radio station as a job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, my sound card was a problem as audio quality dropped completely, which I fixed by being quite technically savvy and finding a solution myself in two days (other than the suggestions Microsoft provided which did not work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, my current problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>- iTunes, which I use to play my music, keeps crashing! I seriously don't know what to do. I will not uninstall this as I'd lose my library set up and playlists.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my mousepad is lagging a lot. It does not seem to distinguish the buttons well anymore either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and adobe reader doesn't work well either. Nor does AVG anti virus. Sorry, Microsoft, but what was the point of this upgrade? To let users spend weeks in reinstalling their applications? At this point, all I want is to go back to Windows 8.1. What a disaster!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, I am completely at a loss on how to fix all these problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Asus F200CA,</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regret the fact that you are not satisfied and contended with the new Windows 10 OS.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following are the steps to assist you in how to Roll Back to your previous OS.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Click on the Start icon<br />
2.&nbsp;Click on Settings, and then click on Update and Security.<br />
3.&nbsp;On the left pane you will find Recovery option, you will find the option Go Back to Earlier Build and the click on Get Started.<br />
Your system will restore back to your previous OS.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
1.&nbsp;If you have upgraded from a Windows 8.1 OS to Windows 10, but your original OS in your computer is either a Windows 7 or 8. The system will roll back to the original OS<br />
2.&nbsp;If you want to roll back your system to the previous OS,31 days after installing Windows 10 you will not be able to perform the roll back.<br />
3.&nbsp;If you perform a Clean install while loading Windows 10, the option to roll back will not be possible.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the steps under the section"<strong>Go back to your previous version of Windows</strong>" from this article.</p>

            <p>Pavan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all due respect, this is quite possibly the least helpful answer I expected. I want a solution to my current problem, not an escape out. Why don't you tell me what the problem is with Windows 10, why are these programs not functioning properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I gather on Google, many (and I mean, a lot!) people have problems with iTunes and Windows 10. How do you propose I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, why was Windows 10 released if there are still so many problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist me with my issues, not with my last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            I bought a new HP notebook computer with Windows 10 already installed. I just installed the latest version of ITunes, opened the program, and authorized my account for my new computer. I then attempted to view and download songs I have previously purchased
 on ITunes. So far I have attempted to do this five times and each time ITunes crashes and closes. So to reiterate, it is a brand new computer. ITunes is the second program I installed, and obviously it is the latest version of ITunes. The first program I installed
 (Chessmaster 10) also does not work on Windows 10. I am very annoyed to say the least.

<h2>            Slow printing PDF files</h2>
                    Just purchased new HP laptop with windows 10. Installed Abobe reader 11. When I attempt to print pdf files to my HP 8620 it takes forever to print even a single page. After a delay it finally starts to print and then keeps stopping during the print. No
 problem printing anything else. Have tried " print as image " and "let printer determine colors". Still no fix. all updates installed on printer.

<h3> robhurley1  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows 10 laptop is stuck in a boot loop sequence since updating this morning.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a real problem here folks and I hope someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 which came pre-installed on my MSI GE72 6QD laptop.&nbsp; Windows 10 updates&nbsp;make some of my video production software unstable, so when it updates to a new version - like this morning - I restore it to the previous version in the settings.&nbsp;
 Never had an issue until today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update was complete and so, as before, I set it to revert back to the previous version and I went to do some paperwork and when I came back 20 minutes later the machine was stuck in a boot loop sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what happens.&nbsp; I press the power button.&nbsp; in a second or two the MSI logo appears on the screen - black background.&nbsp; All normal.&nbsp; the little circling dots that usually appear at startup do their thing for a second or two.&nbsp; Next the screen goes black
 for a second.....a box flashes for a fraction of a second in the upper left of the screen......a white outline of a box to be precise.&nbsp; then two messages&nbsp;flash across the bottom of the screen in rapid succession.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first message says....Attempting to recover installation.... The second says....Restoring your previous version of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the screen goes black and it all starts again.....over and over.&nbsp; I have to hold down the power button to switch the laptop off, otherwise it continues to repeat the sequence over and over.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no recovery media as the Laptop did not come with one.&nbsp; Even if I had a disk or USB I still cant set the boot sequence in the BIOS to allow booting from&nbsp;either&nbsp;USB or DVD drive&nbsp;because I cant access the damn BIOS unless the laptop is up and running......in
 Windows 10 you cant access BIOS on startup like older windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please help with this............I need the multimedia files in this machine for a big event next week.</p>
<p>

            Hi Rob, please try the options in the Windows Recovery Environment - all options listed below are non-destructive to your files:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps
<br />Then start the Reset

            Hi Rob.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>So. Finally sorted. Heres how</p>
<p>
</p><p>Created an installation DVD from Microsoft using iso file downloadef using installation media tool. Used this to boot into recovery. Then.....</p>
<p>Got into notepad thru DOS prompt and used it as mini explorer to find and backup critical work files to USB drive.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>Did a clean install using the installation DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled drivers, various programs etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I say a huge thank you to all who posted so helpfully to steer me through this mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Particularly useful was the idea of using notepad as a mini explorer to rescue critical files. &nbsp;I cannot tell you how much time this is saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One final query. &nbsp; is there a way to block Windows 10 updates altogether?</p>
<p>

            Hi,
<br />Glad to know this is resolved.
<br />I suggest you to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.

    <title>Malware and viruses problem on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chattan johnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Malware and viruses problem on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am running into multiple problems.</p>
<p>1. My personal computer which is running on windows 10 is infected with viruses and I have no access to malware protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When I go into the program files to delete these harmful files they either,</p>
<p>a. delete normally</p>
<p>b. say that it can't be deleted because&nbsp;it is&nbsp;currently running</p>
<p>c. say that it can't be deleted because&nbsp;it requires administrator permission (I am the&nbsp;only administrator and user of the computer)</p>
<p>3. When I open the control center and go to the "uninstall a program tab" the virus programs that do not delete either,</p>
<p>a. say that it can't be uninstalled because&nbsp;it is&nbsp;currently running</p>
<p>b. say that it can't be uninstalled because&nbsp;it requires administrator permission (I am the&nbsp;only administrator and user of the computer)</p>
<p>4. When I open the task manager the programs that do not close when I click "end task", just disappear&nbsp;for less than a second and reappear.</p>
<p>5. I am not sure that safe mode works correctly I tried by pressing the "F8" key multiple times upon startup but it seemed no different</p>
<p>6. The largest amount of harmful files is inside program files, program files x86, and program data&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. When I run a delete as an administrator it either,</p>
<p>a. deletes normally</p>
<p>b. Says that I do not have administrative access. (sometimes it will tell me to open the security tab to obtain it but I have no clue how to once inside the tab)</p>
<p>8. Some files that I suspect have these harmful files within will not open because&nbsp;I lack administrator access, again I am the only administrator.</p>
<p>9. Microsoft edge and google chrome both start up with strange ads and search engines</p>
<p>Please help me there has to be a way I can get in there and delete these files. I believe they originated&nbsp;from when I tried&nbsp;to download a zip file of a game online and it was actually a malware installer as it installed multiple files, I tried to exit out
 of it but it just downloaded anyways, some of the notable ones are sunnyday, sunnyday21, system healer, mpc cleaner, bokdu, content push, please remember there are others, I would guess that a solid 20-30 files and programs were installed. If you need any
 screenshots let me know and I will upload them asap.</p>

            <p>Depending on the version of Windows you are running, you might have to prepare the ISO file in a usable formation so it can be recognized by Windows in order to initiate setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 and earlier versions require that you burn the .ISO file to a blank DVD or use a utility to create a bootable copy on a USB thumbdrive so you running version of Windows can see the setup files and start the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 and later versions can natively recognize ISO files, all you have to do is double click it to view them then double click the setup.exe file to start the installation.</p>

                    When one program is open, trying to open another will cause the system to crash. Internet Explorer very often has a problem and needs to close. These are not occasional problems -- they are constant.

            <p><strong>EDIT: SOLUTION FOUND!&nbsp; SEE UPDATE BELOW</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can confirm that&nbsp;there is a definite issue with Windows 8 and memory handling.&nbsp; I have had no problems with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and now with Windows 8 Pro 64-bit on the same computer&nbsp;there are lots of crashes and random freezing.&nbsp; I have done all
 of the updates through Windows Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On several occasions applications denote a memory error.&nbsp; I have run the 2-pass test with Windows Memory Diagnostics just fine without any errors found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I had a problem playing PokerStars where it wouldn't let me make my next move and it forced me to fold my hand.&nbsp; I contacted PokerStars with the debug info.&nbsp; They said I have a memory problem.&nbsp; hahaha</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have any physical memory problem.&nbsp; I checked the BIOS settings for RAM timings.&nbsp; The RAM is brand new&nbsp;as of early 2012 while running Windows 7.&nbsp;The RAM is operating at 2133 MHz while it's rated at 2400 MHz so it's very robust/reliable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I upgraded my BIOS to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having frequent memory issues with Flash player and Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Suddenly web pages won't load or would just show a white screen.&nbsp; A separate browser window does not resolve it due to shared memory space.&nbsp; To work around this I would open an InPrivate
 browsing session (CTRL+SHIFT+P) and then Flash and other websites work again under that, because it's under a secured memory delegation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is definitely some sort of kernel-level (or related) memory issue with Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone else have these kinds of issues they'd like to share to raise awareness?</p>

<strong>
<p><strong>UPDATE -- SOLUTION!&nbsp; CULPRIT: INTEL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem: your CPU is about to die and take down your motherboard with it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are&nbsp;using a 2nd gen. (Sandy Bridge) or 3rd gen. (Ivy Bridge) Intel Core processor, you probably tried what I did: I put my&nbsp;Core i7-2600K&nbsp;at 3400 MHz to&nbsp;work with my RAM at DDR3&nbsp;2133 MHz speed, though my RAM is rated at 2400 MHz.&nbsp; The specs
 of Intel's latest CPU's is to only run the RAM speed at&nbsp;1333 MHz or 1600 MHz (check your max soeed at
<a href="http://ark.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ark.intel.com</a>).&nbsp; My RAM SPD specs also has a slightly higher voltage.&nbsp; (I think 0.5V higher or something).</strong></p>
</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WTF?&nbsp; Well, you see, AMD had memory management architecture incorporated into their CPU's for ages.&nbsp; There was pressure on Intel to finally incorporate they same.&nbsp; They failed.&nbsp; Intel's south bridge can only handle slow speeds and low voltage.&nbsp; So,
 time for a&nbsp;cover-up!&nbsp; In with the marketing department! "NEW 2nd/3rd GENERATION INTEL PROCESSORS RUN OPTIMALLY AT SLOWER SPEEDS! :D"&nbsp; lmaooooo</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LAUGH OF THE CENTURY!&nbsp; I got higher benchmarking scores and Windows Experience Index values of 8.2 instead of 8.1 when I had it set to 2133 MHz memory speed.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My motherboard totally fried last month&nbsp;and I sent it into ASUS for warranty.&nbsp; When I got a refurbished replacement, it powered on but nothing happened.&nbsp; Turns out the CPU was ALSO fried!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Intel threatened me when I redeemed the warranty for the CPU, saying that if I want me processor to last its normal lifespan I have to run it at the memory speed in the specs and ensure that memory voltage is reduced to spec as well.&nbsp; Very different
 tone of voice than their marketing of "works better slower" to mislead people into thinking that it works faster at slower memory speed.&nbsp; The marketing makes it sound like an optional recommendation.&nbsp; Their support rep made it sound like a mandatory statute!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The sad part is that 2400 MHz DDR3 RAM was already available on the consumer market when Sandy Bridge debuted.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So to that I say: I've been with AMD all my life, and it was a&nbsp;big mistake deciding to switch back to Intel for their Sandy Bridge tech.&nbsp; My next build is definitely going to be AMD.&nbsp; They pioneered the x86-64 bit architecture.&nbsp; They are at the true
 forefront of technological evolution.&nbsp; They know how to do things properly.&nbsp; It's true what they say: underdogs&nbsp;yield better quality than those capitalistic penny-pinchers&nbsp;in the limelight!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Farewell Intel and thank you for damaging ASUS' hardware and making Microsoft look bad, because of your bad technology.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My new system has been running perfectly for days now without a crash and without the Internet Explorer issues people are having.</strong></p>

<h3> whoppaswappa  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#40;SOLVED&#41; Games crash after Windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated and then did a clean install of Windows 10. Everything works wonderfully, except every time I start&nbsp;a game, a popup comes up and says that it stopped working. For example, I started up Skyrim and the launcher works fine. I can select my display&nbsp;and
 graphics options. But once I click "Play", it goes to a black screen like it's starting up, but then it stops and says "Skyrim has stopped working".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running as administrator for both the launcher and the game itself. I also tried running it in compatibility mode with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one of those NVIDIA Optimus machines, where it has dual graphics cards. When I force the game to use my&nbsp;Intel integrated card, it opens the game and&nbsp;works fine. But when it uses the NVIDIA card, it crashes like I mentioned before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure I have DirectX installed and updated, as well as my&nbsp;NVIDIA card driver updated. Windows Update says that it failed to install a driver to my computer, but I did a&nbsp;driver update check&nbsp;and I already have the latest version. I even went into the
 device manager and there don't seem to be any conflicts. Also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the games, and restarting the computer multiple times. I also, did a fresh install and still no dice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home 64-bit</p>
<p>Intel Core i5 CPU M 480 @ 2.67GHz</p>
<p>NVIDIA GeForce GT 420M</p>
<p>Intel HD Graphics</p>
<p>6 GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what could be the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Solved this issue. Needed to downgrade the drivers. I personally downgraded to 345.20 if that helps anyone.</p>

            I did a little more research and reading other forums. It appears I had a BIOS update available before I installed Win 10. It says its compatible up to Windows 8.1, but does anyone think that could be the issue? That I need to update the BIOS?

            @ZigZag3143 I found the deeper issue. &nbsp;It has to do with the coding of Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 not allowing DX9 32-bit pc games to utilize more than 4064 Mb worth of video memory, &nbsp;NO MATTER WHAT. You can change the page file size all you want, but
 running a DX9 Video Memory test it shows 4064 on every test, then I run the DX11 Video Memory test, &nbsp;and it says I have 33644 Mb of Video Memory. And I am sure that seems fine considering that without special treatment almost any 32-bit program cannot utilize
 more than 4064 Mb. But through hard work and dedication a select few people made it possible to utilize every last byte of video memory for a 32-bit pc gaming application. All in an effort to make it possible to run games, &nbsp;SKYRIM in particular, with many
 graphic intensive mods. &nbsp;And this was somehow hindered in the transition from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1...and I can attest to this through research and through trial and error. I can guarantee for a fact that when I r

<br />
<br />Be sure and check the hard drive and cabling. Read and try the methods in the BCCode: 154 section below.
<br />
<br />Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-spyware/security programs.

<br />=====
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />
<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics at top of the list - click it. in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows Memory 
<br />Diagnostic".

            No drivers were named in the crashes, so our next step would be to find the offending driver if any. 
<br />
<br />Enable Driver Verifier:

<br />
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation.
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.
