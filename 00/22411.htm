<h2>            Office on Mac Deactivated on its own - help</h2>
                    <p>In September 2013 I bought a Mac with a 4-year Microsoft Office license under an academic license I imagine given I bought it at a university bookstore.&nbsp; A couple of weeks ago, it stopped working and instead came up with a deactivation notice (image below).&nbsp;
 I am at a total loss.&nbsp; I did not have a subscription, so I don't know why I might be asked for one.&nbsp; I tried re-entering the product key, but that didn't work.&nbsp; I cannot provide a lot of other information as my daughter has the machine right now half way around
 the world and with poor internet access, so I'm hoping there isn't a recommendation to download and re-install the software, although if that is necessary, I'll help her figure out what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Yes I thought of that and asked my daughter to make sure the computer clock and date are current and they are.&nbsp; Of course, I don't know if the clock and date were wrong 9 months ago when the computer was purchased and software installed.&nbsp; I asked her to
 re-start the computer and check for Office updates as well.&nbsp; I haven't yet heard back (we are 10 hours apart), although I'm not that hopeful that is a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The frustrating bit is this was working just fine and it is a 4-year license on a 9-month old computer.</p>

Other than deleting and re-adding the person, you may try forwarding the meeting to her. If that doesn't work, we'll need a few more details:</p>

<h2>            Access Database, Access Denied</h2>
                    Hello, i think this problem is very hard to solve, i'm trying to solve it for 1 week.
<div>I created a Visual Studio 2012 project, and i want to connect a access database to it</div>
<div>When i try to do so, it shows a error message "Access Denied". The steps i make are (add new data source&gt;database&gt;dataset&gt;microsoft database file&gt;...)</div>
<div>When i choose the file and click OK, the error message appears. If i click Test Connection it says Successful.</div>
<div>I asked in VB foruns and they told me to come here, because the problem is with Access.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i have microsoft office 2013 profissional plus.</div>
<div>I did this many times before format my computer, with VS 2012 and office 2010, and it worked, but now it dont.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            Actually I don't think the problem is with Access. I think the problem is how you are connecting the database. And for that you need a Visual Studio expert.&nbsp;

            Make sure you save the file as a Access 2007 format. Also make sure you don't use any features specific to Access 2013. That might be what is preventing the connection.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
I am attempting to set up my new pantech phone. I am using the demo version of outlook that came with it. After several failed attempts at 1. adding my contacts to my computer from my old sony ericson 2. adding them to the demo outlook from express and 3. adding
 them to my new phone, I now have them. my problem is they are listed as Last name, first name, I want them first last. I'm not too familiar with outlook nor active sync. or my phone. when I look at my contacts in outlook they are the way I want but they don't
 sync to my phone in that order. at this point I would have been better off putting them in manually but I've come too far to turn back now. I hope there is a fix.

            Printing email is not a Word function. Are you printing from Outlook? Either Word or Outlook will print with the font size that is applied to the text. If your printer has a setting for printing at 150%, that should work but is nothing to do with Word.
 FWIW, 22 points is <strong>not</strong> small (it is nearly a third of an inch). The default text font size in Word is usually in the 10-12 point range.

<p>Thank for your reply. The simple answer is no.</p>
<p>I have had my computer into the local IT shop and of course it works perfectly well on their server. I was advised to reboot my router which I have done but again no result. I have twice reported this to Microsoft but don't expect a reply any time soon.</p>
<p>My latest position is that I sometimes access my on line files and sometimes I dont. I have noticed that when I don't, the program has sent Chrome browser to the wrong address. This is beginning to make me suspicious that the fault lies with the program
 and not my PC. How can a program direct itself to two completely different internet addresses when it is trying to access my online files which are presumably in the same place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I regret I have little technical knowledge so I can only keep harassing Microsoft in the hope someone provides some help. Strange this wasn't happening until my PC updated itself to Windows 10 version 1809 or am I just an old cynic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Randy,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Did you check this behavior by booting your computer in Safe mode with networking? If not, then boot your computer in Safe mode with networking by following the steps mentioned below.<br />
&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Use F8 while restarting the computer.<br />
&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Under Windows Advanced Boot Options menu, select Safe mode with Networking and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;Once you login to Windows in Safe mode, open Internet explorer and sign in to your email account to open your emails.<br />
&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;Check if internet explorer stops responding while doing so.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;By the way, do you’ve multiple email accounts? If yes, does it happen on each email accounts that you login to?<br />
For example: If Internet Explorer stops responding while reading/writing emails on your gmail account, then do you also see if it stops responding while on yahoo mail.</p>
<p>If you’re using Windows 7 as your operating system, then you can use the Internet Explorer Performance Troubleshooter to fix the problem. Visit the link below for the same.</p>
<p><strong>I: The Internet Explorer Performance troubleshooter<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter</strong></a></p>
<p>If internet explorer works pretty well in Safe mode with Networking, then the issue might be due to an add-on. Restart the computer back to normal windows startup mode and then figure out which add-on is causing this problem. You can initially start running
 Internet explorer in No add-ons mode to confirm that Internet explorer behaves normally while reading/writing emails. To run Internet Explorer in No add-ons mode, follow the steps below.<br />
&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Click on Start; then click on All Programs.<br />
&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Click on Accessories. Click on System Tools.<br />
&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;Click on Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</p>
<p><strong>II: How do browser add-ons affect my computer?<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/How-do-browser-add-ons-affect-my-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/How-do-browser-add-ons-affect-my-computer</strong></a></p>
<p>You can try disabling protected mode to see if that fixes the issue.<br />
To do so, follow the steps below. <br />
&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Open Internet explorer. Click on “Tools”, “Internet Options”:<br />
&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Go to the tab “Security” and untick the option “Enable Protected Mode”:<br />
&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;Restart the Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>On the other side, I would also suggest you to create a test email account and try composing an email to see if Internet explorer responds well. The reason to ask you to create a test email account is due to the fact that internet explorer stops working
 only while reading/writing emails.</p>
<p>You can also try following the steps mentioned in the link below apart from the steps mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>III: How to optimize Internet Explorer<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/</strong></a></p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.<br />

                    <p>Running 10 Beta.. Norton (Xfinity release) up dated today. Stating a restart was necessary the pc shut down and will not restart.&nbsp; Windows startup repair will not correct the issue and System restore fails while trying to save my files. Any Thoughts?</p>

            I first let The startup repair run and this was un successful, I later tried to do a refresh and save my files, the repair started then failed. Finally I attempted a full refresh removing all files and programs and that was also unsuccessful. I then booted
 to a Hirens disk and did a Nortons removal. While it did remove the program the problem remained. I am unable to start or refresh the system. I should point out that the drive in question is a clone of my windows 7 drive and I ran the up date to 10 Beta. It
 has been running fine until this am when Norton Updated.

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I add &#39;amazon&#39; as an account to my windows live custom domain&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I'm setting up accounts in windows live domains so I can add them later as aliases in accounts.live.com and all the emails go to my primary email address but I'm having problems setting up one account. I'm use them to identify which company it was that
 was responsible for me receiving spam etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Windows Live Custom Domains lets me add 'apple' as an account (i.e. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***), but when I try to add 'amazon' (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) it comes up with the following error message:
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>That account name is not allowed for use with this service.</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why is it I'm not allowed to use that name?! Is it a dirty word in Microsoft's book?!&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>What do you mean by "I'm setting up accounts in Windows Live domains so I can add them
 later as aliases in accounts.live.com and all the emails go to my primary email address"? Are you saying that you need to add&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain domain name first before you need to add them as alias?</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>Please be informed that you don't need to create a custom domain&nbsp;just to create an alias.
 You can create&nbsp;any alias as long as it's available and&nbsp;as long as you did not exceed the limit for aliases.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>Please provide the exact name of&nbsp;your&nbsp;domain&nbsp; for investigation purposes.</span></font></p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>My MX records are pointed at windows live domains, so the only email provider I use is outlook.com. That means all the emails for the aliases on my domain get lost unless I create an account first for it e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in windows live domains.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once I've done that, I can add it as an alias for the main email address in microsoft accounts (though accounts.live.com and it'll come through to that address.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There's two problems I'm having:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1.) I can't create *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as an account in windows live domains because it comes up with the following message:</div>
<div><br />
<div>That account name is not allowed for use with this service.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2.) By trying to set up aliases in accounts.live.com, having to remove them again and readd them I've already gone through the 10 aliases you're allowed a year, even though I don't actually have any set up! I can understand a limit of 10, but having effectively
 a limit of 10 changes renders it useless. Can this not be reset by someone if you explain what happened and that you haven't actually used 10 aliases you have none?!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Tom</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me further assist you with your concern. I have&nbsp;created a private message tab for you so that you can provide us the affected email address which you cannot register on your domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also please be informed that if you have Microsoft account on Outlook.com, you can only register an alias if it is @outlook.com, @live.com, etc. But if you are planning to use a third party domain as an alias, it is not possible.

            <p>Hi Tom, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding to your query as we are currently receiving a high volume of support request.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your time and efforts for getting back to us and for providing us more information about this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that I have now escalated your concern to our Support Specialist regarding on creating an amazon as part of your domain account and to set proper expectation, we will only get back to you once we get further updates on this or we need
 more information you so we appreciate your continued patience on this matter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regards to creating an alias, please be advised that you can only create <strong>
10 </strong>aliases for your account per year and it will only reset after a year. Even if you don't have an existing alias on your account, you still have to wait 365 days but it will depends on the first alias account that you've created. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>You've created 2 aliases last January 1, 2012 = You can only create another 2 aliases after 365 days.</li><li>You've created 3 aliases last February 1, 2012 = You can only create another 3 aliases after 365 days.</li><li>You've create 5 aliases last May 1, 2012 = You can only create another 5 aliases after 365 days.</li></ol>
<p>If there's anything else that I can help you with, please do not hesitate to reply here and we will further assist you. We'd love to hear from you again.</p>

            Hi Ron,
<div><br />
<div>I have just tried to add the account again, and it worked this time. I didn't do anything differently to what I did before, so something must have been fixed in the background.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, thanks for the help, I guess I don't have that problem any more. Will just have to wait a year to be able to add that account as an alias through accounts.live.com! Hopefully Microsoft will remove the 10 'actions' per year limit and change it to
 a 'no more than 10 aliases at any one time' limit which makes much more sense.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>

            Hi Leon, did you get a Blue Screen, of just an error?
<br />
<br />If you got a blue screen:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
<br />
<br />If you only got an error dialog popping up:
<br />
<br />Hi , follow these steps to repair your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the online repair (if available), it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .

    <title>Excel Issue with the last name True - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billhart1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Issue with the last name True</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet of names that includes one person named Arthur True. When I type True into the last name field, Excel&nbsp; capitalizes it and centers it in the cell. I cannot reformat&nbsp; to Cap C, lower case rue. I know there is a TRUE function in Excel but
 I know nothing about it.&nbsp; How can I work around this issue?</p>
<p>

            You need to format the cell as Text. Or you can try typing 'True. The apostrophe will tell Excel its Text and not the constant True.

            Another alternative is to enter anything in the cell preceded by a apostrophe. That will force the text entry to be become text. Hence, you need to enter -

'True

<h2>            Repeated &#34;How do you want to run this&#34; when opening a web link in Outlook on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am running the released version of Windows 10 Home Edition 64-bit.&nbsp; I also am continuing to use Internet Explorer 11, because a vital app (LastPass) will not work on Edge yet.&nbsp; I frequently get emailed web links in Outlook.&nbsp; When I click on the web link,
 I get a pop-up asking me "How do you want to open this", with several choices including IE11, Edge, or choose an app from the app store.&nbsp; At the bottom, it has a button titled "Always use this app".&nbsp; So, I select IE11, and click "Always use this app", and
 IE11 launches just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the next time I open a link from within Outlook, I get the same pop-up again.&nbsp; So, the "Always use this app" is not remembering my choice.&nbsp; How can I change this behavior?</p>

<h2>            Unable to &#39;send mail as&#39; through Outlook SMTP servers&#58; Error 535 on Gmail.</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I realise this problem has been around for a long time. There used to be a workaround thanks to a flaw in the Linked Accounts feature, but as you can no longer link your Live/Outlook accounts in the same fashion since Spring 2013, there is now no workaround
 published on the forums. I would like to create an opportunity for the Microsoft staff to offer a clear and universal solution which is up to date as per August 2013.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</div>
<div>When you want to use your Gmail account to 'send mail as' your Outlook/Live username, you need to setup a special feature in the
<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Gmail settings</a>. Gmail offers you to choose between sending an email as
<i>youroutlookaddress</i> through Gmail servers or through Outlook's SMTP servers. If you wish to proceed through Gmail servers, things work fine, but if you wish to go through Outlook's SMTP, they don't.</div>
<div>Namely, the setup process requires you to supply:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The<i> <b>SMTP Server address: smtp.live.com</b></i>&nbsp;</li><li>The connection&nbsp;<b><i>port</i> <i>587, 465, or 25</i></b></li><li>Your Outlook/Live account <i><b>username</b></i></li><li>Your Outlook/Live account <i><b>password</b></i></li><li>The encryption type:&nbsp;<i><b>TLS</b></i>, <i><b>SSL</b></i>, or <i><b>unsecured</b></i> (port 25 only)</li></ul>
<div>And no matter the combination you use, there is no way you can set this up for your Outlook/Live account. The errors displayed span as follow:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>With port 587 and TLS selected: "<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold">Authentication failed. Please check your username/password.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold">[Server

Please double-check the server and port number.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">With port 465 and

 TLS selected: "</span>Authentication failed. Please check your username/password.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold">[Server response: 535 5.2.1 Login to your account via a web browser to verify your account. code(535) ]</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">With port 25 and

 Unsecured Connection selected: "</span>We are having trouble authenticating with your other mail service. Please try a different port or connection option. If you continue to experience difficulties, please contact your other email provider for further instructions.</span></li></ul>
<div>NON-SOLUTIONS</div>
</div>
<div>Although there seems to be a number of potential reasons for all the different setups not to be working, only one is relevant: error 535. Error 535 seems to be triggered when 2-step verification is activated in the Oultook/Live account. When this is activated,
 you just cannot setup 'send mail as' in Gmail for your Outlook/Live account; and once you activated it, you cannot deactivate either, so either way you are not in luck.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I happen *not* to have 2-step verification activated at all, but still, I'm getting error 535. Yet I bothered to take on the advice published some time ago&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-email/windows-live-mail-not-working-properly-535-521/d287e723-57cc-4394-bb3b-4364aa22eb6c">over
 at this thread</a>, which was to 'link' a newly created Outlook/Live account to your primary one, thus opening a window for you to deactivate the 2-step verification process, and re-enabling you to use Outlook's SMTP servers. Unfortunately, you can now 'link'
 your account with Apps only, and they don't include Oultook webmail. But most importantly, SMTP servers do not cooperate anymore, whether you do or don't have 2-step verification process enabled.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is not a Gmail problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>REQUEST</div>
<div>Can someone from Microsoft provide a solution? I want to send some emails as my Outlook username using Gmail webmail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I tried to write a detailed question in order to describe the problem very clearly and to make it easy for other affected users (and they are many) to browse for the potential solution when you will provide it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Therefore, I am now not only frustrated by my encountered issue, but also with the lack of understanding you display when you want to help me "configure my Gmail account in Outlook.com". I do not want to configure my Gmail account in Outlook.com. Instead,
<b>I want to setup my Outlook account in Gmail.com.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>As a result, the solution article you provided is 100% irrelevant to this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, you can help me configure my Outlook account in Gmail.com, and this despite the fact that it takes place in Gmail.com. The reason you can is because the problem occurs on Outlook SMTP servers. At some point when Gmail tries to talk to Outlook, Outlook
 says it doesn't know what Gmail's talking about, if it hears anything at all, you know what I'm talking about?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope the issue I'm trying to raise is now 100% understood.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't think replying to a private message will help me and other affected users better than providing a solution here, but still I will play ball. However, please consider reviewing this issue and provide an answer here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>JR_N obviously understood my issue oppositewise, so I would like to wait for him to issue a new advice now that my actual problem may appear more clearly after I clarified it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the meantime, perhaps Julius Caesar_B you could help in specifying why my issue 'appears' so that it could be best addressed by Gmail. Not to say it is typical out there in the world that when you get 2 separate services failing to synchronise, they
 both declare it's the other's fault, but it's always a good idea to provide arguments as to why one side thinks it is actually the other side's failure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From my point of view, Gmail offers different ways, namely ports and encryption methods, to make use of Outlook's SMTP servers, but they all seem to fail no matter what. That leads us to 2 approaches:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Is Gmail not invoking Outlook's SMTP servers in a way that Outlook supports, in terms of port and/or encryption method? If yes, perhaps Microsoft should provide a method for properly making use of Outlook's SMTP servers, or explain why it is not supported
 at all.</li><li>Is Outlook suffering from a potential malfunction, maybe due to its sign-in and/or account verification process, which prevents the use of its SMTP servers in some cases. If yes, perhaps Microsoft should clarify what the malfunction could be, and whether
 they plan to address it (so we can all quit trying instead of trying to figure a way to no avail ever).</li></ol>
<div>I'm trying to keep things constructive and only hope you can join me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>Let me address your issue accordingly.<br />
<br />
First: "Is Gmail not invoking Outlook's SMTP servers in a way that Outlook supports, in terms of port and/or encryption method? If yes, perhaps Microsoft should provide a method for properly making use of Outlook's SMTP servers, or explain why it is not supported
 at all?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue can be best address by the Google support team, since you are asking about the port and SMTP settings when you configure your Outlook.com to Google.<br />
<br />
Second: "Is Outlook suffering from a potential malfunction, maybe due to its sign-in and/or account verification process, which prevents the use of its SMTP servers in some cases. If yes, perhaps Microsoft should clarify what the malfunction could be, and whether
 they plan to address it (so we can all quit trying instead of trying to figure a way to no avail ever)."<br />
<br />
We do not have an issue regarding sign in and account verification. JR_N. already provided the general settings regarding having multiple email accounts that&nbsp;you can use in
<span>Outlook.com.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you</span></span><br />

<div><br />
<div>Even though you believe this issue can be best addressed by Google, could you please address it in the less better way you are thinking about? At this point when so many users face the same issue, this could definitely help us out. And if not, it will
 still be relevant information that may help Google diagnose the problem, if they can do anything about it from their side.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is more, aren't the port and SMTP settings to access an Outlook account from Gmail defined by Microsoft? I mean, isn't it Microsoft that decides what port/encryption can be used to access an Outlook account outside Outlook webmail? Therefore, isn't
 Microsoft the most relevant entity to turn to when it throws an error after trying to connect to its own servers?</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>We do not have an issue regarding sign in and account verification. JR_N. already provided the general settings regarding having multiple email accounts that&nbsp;you can use in&nbsp;Outlook.com.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>Once again, the page provided above does not mention anything (at all) setting up your Outlook account from within the Gmail.com website, nor anything related to that purpose. I don't own multiple Outlook/Microsoft accounts, I just have one Outlook account,
 and one Gmail account.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is true that I may not provide a correct diagnosis of the issue when I mention the sign-in/account verification, but this would precisely be the reason why I am turning to people more knowledgeable here, presumably because they are part of Microsoft
 support and can offer a more correct diagnosis than I can. Of course it's easy to say my diagnosis is irrelevant, but would you care to to provide your own which would certainly be more insightful?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm going to take a chance and give you my most advanced diagnosis then, since nobody has been willing to provide any in 3 replies.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Based on the authentication failure and server response&nbsp;<b>535 5.2.1 Login to your account via a web browser to verify your account. code(535)</b>, I should be able to complete the authentication process after login in my Outlook account on Outlook.com
 in my web browser. However, when I do so and repeat the setup process on Gmail.com, the Microsoft server still declares I need to verify my account. Besides, when logging in on Outlook.com, nothing prompts me to verify my account any further than logging in
 per se. So can you please enlighten me about how I can verify my account?</div>
<div><br />
<div>To summarise, when Gmail comes equipped with my Outlook credentials and knock the door of Outlook's SMTP servers, Outlook replies my Outlook account needs to be verified, and so Gmail reports that to me. Gmail is not making this up. Rather, Gmail is purporting
 what Outlook said. Now, can you please clarify what is causing Outlook to say that? I'm sure Gmail is knocking the door politely enough, so it must not be put in question at this point of the diagnosis. But if you have another diagnosis to offer, please go
 on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            Here is another piece of information to help you diagnose the problem.
<div><br />
<div>When I create a new Outlook address, I can setup 'send mail as' as expected from within Gmail.com for that Outlook account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I do the same process with my primary Outlook address that's been around for ages, it still gives me the error 532 5.2.1. Maybe it's a problem with former Hotmail addresses like I have?</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, when I mistype the password in the Gmail setup, I get error 535 5.0.0 'please check your password', not 535 5.2.1 'verify your account'.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, still Gmail's fault?</div>
<div><br />

            don't bother with the mods here, they are sick, stupid and they will totally waste your time, they question is asked every where, with no solution excepted for the linking accounts work around which is not valid any more, even more the moderators are just
 copy pasting the replies around, extremely retarded assholes I would say, this have been going between me and them in different threads and private messages, and whenever I start a new thread, I get the same stupid replies, how to set gmail in outlook, give
 us more information, and then maybe another useless reply and finally , they would say it is a gmail fault, i noticed that the same moderators are re-posting these replies over and over, so they are doing it on purpose ! don't be polite with them, they are
 a bunch of restarted losers, by the way I already tried with gmail in case you still haven't, you will get a reasonable reply from them, it is an MS issue<br />

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I took up your suggestion to change my password, but it didn't affect my issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is more, I have no more security info to add, as it's all filled up. I did try to enable/disable 2-step verification after changing my password: still no effect. I also tried to use the unique app passwords that Outlook generates when you wish to
 connect an external app such as a mail desktop client, but that didn't affect my issue either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another piece of diagnosis:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>When I create a new Outlook account and set it up for 'send mail as' in Gmail.com webmail, everything goes fine on port 587 with TLS.&nbsp;</li><li>Like I said before, if by mistake I mistype my password during the setup process, I get error 535 5.0.0 'please check your password'.</li><li>The same error shows when I activate 2-step verification process on my older Hotmail account and try setting up this account in Gmail.com webmail.</li><li>When 2-step verification is deactivated on this Hotmail account, trying to set it up in Gmail.com webmail leads to error 535 5.2.1 'Login to your account via a web browser to verify your account'.</li></ul>
<div>Could someone from Microsoft with knowledge of their SMTP provide a diagnosis for this issue? A diagnosis is in the following form:</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>Q1) What is the problem?</i>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A) I cannot send mail through Outlook's SMTP for my Hotmail address.</div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>Q2) At which step of the process does the problem occur?</i>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A) When setting up SMTP in Gmail.com's webmail.</div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>Q3) How do you notice the problem?</i>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A) Outlook's SMTP server responds with error 535 5.0.0 or 535 5.2.1</div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>Q4) What is causing Outlook's SMTP server to issue an error?</i>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A) <i><b><u>relevant answer from Microsoft staff goes here.</u></b></i></div>
<div><b><i><u><br />
</u></i></b></div>
<div><b><i>"<u>Therefore, here are the steps you should take to resolve your issue.</u>"</i></b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Note: If a person from the Microsoft moderating team is not qualified to answer this, then (s)he should specify who to turn to instead. If no relevant help can be sought here, it is better to state so that providing irrelevant answers and suggestions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In addition to answering Q4, could someone answer whether having an old Hotmail account is what is causing the issue altogether? I used to be able to 'send mail as' that Hotmail account from my Gmail webmail, but one day it just stopped working and returned
 error&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">535 SMTP 'AUTH failed with the remote server via the&nbsp;</span>Mail Delivery Subsystem'. Most probably some change that occurred when Hotmail.com became Outlook.com has created some incompatibilities.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>So if you have changed your SIM from one operator to a different one then possibly there might be an issue with your device. I would hard Reset so it reinstalls the OS. If it works fine after that then you are all set. If it does not then it is an issue
 to discuss with your mobile operator.</p>

    <title>Borders in Word appear by themselves - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Borders in Word appear by themselves</h2>
                    <p>I have a large Word document that I update every day. I use a horizonal border line to separate my entries.</p>
<p>Sometimes (I can't figure out what triggers this behavior), while I'm&nbsp;editing an entry that's inbetween two of these existing horizonal border lines, a new&nbsp;horiz border line appears out of nowhere -- right in the middle of&nbsp;the text.&nbsp;There is no way to&nbsp;"delete"
 it. If I select it and use the&nbsp;border control on the ribbon to choose "no border," the border doesn't go away -- it just moves up a few lines in the text. The only way to eliminate it is to position the cursor below it and select more text MOVING UPWARDS in
 the doc to just below another border (that I put there earlier intentionally) -- and then to click the "no border" control in the ribbon. This seems to squash the border I don't want into the one that I want to remain -- and the errant border disappears.</p>
<p>It gets time-consuming and very distracting to have to get rid of these surprise borders. Is this a bug? Thanks for any advice or insight.</p>

    <title>How to reactivate a deactivated hotmail account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to reactivate a deactivated hotmail account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deactivated my account a few years ago to create a more professional sounding address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now trying to log back into my old playstation network&nbsp;(PSN) account and to recover the password for this,&nbsp;the PSN&nbsp;is&nbsp;sending&nbsp;my password details to this deactivated Hotmail account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't access my PSN account without getting into my old Hotmail account.&nbsp; Even if they can link the account to my new one that would be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can't remake the email account as outlook no longer uses .co.uk addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please advise how I can get the account reactivated please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Basically you cannot.&nbsp; Microsoft is not creating any new email addresses in co.uk.&nbsp; They are only creating emails in th Hotmail.com &amp; Outlook.com domains.

<div>Basically I tried to log into my account and received the message "It Looks Like Someone Else Might Be Using Your Account" so firstly I attempted to get into this account, however this e-mail was created
 a long time ago, at a time when I used a college e-mail and so since leaving college, the e-mail address in order to get my verification code sent to has been deleted. So I continued onto the "I cannot verify this account" stage.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As I must reiterate this is a very old e-mail and as such I cannot remember my "E-mail Subjects" "Folders I may have created" etc necessary for the "Account Recovery Form".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I try this three times and it tells me I have not provided sufficient information and "blocks the account".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Next step - Chat to an adviser! She makes me fill out a log on this link&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/hotmail-support - DONE. I explain to this adviser all the issues, its an old e-mail, I can't remember everything it needs, the
 verification code can't be sent to the e-mail address saved on this account because it longer exists etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Filled in the form .. two days later I receive a response on a "Log".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So they send me a step-by-step guide on what to do .. and guess what, it is the same thing from the beginning, the "Account Recovery Form". To which now I have stipulated a fair few times that I have tried doing this and cannot remember everything
 it wants and just keeps rejecting me!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Quite simply I have purchased things on this said e-mail account and if my bank details are taken I will be highly annoyed. It is frustrating that I have repeated this story now for the third time to the same people who still seem to not be able
 to get it right! I just wish to get back into this account, delete all information and close it down. In addition I also ran a "Virus" check through my computer (because at first I was blamed for it being hacked) my computer is 100% clean.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Any help would be sincerely appreciated.</strong></div>
