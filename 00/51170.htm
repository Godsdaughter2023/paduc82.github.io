<h2>            Yahoo account deleted &#40;inactivity&#41;, cannot log in with Gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>So the yahoo account I used to log into Live was deleted (I think) at some point within the past month. Because of this, I can no longer access Live with my precious Gamertag I've had for the past 6 or 7 years. The reasoning behind this is, I had be able
 to access Live just fine up until a certain point, when it started telling me that my yahoo account no longer existed. After a little research, I figured out yahoo accounts are eventually deleted due to inactivity, something that never even crossed my mind.
 If I had thought of that sooner, I would have transfered my Tag to another account that I actually used. I honestly didn't even know you could do&nbsp;<em>that</em> until I did some more research. As it is, I'm completely out of luck unless one of you have a beam
 of radiant knowledge that you could shine my way. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Hey man well there still is some hope for your account, I know you cant use the yahoo email anymore but your account is still active with Microsoft. I assume by not being able to access your account you mean that the password you are using is not correct,
 what you would want to do is recover your account. Go to account.live.com then click on 'cant access your account?' then its going to ask you what wrong so click on forgot password then it is going to prompt you to enter your email and then input the characters
 that you see below. In the next screen it want to send you a code to the email or the phone number on file it might even ask you for a security question if you cannot use any of them click on "I don't use these anymore " then its going to take you to another
 screen and ask you Do you "have an account recovery code?' and if you do enter it and if not click no. It is then going to ask you for an email that you can be contacted at so enter and email that you currently have active and use then click submit. It is
 going to give you a questionnaire about your account, try to put as much info as possible if you think it might be just put it after you have entered the info click submit. You are going to get a notification telling you that they will contact you in 24 hours,
 just go check your email usually you are contacted like in a few minutes to about 3 hours. If you get an email letting you back telling you to reset your password just do so and if you get something telling you that you did not provide enough info you are
 going to want to contact xbox live support so they can escalate your issue to there tier 3 department. If you were able to recover your account you are going to want to go to where it says account aliases. If its give you the option to add and alias do so
 then you would want to verify it and make it the primary if it does not give you the option to add an alias it is because it want to verify you original email that is on your account if that's the case you are stuck with that email as you primary but you can
 still update your account info if you go under security info, you can put and email and a phone number so if you ever lose access to your account you can just reset your password using that info. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, if your Yahoo account was deleted recently, you might still be able to recover it. You could also attempt to recreate a Yahoo account using the same log in name. Doing so would make it the same e-mail address that you had before and MS would be able
 to send you password reset help.</p>

<h2>            Constant UAC pop up for file operation.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past few weeks, every time I boot my laptop the user account control starts repeatedly popping up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says for a Microsoft File Operation.&nbsp; So I click 'yes' and keep doing it over and over, sometimes it will say a particular folder doesn't exist and would I like to create it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did it for 3 hours once, but now I turn off UAC for half hour and then it finally stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't whether this is related, but Office 365 Won't start right, which also started around the same time, I open outlook (or word etc) and sometimes says operating system not configured to work on this computer or something like it.&nbsp; I run the apps as
 administrator, and they work, and after that they all work fine, until I reboot again.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and repaired multiple times and it still does it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, again may not be related it also says operating system not configured etc randomly with no apparent file association.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!!!&nbsp; please it's driving me nuts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I've run every virus/malware checker known to man too! lol</p>

            Hi Cat.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you running as Administrator?  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Once you turn it off at Startup, you can create an elevated Shortcut to run it as Admin.  If it needs to run at Startup you can paste the Admin shortcut in the Startup folder: <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1070619/how-to-grant-elevated-privileges-to-a-windows-10-startup-shortcut-to-auto-start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/1070619/how-to-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>1.&nbsp; Problem started after downloading ematic EM102VID conversion software for video.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In process of deleting this program, my child may have deleted a part of Win RAR.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; When trying to play a music file on the hard drive with Windows Media Player, error occurs; COOD11B1;&nbsp; this happened only once, and error message does not appear again.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Clicking on help, will not connect to internet, even when otherwise on line.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Going directly&nbsp;to Microsoft fixit, when trying to run 'Mats_run.codec.exe' or 'FixitCenter_run.exe', I am getting 'Unable to find a version of the runtime to run this application', and am asked to install '.Net Framework 2.0', but the link to download

<p>6.&nbsp; I have directly downloaded and repaired Net Framework 4, and I have Windows XP with SP3, all updates are current.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Have done system restore with no change to the problem, have done update tothe drivers for audio and video with no help to the problem.</p>

<p>What's the file type of the music file that you're trying to play (MP3, WMA, WAV...)? Does the problem occur with all music files, or just one or a few?</p>
<p>You can try downloading WMP again from Microsoft Downloads, and reinstalling it on top of the current installation.</p>

<h3> kimieva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Noob DLC question</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the Ultimate edition this game, so I think I have all the DLC for it. I've already played Warden's Keep and The Stone Prisoner. From what I understand, Return to Ostagar is something I can just do in the main campaign as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about the ones where you can, according to the Wiki, "import" a character from Origins, like Golems of Amgarrak? Is this something that I can do while in the main campaign, or is it something that can only be played separate?</p>

<p>From what I understand. If you create a new character for awakening, the warden will be an orleasian warden. Therefore, no one will acknowledge any of the events from your Dragon Age: Origins playthtough. Plus you will start from level 18, and i do not about
 you , but I always get to around level 23 in a single DA:O playthrough.</p>
<p>Story wise- there is a benefit</p>
<p>Gameplay wise- not a huge benefit</p>

<p>Follow up question: I've now beaten the game 4 times to see four endings, but which one of those endings gets imported? I didn't hit "Resume" and make camp saves of all four of them, so I'm curious if it's like Mass Effect, where every beaten game has its
 own file, or if it only takes into account ones that have actual saves.</p>

<p>Meh, that was thoroughly unsatisfying. Being friends with Morrigan as a female Warden is significantly more interesting IMHO than romancing her as a male Warden. Makes me curious how a romance between Morrigan and a female Warden might have played out, had
 that option been available.</p>

<p>From the issue description it seems that you would like to upgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 8 without clearing the hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will help you with this issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't reformat your hard drive during installation, your files are saved to the Windows.old folder, where you can retrieve them after the upgrade.
</p>
<p>For more info, see <b>How to retrieve files from the Windows.old folder.</b></p>

                    <p class="contentHeader1">Remote Desktop Services App on Windows 10 hangs when opening published apps</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have a remote desktop services deployment with 1 gateway, 1 connection broker and 2 session hosts.&nbsp; When clients connect using IE to the web app, there are no issues at all.&nbsp; If they connect using Remote Application and Desktop
 Connection again, no issues running the published apps.&nbsp; However if they run the remote desktop app from the Windows Store, the published apps show up, but when they try to connect to any of them a window opens and it says connecting with the ever present
 scrolling dots.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Looking at the event viewer on the connection broker under Terminal Services&nbsp;- SessionBroker -Client Operational&nbsp;it shows that the session has been successfully forwarded to the session host, and the client shows that the connection
 has been established.&nbsp; Furthermore, the session host shows that the Listener RDP-Tcp received a connection.&nbsp; It also shows that the session has exceeded its disconnect time and was logged off&nbsp;then&nbsp;Remote Desktop Services Network Fair Share was disabled for
 the user followed by a logout message.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">This has been very frustrating for us to say the least.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Windows Firewall maliciously&#47;suspiciously turned off and won&#39;t restart.</h2>
                    A pop up screen appeared saying that my Windows Firewall was not active.&nbsp; (I ALWAYS have it active, so this was a first!)&nbsp; I tried to reactivate it, but the system says I can't use the Firewall service.&nbsp; I suspected malware, so I ran MS Safety Scanner,
 McAfee's product, and VipreRescue.&nbsp; None of the three products found any malware.&nbsp; I'd appreciate any advice you might have.&nbsp; Thanks.

            Hi,&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6a99eb16-1a2c-4ab9-9dab-e77930ee8174">hello today xp</a>,
<div>Windows Firewall is always turned on by its default settings after installing a new copy of windows. But when you install an Anti-virus (e.g. Norton Internet Security) especially from third parties, it turns off Firewall during its installation. Later,
 it may not automatically turn on your Windows Firewall. Even, when you try to turn it on, it will allegedly prevent you from doing this. Why? Because it itself uses its own firewall settings to protect your computer. So, check out your Anti-virus program.
 However, If Windows Firewall persists not to be turned on, you can launch system restore. It will bring back your computer into the previos state. If you can manually uninstall the program that is preventing Firewall to start on the go, that will be better.&nbsp;If
 your computer is connected to a network, network policy settings might prevent you from completing the process too. So, disconnect your computer from internet first, then try to turn Windows Firewall on. At last, restart your computer to take effect the changes
 you made. If everything fails, just restore your system to an earlier state.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
To open System Restore
<span>Before you start System Restore, save any open files and close all programs. Once you confirm your restore point, System Restore restarts your computer.</span>
<span>Click on</span> Start menu. Then,
<b>Accessories, System Tools, </b><span>click</span>&nbsp;<b>System Restore&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;.<span>&nbsp;<span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide
 confirmation.</span></span>
<span>Then follow the instructions on Screen.</span>

            Hello and thanks for the info.&nbsp; However, I am trying to learn why the Firewall was turned off.&nbsp; Nothing had changed in my system to cause this.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The Windows Firewall had been on for YEARS.&nbsp; I had been using McAfee virus scan for YEARS.&nbsp; The McAfee firewall was not even installed because (as you indicated) a system can only use one firewall.<br />
<br />
Then, out of no where, McAfee gives me a message that the Windows Firewall is not active.&nbsp; And WIndows won't allow me to turn the firewall back on.<br />
<br />
So I would like to learn what caused this problem.&nbsp; Can you help detyermine this?<br />

<p>
</p><p>But after upgrading to Windows 10, I cannot find equaliser in MAXX Audio app. Also, I don't think the whole MAXX audio thing is working. Now when I watch movies with headphones, it feels like people are shouting in my ear.</p>

            <p>I had contacted the tech aupport on chat. I do not remwmber the person who was with me, but he resolved my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turna out, the latest version of MAXX Audio was not supported by Windows 10. The guy uninstalled it and installed latest version recommended on Dell's website (which actually is an older version)</p>

<h2>            Server Manager Stops Working After October Updates, Faulting Module KernelBase.dll</h2>
                    <p>From Event Log:&nbsp;Faulting application name: ServerManager.exe, version: 6.3.9600.17238 Faulting module name: KERNELBASE.dll, version: 6.3.9600.18666</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
October updates were for 2012 &amp; 2012 R2 servers.and Windows 10 Workstations.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Some 2012 R2 servers can still run Server Manager but most cannot. This is spread across multiple VMHosts. All drivers are current. DISM and SFC have both been tried. Some servers had multiple servers added to S/M but others only had the local machine.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Only one Windows 10 machine still has a working implementation of Server Manager. The user states they have six (6) servers added (under All Servers)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
We had the thought that maybe there is one certain server that, if added to Server Manager's list of servers, kills the application. But even if we do find this machine, how would we remove it from Server Manager's list (it crashes on opening)?</p>

            You need to install all of the drivers.&nbsp; There is no difference between XP Home and XP Pro as far as drivers are concerned.<br />
<br />
You may, however, be faced with a "non-genuine Windows" issue unless the XP Home CD you used to do your recent install has its own product key -- the product key on the label affixed to your computer will not work with it.<br />

Enter your computer's model.&nbsp; If you just enter "Compaq 6830s" you get 3 choices.<br />

complete product number</a>, but if not, here's some general guidance:<br />
<br />
For each of the downloads, click each tab on the download page and read the information about "Description," Enhancements," "Installation Instructions," "System Requirements," Release Notes," and "Revision History"
<b>before </b>you actually install the downloaded driver.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Start with "Driver - Chipset" and use "9.1.0.1007 A (16 Jan 2009)." </li><li>Next go to "Driver - Storage."&nbsp; Install the Intel Matrix Storage Manager driver.&nbsp; Optional, but probably very desirable, install the newer version of HP 3D DriveGuard.&nbsp; You probably don't need (at least for now), the SmartCard Reader driver (unless you
 have an external SmartCard reader).</li><li>Next go to "Driver - Audio." Install the Microsoft UAA driver and the newer of the ADI SoundMax drivers.</li><li>Next go to "Driver - Graphics." Install the newer ATI video driver.</li><li>Next go to "Driver - Network."&nbsp; This is a bit trickier.&nbsp; Install the Marvel Yukon Gigabit Ethernet controller driver.&nbsp; This will permit you to connect to your cable or DSL modem, or your router, by Ethernet cable.&nbsp; You need to determine if your particular
 notebook has an Intel or Broadcom wireless adapter.&nbsp; By looking in Device Manager in the "Network adapter" section you should be able to make that identification.&nbsp; Install the driver for the appropriate device.&nbsp; If you believe that your notebook has Bluetooth
 capability, install that driver as well.&nbsp; The HP "wireless assistant" is optional.&nbsp; I would delay installing this at this point.</li><li>Next go to "Driver - Keyboard, Mouse, and Input Devices."&nbsp; Install the Synaptics Touchpad driver and the driver for the HP Quick Launch buttons.</li></ul>
<p>At this point, most of your hardware should be operating correctly.&nbsp; If there are still warning icons in Device Manager, you should be able to figure them out ... or ask again here.&nbsp; Read the "Description" for other downloads to see if it is something you
 want or need.&nbsp; Be aware, however, that many of the "Software" downloads are only patches or updates, and not the complete software package (which presumably would have been pre-installed on a new computer.<br />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the is probably up to the creators of the game or the platform to decide, not really something Xbox controls.</p>
<p>So it might be best to try and reach out to people that may 'control' that for Intellivision</p>

            Depends on a lot of unlisted factors: like what email client you are using specifically, what email service provider you use, how you connect to that email service provider with whatever client you are using, etc.

    <title>Bluetooth missing from device manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mivanit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth missing from device manager</h2>
                    <p>I was having problems with my bluetooth&nbsp;mouse, replaced the batteries, tried to remove it from connected devices to reconnect, but it said device could not be removed. So, I tried to just turn bluetooth on and off but after turning it off it could not be
 switched on again. I've had this problem once before, and that time I managed to fix it by restarting Bluetooth Support Service through "services.msc". This time that didn't work, despite multiple restarts. I've tried turning it to manual, restarting, and
 turning it on, as well as back to automatic start and restarting my machine.&nbsp;None of it worked. Tried to update drivers through device manager, but no updates were found. I also tried (because I saw it suggested on a forum) uninstalling all bluetooth&nbsp;devices
 through device manager (after trying to just enable/restart them of course). Despite what it said on the forum, my bluetooth&nbsp;devices did not reappear in device manager after this, despite scanning for hardware changes, showing hidden devices, and manually
 trying to install drivers from Acer (I have an Aspire F5 573).&nbsp; I also wasn't able to find anything in the "add legacy hardware" option, it doesn't&nbsp;list anything under bluetooth devices. Please let me know if you have any suggestions as to what else I can
 try.</p>

<p>Dear Mivanit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused and thanks for describing your problem in detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have tried all the basic steps so what I would suggest would be is to download the driver from&nbsp;<a href="https://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/Driver/Bluetooth/Bluetooth_Intel_18.1.1546.2762_W10x64_A.zip?acerid=635979270710211133&amp;Step1=NOTEBOOK&amp;Step2=ASPIRE&amp;Step3=ASPIRE%20F5-573G&amp;OS=ALL&amp;LC=en&amp;BC=ACER&amp;SC=PA_6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install it &amp; then try to restart the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if after the restart if it works or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not work even then, download the Driver Booster from&nbsp;<a href="http://files.downloadnow-1.com/s/software/16/01/75/24/driver_booster_setup.exe?token=1516860613_aece7802b68e4e8f789943eb69fd10be&amp;fileName=driver_booster_setup.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a trial version however will update all missing and obsolete drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it is done restart the system and then check if you can use the mouse or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that too fails then you try to restore the system back to the date it was working good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if that helped you.&nbsp;</p>

            The driver you sent is one of the two I attempted to install from Acer, unfortunately I have already tried this multiple times, but thank you nonetheless. What is this "driver booster" program? "files.downloadnow-1.com" does not sound very secure. Who
 releases this software, and why is the link not to their official website? does microsoft endorse this software? Additionally, I fail to see how this can help as I have downloaded and installed the newest drivers from Acer manually.

<p>Hi Abdul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may be caused by the need to update the software settings of your Surface device.&nbsp; Let's try to run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (SDT) in order to the device to get updated with the latest drivers.&nbsp; To find out more about this, please click
 on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running SDT, try to modify or change your date and time settings and see if the issue persists even when you disconnect the screen from the keyboard.</p>

<p>Hi! Vicky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performed the process as guided above but still if you disconnect the direct electricity even when the surface Pro 3&nbsp; is in off position the time and date does not synchronize, I have to manually adjust but If leave the direct electricity on even when the
 surface pro 3 is in off position the time and date does not change ( meaning synchronized and depicts the correct time and date) Please advise next steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Vouna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the trouble shooting process as directed in Mar T's thread&nbsp; as mentioned above and synchronized with INTERNET TIME SERVER many times but no change</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The time works accurately ONLY if the unit is plugged to power supply all the time both in Off and ON position. besides , if I unplug and off it then the wrong times appears on re-start but then when I plug the unit&nbsp; to power supply&nbsp; and try synchronize
 with&nbsp; the INTERNET TIME SERVER then the time automatically corrects to local time without manually adjusting the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any battery internally fixed to the clock which is not working or not charging ( I am not referring to the UNIT's main battery which
</p>
<p>working fine)</p>

                    It doesn't matter what keyboard i try to use on my laptop.Everytime i plug it in it says installing drivers and all i get is a fail message.I have went into device manager and tried uninstalling and re-installing from the manufacturers website.I have even
 tried a Microsoft Comfort Keyboard 2000 and it does the same. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OS windows 7 home premium.I got the computer from an individual and not new or refurbished so i think they may have done something to cause this problem without knowing.Also
 when i try to install the windows 7 SP1 update it says it fails and has to restore.Could these 2 problems be linked in some way?I usually figure most stuff out but...this has me stumped.Please help.

            <p>If you have received a second user PC the first thing you should do, if not allready done, is to restore the PC to factory supplied state using the PC makers recovery disks. Only after this has been done can we diagnose any faults.</p>
<p>NB You will lose all programs and data when doing this</p>

            <p>The system may have a hidden recovery partition, with which to create the recovery disks as per that laptop makers instructions.</p>
<p>Or you can contact that makers support line to request the disks, for a small fee.</p>
<p>Unless you reset to factory condition you have no idea what the previous user did with the system or installed/downloaded.</p>
<p>You cannot correctly install a driver by moving it to another folder, that simply wont work</p>
<p>You also have the problem that Win sp1 fails to install.</p>
<p>So all in all you have a damaged system that you are not going to be able to cure untill you first put it back to factory condition. (Or buy a retail version of win7 in order to clean install)</p>
<p>BTW What make/model laptop is it?</p>
