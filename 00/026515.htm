<h2>            Sharepoint&#58; Track the number of times an attachment has been downloaded</h2>
                    Per thread title: if I upload a document to Sharepoint, can I track how many (unique) users have downloaded it? Can I track how many times it's been downloaded? Can I track usage over time?

<h2>            Unable to add Office 365 User to Members of Sharepoint Site</h2>
                    I have created a new employee as a user with a Business Essentials license. We have many such users. When I try to add her user name to the Members group of our sharepoint site I receive an error message: "The user does not exist or is not unique." I have
 tried deleting and recreating the user, but still receive the message. When I attempt to connect Outlook to the team site calendar I can see the team calendar without any items, but when it asks to confirm credentials I receive the following error message:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20655f1c-e66c-4522-a4f2-0e56f14c9785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20655f1c-e66c-4522-a4f2-0e56f14c9785" /></a>

<h2>            IE crashing &#47; uxtheme.dll error</h2>
                    <p>Recently, we've had several computers experiencing an issue that causes IE to freeze, crash, and reopen without warning or error messages. We've looked at the Event Viewer logs and find:</p>

</p><p>We’ve ensured there were no 3rd party extensions or add-ons running in IE – no luck. We’ve tried disabling user interface animations (e.g., minimizing, closing, or opening a new window; aero peek; etc.) - no luck. We’ve reset Win10 – no luck. We’ve rolled
 back to a previous restore point – no luck. We're tried running the SFC - no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: update on situation. The laptop was reset on Friday (02/15). Upon booting up the laptop today it remains stuck on a black screen. Opening task manager and running explorer.exe, we got the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\uxtheme.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation mdedia....</p>

            HI, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Clear browsing history. 
<br />
<br />3. Run the SFC scan 
<br />Run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as "System File Checker" or "sfc". This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions. Here's how: 
<br />1. Press Windows key + X, click Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command, sfc /scannow and then press Enter. 
<br />3. Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk 
<br />and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive. 
<br />4. Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, restart the system. 
<br />
<br />4. Repair and reset the app: 
<br />Right-click on the Start menu button, and select Settings. 
<br />Select App, click on IE from the list, and select Advanced options. 
<br />Select Repair. 
<br />If the issue persists, repeat the steps and select Reset. 
<br />
<br />In case the procedures above didn't work you can try the procedures in the links below:

            Hi Angel
<br />
<br />Could you check if this happens under another user account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try using IE under that account. 
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, Microsoft has begun to encourage users stop users stop using Internet Explorer. Its probably best you consider an alternative browser such as Firefox or Google Chrome if you don't like using Edge.

<h2>            N8 Nokia Maps- One problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have noticed that whenever I zoom in, the maps will display the location of all the bus and subway stations.</p>
<p>While that is good for some, I have no interest in knowing where they are all listed.</p>
<p>Also, the phone slows down and struggles to move when I scroll around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any ways to move the Bus and Subway icons as a selection in the Categories folder?</p>
<p>It would be nice to be able to remove the icons if there are no need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>I got an idea (pretty good, I think)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, the start menu is like this by clicking on the Windows logo: </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Left click: the start menu (with apps, search etc...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Right click: a contextual menu with thechnical tools</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">new thing</span>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Left click: the actual start menu (maybe with différents color tones but i'll tell us about it in an other topic...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Right click: a&nbsp;<strong> graphical&nbsp;"Settings&nbsp;menu</strong>" like the&nbsp;start menu&nbsp;but with the&nbsp;<strong>technical Tools
</strong>(like disk defrag, control panel etc...) of the actual right click contextual menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My explanation isn't very good (i'm french) but thoose pictures can help you:</p>

            <p>Yeah I also had similar ideas; If you left click you get Start Menu, if you right click you get Start Screen. That was my idea.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had not though but it can be also good.</p>
<p>We should have the possbility to choose between tow "Righ click menus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;the "Start Screen" and the "Technical Menu" which can include this options:</p>

<h3> maggie michigan  say:</h3>
<h2>            logger.js twitter.windows.exe</h2>
                    <p>A couple of days ago I received a notice that logger.js had downloaded and wanted to run.&nbsp; I searched the computer and deleted this from temporary internet files.&nbsp; I then ran Norton antivirus, Norton power eraser, Malwarebytes, and Microsoft security scan.&nbsp;
 There were no findings from any of the scans.&nbsp; Then, the magnifying glass on the yahoo search button stopped working.&nbsp; I can search with other browsers but not with Yahoo though my favorites still do work.&nbsp; Today, I received a notice from Norton that twitter.windows.exe
 was trying to access the internet.&nbsp; When I touched the notification box it automatically went to accept.&nbsp; Norton did say this is a safe program.&nbsp; I manually went to the Norton firewall and blocked this program (it seems some malware can mask itself as this
 program per the internet).&nbsp; The program is located in C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\9E2F88E3.Twitter_5.3.1.0_wgeqdkkx372wm\Twitter.Windows.exe.&nbsp; When I try to access the WindowsApps folder I get a message that " You don't currently have permission to access
 this folder", then "You have been denied permission to access this folder" (though there is an option to gain access through a security tab).&nbsp; Please advise if I have an issue here and what the next steps should be.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<h2>            nokia 5800 express music problems after software update</h2>
                    
<p>I updated&nbsp; my phones software (version 50.0.005). I downloaded ovi store update,installed it but it is not working on my phone, can't even open it. I also downloaded ovi maps but installation is always failed 'due to internal error'. I reinstalled the software
 but the problems persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, after update, I have to unlock my phone to answer a call. same thing with my alarm</p>

<p>First of all it's always advisable to do a reset after a software update, backing up ONLY contact and calendar (backing up your settings may restore any conflict between the new and old software) then set up the phone manually. For answering phone , you
 should see two animated arrows pointing right and left when called, simply swipe in the direction the arrow points, or go into settings and disable the auto lock function, and simply lock your screen manually using the slider.</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<p>Hi Deegs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the Outlook desktop client to create templates and save the templates to local. But it isn't feasible to add template in Outlook Web App. As I understand based on your description, you want to create company-wide templates. You can create templates,
 then save templates to&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200758(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Public Folder</a> as a work around. In this situation, other users can use the templates in your organization. At the meantime,
 you can give feedback to our related engineers via <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/313228--outlook-on-the-web-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook on the web Uservoice</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your understanding is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t open the PDF document created by Office Lens from within - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sba923  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open the PDF document created by Office Lens from within Office Lens</h2>
                    <p>I have uninstalled Adobe Reader from my Lumia 830 running Windows 10 Mobile 10.0.10586.218.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a naughty side effect: when I click the PDF version of a document created by Office Lens within Office Lens, I get prompted for "do you want to search for al application in the Store." If I they&nbsp; click "Yes" the phone switches to the Store app, with
 a title of "Office", and an empty window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I re-associate PDFs in Office Lens with, say, PDF Reader, or Edge, or cause it to prompt me for one of the installed apps that can open PDFs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: uninstalling / reinstalling Office Lens doesn't fix the issue. Uninstalling / reinstalling PDF Reader doesn't either.</p>

<h2>            retriving an &#64;live.ie email account</h2>
                    I had an @live. ie email address which I set up in 2011. I rarely used the account so it has been closed due to inactivity. I now need access to the account and wasadvised by Microsoft support to set up a new account with the same address. I tried this
 but it said that @live.ie was a " reserved domain". Is there anything I can do to recreate the account I had. I don't need any old messages on the account just access to the account.

    <title>Outlook Mac 2011--Transfer sub folders from one imap account to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sisyphusyp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Mac 2011--Transfer sub folders from one imap account to another</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook 2011 as an email client. I have an IMAP account with several subfolders and I have a lot of email in these folders which is stored on the servers of my ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently signed up with BT, mainly to get BT Sport, but I want to use my BT mail address for future emails. I need access to the emails stored on my initial ISP's servers, and thought I could do this by setting up new folders on the BT server and
 copying the emails from the initial folders into them. This seemed to work, but now, a couple of days after the copying, the mails no longer show in the new folders. I thought that perhaps the copying was not meant to work and started looking at exporting
 and importing the emails in the various folders, but I cannot get this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody tell me how this can be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For background, the initial ISP also provides me with webspace to a domain I own. I have no future need of it and want to give up the domain, but if I do this now I will lose access to my email in the folders. I would like to transfer everything as soon
 as possible and close the domain but in practice it will have to continue for some time as, like many people, my email address on the old server is registered with lots of companies whose products I use. I have details of many of them, but some come as a surprise,
 today's being my ongoing sub to the Automobile Association. I think I will have to run both mail accounts for say six months to catch all of them before I can close the original account but it would be a big step forward to get the mail from the initial iSP'
 servers to the BT servers.</p>

<h2>            Email from me to me</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am receiving emails to me from me.&nbsp; They are not picked up by junk mail and I'm afraid to open them. What should I do?</p>
<p>I am not using a windows email service if that makes a difference. I use MyWay and have been for 10 years. I don't even know who to</p>
<p>ask since I don't know where the fault lies.</p>
<p>The emails are addressed to my email from my email and the subject is always "documents from work."</p>
<p>I want to read it so bad I can't stand it. In the preview there is nothing and the header shows it as untitled document.</p>
<p>Changing emails is out of the question I have to much on there from to many people from 10 years of use.
</p>
<p>I'll be converting to windows 10 in the next week but I need to settle this first.</p>

            <p>Though you apparently already realize it, this is obviously a potentially dangerous file, since clearly no one would send you such a terse message or file name if they knew you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact a short search came up with the following info that the attachment is a ransomware named Locky that would have encrypted all your files, so lucky you didn't open it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&lt; EDIT &gt; In case it isn't obvious from the above, delete this email and any others that appear suspicious.&nbsp; If someone really important wants to reach you they will provide a more reasonable message that you should recognize as from the person you know.&nbsp;
 If not, being suspicious in this day and age of phishing, spam and malicious attachments is always the best policy to protect yourself.</p>

</p><p>And FYI, your email account password had nothing to do with this.</p>

            <p>If you read closely on the web page I linked above:</p>
<p>"This rather terse spam appears to come from the victim themselves (but doesn't)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what is called a "spoofed" message, since the from address portion has been faked by the true sender to appear to come&nbsp;from yourself.&nbsp; This could have been displayed as from&nbsp;anyone, but as you noticed this makes blocking the message virtually impossible.&nbsp;
 It's a common trick used by spammers and others attempting to get a malicious message delivered past most junk mail filters.</p>

<p>Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again many thanks. Unfortunately, I'm still having the problem with a new twist. This time, the email was sent from me to a subject. It seems that the subject was an entry into my contact file. I'm sad to say that I opened two of them.</p>
<p>These unlike the others had body text and didn't seem suspicious at all until to late I saw the sender was me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One was my wife's email address with a message from direct-TV. I thought she might have not maid the payment on time. I hit the hyper-link and went to Direct-TV. The second was the worst. It was PayPal. In both I had to use my&nbsp; Password. You can imagine
 the fear that hit me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called PayPal, changed my password and then talked to someone in security. While I was waiting to talk to someone, I went to my email In Box. The whole page of 20 emails was listed this way. The person I talked to in PayPal security said,&nbsp; changing my
 name was a good idea but, they had the means to stop anyone else but me from entering my Pay Pal account. He said it might be a good ides to change my security questions. I did this, and to help ease my mind I also removed my bank and it's info. For good measure
 I also changed my credit card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, when I went back to my email, everything was back to normal. I'm at a loss as what to do.</p>
<p>I even did a clean install to Windows 10 two days ago. I've been with my email company, My Way out of UK for 10 years or better.</p>
<p>I haven't checked out the SPF yet (just got my computer back) but I will. Will this apply to MyWay. I hope I can understand it.
</p>
<p>If you can help I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>

            <p>Quit opening messages without stopping to look carefully at them first and then if they don't look right at all, just delete them.&nbsp; The "best" phishing messages like those you apparently received are often very simple and use subtle tricks to get you to
 open them, but if you look at them in the context of what you've seen from that sender in the past, there's always something "fishy" about them, hence the name Phishing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a link in the email is asking you to login, that's a huge red flag and should immediately cause you to stop and think, at which point exiting the current screen and opening a fresh one where you manually enter or select an existing favorite for that particular
 organization is the only safe option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how your particular My Way email works or what specific security features they have in place, that's a question for them.&nbsp; If your email address is something like my.name @ myway.com then the SPF Record would be for them, if you have a personalized
 domain like bill.com then My Way would still likely manage this for you, but the SPF Record would need to be specific for that specially chosen domain.&nbsp; In any case, your email management would typically do this and not you personally, since you have none
 of the knowledge or access to make this happen in most cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick look online at a simple "review" of My Way at About.com seems to indicate it's a rather weak service that includes advertising in the outgoing messages, which in the US is typically avoided.&nbsp; The cons were mostly missing features, so apparently nothing
 terribly wrong with them, but nothing all that special either,&nbsp;but some of the major names have their own issues so even&nbsp;that's no guarantee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent type of phishing messages you received are often difficult for even the best Junk mail filters to catch, since I've seen 3 of these myself sent by 2 different people who clicked on these by mistake.&nbsp; They might seem quite convincing to most
 people, but to me the relatively terse subject line combined with the senders who I knew obviously made no sense together.&nbsp; I purposefully opened one of these and clicked the link which took me to a somewhat convincing login page for my own email account,
 but which had small clues like a copyright years in the future and slight distortions in the images I could personally recognize as invalid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem is only partially related to My Way, since like many others you are now&nbsp;allowing your worry or haste to override your common sense.&nbsp; No email system at present is good enough to perfectly block every false message that's sent, so you must take
 the time to vet them yourself.&nbsp; This is why I personally keep my sign-ups to any email lists to an absolute minimum and preferably only for notifications that I can personally choose and configure, like alerts from my bank that I then always log into manually
 (no email links ever!) in order to manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never give out my email address to anyone I don't completely trust and instead have a secondary "throwaway" address which I use for less trustworthy firms where I still may need that ability, since I can always provide my "real" address later if I feel
 their&nbsp;status changes.&nbsp; This has kept my own Spam email to a minimum and so gives me more time to examine a questionable message that does make it into my inbox.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much, you've really tried to help me. I'm not exactly sure what's going on, but I don't think it's&nbsp; phishing messages. When I go to my email the whole page has emails from me. I can't afford to miss 20 messages.</p>
<p>So i tried restarting my computer and have found that sometimes they say their from me and sometimes the same messages are listed as being from the correct party that sent the message. I've even found that by refreshing my email account it corrects it's
 self. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for the lone email that's from me to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to have to find out what's causing this, because it's really been a pain in the a*$. Although it's not a solution,</p>
<p>at least I've found a stressful work around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your insightful ideas and a special thanks for holding me accountable for missing some simple things, I should have been looking out for. Your answers came really fast and were very thought out. I'll try to put some of
</p>
<p>them into practice as they seem to be very helpful.</p>
<p>

            <p>It seems you've been discussing multiple issues, with some sort of flaky operation of your email client involved in the changing address fields after "refreshing", however you are doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the email system is unstable, you'd need to contact My Way to try and determine what may be causing those issues.&nbsp; I was concentrating on your description of the PayPal and other message where you indicated you felt the messages were in some way suspect,
 so you contacted PayPal support and made security changes.&nbsp; This is what I was responding to, so if this was simply due to some flaky email operation it may have been unnecessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't apparently make sense of what your situation is, so I'm going to stop trying to provide answers for things that make no sense.&nbsp; You need to either talk to the My Way support or have someone technically knowledgeable look at your email with you to
 determine what's really happening first.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Alexandra,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing issues while surfing websites using Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue you are facing could be caused due to incorrect settings in Internet Explorer or if the websites are not compatible to Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To get a better understanding of the issue, I want to know:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span>Are you facing similar issue with other browsers?</span></li><li><span>Is this issue specific to some particular websites?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue is specific to Internet Explorer, I suggest you to open Internet Explorer in In-private mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>InPrivate Browsing</span></strong><span> helps prevent your
 browsing history, temporary Internet files, form data, cookies, and user names and passwords from being retained by the browser.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can start InPrivate Browsing from the Safety menu, by pressing
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+P</strong>, or from the New Tab page. Internet&nbsp;Explorer will launch a new browser session that won’t keep any information about webpages you visit or searches you perform. Closing the browser window will end your InPrivate Browsing session.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, try the methods below and check the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Internet Explorer Performance Troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might be able to solve some problems by running a troubleshooter that will automatically fix some common issues with Internet Explorer Performance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press the ‘<strong><span>Windows + W’</span></strong> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type <strong><span>Troubleshooter</span></strong> in the
<strong><span>Search</span></strong> box and then press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Select <strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>. Click on
<strong><span>View All </span></strong>and select
<strong><span>Internet Explorer Performance.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>d) Click <strong><span>Next</span></strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After trying the troubleshooting from Method 1, if the issue still persists you may also follow Method 2 and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>
<strong><span>Fix site display problems with Compatibility View</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the article below:</span></p>

<p>Sounds like you are in the Immersive browser (aka MUF IE) with the Address bar set not to Auto-hide.&nbsp; Press Win-I, Enter&nbsp;for Options to toggle that option off.&nbsp; (Alternatively swipe from the right to see the Charms bar, tap on the Settings charm and then
 use the Options button.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally MUF IE was always Fullscreen until its Address bar was raised with an swipe from the top or bottom for its "options".&nbsp; That's why it was called "Immersive".&nbsp; I guess that caused too much confusion for new users so they gave them a permanent Address
 bar to feel oriented with.</p>

 are a dozen categories with an average of a dozen subcategories each.&nbsp; I'm sorry, that's a withering number.&nbsp; The people trying Windows 10 and providing feedback are providing a tremendous benefit to Microsoft.&nbsp; We are not Microsoft employees.&nbsp; We are taking
 our valuable spare time to do this.&nbsp; Make it as easy as you possibly can on the folks providing feedback, even if means extra work for the interns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other nice thing with the forum is that I enter in my question and *then*, *afterwards*, I am asked to categorize it.&nbsp; That's the correct order.&nbsp; With the feedback tool, you have to pick the category up front. Literally, I am not kidding, after spending
 some time trying to find the right category and subcategory with the feedback tool, it took me a minute to recall exactly what I was giving them feedback on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, hey, if you are willing to micro-categorize your feedback, knock yourself out.&nbsp; But its a barrier that some folks are not going to get over.</p>

<p>As Graham said, you can save this as a <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If you simply want the header and footer available through the Insert &gt; Header/Footer galleries, then save them as building blocks in a template and make that template a

<h2>            MS Support and ActiveX control denied in IE9</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Microsoft REALLY don't want to give anyone any help do they?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/oas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/oas</a></p>
<p>Internet Explorer has blocked this site from using an ActiveX control in an unsafe manner.</p>
<p>Let's set aside that this was a message I had to TYPE from one IE window into another.</p>
<p>Let's also set aside the fact that this prompt contains NO information on how to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll set aside the fact that this site is in my trusted zone AND a Microsoft HTTPS website.</p>
<p>[deep breath]</p>
<p>Please give me a procedure to get around this, so that I may continue my original task of asking for help with something else.</p>

<blockquote>It's Win7 x64, however this behaviour is common to all OSes (that run IE).</blockquote>
<p><br />
<em>NB: ActiveX Controls are NOT supported in IE 64-bit.</em></p>
<p>Please answer <strong>all of the following diagnostic questions</strong> by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Did you upgrade to Win7, was Win7 preinstalled when you bought the computer, or did you do a clean install?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Does the behavior persist if you start IE8 32-bit in No Add-ons mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; Start | (All) Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Internet Explorer (No add-ons)</p>
<p>3. Does the behavior persist if you Reset IE Advanced settings &amp; reboot?<br />

<p>4. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>5. Has a(nother) Norton application or a McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>6. Did a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>7. Are ALL of the following updates listed in Installed Updates (not Update History)? =&gt;&nbsp; KB976902, KB2419640, KB2423089, KB2436673, KB2416400, KB2296199 &amp; KB981852</p>
