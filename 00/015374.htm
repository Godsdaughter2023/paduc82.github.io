<h2>            Bing Ads for Nigerian Advertizer</h2>
                    Hello. Nice to be here. I tried signing up as an advertiser with bing ads. My Microsoft account was set up but couldn't register with bing ads because Nigeria wasn't on the list. You don't do business with advertizers in Nigeria?

    <title>Lack of memory after upgrading to Windows Phone 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lack of memory after upgrading to Windows Phone 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Before upgrading to Windows Phone 10, my cellphone Lumia 640 XL had something around 3G from original 8G memory. This is why I managed to upgrade. After upgrading, however, when I connect my device to my computer, it shows less than 1G of memory remained.
 This is while when I use my File Explorer nothing is there. It's empty of anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's obvious that last OS, Windows Phone 8.1, plus the new one, Windows Phone 10, have occupied the memory. I would like to know if anyone knows how I can release at least a part of my memory.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>There is two ways.</p>
<p>1. Go to storage and move/uninstall apps from your device. Clear internet history, cache or&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. you just try to downgrade your windows 10 to windows 8.1 using Windows recovery tool. Then upgrade to Windows 10. It will work. Take a Backup before doing this.</p>

    <title>In Outlook, no longer able to chanqe existing account&#39;s email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vic in nyc  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Outlook, no longer able to chanqe existing account&#39;s email address.</h2>
                    <p>Why was the capability removed to change the IMAP email address of an existing account, in Outlook 365? The loss of this capability is disrupting a workflow I was relying on in Outlook 2012, and I now have to edit the registry to in order to maintain the
 workflow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my IMAP email accounts is a catch-all for any email address at a domain I own that is not handled by another account. This is useful because it allows me to specify and receive emails on an arbitrary email address at my domain, when I create an account
 on a website. For example, when registering at microsoft.com, I may give my email as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. In Outlook 2012, when responding to emails sent to this address, I could go into account settings for the catch-all account and change my email
 address to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. But in Outlook for Office 365, I cannot find any way to set the email address for the account, and I am resorting to editing the registry and restarting Outlook. I can set the "Reply-to address" under File/Account
 Settings/Account Name and Sync Settings, but the "email" address is not settable in any of the options under Account Settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can view the email address by selecting:</p>
<ul>
<li>File/Account Settings/Account Name and Sync Settings, or</li><li>File/Account Settings/Server Settings</li></ul>
<p>It appears under the heading "IMAP Account Settings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The full version is "Microsoft Outlook for Office 365 MSO (16.0.11629.20210) 32-bit." I'm running Windows 7 Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The registry key where I find the email address to change is:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles\Other IMAP\9375CFF0413111d3B88A00104B2A6676\00000004</p>

<h2>            Saving emails to my sky drive or pc</h2>
                    Can anyone help? I wish to save email folders (and all the emails contained therein) to either my pc hard drive or to my skydrive.
<div>I am using hotmail on outlook.com<br />
<div>I have searched for hours on here to find how to do this and just cannot find a solution that works.</div>
</div>
<div>One 'solution' mentioned using the 'file' tab on windows live mail, but I don't have one, and on my skydrive (accessed from outlook.com)</div>
<div>I only seem to get the option to save files from my pc and not email folders.</div>
<div>I am getting increasingly frustrated trying to find the answer to what should be a simple question.</div>
<div>Hopefully someone out there can help ?</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to us. I will try to answer all of your questions one at a time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Yes, by downloading and using Windows Live Mail, you will still be able to sign in to your Microsoft account on any other devices such as your computer and/or mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Yes, you can do so by selecting <strong>Selected folders</strong> instead of
<strong>All folders </strong>on step 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Yes, you need to use Windows Live Mail in order to import the email messages that was exported. And yes, you can use multiple email accounts on Windows Live Mail on the same computer. You will just have to sign out on Windows Live Mail, then sign in the
 other account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. You are good with the steps shared to us by <font color="#0072c6">Eugene S.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have other questions regarding to the web based Hotmail/Outlook.com, don't hesitate to post it here in Microsoft Community or you may try to search for an answer via the search function.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting at the community.</p>

<p>That's not a normal camera behaviour. I would advise you to contact Nokia Support about the issue:

<p>If there's something you cannot change on the phone you will need to ask for a replacemente phone.</p>

<p>I need to add an additional MX record to the DNS, in a subdomain, for an external SMTP service used by our system to notify our users.</p>
<p>The question is, when I try to create a new entry there is no option for MX, it only shows CNAME, A, AAAA and TXT.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacted the provider of the Office 365 service. </p>
<p>
</p><p>They explained that when I use the Domain Managed by Office 365 option it restricts the creation of MX records.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case the only option is to use an external DNS manager for both O365 and my second mail service.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, may I know which build of Windows 10 Tech Preview you installed and how as it installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a clean install using the ISO (which is more likely, as the optional "upgrade" to Windows 10 Tech Preview from Windows 7 and Windows 8.1&nbsp;was only made available a few weeks back), I suggest:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Reverting the computer back to factory settings if Windows 7 was pre-installed to the computer when you first got it using the provided recovery media, or;</p>
<p>2. Doing a clean install using your Windows 7 installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also go to <strong>Action</strong> <strong>Center </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings
</strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Recovery</strong> &gt; <strong>
Go back to a previous version of Windows</strong> if you haven't&nbsp;used Disk Cleanup to delete files from the previous install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to back up all of your files first before doing any of the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

<h2>            OneNote &#40;Metro App&#41; not supported on Windows Server&#63; Future of OneNote &#40;Desktop&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello together,<br />
<br />
first things first: i am from Germany and i do not speak / write englisch very often, so i excuse for any inconveniences due to incorrect grammar etc..<br />
<br />
Now to mjy questions:<br />
<br />
- Can or can't i use metro apps (especially OneNote) on windows server 2016 in general?<br />
- When the desktop app is no longer supported and the metro app is not available on server systems, how can i use OneNote on windows servers?<br />
<br />
I opened a service request some weeks ago and got confirmation for opening, but did not get any answer or reaction. the service request was later closed with no further comment.<br />
<br />
I also called the microsoft support, but - as usual - the people on the phone are not able to answer a question that simple.<br />
(I really have to say: the microsoft support on the phone is just terrible... you call, you wait, you wait even more, you do not [never ever] get any helpful idea / answer / comment, you leave disappointed... always the same... this is something that i experience
 since more than 10 years and it became a stereotype for microsoft... not really customer friendly at all, just wanted to point that out...)<br />
<br />
So, back to topic: can anyone please answer my questions? <br />
<br />
Tahnk you very much. <br />
Kind regards, Axel.

<p>Hi Axel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your query in this community. Sorry about the bad phone support experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address your concern, please check my reply below:</p>
<p>1.Since the Windows Store is not available in the Windows Server 2016. So unfortunately, the user on Windows Server 2016 won't have access to
<p>
</p><p>2.Currently, OneNote 2016 desktop app is still in our support boundary, the official article indicates this application's Support End Date is 14/10/2025. This doesn't mean you won't be able to use it anymore after 2025, you could still work with your notebooks
 on OneNote 2016, the only difference is there will be no bug fix or security updates on this product anymore.

                    Every time I use find and replace I get a pop-up box that lets me know how many items Word has replaced. I use this feature a lot and so the constant need to close a pop-up box is really annoying. Is there any way for me to turn off this notification?
 I never had this problem in Word before updating the program a couple of weeks ago...and now another colleague of mine is having the same issue. How can I make it stop??

<p>1.&nbsp; But, is there a way to attach files to certain student profiles? I would like to scan in their applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Also, Is there a way to add more fields to the student file so I can keep track of the forms they have and have not turned in?</p>
<br />

<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; You could add an attachment field to the table, but I would suggest adding a text field in which the path to the file can be stored.&nbsp; You'll find an example of how you can open a dialogue to browse to a file and gets its path, and how to open or print
 the file, as Browse.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />

<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file uses an unbound form, but can equally well be applied to a bound form in which the path can be inserted into a bound control in the form.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; If you are thinking of having separate fields for each form then stop right there.&nbsp; That would be very bad relational database design and you'd soon encounter problems.&nbsp; The form names or whatever should be stored in a separate table.&nbsp; You then have to
 model the many-to-many relationship type between students and forms which you'd do with another table which resolves the relationship type into two one-to-many relationship types by having foreign keys StudentID and FormID, each referencing the primary key
 of the Students and Forms tables.&nbsp; Other non-key columns can be added to this table to represent attributes such as the date a student received the form, the date it was turned in etc.<br />

    <title>Different top &#38; bottom margins for odd &#38; even pages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimx_iniowa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Different top &#38; bottom margins for odd &#38; even pages</h2>
                    I produce a newsletter each month for a club. &nbsp;I have a new duplex printer and have found out that on the odd pages the text is cut off above .75" &nbsp;on the top edge and cut off at .5625" on the bottom edge &nbsp;On the even pages the top cutoff is .5625" &nbsp;and
 the bottom is .75". &nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to set my top &amp; bottom margins one way for odd pages and a different way for even pages. &nbsp;I don't like setting each page as a different section as we add or subtract content which moves all text down or up accordingly. &nbsp;
 We try to adjust content so as not to go over an even number of pages for printing purposes. &nbsp;

            <p>Parth, the link you shared provided nothing helpful. I have a similar problem as Kim, and am clearly not looking for mirrored margins. Mirrored margins do not affect the top and bottom margins of a page. We want odd pages to have one top margin and even
 pages to have another. How do we accomplish this?</p>

            <p>Enable <strong>Different Odd and Even</strong> for headers/footers and then adjust the content of the headers/footers to fit within the printable area. You won't be able to change the header/footer margin, but you can set the margin to the smaller amount
 and then use Spacing Before/After to achieve the larger margin.</p>

            Hi BM.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.  
<br />
<br />If you try to  install an unnecessary 3rd party antivirus it should shut off Defender because two anti-viruse solutions should not run at once.  You can check in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Defender &gt; Open Security Center &gt; Virus and Threat Protection Settings.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    Have a home PC (Windows OS) with Microsoft Office 2010. In Word, you can insert a screen clipping from a web page, another document, etc. I've looked through the Microsoft Office Word 2011 for Mac 'Insert' options and don't see this feature at all. Did
 I miss something?

            That's a "convenience" which accesses the operating system utility... MS includes it in Windows Office because Windows is their OS. You can do the same in OS X by following the instructions provided in this Apple Discussions reply from CT:<br />

            This answered the question, although it's complicated with all the key strokes required. Don't understand why the Mac version (2011) of Office can't incorporate this feature. All you are doing is capturing what is displayed on the screen (or a selection
 thereof) by utilizing a function within the Word app. Being able to select 'Insert Screen clipping' and using the mouse to select what you want to import into the Word document should be a straightforward addition to Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac. Thanks for
 the assist though.

            <p>On the Mac, Word can be configured more precisely than on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, two caveats. </p>
<p>1.What I am about to explain will not work in the Home and Student edition of Office, but will work in all other editions.</p>
<p>2. Usually the <strong>Library</strong> folder is hidden. If your User:Library is hidden (which means you don't see a Library folder when you click on User in Finder), then
<a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/22/access-user-library-folder-in-os-x-lion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
follow these directions</a> in Lion or later editions of Mac OS X to unhide the <strong>
Library</strong> folder before you proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's what to do:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Automator Application</strong> (comes with Mac OS and is in the Applications folder)</p>
<p>2. Choose <strong>Workflow</strong> at the first screen</p>
<p>3. Drag the workflow called <strong>Take Screenshot </strong>from the left side to the big white empty space on the right side. Note that there are
<strong>options</strong> for using the entire screen, a selected window, or drag a screen selection. Choose whichever option you want to use.</p>
<p>4. Drag the workflow called <strong>Paste Clipboard Contents into Word Documents</strong>. Notice there are
<strong>options</strong> as to where the clipboard contents will be placed in the document.</p>
<p>5. In Automator, go to the <strong>File</strong> menu and choose <strong>Save</strong>. For the
<strong>File Format</strong>, choose <strong>Application</strong>. You must save your file in this directory:</p>
<p><strong>User:Library:Application Support:Microsoft:Office:Word Script Menu Items</strong></p>

<h2>            Malwarebytes Quarantine and Windows Defender</h2>
                    <p>I accidently clicked on an dubious site looking for info&nbsp; I was told smartscreen wasn't working but the items had been stopped from entering folders .&nbsp; This was great , I ran the free version of Malwarebytes and it found 4 Items , they turned out to be PUPs
 and were put in quarantine.&nbsp; On the free MWB there no option to delete (quarantine always reminds me of somebody under arrest but could break free and still do damage . Like here in the UK were the Police are stupidly unarmed and get killed its heartbreaking)
 &nbsp; Soz I diverse.&nbsp; Defender has now become so strong especially since the introduction of Israeli Technology ie. Hexadite etc.&nbsp; Test results are brilliant . Satya Nadella the CEO at Redmond promised us the most secure Windows ever and its getting there . Well
 done Redmond.&nbsp; Although these items were blocked we should have the option to Delete &nbsp; Redmond could you please help</p>

<p>Malwarebytes is not Microsoft product and when it add something in quarantine, normally it give option to remove it. If it is not available for some reason, you will need to check with their support and normally items in quarantine won't go free after uninstall.</p>
<p>In Windows Defender, Quarantine items will be deleted automatically after 30 days but you could remove them manually.</p>

            It is the Free version of Malwarebytes they only give the quarentine option and you cannot get support. My arguement is although Windows Security blocked two items they do not state what they are or what will &nbsp;Whappen to them. &nbsp;We should be given the option
 to delete. &nbsp;Could Security please consider this&nbsp;

<p>According to everything I've ever read, the only difference with the free version of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware&nbsp;is that the Real-time protection portions stop operating after the initial trial period, nothing else changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appear that others have had the same confusion about the MBAM Quarantine interface that you are having, as this forum post from 2016 displays.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As for your assertion that two Windows Security&nbsp;(Defender?) items were displayed as blocked, with no other option to delete, I suspect you are just as confused about the operation of these items.&nbsp; If these are what you wish to resolve here, then describe

            Rob &nbsp;Thanks very much thats clarified the issue. You have to excuse me mate I am 71 yrs of age, never had an IT lesson in my life . I got a PC about five yrs ago and just picked the grandkids knowledge. Ive got an IPad now but love Windows 10 the progress
 of Windows has been fantastic especially Defender. &nbsp;It makes you feel part of it &nbsp;The big boys in Cyber Security must be a bit edgy adverts are being thrown at us left right and centre, theyll be putting flyers up at Bus Stops soon. &nbsp;Satya Nadella the Staff
 at Redmond are doing a great job. Thanks once again Rob much appreciated Good Luck. &nbsp;Billy from Liverpool UK

<p>Billy,</p>
<p>Though I'm younger than you by several years, I learned most of what I know on my own, even though I also went to an engineering school with a computer specialty back in the days when the original PC was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem you are having appears to be with the quickly changing modern&nbsp;interfaces, which are more often tuned to mobile devices and so tend to use a "drill down" technique rather than the older, everything on the same screen method which used a lot of
 screen real estate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this does is often confuse older PC users who became used to everything being visible on the screen at once, where the younger crowd has mostly grown up with smaller and newer mobile devices so clicking on everything is second nature to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I found that for myself, simply clicking around any new interface with the curiosity of a child is often the best way to learn what's "hidden" behind the various items already displayed.&nbsp; Since anything that might do true damage such as deleting
 or changing a critical configuration item typically causes an additional prompt to confirm, this tends not to be as dangerous as we older and more risk averse users think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have an issue with the operation of Windows Defender and the two items you mentioned, that's still worth discussing if it hasn't been resolved.&nbsp; In order to help though we'd need to get a better description of exactly what was displayed, so
 just start again with that focus if you care to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Windows 10, what most people don't realize is that its actual purpose is to quickly move from the relatively ancient (1981 origin) general purpose design focused on the PC to a more modern interface and security model similar to that of the other
 major vendors.&nbsp; Bringing the customers with them means needing to move the often foot-dragging 3rd-party application developers&nbsp;more quickly, so that's why we're all operating on a platform that's truly more similar to a fast-moving series of beta releases
 than a mature product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This rapid pace of change is invigorating to some, but occasionally error prone and difficult for others to manage, which for the less willing to learn is more than a bit scary.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the only choice Microsoft really has is to either make these
 changes or eventually lose all of their truly important business and high-margin customers to other vendors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Satya Nadella realizes all of this and has taken the difficult, but necessary road to a more modern future for Windows and Microsoft.&nbsp; The recent improvements in revenue and thus stock value have shown that it's working, but along the way they'll still lose
 some of the consumers who've decided they simply don't wish to move ahead and would rather keep the old versions they've grown up with around until they die.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By that I mean either the operating system and applications or the people themselves, since by not moving ahead they're basically admitting they're dead&nbsp;already.</p>
<p>

<p>Rob &nbsp;&nbsp; I followed your instruction on Malwarebytes and see where I went wrong. &nbsp; I have however decided to put my total faith in the now entitled Windows Security and uninstalled MWB.&nbsp; I have kept MSRT I am still unsure of the need
 for that Tool doesn't it does the same job as the virus scanner? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The promoters of third party software left Windows people feeling insecure by constantly slating Defender.&nbsp; As I said in the previous article the introduction of Israeli Technology seemed
 to have been a real plus .&nbsp; Hexadite was set up by three Ex Israeli Army Cyber Technicians . I have no particular political bias but Israel is under constant threat and therefore need the best brains available to survive. &nbsp; The skills of those three men and
 their Firm have been grafted into Redmond what a plus.&nbsp; I am not being psychophantic but the improvement has been amazing. &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway thanks again for your assistance Rob your obviously a trained Technician the Microsoft Community will be obliged for your
 help Take care mate &nbsp;&nbsp; Billy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (grafted not graphted got a Bypass on my mind)</p>

<p>Actually Billy, I wasn't aware of the Hexadite acquisition, but in truth that's to some extent what Microsoft had been doing within its security products all along, while it appears that Hexadite was just doing the same thing on steroids.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own knowledge of the Microsoft security products goes back to those early days in 2004-5 when the first beta version of the products were making an appearance after
<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2003/06/10/microsoft-to-acquire-antivirus-technology-from-gecad-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Acquired Antivirus Technology From GeCAD Software</a> in 2003 and&nbsp;then <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2004/12/16/microsoft-acquires-anti-spyware-leader-giant-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Acquired&nbsp;Anti-Spyware Leader GIANT Company</a> in late 2004.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GIANT's SpyNet, the predecessor&nbsp;to MAPS and eventually the Cloud protection in Windows Defender, is all really just an evolution of the same basic idea, the introduction of machine automation and eventually learning, leading to the use of AI to replace the
 more rudimentary steps once performed by analysts, in order to allow these people to work on the more important tasks such as completely new forms of malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is made clear by this document called <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/05/08/antivirus-evolved/?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc?source=mmpc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Antivirus evolved</a>, which you'll note was created in early May 2017, which was just before the Hexadite acquisition&nbsp;later that same month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the development teams that had been working on the Microsoft security application's core code had been located in Israel for many years, it wouldn't be surprising if those starting Hexadite were either past members of this team or at least aware of
 their efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally knew the individual at Microsoft most responsible for the initial development of the original Windows Live OneCare, MSE and most of the core of what exists today, though he left that team several years ago.&nbsp; I was an MVP during the formative
 years of 2007-2011, so I was privy to some of the internal development groups at that time, which is why I understand the operation of these apps&nbsp;better then the average person providing support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a trained technician only in the sense that I took courses in engineering that focused my ability to perform investigations in a methodical manner, but in reality I'd always been that way and had been doing this type of electronic and software based
 trouble-shooting for several years before I attended that particular school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I volunteer here primarily to aid those who are trying to understand Microsoft's systems and direction,&nbsp;as I've observed them closely since at least the mid-1980's.&nbsp; Most coming here are confused about something within either operation or the direction that
 Microsoft is going, so my understanding of their history is often valuable to provide the larger picture most are unaware of.</p>

            Rob. Your articles are really helpful to us all thanks again keep them going. &nbsp;Would like your opinion on the following. I noticed two indivuals in particular on You Tube who on a regular basis slated Windows Defender. For legal reasons I cant name them.
 I am sure their ulterior motive is to promote third party software and receive backhanders. They create an aura of uncertainty and paranoia people then splash the cash on bells and whistles bloated software. Windows Security is fast becoming a powerful system
 even now there is no real need for third party. The big Companies cant be happy about it. What will be the eventual outcome of this.

<p>Regardless of their motives, opinion is all that any of these online personal reviews ever are, which is why there's so much confusion about the true meaning of security by consumers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In many cases, the misunderstanding comes from personal experience where the detection of&nbsp;supposed malware by some 3rd-party product after it's been apparently missed by Defender or even the opposite, has led an individual to the potentially false conclusion
 that one product is always better than another.&nbsp; This is anecdotal at best and may even be false information due to fake detections by a malicious 3rd-party product at worst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In truth, there are a number of relatively good and well known products that typically cluster together near the top of the detection results in (supposedly) independent testing.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these tests often create their own distortions in an attempt
 to grade or rate the products in order to define the "best" among them, another flawed methodology that may again be due to a vested interest, or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I decided long ago was that the only vested interest for Microsoft was the effective protection of their own products.&nbsp; Whether these received accolades or were panned by others really doesn't matter, since only the true protection of my own and other
 friends and relatives systems I've supported truly matters to me personally.&nbsp; I've had experiences at least as good and typically better with the Microsoft products as I expected and so I've stayed with these for this reason, as well as the simplicity of use
 and product familiarity this has provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've watched as many consumers jump around from product to product, constantly looking for the "perfect" protection, while the sound initial design of the Microsoft products has consistently improved, exactly as they promised these would evolve from the
 beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having a long history myself supporting computer systems in engineering education, computer manufacturing and other businesses, I've learned that the steady, often boring methods of maintenance of updates, as well as a stable and simple to use security application
 are most effective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search for the perfect security app can never end, since it's impossible to attain.&nbsp; While the more recent moves by Microsoft towards a leaner and more inherently secure operating system design with
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-core-os" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Core OS, including the Windows 10&nbsp;"S" version</a>, which offered an early view into this more secure future, is the only method that can truly improve the situation in general.</p>

To protect your PC and any private info on it, including for instance your online banking, your email, etc. you need two things.
<div>Firewall and anti-virus.</div>
<div>Windows has an internal firewall which you can enable, or you can download a different one if you prefer.</div>
<div>Microsoft offers a free anti-virus, called Microsoft Security Essentials.</div>
<div>In both cases, it is important that you run ONLY ONE of each (but, again, you need both firewall and antivirus.)</div>
<div>Neither of these would have (normally) interfered with your chrome browser...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you are now apparently unprotected, you should first verify that windows firewall is turned on, or that windows detects another installed firewall. &nbsp; If you are using Win 7 or Vista, click the start button and type security center into the search
 box. &nbsp;Follow the instructions here: &nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Using-Windows-Security-Center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Using-Windows-Security-Center</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>You should also be able to turn on anti-virus from here (windows defender most likely.) &nbsp;You should then go here and download and reinstall Microsoft Security Essentials.</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/mse.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/mse.aspx</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Once you have both up and running, do a full (not quick) scan with Security Essentials. &nbsp;Right click the green security essentials icon-&gt;open-&gt;click the 'full' button-&gt;scan now.</div>

<p><span>I have two Lumia 635's running Windows 8.1 without any problems. Mail, Calendar, Calendar and Contacts all synchronise with my Google account.
</span></p>
<p><span>The 650 however does not synchronise my Google contacts into 'People' </span>
</p>
<p><span>If I open 'People' it gives me the choice to synchronise with Outlook and/or Google. Nothing happens whatever is selected.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I was about to suggest that Google had set a device&nbsp;limit until I read the emboldened&nbsp; segment</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either you have&nbsp;set a filter (synced but NOT set to display)</p>

<p><em>(it can't be remedied by additonal&nbsp; syncs only NEW contacts you&nbsp;then add &nbsp;will show up on the phone</em></p>

            <p><strong>All ok now!</strong></p>
<p>Fixed by deleting account and starting again. Must have been much as described in Plan B, Thanks!</p>
<p>Note that NEW contacts were NOT showing up either, contrary to the line: '<em>it can't be remedied by additional&nbsp; syncs only NEW contacts you&nbsp;then add &nbsp;will show up on the phone</em>'</p>
<p>Finally tried deleting the Google account&nbsp;and starting again and that fixed the problem.</p>

            <p>Hello Rich,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may arise due to security issues with the website or compatibility issues of the website with the Internet Explorer. So, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Add&nbsp;the websites&nbsp;to the trusted sites for Internet Explorer and modify the security for this zone to
<strong>Low</strong>.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Internet&nbsp;Explorer.</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong><span>Tools</span></strong> button <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong><span>Security</span></strong> tab and click on <strong>
<span>Trusted sites</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Scroll down the bar for the security level to <strong><span>Low</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Uncheck the <strong><span>Enable Protected Mode</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><span>Sites</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type in the website name (complete URL for PBGC </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">retirement website</span><span>) in the space provided and click
<strong><span>Add</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><span>Close</span></strong> and then click <strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try reloading the websites and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to try <strong><em>all </em></strong>the steps from the following link and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956196/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">"Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" error</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Disclaimers</span></span><span>:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Reset Internet Explorer: </span></strong><span>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also
 reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System Restore: </span></strong><span>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed after that date are removed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>
