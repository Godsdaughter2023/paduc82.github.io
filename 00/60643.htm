<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p><span>Windows Update in particular features some major changes. </span><span>Since the introduction of Windows Update as part of Windows, Microsoft has delivered updates as a way to keep Windows updated and secure. This has always been the way the company
 keeps commercial versions of Windows on the market current. With Windows 10, Microsoft is making significant changes to this model by delivering new methods of servicing the operating system. Taking into account we now live in a mobile, constantly connected
 world where threats happen all the time. Part of the solution to this is to keep users current by providing the latest updates&nbsp;as soon&nbsp;as they are&nbsp;available in addition to delivering features as soon as they ready too…automatically.

Windows 10 is a significant upgrade in the platforms history; because the company describes this as the last monolithic release of the operating system. No, Microsoft is not ending development of the most popular operating system in history; but the company is moving to a future where the roll of the operating system takes a back seat to services. The Cloud has become the buzz word in this industry and for Microsoft it is a critical wave on which company’s future rides, not just on the client side but also in the data centre."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Windows

Familiar landmarks: Start button, Start menu, Taskbar are all there. These old favourites of course have been improved with new features and functionality."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Windows

Microsoft will be moving the web browser into maintenance mode going forward; which is still being actively used on more than 50% of PCs worldwide. So what’s next? Microsoft realizes there needs to be a clean slate and that obviously means starting over."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Windows

 10 Review: Advanced features, Security and Connectivity</span></a> </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have a feeling this will not sit well with a lot of Windows users. Some persons are starting to say it basically feels like Microsoft is being a nanny about applying Windows Updates but with good reason. Windows 10 Home users can pretty much expect
 to mandatorily install all critical Windows Updates. It’s not much better with Windows 10 Pro which will let you delay updates for a period of time. Customers running the Enterprise edition will have complete control over Windows Update. Why I think this is
 a good idea is based on my years of coming across PC’s, laptops running Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 from a friend or relative that has not been updated since they first booted it up. This mandatory procedure finally takes care of that. Users on metered
 connections should not worry though, updates are not downloaded automatically when your Internet connection is set as metered/mobile broadband.

<p style="text-align: center"><span><em>You can choose multiple ways to get Windows Updates</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 introduces a cool enhancement to Windows Update I am excited about; the option to have Windows Update download updates from a PC within your local network in a peer to peer fashion. This is great for scenarios where you are using a metered
 connection but have multiple PCs. You can use one PC to simply update the other, as long as they are the same architecture. You can enable this by going to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update and Security &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Choose how you download updates<span>&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Users will be able to defer some updates but not indefinitely</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p><span><span><strong>What does lifetime of the device mean?</strong> The logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, it will continue to be supported with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates
 to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and 5 years extended support. Also note, there will be revisions of Windows 10 over the next 10 years. The revision of Windows
 10 you get on July 29th 2015 will not be same revision you are running July 2020. In order to main support, you will need to update to that revision (which of course will be free). It’s alsmost like Windows XP RTM SP1, SP2, SP3. After a period of time, Microsoft
 stops supporting a particular revision, requiring that you move to the latest revision of Windows XP which would be SP3 in order to continue receiving support.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The fact is, the average life span of a computer is 3 to 5 years. I see students get a new laptop for September and by January the following year the screen is cracked or its dead from the amount of times they dropped it. Only the most meticulous (yours
 truly) manage to even carry a laptop across the 5-year threshold. I had an Acer for up to 8 years before I fiddled with it and it stopped working. My sibling has a Dell Inspiron from June 2006, originally came with Windows XP, upgraded to Vista then Windows
 7. Not sure if it qualifies for Windows 10, but that’s almost 10 years, my other sibling sold his Inspiron from 2008. The fact is the vast majority of computers will eventually be replaced within 5 years of purchase, so it’s a safe cycle for Microsoft to ride.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Of course, the upgrade treadmill money is not there anymore like the 90s and early 2000s when you had persons buying shrink-wrapped upgrade packages. Microsoft realizes it does not need to fear giving away new revisions to existing devices, it’s not
 the 90s anymore when the PC market was just 50 million computers running Windows 3.1 and retail licenses were crucial to revenue. Out of that 1.5 billion Windows PCs, there will be a large amount who replace machines with OEM preinstalls over the next decade,
 in addition to the volume license club that Microsoft probably finds the most lucrative. So, the Windows revenue might not be what it used to be, but it’s not bad either.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Recovery and Rollback -</strong>Throughout the history of Windows revisions, Microsoft has included an option to uninstall the operating system when you upgrade to a newer version. My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows
 ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless
 way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn’t guarantee the process would according to plan.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d898166-5cbc-41dc-83e1-1a1d83f37831" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span><em>If your PC is not working well after upgrading to Windows 10, you can easily uninstall it</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has finally provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back to your previous version of Windows. This option can be handy for diagnostics
 purposes, trial and error or to simply go back to a previous version of Windows that works better with your PC. Please note, this option must be utilized within the first 30 days or it will not be possible. This is because the Rollback function is dependent
 on the Windows.old folder stored at the root of the drive which is automatically deleted after 30 days.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also keep in mind, this only works with Windows 7 and later; because prior versions of Windows such as Windows Vista and Windows XP can only migrate to Windows 10 through a custom install, the command line operations remain your best choice if you
 do decide to go back. Rollback is not available either if you perform a custom install over Windows 7 or later. It’s quite an uneventful process which can take quite a while depending on how complex your Windows installation is. After clicking Get Started
 you can make multiple selections why are going back to your previous version of Windows along with additional details or you can choose just one and click Next. As noted, any configurations made to Windows 10 since upgrading will be lost, so if you installed
 new programs or hardware drivers or made personal settings, those will be deleted. Users will also have to make sure they have their password ready to sign into their old version if one was being used before.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Easy Upgrade - </strong>Windows 10 is available in a variety of editions that target different markets and user needs. The three most popular editions are Windows 10 Home, Pro and Enterprise. Most users who purchase a new PC will often
 get Windows 10 Home preinstalled. Users who need some of the unique capabilities of the Pro edition such as Remote Desktop, business networking and other capabilities can most often select this edition at purchase for a new PC or purchase it specifically for
 upgrading from a previous version. With the launch of Windows 10, Microsoft has made it known Windows 10 will be free to every PC or device running a genuine retail or OEM Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/025a0aa3-cdf0-4995-a688-daf153981018" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span><em>Easy Upgrade makes it easy to upgrade to a higher edition of Windows 10</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Of course, persons will be upgraded to the logical edition, example Windows 7 Home Basic or Premium will be upgraded to Windows 10 Home. Some persons might want some of the richer capabilities available in Pro. For this, you will need to purchase the
 Windows 10 Pro Pack which will include a product key so you can unlock that edition in your current edition by simply entering the product key.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Good news also for persons who might have Home Use rights through an employer’s volume license program. Volume License is a convenient way for large businesses to purchase Windows licenses in bulk and deploy it to many computers an organization might
 own. Volume license also includes flexible options that allows organizations employees to also upgrade their personal devices to the organizations licensed edition of Windows. So for example, if your company is running Windows 10 Enterprise edition and you
 are running Windows 10 Home on your personal laptop, you can easily upgrade that system using Easy Upgrade. This is important for ease of use, management and support rights that guarantees all systems are standardized and are protected using the benefits that
 are available with that particular edition.</span></p>

            <p><span>After a day or two of exploring and using WIN 10 I found a few issues that I didn’t care for so I finally went to Recovery and found the button for “Go back to Windows 7”.&nbsp; From the very
 first time I pushed the “Go back” button I have seen the screen that says – “We’re sorry, but you can’t go back. The files we need to take you back to a previous version of Windows were removed from this PC.”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After nine days and approximately 30 hours between waiting for and talking to Microsoft I got told "We are sorry but we can do nothing for you &nbsp;:("</p>
<p>
<span>I honestly believe that t</span><span>his problem was created by Microsoft and should be corrected by Microsoft.&nbsp; As far as I can determine I
 took no action that would render my “Go Back” button inoperable.</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I have a recovery disk from HP and I believe that my System Recovery file from 31July (a routine Backup to an external HDD from before the WIN 10 install) should be able to get me back
 to Windows 7.&nbsp; However, that is NOT the desired solution.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The desired solution is to fix the Windows 10 OS so that the “Go back to Windows 7” button actually works.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It just seems to me that the best solution is from WITHIN rather than relying on external vendors and devices to complete a process that Microsoft has touted to be one of the benefits
 for making the transition, i.e. “If you don’t like Windows 10 you can always go back.”&nbsp; In my case I can’t go back and I would like to have that option.</span></p>

 old files - no warning, no option to save files and protect things, no not them. They'd rather cheat ya. Well I think that 10 sucks. I think what they did sucks. And it gives me a whole new opinion of Microsoft and that liberal B bill gates. I think I will
 find another program to use so I won't be allowing these **** to see my data, or ever get a dime for their despicable act.&nbsp;
<strong>Maybe this is a good time to switch to Apple or Lenox and never get anything that is a Microsoft partner.</strong></p>
<p>It appears that widows 10 is designed for laptops and tablets or mind dead idiots.</p>
<p>If you can switch back do so and get rid of this piece of garbage</p>

<h2>            How is Windows 10&#39;s Activation Key&#39;s Hardware HASH code Determined</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering how&nbsp;Windows 10's Activation Key's HASH code is determined? I currently have Windows 7 Pro installed, and want to activate my Windows 10 (via the upgrade feature) after which I want to do a clean install on a bigger hard drive. So my question
 is will this work, or will my windows 10 not be activated anymore since my "hardware" changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, will Windows 10 become inactive if I say change my GFX card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reaaaaaally don't want to reinstall Win7 on the bigger drive just to get a Windows 10 "key".... The same goes for system upgrades....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx.</p>

</p><p>I was struggling to find any driver Win 10 or earlier and then stumbled on this on the Bluedio Community page:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(44, 62, 80, 1)">
Generally, To enter pairing mode: when your headset is off, press and hold the MF button until you hear "pairing", and you will see the Blue light stays on.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(44, 62, 80, 1)">
PS: During this process, you will hear "power on", but do not release the MF button, just keep pressing it until you hear "pairing". Then turn on the Bluetooth feature of your mobile phone and search this device.</p>

    <title>FSX Product Activation Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tevin_236  say:</h3>
<h2>            FSX Product Activation Error</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi i am having an error problem with my Flight simulator that says" An error occurred while attempting to activate the product. The problem may be due to an incomplete installation of the application".
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I was trying to repair my flight simulator because it was not acting right. After repairing the flight simulator i would run it and it would just crash, so then i decided to uninstall the program and then reinstall the flight simulator. After doing that
 the flight simulator would run fine but then still continued to crash if i would trying to load in with my addon aircraft's. while i would run the simulator after this would happen it would give me the error as i have mentioned in the subject title of it being
 an activation error the simulator does not work, i have tried repairing it since the issue has happened, even reinstalling it which the error tells you to do which does not solve the error. I have also even created another Microsoft account which i hoped would
 work, but still didn't work, Also tried running in compatibility mode.</p>

<p>Hi Tevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You appear to have a number of problems with FSX here.&nbsp; &nbsp;After you re-installed FSX, did the install go through without error?&nbsp; &nbsp;If so, then did the Activation box option appear at the end of the install?&nbsp; &nbsp;You didn't mention whether you activated it at
 this point, or tried to do it when the activation error came up after flying for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you were wanting to try another clean install again, I would suggest that after uninstalling FSX (either from the option in Disk 1, or from your Uninstall Programs), you do a search of FSX in your file system and Registry and remove everything associated
 with it.&nbsp; As you know, FSX puts various files in different locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then do a fresh install, but instead of installing it to the default location (Program Files), install it to the root of your drive (e.g. Your drive letter:\FSX).&nbsp; This is so that when flying, it reads directly from its directory instead of wading through
 another folder.&nbsp; &nbsp;As well, you won't have problems with Administrator rights when installing/running add on software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this installation, then attempt to activate the Sim.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the activation doesn't go through and gives out an error that it couldn't be activated, then you will need to try and apply a fix.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can explain that after your feedback on the result of the
 install or you can find the fix that is given elsewhere in this Win10 Gaming Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If activation goes through okay, then take a flight to make sure that there are no errors or crashes at this point.&nbsp; If all okay, you can go ahead and install Service Pack 1, take a flight, close FSX and then install Service Pack 2 (optional), and take a
 flight.&nbsp; &nbsp;If still no problems, then reinstall your addons one a time, taking a flight in between each install to check that no problems surface.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doing it this way, will also show you, if an error comes up, what install or change may have caused the error
 to occur.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your reply, i have already activated FSX on the computer that i am running it on the first time when i did install it. I uninstalled it because the error started happening after i tried to repair the simulator, but when i decided to just
 go ahead and reinstall the program the second time that i have done on this computer it seemed like it installed fine. but again as i have mentioned i selected one of my addon aircraft and the simulator would just crash on just trying to load the plane for
 preview. When i would run the program after the crash that is when the error would pop up, and the activation box did not pop up to be activated i have tried the regedit to see if it would pop but still ended up with the error box when the simulator would
 start running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have removed all my addons and deleted the flight simulators file from the program flies not to also mentioned i dont know if it even matters but i am using a partitioned side of my mac, and my mac does not have a local drive i only have an external
 drive for the disk. So i will try to a fresh reinstall on my computer by your directions.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Tevin,&nbsp; I see that you will be doing a fresh install of FSX, but wondered whether FSX would have crashed if one of your add on aircraft wasn't loaded.&nbsp; In other words, would FSX crash if you used a default aircraft
 instead of an add on?&nbsp; &nbsp;If FSX crashes, then it usually means that there has been some conflict between it and some other software or hardware;&nbsp; FSX as a program has been well put together and gives no problems, unless a file is missing or corrupted.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway,
 a fresh install would be a good start and as I said, don't be in a hurry to install anything else until you're satisfied that FSX is running well without crashes.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this way, you can isolate what may be causing the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, the first thing to do after
 installing FSX, is to attempt to activate it, and see whether this goes through, before trying anything else.</span></p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi Chris i have done a fresh install of the simulator i have removed everything that has been associated with the flight simulator addons, and saved flight plans and of course the flight simulator folder. I really cant do much on trying to put it on
 a new drive instead of the default installation. When the simulator first loads up after the second disk installation everything shows up fine even the default aircraft load up fine, but i have also noticed that the multiplayer also shows up after the installation
 loads up the simulator. But if i exit out of the simulator and load it back up thats when i get the error and the multiplayer goes missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So the activation still does not show up i even have gone into the flight simulator folder and tried to activate it that why but it still will not pop up for me to activate it. i would also like to try the fix that you have mentioned in your first post
 and see if that works if not i will just move on to a different flight simulator.</p>

<p>Hi Tevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Multiplayer is showing after you install FSX, then it appears that Service Pack 2 is still installed (as Multiplayer option was given only with SP2).&nbsp; &nbsp;Is that the case?&nbsp; &nbsp;You could then go back to your Control Panel and then to Uninstall a Program:&nbsp;
 does Microsoft FSX Service Pack 2 show up there?&nbsp; &nbsp;If it is there, and you have not installed either of the Service Packs since this fresh install, then your FSX was not completely uninstalled.&nbsp; &nbsp;You may need to start all over again and remove everything,
 including the SPs.&nbsp; Hopefully, that may fix up the matter of Multiplayer showing up the first time but disappearing after the next loading of FSX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after you installed FSX and you said that everything loads up, did you take a flight in the default aircraft to make sure that FSX was working well (except of course, your activation issue)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can now take a flight (e.g. in the default Ultralight) and after it loads, Pause it, and open up the top Menu bar.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then click on&nbsp; Help and then on&nbsp; About Microsoft Simulator.&nbsp; &nbsp;At the bottom of the screen (and above Eula), there could be a Product
 ID.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is NOT the same set of numbers as your Product Key which you have used to first install FSX.&nbsp; &nbsp;As I understand, if the Product ID is there then it indicates that FSX is activated, if not there, then Activation still needs to be done.&nbsp; &nbsp;As well,
 reference to SP2 would be in that&nbsp; "About MS Flight Simulator" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could check on these things I've mentioned, for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;No the Microsoft FSX service pack 2 does not show up in the programs. Yes i have taken a flight in one of the default aircraft and everything was working fine. i have checked to see if there was a product ID and no numbers that show up.</p>

<p>Okay, so we can assume that when you uninstalled FSX that both SPs were also removed.&nbsp; &nbsp;And if there is no product ID shown, then the Sim is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you open up FSX now, then Multiplayer option won't be there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Correct?</p>
<p>If you then launch a flight with your default aircraft, then everything loads properly and the aircraft, scenery, and instrument panel all function correctly?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you at any stage during the flight, get a prompt for Activation, or does FSX quit after 30
 minutes of flying?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, then the only solution is to apply the Registry change.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think you tried it before, but to mention:&nbsp; exit FSX completely.&nbsp; After you find the relevant entry in the Registry, make sure that it reads as&nbsp; &nbsp;PartMgr&nbsp; &nbsp;(as written here).&nbsp; &nbsp;Save the change,
 exit and reboot computer.&nbsp; Does this action improve your situation?&nbsp; &nbsp;By the way, I assume that you are not launching FSX in compatibility mode (as you were doing in a earlier installation of it).</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing left to do is to install Service Pack 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm assuming that you have not done this yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;This SP has as one of its features, to correct issues with FSX installation and activation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully, by installing this SP, it might cause FSX to
 allow activation, or you may need to go back to the Registry and check on your change to&nbsp; PartMgr.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; Hello Chris</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It has finally been solved after installing service pack 1. After installing the SP it seemed to already have been activated, but everything is running fine. And i will need to install SP2 for my addon aircraft to work thats why it kept crashing when it
 would try to load them in for preview.</p>

    <title>User Switching showing up on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            User Switching showing up on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a windows 10 version which came as an automatic download upgrade when I purchased an Window8.1 Lenovo laptop. Once I finished the update to Windows 10 everything was fine and I setup multiple user accounts/profiles for me my son and guest and
 everything was working as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And at that point I could see the fast switching options on all options that I have seen that are mentioned on every possible forum that discussed about fast user switching. I saw it on crtl+alt+del, I saw it on locked screen, I saw it under user name when
 I clicked windows button. So basically every where it was supposed to allow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But after few days all of a sudden that option is basically gone and I don't see it anywhere at all, I definitely haven't done anything to change configurations or such to disable it, and my 9 year is definitely not a geek (yet) to figure out how to do it.
 I mean I read searched and explored as may way i could possible try but no one is talking about the missing fast switching in windows 10 all together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me understand if it is just me and if I have done something wrong to be cursed by Microsoft cause it is pretty annoying to have to log out to use another user profile (specially when the OS offers that feature). I would greatly appreciate
 and do let me know if I need to provide any more details to help understand my scenario. Gobble Gobble Gobble.</p>

<h2>            Computer Locks Every 30 Minutes While in Use</h2>
                    Despite other questions, this is not about the screen locking when the computer is not in use. It happens when I am watching a movie, browsing the internet, playing a game, working in the office suite. It doesn't matter that I am doing something. The computer
 will lock no matter what every 30 minutes exactly. It is driving me crazy. I reset all my advanced lock screen settings but it still happens. Can't find anyone else who has had this problem.

</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span><br />
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or
 determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you
 start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you
 from following these steps. <br />
</span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reply with the status of the issue, I will be happy to help you.</span></p>

<h2>            External Hard Drive Dock Not Recognized by Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought a new machine with Windows 7.&nbsp; I have a stack of old hard drives off of which I am trying to pull data.&nbsp; I bought a generic HD enclosure with a USB cable in which to install the old hard drive but when I plug it in, Windows 7 tries to
 install a driver for the device and then says it has failed to do so.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            It recognizes that a USB device has been attached, but that's all.&nbsp; It tries to install drivers for the device and then states that the drivers failed to install.&nbsp; According to the manufacturer, it should be plug and play.

            If two different operating systems fail to recognise the enclosure then there is a high probability that it is defective or that its driver is flawed. I had a similar problem some time ago when I bought two identical enclosures. One worked immediately,
 the other failed. I had it replaced under warranty.

            It's only one operating system - Windows 7.&nbsp; This is the second device I've purchased to try to connect the device to my computer.&nbsp; The other one had the same problem.&nbsp; I'd plug it into the USB port, the computer would recognize it was plugged in, try
 to install drivers for it (which it shouldn't need), and then claim that the device driver was not successfully installed.&nbsp; Now, I borrowed an enclosure from an acquaintance for an old 2.5 " IDE HD I had from a laptop I owned and when I plugged that one in,
 it worked fine - no drivers issues at all.&nbsp; I would expect that this device should do the same.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            hi...try formatting<br />
<br />
Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Administrator Tools-&gt;...I think you should know the rest...<br />
<br />
If using the Esata doesn't work, does the USB work?<br />
<br />
Its important that which component is the problem one...Toaster or HDD.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I heard that using a Dual <a href="http://www.espow.com/wholesale-sata-hdd-docking-station-for-mac-support-1394b-1394a-firewire-port.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mac hard drive dock</a> toaster you also need to get card as well<br />
<br />
anyway..read here...its a review of the Toaster and Card that is needed.<br />

If you tried everything and it doesn't recognized, maybe even your HDD is dead?

            <p>I started experiencing it yesterday as well, the patch got revised, and somehow machines that already had the patch, got the installation revised reinstalled even though SCCM mark it as I don't have downloaded the latest, and there was a red X on the patch
 (being mysteriously pulled out from the metadata on SCCM)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When removing it using a task sequence running this command it shows success, and you see the computer applying the changes, but then inspecting the add/remove programs, the patch still there even after reboot - but the good news the connection gets reestablished,
 so, something about initiating this command line affect its behavior:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\wusa.exe /uninstall /kb:3172605 /quiet /norestart</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opened a premier case with Microsoft and with their assistance I was successful on completely removing the patch using on the computer command line prompt:&nbsp;</p>
<p>dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_KB3172605~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.2 /quiet /norestart</p>
<p>
</p><p>but when added to a task sequence &nbsp;and rolled via SCCM I got this error:</p>
<p>Task Sequence: Rollback KB3172605-ASH000A0 has failed with the error code&nbsp; (0x800F0805). For more information, contact your system administrator or helpdesk operator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I just rolled out the previous task sequence that even though seems not to remove the patch from add/remove program, it does the trick to reestablish my communications,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, but Microsoft needs to find the issue, and explain how a revision on metadata of a botched patch can be affecting machines already patched without the express downloading it and re deploying it.</p>

                    I have a Garmin Forerunner 205 which will not sync with Garmin Express or Garmin Connect&nbsp; when plugged into the USB port.&nbsp; It used to work great prior to updating to Windows 10 but no longer works.&nbsp; Garmin says it is my device but it works fine with all

            <p>There are some that will hide your files/folders so that you cannot see them normally. I would highly suggest running a scan of your computer with your antivirus/antimalware software. If you need it, you can also use the Microsoft Safety Scanner, it's free:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Also, if your files are hidden, please see the following article on how to unhide them:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-hidden-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-hidden-files</a></p>
<p>Also:</p>

<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do</p>
<p>a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running</p>
<p>resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the</p>
<p>cause.</p>
<p>No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy</p>
<p>to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So</p>
<p>its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an</p>
<p>extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.</p>
<p>These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run
</p>
<p>them in regular Windows when you can.</p>
<p>Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.</p>

<h2>            Why is date of birth mandatory on Skype AND then made public&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was forced to put in my date of birth by the new MS Skype account dialogue. I do not want business contacts sent a picture of a birthday cake on my birthday so I put in 01/01/2018.&nbsp; Now Skype says I need my parents' permission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sure how to do that
 even we had not scattered their ashes decades ago.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I pay for this account an feel very aggrieved at the way MS is treating me and other Skype users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, and I am not sure if this is related, it seems the account name has been linke to my personal hotmail email account instead of my business account.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Windows Photo Viewer order of pictures - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Windows Photo Viewer order of pictures</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I have a few questions about Windows 10 version of Windows Photo Viewer. Okay, so I upgraded to Windows 10, I'm liking it so far but came to an obstacle that I can't seem to overcome. My problem is that when I'm viewing pictures and want
 to go to the next, it's going in alphabetical order rather than the way it's sorted out which is by date. I looked at a few solutions but either I don't understand how to input it or I'm doing something wrong.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at this one http://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/12946-windows-photo-viewer-sorting-order-not-same-view-order.html and put the code
</p>
<pre><p>"Clsid"="{FFE2A43C-56B9-4bf5-9A79-CC6D4285608A}"</p><p /><p style="text-align: justify">...into regedit. I clicked the arrow next to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT to go to jpeg file to go to the shell folder</p><p style="text-align: justify">then went to the open folder and right-clicked to create a new string and pasted the code above.</p></pre>
<p>Did I mess up along the way?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When was the last time the computer booted properly?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to perform a system restore from
<b>WINRE</b> (Windows Recovery Enviornment) mode to the date the computer was working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have Windows 7 disk you may try to perform a system restore and startup repair using Windows 7 disk:</p>
<p>A. Insert the installation disc.</p>
<p>B. Restart your computer.</p>
<p>C. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</p>
<p>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For
 more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>
<p>D. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</p>
<p>E. Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p>F. Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p>G. On the System Recovery Options menu, click System restore and select the date when the computer was working fine.</p>
<p>If System Recovery Options is a preinstalled recovery option on your computer, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>A. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</p>
<p>B. Do one of the following:</p>
<p>· If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows
 logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>· If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press ENTER. (If Repair your computer is not listed as an option, then your
 computer does not include System Recovery Option as a preinstalled recovery option.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D. Select a keyboard layout, and then click next.</p>
<p>E. Select a user name and enter the password, and then click OK.F6. On the System Recovery Options menu, click system restore and restore the computer to the date it was working
 fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the link to find more information about system restore.</p>

            HI Ed-pc... do you mean you want to get the login screen?
<br />If it is a touchscreen you can swipe from the bottom up.
<br />If it is not you can do ctrl + alt + delete.
<br />That should give you a login screen to type in your username and password.

            All windows operating systems are like that for security reasons.
<br />You can disable that by doing the following.
<br />Go to search and type the following.
<br />
<br />netplwiz
<br />
<br />Open it.
<br />Click your username and remove the checkmark for 'Users must enter a username and password to use this computer'.
<br />
<br />See link for further explanations.

            Techadvisor is a safe site... i use it all the time but i understand.
<br />But then I wouldn't recommend you keep your machine wide open like that then if you are worried about the bad world :)
<br />If your PC is not using a username and password to login then any one can hack your network and gain access to your PC very easily cause it is not locked.

            Hi Ed-Pc, 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!

How many DVDs do we need for Back-up files with Backup and Restore programe? Is there big differences in<u> time</u> and

            <p>&nbsp;I don't understand your question.&nbsp; You were asked how space was used on your C: drive and you answered 60 GB.&nbsp; Are you now saying that your C: PARTITION is 60 GB with only 20 GB used?&nbsp; I really don't understand what you're so confused about.&nbsp; It's simple
 3rd grade arithmetic.&nbsp; Whatever space you have USED on the C: drive, multiply that by 0.7 to get how much space will be used on your backup drive after compression.&nbsp; Divide that number by 4.7 and round up.&nbsp; That's how many DVDs you'll need if you insist on
 using DVDs for backup.&nbsp; So</p>
<p>1) If you're using 60 GB, the answer is (60 x .7) / 4.7 = 8.936.&nbsp; I rounded up to 9 and added 1 just to be safe.</p>
<p>2) if you're only using 20 GB, the answer is (20 x .7) / 4.7 = 2,97 rounded up to 3.&nbsp; Add 1 and get 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you're only using 20 GB I'm very surprised because almost any significant Windows 7 installation is going to take more than 20 GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;All this assumes that you're NOT using the Windows Backup and restore program but one of the ones I recommended.&nbsp; When I used the Windows one, the results were several times the space I was using on my C: partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Therefore I trie to set up a Skype Number, so that I could use my Skype account to make calls. Colombia wasn't offered as a country to choose, when I was trying to obtain a Skype number so I selected the US. After all, that is where most my calls will be
 going to.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Computer couldn&#39;t boot due to unspecified changes to system configuration...</h2>
                    <p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've left my computer open and when I came back I saw the "Startup Repair" screen open so I've tried to find the issues, tried some solutions from other websites, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error:</p>
<p>Prob Name: StartupRepairOffline</p>
<p>Prob S#1: 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Prob S#2: 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Prob S#3: unknown</p>
<p>Prob S#4: 21198133</p>
<p>Prob S#5: AutoFailover</p>
<p>Prob S#6: 3</p>
<p>Prob S#7: CorruptFile</p>
<p>OS Version: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.1</p>
<p>Locale ID: 1033</p>
<p>[ S means Signature ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>From "View diagnostic and repair details" the root cause is "Boot critical file &lt;path&gt;\fvovel.sys"</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>Most of the solutions didn't make any effect at all but I've found this where I enter that command into cmd prompt:</p>
<p>Command: "copy X:\Windows\System32\Drivers\fvovel.sys C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\fvovel.sys"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which has made the windows animation logo appear and the colors but at the end a weird sound comes out of my device and the computer restarts from itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that happened this root issue appeared:<br />
"Unspecified changes to system configuration might have caused the problem."</p>
<p>There were 3 repair actions but under the "Root cause found" there's a repair action called "System files integrity check and repair" that had the result "Failed, Error Code = 0x3".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, if you need any more information tell me. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards, </p>
<p>Usama.</p>

<p>Hi d3ath2005,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There's a lot of possibilities that caused this issue. I suggest that you <span>
boot from Windows 10 installation media in a removable storage device, flash drive, or DVD and access the Advanced options.&nbsp;</span><span><span>This should
 be viewed as your LAST resort when you have system problems as it will wipe out all your data and programs.</span></span><span>However, it seems that this will be the best option.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>To do this, follow these steps:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Insert the USB or flash drive to your PC and restart.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>The&nbsp;<strong>Windows Setup</strong>&nbsp;screen will pop up, select language and click on&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Advanced options</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>&nbsp;and enter the following commands:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>bootrec&nbsp;/scanos</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong><span>bootrec&nbsp;/fixMBR</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong><span>bootrec&nbsp;/fixBoot</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong><span>bootrec&nbsp;/rebuildBCD</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Restart PC and see if there are any changes.</span>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
