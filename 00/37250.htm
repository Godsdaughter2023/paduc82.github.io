<h2>            Accidentally Deleted Music File</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I accidentally deleted my Music File while trying to back up my pictures and music. And it's gone gone. The little colored&nbsp;folder that used to be there is gone. Nothing but that blank page Microsoft uses when there's nothing there is left. And now
 I can't playany MP3 files on my&nbsp;comp because it keeps saying the music is gone. Can anyone tell me how to get the file back?&nbsp;

<p>DocCeCe,</p>
<p>From what I understand in your post, it seems that you deleted your Music
<b>folder</b> that is inside your User folder. If this is incorrect please clarify.</p>
<p>If you simply moved your folder to the recycle bin by only clicking delete, then you can restore it:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/fe1e050f-f279-4404-b895-c34b5c5398591033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/fe1e050f-f279-4404-b895-c34b5c5398591033.mspx</a></p>
<p>If you were holding Shift when you deleted it then you performed a permanent delete in which you may attempt a restore from the Shadow Copy Service. Consult the following article for more detail:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/afb7ed89-ed63-4e07-a482-d7004a8f40121033.mspx#ECD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/afb7ed89-ed63-4e07-a482-d7004a8f40121033.mspx#ECD</a></p>

<h2>            Skype broken on WP Lumia 535</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Phone 8.1 (Lumia 535) has the Skype app on it and suddenly a few weeks ago it stopped working. I get a strange message about network problems. There are no network problems with my phone. At this point I'm pretty sure that Microsoft has intentionally
 broken Skype on Windows Phone. I would appreciate an explanation or a suggestion on how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>

</p><p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I know how important it is for you to use Skype on your </span>Windows Phone 8.1 (Lumia 535) device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Due to a change in Skype infrastructure moving from peer to peer to the cloud, certain Skype platforms and devices will no longer work on July 1st, 2017.
</span></span></span><span><span><span>The Platforms, and devices&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34763/which-skype-enabled-devices-or-platforms-are-no-longer-supported?q=unsupported" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">listed here</a> will no longer
 work and will not be able to communicate with other Skype users. Apparently, that includes
</span></span></span>Windows Phone 8.1 and lower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want to create the best possible app experience for our Skype users which means we have to make some changes along the way. These decisions are hard to make, but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning Skype from a peer-to-peer video and
 chat app to a modern, mobile friendly cloud architecture. <span><span><span>You can check our
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">support site </span><span><span><span>to find out which devices and operating systems Skype will support in the future.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Movie Maker Music delay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sk9164  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie Maker Music delay</h2>
                    I am editing a video on the newest version of movie maker and the music plays through perfectly when I start previewing it from the beginning of the timeline. But when I try and preview starting from any other place but the very beginning it plays the
 music in a different spot. So the correct music plays when I start from the beginning but if I hit play in a different spot the music is delayed and starts at a different part in the song which makes it extremely difficult for me to edit especially when I
 have to start from the very beginning and let it play through just to see if the part in the middle is correctly edited with the music. Any one have any solutions?

            Most often this happens when using a music file that isn't 100% compatible with Movie Maker. I've seen this reported most frequently with high-bitrate MP3 files. The workaround is to convert the file to another format, preferably .wma and use that instead.
 That should play the file correctly from wherever you are in the timeline.

            Hi lynda123,<br />
<br />
#1 Download the Subinacl.msi program from Microsoft's website:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en#AffinityDownloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/d...inityDownloads</span></a><br />
<br />
Install this on the computer and boot into safe mode<br />
<br />
#2 Copy the following text in a .bat file and run it with administrative credentials. It may take a while to finish. You will get a "Press any key to continue" message once it completes:<br />
<br />
@echo off<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f<br />
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=administrators=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=system=f<br />
@Echo =========================<br />
@Echo Finished.<br />
@Echo =========================<br />
@pause<br />
<br />
#3 Try and register FM20.dll again, and it should succeed:<br />
<br />
REGSVR32 FM20.DLL<br />
<br />
Also download and run&nbsp;malwarebytes - malware removal program. Its a free download.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now the errors should go away.<br />
<br />

<p>I would say, in pristine condition...not alot. Maybe better off contacting which ever shop you will be taking it into and asking what they are currently giving as trade in...or use the CEX website to see what they are listing it as. Research will be your

I was having the same trouble. You need to download this to fix the problem http://www.avg.com/filedir/util/support/delrepwv_en.exe&nbsp;This should resolve the problem ok?<br />

<p>I was having the same problem too. Uninstalling the AVG Toolbar from web browsers turned out to be the fix. IE was easy - with the browser open you simply go to Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - Reset Internet explorer settings. Firefox proved bit
 more difficult. With the broswer closed I had to run&nbsp;a command prompt from the start menu. Type in firefox -safe-mode, click ok. Then just tick the disable all add-ons box, then make changes and restart. I then simply re-booted the computer and the probem
 was gone - didnt even have to go have to switch AVG Malware on using the security centre.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 File Share Settings being Reset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 File Share Settings being Reset</h2>
                    I have Win 8 installed on all of my machines, 1 desktop, 2 laptops, each connected to a Homegroup. &nbsp; While everything is working well, for the most part, one particular folder on my desktop is supposed to be shared with the Homegroup with read/write capabilities.&nbsp;
 I've even gone so far as to include 'Everyone' with Read/Write privileges on the folder.&nbsp; However, it seems that every day the share settings for this folder gets overwritten.&nbsp; Specifically, 'Everyone' is removed and Homegroup only has Read permissions.&nbsp; There
 are other folders on the desktop that retain their Read/Write permission status, but this particular one does not.&nbsp; It is a folder holding several hundred GB worth of pictures, although drive space is not an issues.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

Thanks for the information, but my issue is quite the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once set up, the HomeGroup share on this particular set of folders seems to work well, i.e., everything works as advertised.&nbsp; However, 24-36 hours later, the share permissions get changed, seemingly
 at random.&nbsp; All machines have remained online, no reboots and no user initiated user permission changes.&nbsp; So, why once set, do the permissions get reset to something completely different?&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I do have the exact same problem and it DRIVES ME UP THE WALL (sorry for the shouting).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a HTPC that I also use for backing up files from my work-pc. Every single day I have to re-set the read/write permissions for the home-group on the HTPC, because it keeps resetting to read only. Once set manually it works fine ... until the next day
 / a restart ... whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never had this problem with win7 and yes I do know that I am doing here ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My work-pc has a windows live account for login, my HTPC is offline-account only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also discovered, that my work-pc (now also windows8) also resets to read-only for homegroup. This is more than just a little annoying, as i have set up a sync-toy time-shedule to save my files to the backup-folders on the HTPC regularly. This job now fails
 due to no write-permissions every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help ...</p>

            <p>Also have this issue. I am&nbsp;sharing 3 folders with Homegroup and Everyone with Read/Write permission. Works fine until a sign out or restart. Then folder permissions for only these 3&nbsp;folders are reset to Owner and Homegroup with Read only (removes Everyone

So for now&nbsp;I moved these folders off the partition D&nbsp;drive&nbsp;and into c:\Users folders... and all seems to be working properly (permissions are same after sign out/reset).&nbsp;This is the first time I've had&nbsp;any trouble sharing files/folders on any Windows system.
 I have now&nbsp;wasted about 4 hours messing around with this and reading forums. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has figured out how to easily and permanently&nbsp;share read/write permission&nbsp;with Homegroup and&nbsp;everyone for&nbsp;files&nbsp;located at&nbsp;(for example)
\\d:\folder&nbsp;please reply to let me know.&nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            I have been dealing with this is as well ever since upgrading to Windows 8.&nbsp; I really hope this is addressed in Windows 8.1 but I haven't seen anything suggesting it might be.

<h2>            Unable to access the Internet&#58; Network drivers for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from my HPEnvy 15-k101nia windows 8.1. After installation all my network drivers were not working. I couldn't access the internet. Couldn't use ethernet or wifi. I went online and tried to get the drivers but the drivers i got didn't
 work and was giving a notification that its not compatible. Viewing the <strong>
Network Settings,&nbsp;</strong>there are meant to be about 8 options but in mine there are only
<strong>5 options (Airplane mode, Data Usage, VPN, Dial-up and Proxy)</strong> excluding (Wi-Fi, Ethernet and DirectAccess).</p>
<p>Please is there anything else i can do or are there some specific drivers i need or do u think i should downgrade back to windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>As you are not able to see the Option on Wi-Fi, Ethernet and DirectAccess, check if you can see the Network adapter icon at the bottom right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Type Network and Sharing center in the search box and hit Enter.</p>
<p>Click change adapter settings from the left pane and check the Network icon displayed.</p>

<h2>            Download from Onedrive to Save Files on PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just moved over 500 GB of picture files from my old PC to a new PC using OneDrive.&nbsp; It took a couple of days for the files to download from OneDrive.&nbsp; They now sit on the OneDrive folder on my new PC - only they don't.&nbsp; Every time I open a picture
 file I see a message saying downloading file from OneDrive. If I check the properties of the Pictures Folder within the OneDrive folder it shows I have some 435 GB of 503 GB saved on disk. This suggests that not all parts of the files have been download. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to save the files from OneDrive on my C: drive in Pictures folder.&nbsp; What is the best way to do it?&nbsp; Do I Copy or Move the files in the OneDrive folder?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All suggestions welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Nick&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Windows Live Essentials is a Suite of separate programs and does not have a manager in Control Panel itself. Instead what management there is is done via the entry in the Programs and Features list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have moved the files you want to retain from the Windows.old directory use the Disk Cleanup &gt; Clean system files utility to remove the folder to prevent permissions issues.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a Linksys WRT320N with Comcast as the ISP.</p>
<p>My Xbox has the external wireless adapter, recognizes the network, connects to the network and the internet, but fails connecting to xbox live.</p>
<p>Before the switch to Comcast (yesterday), the router worked fine. I can't seem to figure it out this time.</p>
<p><br />
I got the ICMP error, xbox live works with the modem plugged directly in, but this is not a practical setup in my home.</p>
<p>Please help, thanks.</p>

<p>Hello ciliboh,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Was&nbsp;Windows Media Player&nbsp;working before you installed BitDefender 2010?<br />
I would first try a System Restore point to before you installed BitDefender 2010 and see if Windows Media Player is now working.<br />
<br />
If the system restore doesn't work, then I suggest you uninstall BitDefender 2010 and see if you can get your Windows Media Player working again.<br />
To choose a System Restore point,<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Pearl (start) button <br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type ‚ÄúSystem Restore‚Äù and hit enter <br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option ‚Äúchoose a different restore point‚Äù and hit next.<br />
Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.<br />
<br />
If you are using a evaluation version of Windows 7, it would be best to install the full retail version as there have been changes until the final released version.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps to get Windows Media Player up and running,<br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know if you are still having problems.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p><p><br /></p><p>I managed to snag an Xbox 360 at a local yard sale for very short money.&nbsp; Just the console and power supply; had to get a controller from eBay.&nbsp; No other cables or manual or anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;It works fine, but I'm trying to set it up so I&nbsp;can play it without the sound coming from the television (don't want to wake the wife, who is generally asleep when I do all my gaming.)&nbsp; I'm finding that a lot of the hardware works with only&nbsp;specific versions/models of the Xbox 360.</p><p><br /></p><p>I know the Xbox 360 comes in several different models (Core, Pro, Elite, Arcade, etc), and I'd like to know how to identify exactly which model I have, so I won't buy something that will turn out not to work with mine.</p><p><br /></p><p>It's flat (matte) black with a chromed-front disc tray.&nbsp; It also has a hard drive on the left (laying flat, not vertically.)&nbsp; Date of manufacture is 02-15-2008.&nbsp; Product ID:&nbsp;895556121114993

            <p>From the sound of it, it is either an xbox 360 Elite or Super Elite. To find out, check how big the hard drive is 120GB (Elite)or 250GB (Super Elite). Either way it is an Elite, but with a bigger hard drive. Also you can tell by the usb sockets on the back, if it's just one, you have an Elite/Super Elite.</p>

    <title>HDMI Input&#58; No Input Signal -- Monitor Going to Sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aspen929  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI Input&#58; No Input Signal -- Monitor Going to Sleep</h2>
                    Windows automatically updated last night before shutting down. When I turned on the computer this morning, the HP w2207h monitor was not functioning properly. Each time I rebooted, I received the message "HDMI Input: No Input Signal" before the monitor
 went to sleep.<br />
<br />
I do not believe it is a problem with the sleep and display settings as I have dual monitors and the EN9910 is functioning properly; both are set to NEVER anyway. Further, I have plugged our SONY television into the HDMI port and it works just fine.<br />
<br />
I have also plugged the monitor into another computer, using the same cable, and both worked just fine. The hp monitor also functions in the utility mode. Problem seems to exist only when Starting Windows.<br />
<br />
This has happened once before with a Windows Update, but I don't recall the solution.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            <p>Hello Dorey82,</p><p><br /></p><p>Your Rewards Account is a separate, unique account created at the time you register into the program. While it is created off your Microsoft Account, and uses information from there, it is not&nbsp;your Microsoft Account. What this means is that when you created your Rewards Account, it registered you into the US&nbsp;region, since this was what your Microsoft Account was at the time. Your migration from the US&nbsp;region will not be reflected on your Rewards Account. When you migrated your Microsoft Account to a different region, this caused our deposits to fail, since we cannot deposit USD from a US&nbsp;Rewards Account into a Microsoft Account that uses a different regional currency.</p><p><br /></p><p>This means that in order to resolve this issue, you have two options. You need to either adjust your Microsoft Account to match your Rewards Account, or create a new Rewards Account to match your new Microsoft Account region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) You can adjust your Microsoft Account region to match your Rewards region from your commerce page at (<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a>). This will cause your regions to match and allow your currency to be deposited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) The second option of Creating a brand new account has some pros and cons. The benefit of creating a new Rewards Account is that your new account will be set to track and Reward purchases made in your Microsoft Account's regional currency. The drawback is that you will lose the previous progress you have made on your account, as you will be creating a brand new Rewards Account.&nbsp;While we will be able to transfer any pending (un-deposited) Credits from your old Rewards Account, we will not be able to transfer any other progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to continue with Rewards in your current Microsoft Account region and create a new account, you must first close your current account by opting out of the program at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/optout</a>/). You will have to wait 48 hours for us to receive and process your request, after which your account should show up as completely clean of progress and have a join by date of "???". At that point, you can create a new Rewards Account by signing back up again, which can also take 48 hours. To confirm that you have re-registered correctly, you can check your join date from the&nbsp;MyRewards&nbsp;page at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>). If your join by date still shows "???", and not your recent registration date, then your account has not yet been successfully re-registered. If you open a new post after being able

<h2>            Nuketown and Firing Range never work...</h2>
                    
<p>When I play Black Ops, whether it's a wager match, domination or any game mode, and I'm in a lobby which has selected nuketown or firing range as the chosen map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It loads up the game for a few seconds, like any other map, but ALWAYS kicks me out during the loading process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It then sends me back to the multiplayer homescreen and I get the error message: "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloadable content has changed"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know why this is, but since I have bought my xbox over a week ago I have NEVER successfully had a match in either of these 2 maps.</p>

<h2>            Xbox freezing problem&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys. So my Xbox has been having these problems for a while now. Everytime I get a used game, my Xbox won't play it. It will either freeze while loading up, or give me the "Disc Unreadable" message. As of lately though, new games have been having problems
 too. I recently bought Diablo 3 and tried to install it to the hard drive (because that fixes the problem), but it would stop around 42% or so. It would also freeze on start up. When I took the game back and got a new copy, the game wouldn't install, but it
 would work and not freeze. I bought GTA V the other day as well. Same thing happened. Tried installing the first time, didn't work. Got a new copy, installed the first disc and it worked fine, besides the "The game was restarted due to a problem with the storage
 device where the game data was installed. Please replace the storage device and re-install the game data if issues continue to occur," problem. Now what's funny, is GTA V would work fine. When I tried to play Diablo again after playing GTA, it wouldn't work.
 I had to get another copy of Diablo. Now that I got the new copy of Diablo, it works but won't install, and now GTA doesn't work even though it's already installed. It freezes and restarts as soon as the game starts up. I do not believe it is an overheating
 issue. I have other games that work fine on the Xbox without being installed either. It doesn't make any sense to me. Does anybody know anything about this? I personally think it is a disc reading problem.</p>

<p>Hi try deleting the game from your hard drive and any non essential saves (if any) and download the game again</p>
<p>You could also try deleting any dlc as this has caused a couple of issues in the past, the content can be reinstalled when your game is up and running by viewing your purchase history.</p>
<p>Finally try the old favourite of clearing you cache as below:</p>
