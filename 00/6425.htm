    <title>User Mailbox To Shared - Sending from shared mailbox and auto-changing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            User Mailbox To Shared - Sending from shared mailbox and auto-changing email signiture</h2>
                    <p>The company I work for had a separate user account for sales and a separate account for accounts.</p>
<p>I have converted these to shared mailboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added the "From" drop down in Outlook so users can send from the shared accounts and added the delegates in Exchange (online).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the signature will not automatically change when selecting one of the shared emails (which had to be manually added in to the drop down box).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a page which told me that I could add these shared mailbox's as their own accounts in outlook (File &gt; Account Settings &gt; New...).
</p>
<p>This works and allows the user to select the other account, and the signature will change.
</p>
<p>The problem is with this setup, the shared mailbox account will not open the folders in Outlook once the licence has been removed from the original account which the shared mailbox came from.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>All I want is for the users to be able to send from the shared mailbox (which was converted from a user mailbox) and have the signature on the email automatically change to reflect the email address they are sending from. Is this possible?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Really appreciate any help I can get.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Ben C</p>

            I have managed to solve this issue by removing the user from "Delegate Access" and "Send As" permissions on exchange online for that shared mailbox.<br />
Only once that was removed would Outlook allow access to the mailbox after adding it as a seporate account (File &gt; Account Settings &gt; New...).<br />
<br />
Now I am able to set up the default signatures for each individual account (shared mailbox).

            <p>I was slightly alarmed when my 'favourites' hadn't made the transition into edge when upgrading to Windows 10, however found that it was an easy fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Edge, click on the "hub", select favourite settings, and select the "old" browser you want to import from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in these setting you can turn the favourites bar on (for me the default setting was off)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also note that in the upgrade the old windows explorer is still lurking amongst the apps....so if all else fails then Billion Debbarmas solution is the go....</p>

    <title>N8 Symbian Belle update&#58;&#58; Long Wait&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N8 Symbian Belle update&#58;&#58; Long Wait&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Nokia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to share my thought, viewpoint on Nokia's firmware updates and it's availability to the global customers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, as mentioned in the subject, I am coming to the much discussed and anticipitated Symbian Belle update for the Symbian 3 smartphone portfolio. Like all other customers, I was waiting for a good user experience on my Nokia s-phone. Symbian Anna might
 be the first step, but Belle definitely looks a Uber UI for all the users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let me explain my point: Nokia may release the Belle firmware for Nokia N8 someday in Q1 2012. I am definitely going to get that as I would keep this one in trash as no one wants an indefinite wait. And I may switch to some other phones running on Android/
 or anything which I feel 'the cool one'. And I am not going to take another Nokia phone as this experience is horrible to wait for an update (having Nokia said "we don't &amp; won't give the s/w update schedules prior"- it is like We (Nokia) would do whatever
 we want, and your (customers) interests doesn't matter). I was loyal to Nokia and keep this brand for nearly 10 years with 25+ phones from Nokia. And ultimately, you are loosing me (Nokia doesn't bother, I know). Not to try it's Windows portfolia as it's updates
 would be available only when Nokia feels to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is a strategy to sell off new phones with latest OS (701 viz), this won't work well, as you may add a few customers and ofcourse sell some handsets, but a huge chunk of customer base will move away from Nokia. Another blunder is- the&nbsp; release of
 update is happening when the update itself is 'Outdated' compared to the then Smartphone OS Versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this Post looks like my frustration vent, but certain that others who have similiar views could like or discuss this :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Harish.</p>

<p>hash</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is your point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, if Nokia has the same "time table" as when the first Anna phones were released, Nokia X7 and E6, then probably the version Belle will be available for the first handsets just around the corner, I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that the "final" Belle is dated around the 20th of October so I think Nokia is doing just fine. I can´t remember the exact date of the "beta" updated E7, C7 right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2011 Nokia is really doing well considering, Microsoft partnership in February, and many updates for other devices even very old ones, including the mayor roll out of Anna.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a huge numbers of handsets in the serie N8 around the world, and of course it will take time to cover the whole world.</p>
<p>I believe that Nokia 500,&nbsp;X7 and E6 will have the Belle update before the earlier handsets of Symbian 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you are rather unfair and as you should know that Nokia never actually has&nbsp;released any dates for Belle updates for Symbian 3-phones. When the first come. then Nokia may give time table, not before the first roll out.</p>

<p>I'd rather wait a bit more for them to get it right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They now have to cope with upgrading to Belle from several different configurations (Symbian 3, PR 1.1, PR 1.2, Anna), some updated OTA (not always successfully, there are two parts to the Anna update and some people haven't applied both parts of the update)
 and some via Nokia suite, some people had problems with MMS access points, QT, or the Shop, and people have used several different workarounds or fixes to these problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it means waiting a month or so more, it doesn't matter. If people have problems updating their N8 with Belle then this forum will fill up with complaints - Belle is bug-ridden, Belle is a disaster, etc... Obviously this is not the case as there are phones
 with Belle already out there, but it's not as easy to update older phones with several different configurations as it is to launch a brand new phone with Belle.</p>

            I dont think hash008 is being unfair, how many times have we been promised upgrades and been let down with sub standard software ie anna, maps, wat makes people think that belle will be any better, i honestly cant understand the nokia fanboys loyalty to
 a phone that nokia has done its best to ruin with third rate software, i myself have been a loyal fan of nokie phones as have my family, but theres only so much you can take before you finally admit that nokia,s software is at best third rate, my family now
 have samsung galaxys s2, and after using my sons phone for a day it outperforms the n8 on every count, apart from the camera, ive spent far too much of my time over the last few months trying to get my N8 working properly, time to admit my family are right
 ditch nokia and get a smartphone, THE N8 COULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A GOOD PHONE IF ONLY NOKIA HAD SOURCED THE SOFTWARE ELSE WHERE, nokia has seen the last of my cash and i suspect many other peoples cash also from what ive heard, a friend of min

<p>I think that Nokia need to work harder with information to reach their customers NOT only about new phones like N9 or others but about software changes to older phones.<br />
<br />
If I read on the Nokia News site in Sweden today I can read about;<br />
<br />
Nokia Research Center – 25 years of innovation<br />
<br />
Grand Slam for Nokia N9<br />
<br />
Voddler now on N9<br />
<br />
Follow our N9 test-pilots<br />
<br />
Free TV-guide in your Nokia<br />
<br />
Spoyify-app to your N9<br />
<br />
On the Global site I can only read about financial stuff and see how much bigger Mr Elop's wallet is going to be this quarter or about Nokia's bold portfolio with upcoming new phones.<br />
<br />
Where is the info to all the customers with older phones that doesn't want or can't afford a new phone????<br />
<br />
Ahha the support pages on the site you say. OK then let's take a look.<br />
<br />
On the support pages for Nokia N8 (yes I have one) I can read info about what I got IF I upgraded to the last version of the firmware.<br />
<br />
I can also read that Nokia thinks that it is important for me to read the user guide and what accessories I can buy. NOTHING about the future for me as a N8 owner. NOTHING!<br />
<br />
I think it would be nice if Nokia informed their customers that it is important that they follow the firmware upgrades and describes why. If they by mistake distributes a major bug in one of their upgrades the first once that should be out there explaining
 what has happened and what to do or how long to wait for a fix is Nokia no one else! Not the loudmouth morons with blogs owning iPhone's / Android phones. iOS and Android is totally OK with me just so you know, it's the complaining loudmouth morons I'm against.
 :-)<br />
<br />
And it is nothing wrong with schedules and time estimates for upcoming firmware updates IF that info is revised by the responsible persons if the dead lines can't be held for some reason or if something else happens.<br />
<br />
Nokia needs to work on their skills to communicate with their existing customers not only the future prospects.<br />
<br />
Finally, the perfect mobile phone doesn't exist for me, at least I haven't seen one yet. Therefore my N8 can always be better so I what to know what is planed to happen and when it's going to and if something goes wrong I want to know that to. FROM THE SOURCE!<br />

<p>As soon as Nokia brings pre-installed Anna and or Belle firmware on certain Symbian^3 phones,&nbsp;into the market, there are no technical objections&nbsp;for rolling out Anna en Belle updates for other Symbian^3 phones. Pre-installed phones can encounter some problems
 with a carrier in a particular country, but that is taken&nbsp;for granted by Nokia as well. Since Nokia sold his (commercial) soul to carriers and other phone selling companies, Nokia is not free to go as Nokia pleases. Android and iphone roll out updates and
 care less what carriers think about them. In any country carriers must comply with android and iphone and not the other way around. I paint a black - white picture, I know, but I'm convinced, that I'm not far away from the reality. As long as the Anna update
 is not 100% available worldwide, Nokia will&nbsp;not&nbsp;roll out the Belle update. Customers in Canada and Australia are already very frustrated and the frustration will only grow when Belle is out for others&nbsp;before they can have Anna. I try to explain and not to
 defend.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As frustrated as everyone might be, including myself, I think it's only fair if we look at all sides of what's currently happening.</p>
<p>I, for one, get a bit uneasy reading about a Leaked version of our Long awaited O.S, but hey, that's just how this world operates, there's leaks almost everywhere and we just need to learn to live with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a fact that Nokia has lost much of it's market share to other manufacturers and it seems as if this happened overnight, but I think it's fair that we give credit where it's due. Anna was launched recently, August if I'm not mistaken, and 3 Months down
 the line we're at Nokia's throats for another update. Mind you Anna was not just a Bug Fix, it was a MAJOR update, which some countries still don't have due to some errors...... Before the Much Talked about iOS5, iOS&nbsp;4 was made available to the public for
 the iPhone and iPod touch on June&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2010 (More Info <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here</a>), almost 15 Months in between, including the Official Launch date of the iPhone 4S with iOS5, yet we can't wait for more than 3-4 Months after a Major Update? Remember, the S^3 phones aren't the only phones that nokia offers on the market, they offer
 a wide range (Look at the most recent E-Series Software Updates that rolled out some days ago). If the N8 was Nokia's only Phone, I'm certain things would be running smoother, not Perfect, smoother.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also love to see some sort of Improvement in here and there from Nokia, but trying to regain Market Leadership will not happen overnight and our support, as Nokia Users, will sure go a long way.</p>
<p>Nokia has in the years given us Products to be proud of, why can't we show the same support as we did before?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I'm saying is, at the end of the day, we all want value for money, we chose Nokia, they are having difficulties, Let's support 'em, we're all human..... We will get Belle, we've only had Anna for about 95 days or so.... And, if True, with Carla and Donna
 under dev. we know that our phones will still be looked after...... Just a thought....</p>

            Yes its a work in progress, but my n8 has the potential to evolve<br />
and is a PC compared to the IPhone which is an Xbox.

<p>When it comes to Nokia firmware update, I have come to realize that I need to be bold and adventurous; otherwise, I must bear the increasing impatience of waiting for official release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, last week I self-administered flashing my N8 with the "pre-released official" Belle version 111.030.0607. It was a risk but it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm enjoying Belle on N8 and even added the Jin-Hao captivating Belle theme effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have to take risk of flashing the phone; that's life with Nokia as I discovered it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your thoughts / assistance greatly appreciated.</p>

            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.
<br />
<br />Also...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

<h2>            Password Recovery&#58; There&#39;s a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later.</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've had this problem for nearly 3 weeks now - haven't got anywhere with MS Support (livechat, SRX tickets, etc etc). I guess this could be my last resort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an account, it's a new one - which I need to access.</p>
<p>This account only has one form of verification on it, that's the 'Phone for code' verification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go here -&nbsp;https://account.live.com/password/reset?mkt=en-gb and insert all the correct details, I get the error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(200, 83, 5, 1)">"There's
 a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried every other form of verification to get this account back, nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why this happening? I know for a fact that I am putting in the correct phone number digits that I set up the account in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so you know, I have tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Different Browser</li><li>Clearing my Cache and cookies</li><li>Trying other URLS provided to me by MS Support</li><li>Completing the account verification form (it's a new account with hardly anything on it, making the form impossible really!)</li><li>Tried it from a wired connection</li><li>Tried it from a wireless connection</li><li>Tried it from a Mac, a Chrombook, a Mobile and a different location</li></ul>
<p>I feel a bit lost and would really value some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going through the support guys with my SRX ticket, but they keep on passing me around and asking me the same question every single time - resolving nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            It is probably that you e-mail address has been black listed as a result of malicious activity. &nbsp;The best thing is to ask the university to provide you with another email address, or use a gmail account or some other mail service.

            <p>Thank you, Doug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to send emails to my other emails account, which was not successful. In addition, I asked one university's IT helpdesk whether my university email account was blocked by them as I failed to send one email to three members of them. They told me that
 they have not blocked me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, can we infer that the problem is in my own account? For example,SMTP settings. The university for now seems to suggest me to use the same email address. However, I will use my gmail address at thisthe moment. Any further suggestion or point will
 be really appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>David</p>

<h2>            Set default email account in Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Lumia 1020, when I create a contact I cannot choose on which account it will be created, and for an unknown reason Windows Phone 8.1 (only Windows Phone 10 seems to allow you to select the account to use) to does not create it under my Microsoft account
 but under an old deactivated account (which I keep for former colleagues contact details).</p>
<p>1. How can I select the default account on my Windows Phone 8.1?</p>
<p>2. How can I move contacts from one account to another. (I found the question here:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdtips/move-contacts-from-one-account-to-another-in/afbae096-cefc-423f-9e96-9816c34a81b3">

<p>3. Any way to create a contact on the phone on my Microsoft account?</p>

<p>After much further research on internet and in my phone, I found how to fix this issue:
</p>
<p>WP8.1&nbsp;-&gt; Contacts -&gt; ... menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Filter contact list -&gt; check Microsoft account under "Show contacts from"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So much time lost while nothing in the labels or even the text could make you guess that filter setting would actually prevent you from creating a contact in expected account...&nbsp;:( (needless to say that I'm never using "Contacts" as it has very limited usability
 compared to anything else on the market)</p>

    <title>How to get Word 2007 to remember scroll positions after minimizing a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wornways  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get Word 2007 to remember scroll positions after minimizing a window&#63;</h2>
                    In every version of word up to 2007, this has never been a problem. If I closed a window and then reopened it, everything would be as I left it. This is also true for other applications such as Open Office's Writer and Word Perfect.<br />
<br />
However, Word 2007 introduced one of the most annoying hassles I've encountered since Word was first released on the old Macintosh computers before PCs even had a graphical interface--the position in a document is absolutely not remembered after a Word 2007
 window has been minimized and then restored. It boggles the mind that a product I bought for so much money that I'm actually embarrassed to admit having done so to friends and family (since there's a free Office environment out there) is actually incapable
 of remembering what position I am at in a document when I minimize the window and then restore it.<br />
<br />
This has never been a problem in all the years I've used any previous version of Word. I could open a document in Word 97 in two windows, split them both into two panes, navigate to various locations within a 300 page document, then minimize the windows when
 I wasn't using them and have the locations I navigated to remembered exactly when I later restored the windows. Why can't this new and presumably "improved" Word 2007 do the same? This has been a basic function of the graphical word processing environment
 since the dawn of WYSIWYG word processors. And now it's just suddenly gone? In a suite that sells for how much?? $700+ at least???<br />
<br />
Okay. So there's the problem. Is there some thing somewhere that I can turn off, on, or sideways to make this psychotic piece of software remember scroll positions EXACTLY after restoring a minimized window? I mean, just like all previous versions of Word and
 all other word processing software sold anywhere? Please? I find that it drastically impacts my work flow for Word not to remember windows as I left them when they're restored.

            I cannot reproduce what you describe with Windows 7 and Word 2007 (or 2010). When restored the cursor and screen positions appear to be as they were left, which is what we both expect to happen? What exactly are you seeing? Does it have this problem when
 started in its safe mode (hold the CTRL key while starting and answer yes at the prompt)?<br />
<br />
If not, may I suggest that you try renaming the normal template - normal.dotm to force Word to create a new one (and remove any old Word normal.dot from an earlier version from the user templates folder) and the Word data key in the registry, and temporarily
 disable any add-ins before blaming the software. See <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            You'll need to scroll to some other part of the document, then minimize and restore the window. I have a feeling you're just opening a document and then minimizing and restoring it. First let's confirm that you are in fact not seeing the navigated-to position
 of your documents change.<br />

            Follow-up: I am using "Print Layout". I don't use the "web" layout because I am writing printed documents, not web documents. I just tried "web" layout and found that scroll positions are remembered correctly in that layout. This is probably what you're
 using, too. Now if you can help me find a way to get scroll positions to be remembered for the "print" layout, we'll be in business.<br />

            &nbsp; Also, I started Word holding the Cntrl key down. The problem went away briefly, but soon came back. In fact, now when I start Word even while holding the Cntrl key down, the problem continues to exist. Very strange that it would go away at first and
 then return.<br />

&nbsp; This annoying problem occurs with .dot, dotx, and .rtf files. I feel completely incapacitated by this headache.<br />

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have installed the last build by changing the dates, you should wait as many days as you delayed the date in previous installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "rapid" method is to perform a hard reset in your mobile (remember to make a back up of your data). After that, the new build will be detected by your mobile inmediatly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same issue and I have performed the hard reset in my Lumia 950XL with successful results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            OneNote Syncing Issues</h2>
                    <p>We are seeing OneNote syncing issues to the desktop version of OneNote on Mac and PC platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are basically the same issues as described in the post linked below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_mac-mso_o365b/onenote-couldnt-sync-error-0xe40200b4/06d15d6f-2d49-42c6-88c7-424e400e40d3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any advisories in our service health dashboard.&nbsp; The Microsoft support agent/moderator in the post above said to DM if experiencing the issue.&nbsp; The error code we receive is 0xE40200B4.</p>

<p><span>Hi Ibing,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue happens in OneNote 2016 for Mac. If yes, I’d like to confirm when it happens and whether the issue happens in a specific page, section or notebook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile. I suggest you check whether you are using the latest version of the OneNote 2016 for Mac application. The latest version is 16.16.0 (18081201). If no, update the application’s version, restart the Mac and then do a test to see the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, I suggest you close the notebook and then reopen the notebook to check the outcome.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<p>Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, correct this is for the OneNote for mac (available via the App Store).&nbsp; The end users who have reported the issue have done a restart and test but still see the same results.&nbsp; The version is 16.16 (180812).&nbsp; I just checked for updates
 on her machine and none were available.&nbsp; See the screenshot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed and re-opened the notebook and still received the syncing error.&nbsp; It happens in several notebooks/pages we have.</p>

<p><span>Hi Ibing,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the newest version
</span><span>16.17.0 (18090901)&nbsp;</span>of the OneNote 2016 for Mac application has been released, I suggest you uninstall the current version, install the latest
 version and then do a full sync from OneNote Online to see if the issue goes away.</p>

<p>I just checked on my Mac, I'm running version 16.12 (180411) and there is no 'check for updates' function within the OneNote application.&nbsp; The Mac App Store does not show any updates available.&nbsp; What's the most efficient way for updates to get out to our
 user base?&nbsp; We have over a thousand users utilizing OneNote (both Mac and PC).</p>

<p><span>Hi Ibing,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for my ignorance of not noticing the OneNote application for Mac downloaded from the App Store is a little different from OneNote 2016 for Mac.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For our troubleshooting, could you confirm the following?</span></p>
<p><span>1. Where are the affected notebooks stored, in the personal OneDrive online place (<a href="http://www.onedrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.onedrive.com</a>), in the OneDrive
 for Business library or in a site library in SharePoint Online?</span></p>
<p><span>2. As the OneNote application for Mac has fewer features than OneNote 2016 for Mac and may not be applied to large number of the users in sharing and syncing notebooks, I’d like to know whether you have
 OneNote 2016 for Mac installed on your Mac. If yes, I suggest you use it instead and install the latest version
</span><span>16.17.0 (18090901)</span> to see if the issue goes away.</p>
<p><span>3. How many notebooks aren’t synced? If you create a new notebook, can it be synced with the application? When did the issue happen? What did you do before
 the issue happened?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<h2>            Can I add my domain email if Connected Accounts is gone&#63;  Using Add a Domain&#63; Office 365 Personal.</h2>
                    <p>I'm wanting to subscribe to office 365 Personal, but trying to find out if I can also add my domain to my office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So with the add Connected Accounts now deprecated, an MS Off 365 Chat sales person indicated I can add my domain email account to office 365 personal.&nbsp; Is this correct?&nbsp; I assume there would have to be a way to add an email account to Outlook on the web,
 or what good would it be.</p>

<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />What do you mean when you want to add your own domain to Office 365 personal?
<br />
<br />Do you want to add your own domain email provider to Outlook Desktop?
<br />
<br />Do you want to add your domain with Office 365 to have Exchange Online Service and have a mailbox hosted with Microsoft?

<p>Thanks Miguel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email address now connected to an Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a little about adding a Domain to Office 365 Outlook on the web for the primary account email address.</p>
<p>This link explains what I'm asking somewhat.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-a-personalized-email-address-in-Office-365-75416a58-b225-4c02-8c07-8979403b427b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add domain email</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't want to be stuck with a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email address after Paying for Office 365, I wan't to keep my original email addresses.&nbsp; That is the whole spirit of Outlook isn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this takes the place of the old Connected Accounts that was deprecated?</p>

            Are you using a business Office 365 tenant or an Outlook.com address?  This &gt;&gt; So with the add Connected Accounts now deprecated &lt;&lt; applies only to business accounts. You can use connected accounts with outlook.com accounts. 
<br />
<br />If you only need one mailbox (up to 6 if you have a personal subscription) you can use a custom domain with Office 365 Home or Personal subscription.

<p>I know this Diane, I have connected accounts in Outlook.com as i mentioned above.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I still don't have an answer to my 'Add email account to Outlook' question.</p>
<p>If new users of Office 365 Can Not add/setup their existing primary email account (regardless of where its hosted) in Outlook on the web, how does this work?</p>
<p>What good is an Outlook on which users can't setup existing email accounts??</p>

    <title>PowerPivot in Excel 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cpbi  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPivot in Excel 2013</h2>
                    <p>Having spent three hours being sent to MS chat options and eventually speaking to someone who didn't know what day of the week it was I am still no further forward on this. I have Office 2010 running on Windows 8.1 - I went on chat this morning to get confirmation
 I could download Excel 2013 independently as I was informed it came with PowerPivot and Power Query already installed plus I could download Power Map. I have done the latter and Power Query is there BUT PowerPivot isn't and no-one on the 'help chat' can get
 it into their brains that it just isn't visible as a COM Add-In. As a result of that the suggested route down REGEDIT also won't work because PowerPivot is not there. Someone on chat mentioned downloading PowerPivot 2013 example files and hope that my licence
 key kick-starts PowerPivot proper - no, I can't believe it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is what do I have to do to get PowerPivot running on Excel 2013? I just cannot believe that MS are letting these issues run when as an Add-In for 2010 it works fine</p>

            <p>Thanks Norman. Utterly unbelievable that MS can release a version of something as widely used as Excel and screw up what works as a COM Add-In from earlier version. Fortunately I have e-mailed transcripts of my conversation with them prior to purchasing
 the product so it's misrepresentation for starters.</p>

    <title>Problems with Mac Mail - Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Mac Mail - Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen something similar. We have a customer who is using Office 365 and for 90% of the users this is fine, They are using Mac Mail for their Mail and in general, it's syncing fine (down to the mail client and syncing between the phone and Mac).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The office is a mix of 10.10 machines and 10.11 machines</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 users however, Who are having nothing but problems and it's hard to pinpoint what it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2 users are on 10.11.6, and have had problems where:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Mail will behave fine then it will show several unread emails, and if she reads one..(as in clicks the mail message and leaves it on for a few seconds, the blue unread dot won't go away until she clicks onto another folder in mac mail such as junk etc)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 - The other has emails coming in that are read automatically!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we have tried starting from Scratch, Removed the Mail preferences, user caches, Removed the account and even Trashed the user/library/Mail folder contents.</p>
<p>We added the accounts as imap but now they are having syncing problems (mail coming in on phone but not the Mac)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Could it just be the 2 machines? We have asked one of the users to try another machine but it seems odd. The network is fine as we thought it may be dropping on and off but its not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought it could be 10.11.6 but there's lots of machines in the office using this and they are fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything else we can try?</p>
<p />

            <span>Hi Aaron,<br />
<br />
As you said, you are using IMAP mode to add the Office 365 accounts into the Mac mail app. When using IMAP mode, only the emails will sync between the Mac mail app and Office 365 Exchange Online. The calendar, contacts, tasks and other items will not sync.
 So I would first suggest you add these accounts via Exchange mode. <br />
<br />
Also please check in Office 365 OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) with the two problematic accounts to see if the issue also exists in OWA.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang<br />

            <p>Hi Yang,</p>
<p>
</p><p>They were originally exchange but we tried imap to rectify the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have more issues on imap so we have gone back to exchange</p>
<p>
</p><p>OWA is fine...but surely Mac mail should be too?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could it be if its okay server side? It seems to be sync issues between mac mail on 10.11.6 and exchange</p>

            <p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If OWA works fine, the expected behavior should be that all outlook clients will keep the same behavior with OWA (server side). Given the situation, it is recommend that you upgrade the OS version of the Mac to the latest, and then configure the Office 365
 account in the mail app via Exchange to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Edge browser - Tabs colors options</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;From a user point of view when there are two or tabs on display, having the active tab change to a Green colour.</p>
<p>This would be visually very&nbsp; helpful as at present when several tabs are open ,it is difficult to see which is the active Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Currently all non-active tabs are grey , active tab&nbsp;&nbsp; in the&nbsp; default white colour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a tablet, big&nbsp; screen or even a desktop computer, just grey and white is&nbsp; difficult to see in daylight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In my&nbsp; experience , eyes see bright colours very quickly,much&nbsp; better than grey or white.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Firefox , there are many themes that allow for this option;&nbsp; it is much easier on the eye.</p>

<p>Hi KCMO Gregg</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!!!</p>
<p>1) What is the version of Operating System you are using?</p>
<p>2) What is the version of Internet Explorer you are using?</p>
<p>3) Were you able to delete the Favorites folders earlier?</p>
<p>4) As you mentioned "certain bookmarked folders", does that mean that you are able to delete some folders?</p>
<p>The issue of “not able to delete favorites folders “is already been reported to Microsoft for Internet Explorer 8 some time back.</p>
<p>However I have tried to reproduce the issue and it was working as it is designed and intended to. I was able to delete the folder from Favorites.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to delete the folder as in Method 1 &amp; 2 below and let us know of what happens.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>1. Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>2. Do one of the following:</p>
<p>·&nbsp; In Internet Explorer 8, click the Favorites button, click the arrow next to the Add to Favorites button, and then click Organize Favorites.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; In Internet Explorer 7, click the Add to Favorites button, and then click Organize Favorites.</p>
<p>3. In the Organize Favorites dialog box, click Folder that you want to delete, and click Delete and select OK in the window that pops up.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>1. Under the Favorites tab Right click the Folder you want to delete and select Delete from the drop down list.</p>
<p>If you have already tried the methods above then I would suggest you to reset the Internet Explorer and see if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>Access the link below to use the Fix it tool or manually Reset the Internet Explorer.</p>

<h2>            Font appears missing for combo box Form Control</h2>
                    In Excel Office 2011 Mac:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When using Form Controls, the Combobox shows no text, only blank lines which correspond to the text in the list range I specified. &nbsp;These blank lines are both in the list menu, and on the control. &nbsp;It functions as if the font is missing, much like what
 happens when a document is opened and the font is missing. &nbsp;I can select an item from the blank list.

<div>The same is true for the Listbox form control</div>

            Glad to hear it, but Arial is a 'standard' font which you most definitely should have. I wonder if you might have removed/disabled it when you did the fontweeding procedure??? Launch Font Book to see if it is available for resurrection. If not you should
 be able to reinstall it from your Office install disk or from your OS X disk.<br />
