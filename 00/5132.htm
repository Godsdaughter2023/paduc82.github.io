<p><span>So I noticed that some people were getting issues with the battery I noticed the typical turn off this, this and this advice which although obvious makes a huge difference.&nbsp;</span><br />

<span>The problem I notice is that although we're told to turn off background apps, what about apps we NEED to leave on like Whatsapp? For me it's really essential for chatting in groups for work as well as socially. When I had the Lumia 800 ( amazing phone
 terrible camera) it barely bat an eyelid in the face of Whatsapp. With the 1020 I had a bit of a nightmare trying to work out what was murdering my battery. So soft reset, hard reset and another hard reset i started from scratch. At 47% battery I had SIXTEEN
 hours of battery left. BOOM. Lovely jubbly.</span><br />
<br />
<span>But then I installed Whatsapp. I'm not even joking - it said LESS THAN 1 HOUR remaining. Please don't tell me I'm the only one experiencing this and is Whatsapp gonna roll out a better update because without my phone works a dream but I really need it

 running in the background like the good 'ol lumia 800 days. If anyone else has some input for this that'd be great!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone can tell me how they're battery performance is with Whatsapp on left in the background that'd be great just so I know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. You need a few (10-12) recharges for the Battery to stabilise ..</p>
<p>2. Note that the sudden drop in the remaining battery is calculated based on the immediate usage pattern .. meaning you charge the Battery full and do not use the phone for 4-5 hours, the remaining battery will show quite a good percetage. Then you use it
 for applications that use higher proccessing power (GPS, Games, Internet, etc) just about 15-20 minutes and it will suddenly drop taking into account that the usage pattern is going to continue. Once you stop using the device again for an extended period,
 the remaining time may again jump up ..</p>

    <title>How to change the color of a symbol in Word&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change the color of a symbol in Word&#63;</h2>
                    I want to change the color of the Enclosed Alphanumerics of the Font Arial Unicode MS, how can I do so? For example, I inserted the symbol of the M with a circle around it, it is in black and white, but I want to be able to change the color of the M and
 just the color inside the circle. Can I do this? I tried to copy and paste it into Paint but it changed the symbol to a question mark.<br />

            <p>You cannot change the color of just part of any font character (which is what this symbol is). You would have to convert the symbol to a picture and then edit it with image-editing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you could create the symbol you desire by inserting a circular shape, coloring it as desired, and then using Add Text to add the M to the center (you'll need to set the text box margins to zero and center the text horizontally and vertically).
 Once you've created the object, you can set the text wrapping to In Line With Text and save it as an AutoText entry.</p>

            If you have no current security on the system, there is a good chance your computer is already infected. Not being able to get to antivirus/antimalware program websites is a symptom of infection. BTW, McAfee is possibly the worst choice you could make.
 If you want a free antivirus, try Avast instead. Download it from a different, known-clean computer and put it on a USB thumb drive.<br />
<br />
First make sure your computer is virus/malware-free:<br />
<br />
Go through these general malware removal steps systematically - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> <br />
<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).

<h2>            Outlook and Messenger app sends the message twice.</h2>
                    When i send a message from outlook.com or the messenger app in Windows 8/RT, the message gets sent twice.

</div>
<div>It's incredibly annoying. It only happens with FB Chat, and NOT the Messenger service. This only started happening yesterday when @WinPhoneSupport told me to disconnect and reconnect my accounts. For good measure, i tried doing that again to see if it
 would solve my problem. no dice.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Messages show up&nbsp;normally&nbsp;on my phone and at Facebook.com</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After a while (5-10 minutes) the duplicate message&nbsp;disappears.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT 1: I have made a new outlook account and fake FB account, connected the two, and friended my primary FB account with the fake account and the problem persists on this new account, too.</div>

<p>So, what do you want help with?&nbsp; Apparently, Excel 2003 had a 'line print' setting that no longer exists in 2010 (and I suspect 2007).&nbsp; My guess is that it was a leftover from the days of line printers (only printed text using an electromechanical printer).</p>
<p>If you have one of those devices you may want to test what happens if you save the file as a xlsx/xlsm and then print.</p>

<p>I suggest you consider using Save As for the xlsm file, and then see what happens when you print.</p>
<p>If there is a problem, you can always return to the original file and try something else.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>The alert message pops up when I click save as and change the file extension to .xlsm</p>
<p>While printing the information on the header is over lapped for a spread sheet. This is good if I print through Excel 2003</p>

<p>I previously had Office 2010, which I uninstalled before installing Office 2016. The problem started right away after the installation, I've never been able to see the scrollbar on my laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Office and did a complete re-install, same results. Tried various layouts (with/without reading pane, changed size of pane, with/without to-do pane, etc.). I was never able to see the email scrollbar. It is missing in the reading pane as well
 as when I open an email in a separate window. That's when I installed Office 2016 on the VM and was able to see the scrollbar. I've attached a screenshot below, top one is from the VM, with the scrollbar, bottom one is from the laptop, without the scrollbar.</p>

<p>3. Format ribbon, Columns group, click Custom Fields</p>
<p>4. In the custom fields form click the formula button</p>
<p>5. Suppose you want to color the bars for the resource Karen then in the formula window type Iif([Resource Names]="Karen",Yes,No) , OK till you're out of the custom fields window</p>
<p>6. Format ribbon, Format button, Bar styles</p>
<p>7. In bar styles, scroll to the bottom and add a line with as Name Karen, change the color below and in show for... type Flag1.
</p>
<p>So much for the Karen bars... now for the ouie bars start all over with the Flag2 field, etc.</p>

<p>Look for the style line "Progress", select it.</p>
<p>Click Cut Row</p>
<p>Now select the first empty line</p>

    <title>Broken File Printouts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> westlywarrior  say:</h3>
<h2>            Broken File Printouts</h2>
                    <p>All -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My school district has begun rolling out Office365. &nbsp;OneNote is proving to be very popular among the staff, however we've run into an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is file "printouts" breaking inside of a note. &nbsp;This issue shows itself with PDF files and Word Files (so far).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no error messages, only symbols for broken links. &nbsp;The larger problem is that the notes/notebooks will work fine initially, and then later display this broken link behavior. &nbsp;It happens in Desktop version of OneNote (office 16), as well as the
 web based version. &nbsp;Also, PC and Mac...once this problem surfaces it seems to set in across all devices.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft Support suggested I post this question here. &nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi WestlyWarrior,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify the situation, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. Does “breaking inside of a note” mean you can’t do any operation on the page where the printout file is inserted?
</p>
<p>2. A screenshot of symbols for broken links for us better understanding.</p>
<p>3. When the broken link behavior happens, can you still use the other sections of OneNote?</p>
<p>4.A screenshot of OneNote version for Windows. Check it via <strong>File&gt;Account.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19c889b0-e43d-4da3-bf1f-c0f1e281cef4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19c889b0-e43d-4da3-bf1f-c0f1e281cef4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. The version of OneNote for MAC (eg.15.33(170409)). Check it via <strong>OneNote&gt;About OneNote</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards，</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, Kimi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - "breaking" means that the file printout does not display. &nbsp;Theres an outline of a "frame" where the printout would normally appear, and it just has a little "x" in it. (image below)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2e14810-2f49-4de4-875d-fd533f88e757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2e14810-2f49-4de4-875d-fd533f88e757" /></a></p>
<p>2 - Image above</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - Other than not displaying the printout...OneNote otherwise operates normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 - PC version 1703, build 7967.2161</p>
<p>
</p><p>5 - Mac version: &nbsp;15.34 (170515)<br />

<p>Hi WestlyWarrior,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the screenshot.</p>
<p>According to the description, I suppose you use “File Printout” to insert the files.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8177781-f8a1-474c-bf8a-1f9beca586c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8177781-f8a1-474c-bf8a-1f9beca586c0" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s switch a way to open it. If you use File Attachment and click Insert Printout to insert, will the same situation come up?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f90966a2-25ac-47f4-b1f6-db017b631a28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f90966a2-25ac-47f4-b1f6-db017b631a28" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you create a new PDF file and a new Word file, then insert them in OneNote<span>, are they showed in OneNote?</span></p>
<p>Moreover, you mentioned that the problem affected all devices. We need to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Do other users like your colleagues encounter the same issue?</span></li><li>If your colleagues and you encounter the same issue, do you insert the same files? And do you use the same notebook to insert files?</li><li>Where do you store the notebook, in OneDrive or in OneDrive for Business?</li><li><span>Please also provide the same screenshot as the last reply mentioned of OneNote for Windows so that we can reproduce the situation.</span></li></ol>

                    <p>When I try to attach a file to an AOL email that I want to send, I get an error message that tells me I do not have permission and must contact the administrator. I am the administrator! My windows 7 ultimate is my operating system. I get the same error

<p>But if I switch to Safari browser I have no trouble accessing Aol and using it's email program to send an email and making an attachment of one of my files.</p>

    <title>No Outlook 365 Address Book - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jersey-devil  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Outlook 365 Address Book</h2>
                    <p>I installed Office 365 Personal&nbsp;on my desktop and tablet computers running Windows 8.1 Update 1 last September, and everything worked fine, including Outlook 2013.&nbsp; About a month ago, Outlook 2013 stopped producing an Address Book.&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft
 support and spent many frustrating hours online trying to get support and dealing with several Level 1 techs and one Level&nbsp;2 tech -- all to no avail.&nbsp; I also checked this forum, found others were having the same or similar problem, and tried a posted solution
 -- again all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I installed a 250GB SSD on my desktop computer&nbsp;and cloned the contents of my existing 110GB SSD to my new drive, and all went well.&nbsp; Then, I uninstalled Office 365 Personal from my new SSD and then reinstalled it hoping that would cure the Address
 Book problem, but it didn't.&nbsp; As before, my computer runs fine except Outlook 2013 has no Address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com works fine as does People.&nbsp; That is, all contact addresses are available in both cases.&nbsp; At one point, I vaguely recall seeing an error message that I should contact the Exchange Administrator and complain about my Outlook 2013 not having an
 Address Book.&nbsp; Would someone please tell me how to contact that administrator or tell me how to fix this damn, extremely annoying Address Book problem?&nbsp; I foolishly thought subscribing to Office 365 Personal would relieve me from having to troubleshoot Office
 365 Personal, but instead none of Microsoft's techs nor anyone else has been able to solve the Address Book problem, which I strongly suspect has something to do with broken sync between my client software and the server containing my contact data, which I
 know is there because it's available to Outlook.com and to the People app.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what you mean by "Are you using only an outlook.com mail account within MS Outlook?"&nbsp; I have both Outlook.com and Outlook 2013 on my desktop and tablet computers.&nbsp; So far as I know, Outlook.com and Outlook 2013 operate independently from one
 another, except for sharing contacts.&nbsp; Outlook.com doesn't run "within MS Outlook".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contents of my original C: drive SSD were cloned to my new SSD, which is now my C: drive.&nbsp; However, I uninstalled Office 365 Personal after cloning and then reinstalled it.&nbsp; Again, I don't know what you mean by:&nbsp; "If you cloned your installation the
 new install of MS Office would have used the original Outlook Profile and its settings, so if there was a Profile problem it would have been replicated. Not that the address book has anything to do with the Profile."&nbsp; I guess a "Profile problem" would have
 been replicated if there was a problem.&nbsp; No Microsoft tech found any problem with the Profile or he/she would have corrected it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer is yes to your last question.&nbsp; Again, several Microsoft techs have meticulously examined my Outlook 2013 and verified such settings.&nbsp; Also please note, there are a number of postings on this forum complaining about the Address Book issue.&nbsp; My
 Address Book problem is not unique.&nbsp; No one has yet posted a viable solution to the problem nor has any Microsoft tech found a solution in my case.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1) Outlook.com is an email account which can&nbsp;be configured in Outlook (desktop client) as either an EAS, POP3 or IMAP email account. It doesn't operate within an email "client" (whether that's Outlook or anything else) - the account is "accessed" via the
 email client. Alternatively, you can access&nbsp;the Outlook.com&nbsp;email account via your web browser (otherwise referred to as WebMail)</p>

 interim - the suggestion I would make for this particular scenario is to create a &lt;new&gt; Outlook profile and configure the Outlook.com account which should result in all info being sync'd from the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook AddressBook is a specialized "view" of the contact folders that comprise it. Sounds like the AB service has become corrupted and any "problems" certainly would have been carried forward via a 'cloning process".&nbsp;A new profile&nbsp;should resolve the
 problem.&nbsp;Also, uninstalling and reinstalling Office never resolves "Outlook profile related" issues since those persist between uninstall/reinstalls.&nbsp;It's essential that a &lt;NEW&gt; Outlook profile gets created - not &lt;copying&gt; the existing one first OR deleting
 / adding accounts to the current profile (remember to make sure that you make the "new default" for the next time Outlook opens.</p>

</p><p><em>Microsoft techs made new profiles, which didn't solve the problem.&nbsp; The last tech before the issue was escalated to a Level 2 tech opined the problem appeared to be a server sync issue, which still sounds good to me.&nbsp; However, the Level 2 tech merely
 repeated all the things the previous techs had done and I've since done, which includes a new profile.&nbsp; I wish I had saved the error message I received that recommended I contact the Exchange Administrator or similar words about a sync problem.&nbsp; I would make
 that&nbsp;contact&nbsp;if I knew how to do it.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>My Response:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I contacted the Answer Desk and Office Ask Support&nbsp;techs, including one supervisor.&nbsp; Including all the time I spent on hold, calling again because calls were dropped, I spent several hours online with techs remotely in control of my computer running
 their tests and reconfigurations all to no avail.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please also note the Address Book problem exists also on my tablet and on every drive I can install in my desktop computer.&nbsp; Again, Outlook.com and People have no Address Book problem and neither did Outlook 365 for about four months after installation.&nbsp;
 Then one day -- BOOM! -- the problem appeared, and all the King's men and horses haven't been able to put Office 365 back together again.&nbsp; All of which leads me to think, the Outlook 365 software on my computers and disks is OK, and it's some sort of a sync
 problem with the server.&nbsp; Also, Office 365 didn't always run perfectly during the four months it had no Address Book problem.&nbsp; Occasionally, it would lose contact with the Mother Ship, which again suggests to me a sync problem.&nbsp; In fact when the problem first
 began, it was flaky, appearing and disappearing in different ways on both my desktop and laptop computers.&nbsp; Now, the problem seems to have stablized in the broken position both computers and all disks.</em></p>

<p>While I was cogitating a possible server-based fault, I noticed a couple other anomalies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Search function activated via the Charms menu was only partially working, and the File History function had stopped working.&nbsp; Being desperate at that point, I
 unearthed a backup clone I'd made before the current backup clone and ran it.&nbsp; Lo and behold, the Charms Search function and File History&nbsp;worked, and a partially populated Address Book appeared.&nbsp; Of course, there was a lot of updating to do, but it wasn't
 bad data-wise due to most of my data being stored on a server somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Contacts folder driving the Address Book was and partially remains FOBAR at this writing.&nbsp; However using baby steps, I've slowly and painfully restored and updated most of it.&nbsp; Although it ain't over till it's over, it appears I will have a viable Address
 Book on my desktop computer when I'm finished.&nbsp; However at this point, my tablet has only picked up two of my contacts, which is disquieting.&nbsp; Maybe I'll have to reinstall Office 365 on the tablet to get the contents of its Address Book to match the one on
 my desktop computer.&nbsp; Or, maybe the Contacts folder will update automatically -- eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless my Outlook 2013 software is still screwed up, establishing and editing contacts is a bear.&nbsp; Save &amp; Close often causes a contact to disappear.&nbsp; Sometimes just saving evokes an error message stating it can't be saved and offering an alternative that
 may or may not work.&nbsp; Other times, a duplicate is made long after a contact has been successfully saved and appears in the Address Book.&nbsp; Many times the only way to get a contact to appear in the Address Book is to&nbsp;construct a contact again.&nbsp; Working with
 the Contacts folder is very treacherous!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm sort of getting lost in some of your descriptions so just to&nbsp;confirm some things up to this point..........</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - When you use the term "AddressBook" - are you referring to the actual Outlook Address Book which is a representation of the contacts folder(s) designated to comprise it or are you referring to the actual contacts within the contact folder(s) you want
 to see appear in the AddressBook? There's a world of difference between the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - You stated that you have gone through multiple "fresh" installs on different systems - is that correct? A "fresh install" is the equivalent of "creating a new profile" which would mean that multiple different systems experience the same issues using
 the same Outlook.com account - that sum it up correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - You mentioned doing installs on different "hard drives" (if I remember correctly somewhere in this thread) - was that all on the same system? Using the same existing Outlook profile that was in place at the time of the install? If that's the case, then
 the same issue(s) would be in play no matter how many times you installed Office/Outlook? Were all of these drives SSD? Did you try installing a standard drive and create a new profile? (Only reason for this last question is that have read about various issues
 over time coming into play with SSD drives&nbsp; - nothing specific to Outlook and have no direct experience with a system using an SSD drive that is the primary boot drive - so just mentioning it FWIW since my tablet only has an SSD drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - In reference to your tablet - what platform is this tablet - Windows using the Outlook desktop or something else connecting directly to your Outlook.com account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 - Out of curiousity, on your Windows systems using Win 8 - is your Windows login using the same email address as your Outlook.com account? Do the contacts appear in the WIn 8.1 &lt;People&gt; applet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to summarize this................</p>
<p>
</p><p>If multiple different systems are connecting to the same Outlook.com account via the Exchnage ActiveSync protocol and contacts do not appear on any of them - then sheer logic dictates that there is an issue at the "source" (ergo - your data on the server).
 You would have to have some "real strange and extreme" exceptional circumstance that something in the data somehow impacts the Outlook desktop software but that shouldn't impact anything on non-Windows based platforms unless the glitch is directly with the
 EAS protocol </p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I'd be doing if this was happening to me while waiting on any kind of info back directly from people who are very familiar with Outlook.com (either other users/people from the Outlook.com answers forum or Outlook.com people themselves</p>
<p>
</p><p>- create a new Outlook.com account</p>
<p>- connect it to your Outlook profile</p>
<p>- add a few contacts - does/do the same problem(s) still occur? If no - then the issue is clearly related to the original Outlook.com account in some way. If the answer is no, then I'd probably delete all the contacts in the original Outlook.com account
 (ensuring that I have a backup of these accounts first somewhere) and then re-importing them leaving a little time between the two events and ensuring that I logged and out and then back in between the steps. The import I'm referring to would be via the WebMail
 process - not via Outlook desktop software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the answer&nbsp;is still &lt;yes&gt; (problems still exist) - then that brings a different focus on things but will leave all of the that until it's known to be the case. However, one last point about MS Support - if you have something that is occurring across the
 board after all of the above - then your best bet is probably the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>- using a &lt;virgin&gt; system with nothing installed other than Office/Outlook and connecting to your Outlook.com account</p>
<p>- open a support case with MS Support directly via the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ContactUs/TechnicalSupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/ContactUs/TechnicalSupport</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(and in the interest for all concerned - have a clear list/description of everything that led up to you contacting them being very explicit when using terms like "AddressBook" versus "contact folder" - creation of new profile (which for some means deleting
 an email account from an existing profile and re-adding it which is not the same as creating a new profile) etc etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case - am real curious to find out if this is an issue with one specific Outlook.com account or anything that connects to your Outlook installs</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>My Response</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I'm lost at this point and don't have time to research your issue.&nbsp; Suffice it to say several Microsoft techs have taken remote control of my desktop computer and done many things, including creating new profiles, all to no avail.&nbsp; However, one suggested
 I needed to delete all contacts in the Contacts folder and reenter my contacts manually.&nbsp; I rejected the advice because at the time I thought Outlook 2013 was getting its contacts data from the same source at Outlook.com, which is working fairly well.&nbsp; Apparently,
 Outlook 2013 gets its contact data from another source.&nbsp; Likewise, People is working fairly well, but not perfectly.&nbsp; Both Outlook.com and People have some multiple contact entries.&nbsp; People is worse, but that may be because its connected to Live, Google, and
 Skype.&nbsp; I would be happier if all my e-mail services connected just to Google's contact data or at least to one Microsoft source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - You mentioned doing installs on different "hard drives" (if I remember correctly somewhere in this thread) - was that all on the same system? Using the same existing Outlook profile that was in place at the time of the install? If that's the case, then

<p>
</p><p><strong>My Response</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled Office 365 Personal&nbsp;on one SSD of my desktop computer, which didn't correct the Address Book issue.&nbsp; My desktop computer has a tower with three 5.25-in Mobile Racks and one dual 3.5-inch Mobile Rack, which allow me to insert and remove several
 hard drives and SSDs quickly.&nbsp; This configuration is particularly helpful when backing up a drive or trouble shooting, for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - In reference to your tablet - what platform is this tablet - Windows using the Outlook desktop or something else connecting directly to your Outlook.com account?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Response</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My tablet is a Dell Venue 8 Pro with 64GB storage, which I think Dell has given a slightly new name to distinguish it from the 32GB version.&nbsp; At last check, the tablet was largely not&nbsp;tracking the contacts in the Contact folder on my desktop computer.&nbsp; The
 tablet only had a few of the desktop's contacts, and I haven't a clue why.&nbsp; I'm not looking forward to creating a new contact list in the Contacts folder of the tablet.&nbsp; My workaround is to use People, which lends itself better to the tablet's touch operation
 anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop Windows is the 64-bit version of Windows 8.1 Update 1, and my tablet uses the 32-bit version.&nbsp; The two devices are somewhat interactive.&nbsp; That is when I installed my tablet, a lot of the setup of my desktop computer transferred to the tablet automatically.&nbsp;
 However, Office 365 was independently installed on each device as was Quicken, for example.&nbsp; That said if I construct a contacts list in the Contacts folder of my desktop computer with the tablet off, I would expect the tablet could access that list from the
 server synced with my desktop computer.&nbsp; However, the tablet is syncing to that contact data very poorly, with only a few contacts appearing at last check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, I seem to recall getting along with Windows 8.x.x very well since I first installed the $40 version of Windows 8 Pro way back when.&nbsp; I'm not a garden variety Windows 8 naysayer nor am I claiming Windows 8.x.x is the greatest thing since sliced
 bread.&nbsp; However, I have done everything I ever did with Windows 7 Ultimate on my Windows 8.x.x installations until just recently.&nbsp; Now problems seem to be popping up like dandelions.&nbsp; Just this morning, I had to reinstall my printer/scanner/copier software
 because it apparently got dinged during a clone operation.&nbsp; Considering the enormous amount of changes that have been made since I first installed Windows 8, I expect I'm due for a totally fresh installation of everything.&nbsp; I had expected to start anew with
 Windows 10, but, having been involved with the preview for many months, I am not planning to migrate to 10.&nbsp; However, I would like Office touch/mouse/keyboard apps on&nbsp;my 8.1 system and even Cortana.&nbsp;&nbsp;But where Cortana is concerned, I can get along just fine
 with Bing and especially Google Now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 - Out of curiousity, on your Windows systems using Win 8 - is your Windows login using the same email address as your Outlook.com account? Do the contacts appear in the WIn 8.1 &lt;People&gt; applet.</p>

</p><p>Yes and yes</p>

</p><p>If multiple different systems are connecting to the same Outlook.com account via the Exchnage ActiveSync protocol and contacts do not appear on any of them - then sheer logic dictates that there is an issue at the "source" (ergo - your data on the server).
 You would have to have some "real strange and extreme" exceptional circumstance that something in the data somehow impacts the Outlook desktop software but that shouldn't impact anything on non-Windows based platforms unless the glitch is directly with the
 EAS protocol </p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I'd be doing if this was happening to me while waiting on any kind of info back directly from people who are very familiar with Outlook.com (either other users/people from the Outlook.com answers forum or Outlook.com people themselves</p>
<p>
</p><p>- create a new Outlook.com account</p>
<p>- connect it to your Outlook profile</p>
<p>- add a few contacts - does/do the same problem(s) still occur? If no - then the issue is clearly related to the original Outlook.com account in some way. If the answer is no, then I'd probably delete all the contacts in the original Outlook.com account
 (ensuring that I have a backup of these accounts first somewhere) and then re-importing them leaving a little time between the two events and ensuring that I logged and out and then back in between the steps. The import I'm referring to would be via the WebMail
 process - not via Outlook desktop software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the answer&nbsp;is still &lt;yes&gt; (problems still exist) - then that brings a different focus on things but will leave all of the that until it's known to be the case. However, one last point about MS Support - if you have something that is occurring across the
 board after all of the above - then your best bet is probably the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>- using a &lt;virgin&gt; system with nothing installed other than Office/Outlook and connecting to your Outlook.com account</p>
<p>- open a support case with MS Support directly via the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ContactUs/TechnicalSupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/ContactUs/TechnicalSupport</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(and in the interest for all concerned - have a clear list/description of everything that led up to you contacting them being very explicit when using terms like "AddressBook" versus "contact folder" - creation of new profile (which for some means deleting
 an email account from an existing profile and re-adding it which is not the same as creating a new profile) etc etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case - am real curious to find out if this is an issue with one specific Outlook.com account or anything that connects to your Outlook installs</p>

                    <p>We are using Outlook 2010 and when I assign a task to someone, when the user accepts or updates the task, it sents an email.&nbsp; However, that email gets stuck in the person's Outbox and when you open the email, it shows "The incoming task is not valid".&nbsp; In
 addition, it shows that the message is "Read-Only" at the top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This does not happen to ALL users but quite a few.&nbsp; I have compared the add-ins for the user and I have also compared the email addresses but it is just not working.&nbsp; Now this worked in Outlook 2003 and also Outlook 2007 but not in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be MUCH appreciated as I am spending so much time trying to troubleshoot this problem.</p>

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No it seems to work in Safe Mode.&nbsp; So does this make the profile is corrupt?&nbsp; If so, then this would be a problem for almost all of our users which could be over 500&nbsp; I am sure not all are using Tasks - i.e., to assign to other users.&nbsp; Now this worked fine
 in Outlook 2003 AND Outlook 2007 so why when we upgraded would it have stopped working?</p>

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I thought about the add-ins and actually removed a lot of them yesterday - i.e., I left the ones where it worked for one user and disabled all of the other ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as the views, no; we just have the standard ones:&nbsp; simple, detailed, etc.&nbsp; I also tested the views&nbsp;- where it was in the simple view, then tested in the detailed, etc. but still had the problem.&nbsp; I am going to go back and test the add-ins again and
 remove all and add back one at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I ever find the solution for this, I will let you know.&nbsp; Also, if you can think of anything else, I would be very appreciative.&nbsp; Thanks for your responses!&nbsp; I really appreciated it!</p>

<p>Sorry to respond so late but yes the problem still happens with the /cleanviews switch on any machine.&nbsp; The problem is the "Workshare Outlook Com Add-In".&nbsp; When it is not checked, updating Tasks work just fine.&nbsp; This add-in is for when we send out attachments,
 then it comes up - Workshare Protect so we must keep it.&nbsp; However, there must be&nbsp;a setting somewhere in one of the Workshare policies.</p>

<h2>            Ntlworld emails in Outlook.live.com</h2>
                    <p>Please pleas help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an Apple fan, and therefore have a iMac, a Macbook Pro and ipads etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always used Microsoft Office which i really like, and for emails I use Outlook 2011 on the iMac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I CAN read my emails on the MacBook through a web browser but can't see the folders etc as they are held on the iMac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, i decided, after seeing a friends set up, to purchase Microsoft 365 in the hope that i could read my emails and create folders on either machine, and each would work together. This is proving to be impossible - I can't even received my ntlworld emails
 on outlook.live.com, I'm signed in ok and according to my profile my email address is correct, but i cannot receive or send email, never mind the folder aspects of my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its driving me mad - it really isn't intuitive as i would have expected a Microsoft Product to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose i initially need help in simply receiving emails via outlook.live.com. That would be a real help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that i can try to sort the folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

    <title>Create a 2 year comparison report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> connie.dbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create a 2 year comparison report</h2>
                    I would like to create a 2 year annual comparison report using financial data from a single table.&nbsp; The data is based on a many to many relationship as there may be accounts used in eg: 2011 that will not be used in eg: 2012, and vice versa. I have created
 separate queries that return the desired data for each year, but can't seem to join them correctly to make it work in the report.<br />
<br />
The report should list all account names in the left most column.&nbsp; Column headings should be eg: 2011 and 2012.&nbsp; The total annual amount for each account should fill the appropriate year heading.<br />
<br />
Non of the available joins do the trick if I add the 2 queries into one query.<br />
<br />
So far what I have attempted with make table queries and a junction table has not worked. Make table doesn't like that much.<br />
<br />
Using Access 2007.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

    <title>Full screen bug when closing excel workbooks on desktop in windowed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vicpt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Full screen bug when closing excel workbooks on desktop in windowed mode.</h2>
                    <p>Bug with multiple Excel workbook windows opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If for example I have 1 desktop space with an excel workbook opened and another separate workbook opened in full screen.... there is a bug when closing the excel workbook in the desktop space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you close the workbook in the desktop space (windowed mode)... the screen immediately after closing this workbook jumps to the fullscreen excel workbook that is still open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely annoying as I open multiple excel files in a desktop space (not full screen), and close them frequently right after... just as the last one gets closed, I get jumped to whatever full screen excel file is opened at the time. If you have
 for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop 1 &lt;-&gt; Safari full screen&nbsp;&lt;-&gt; Mail full screen&nbsp;&lt;-&gt; Excel workbook xyz</p>
<p>
</p><p>It even does worse in this situation as this is what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop 1 &lt;-&gt; Excel workbook xyz &lt;-&gt; Safari full screen&nbsp;&lt;-&gt; Mail full screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>The excel workbook in full screen mode becomes as the next screen after desktop, which disorganises completely the exposé. So jumping to whatever fullscreen excel workbook was already bad and annoying.... disorganising my screen setup takes it a step further
 do complete annoyance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this problem happen in every version of excel 2016 for mac... currently have the latest February 2017 update... running on Sierra (Macbook Pro 13" mid 2010)</p>

    <title>GAL Auto Resolution &#38; Rules Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tekj42  say:</h3>
<h2>            GAL Auto Resolution &#38; Rules Problem</h2>
                    Greetings -<br />
<br />
First time I have ever posted a question on a forum like this. I have a client who uses hosted exchange as an email platform for two domains. The email works great - the problem is that she wants to create a rule to move all email sent to her address at one
 of the domains, while leaving the other domain email in her regular inbox.<br />
<br />
After trying all manner of different rule variations including searching the header, recipient, and even body of the email for specific words or phrases, I still cannot get exchange / outlook to filter email sent to one address from email sent to another. Auto
 Resolution resolves the emails to the default email address set for the user in the GAL mailbox before the rule is processed, so there is no way to sort emails sent to one domain email account versus the other.<br />
<br />
I have tried disabling Auto Name Checking on the client, as well as trying to create the rule in OWA.<br />
<br />
Any Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance -<br />
<br />
Jason Hodge<br />

            <p>That is expected behavior when the address has been configured as an additional address (alias) for the mailbox.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For external emails, letting it search for that email address in the message header should do the trick.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another method to deal with it is to create a mail enabled distribution list or contact on the Exchange server for this address and have it forward to the main address of the user. This also allows the user to send from this address.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - How to Manually Archive Personal Folders</h2>
                    Is there a way to manually force Outlook 2010 to archive the personal folders? I don't mean setting up an Auto-Archive schedule, but doing it right now and only once. I seem to remember doing this is previous versions of Outlook.

<p>No, I'm sorry Russ. I meant I want to archive a message folder in my personal folders.</p>
<p>But I found the problem. Seems to be a quirk of Outlook. Even if you want to only archive items in your personal folders (personal.pst) file, you must have at least ONE message in your default .pst file, otherwise you'll get an error. At least for the first
 time you archive. I'll experiment the next time I do it. I'd just cleaned up my entire default .pst file, including sent items, and when I clicked on File | Mailbax Cleanup | Archive, I received an error that there was no object found. Once I sent myself a
 test message, all went smoothly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a similar problem after I updated to V20 firmware on my N97.&nbsp; I posted the problem but as yet nobody has been able to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having backed up the phone&nbsp;after the update I used Ovi Suite tried to restore the contents.&nbsp; When doing the restore (after some time) I received the following message from Ovi Suite "<strong>Not enough memory to restore all content</strong>" with a reference
 to a folder that had been created which apparently contained the material that was not restored.&nbsp; Several attempts at the restore process produced the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I synked the information that I could back back to the phone and re-setup my preferences WiFi connections, etc.&nbsp;but I lost some applications though as these were not restored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same problem after someone maliciously messed with and deleted things from the phone I tried to restore from the backup I had made a few days prior.&nbsp;Again though after some time Ovi Suite gave the message "<strong>Not enough memory to restore all
 content</strong>" with a reference to a folder that had been created which apparently contained the material that was not restored.&nbsp; Again some of the applications that I had installed have not been restored and this time, in addition, Ovi Maps would not work
 on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest problem is losing the apps as everything I have tried does not bring them back (they are not on my stuff).</p>

    <title>Pausing a Bike Ride Doesn&#39;t Work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaygourley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pausing a Bike Ride Doesn&#39;t Work</h2>
                    About one out of every three times I pause the Band in the middle of a bike ride it ends up ending the ride.&nbsp; This is discouraging.&nbsp; How can I ask Microsoft to fix this problem either by (1) allowing the app to join consecutive bike rides, or&nbsp;(2) updating
 the bad software so that the bike rides don't automatically end when paused?

            Hi Ben_MK--&nbsp; The link you posted goes to another thread.&nbsp; It's a long thread contains several other links.&nbsp; If that's really the link you intended to post, it doesn't go directly to a feature request page.&nbsp; If you know the URL for the feature request page,
 please post it.&nbsp; Thanks.
