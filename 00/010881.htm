<h2>            Outlook for Mac Importing 2011 data to 2016 getting &#34;No Data Found&#34; error</h2>
                    I have tried to import the old Outlook 2011 data into Outlook 2016, but keep getting a "No Data Found" error. &nbsp;This is by using the default location as well as browsing to the Office 2011 Identities folder. &nbsp;I have also tried creating a completely new
 profile to import the data into but got the same error. &nbsp;

            Greetings, Arshad - I have the exact same problem as the original poster, including the same window with the "No data found" error. &nbsp;In my case, my old computer died and I do not have the ability to reload Office 2011 on my new machine. &nbsp;I can navigate
 through my backup folders to verify the messages and such are really in the&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Office 2011 Identities folder - Outlook 2016 just won't&nbsp;believe it. &nbsp;Thanks</span></span>

            <p>I had the same problem when my iMac died and I had to replace the hard drive. &nbsp;The key to getting this to work is that you have to rebuild the Office 2011 identity. &nbsp;You can do that by downloading Office 2011 from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/MacOffice2011/en-US/MicrosoftOffice2011.dmg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/MacOffice2011/en-US/MicrosoftOffice2011.dmg</a></p>
<p>There's an installation option that allows you to read files without purchasing a license. I did a custom installation that only included Outlook 2011 and the utilities. &nbsp;This will allow you to run the Microsoft Database Utility which will recognize your
 2011 'main identity' file and allow you to select it and rebuild it. &nbsp;Once rebuilt, Outlook 2016 will recognize the identity data including all your 2011 outlook files and allow you to import them.</p>

<h2>            OUTLOOK 2016 REMINDERS WINDOW&#58; How can I get it to show when I open Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently moved from old laptop with Outlook 2007/Windows Vista to a new one with Outlook 2016/Windows 10. On the old laptop with Outlook 2007, the Reminders Window would automatically show. This was good for me because it wouldn't allow me to forget overdue
 items. With Outlook 2016, if I want to see Reminders Window, I have to go to the View Tab and then click "show Reminders Window" (bell icon). But I have to remember to do this, which doesn't make sense.&nbsp; Can I get Reminders Window to open up when I open Outlook
 2016?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thx,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BC</p>

            Not at all helpful.&nbsp; Since migrating to 2016 from 2013 my reminders no longer popup even if I click the bell icon.&nbsp; I get the reminder count in the status bar but I never get a popup window.

            I spent hours with my computer/software dealer (geek squad) and on line and phone with MS Answer desk etc, etc. regarding the Outlook 2016 reminders window and also the to-do bar, which doesn't show items for today even though I have them on my calendar.
 Also in Outlook 2016 email moving the folders around in the folder pane doesn't work properly; it's cumbersome. It did work like it's supposed to when I first got it , but not now.&nbsp; I finally decided I was wasting my time seeking help. I'll hope that future
 updates solve these issues.&nbsp; Funny, Outlook 2007 didn't have any such problems in my experience.

<h2>            Converting footnote numbers and text to plain text, and leaving the text intact</h2>
                    <p>Modified question:</p>
<p>On a Mac running Office 2011. I'm editing a chapter where the author used Word's footnote numbers in the text, which correspond to reference numbers (and text) in the back of the chapter. I've gotten rid of the other types of links used with Cmd+A and then
 hitting Cmd+Shift+FN+F9, but these "footnotes" didn't change at all. I need the file to be "vanilla" without any of Word's bells and whistles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know?</p>

<p>It sounds more like you have End Notes than Footnotes and if that is correct, on a Windows computer, the following macro would convert them to ordinary text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if it will work on a Mac, especially one that is running Office 2011, which has been superseded by later versions that do have more Visual Basic ability, but even then, not yet the equivalent of Visual Basic on Windows.</p>

    <title>&#91;SOLVED&#93; Product Suddenly Became Unlicensed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Product Suddenly Became Unlicensed</h2>
                    <div><b>UPDATE: </b>Yay I finally got this fixed by calling Microsoft Tech Support. It took 2.5 hours, but we reinstalled Office 365. The problem was that I had a trial version of 365 on the computer BEFORE I actually purchased the product. At some pt, it started
 to interfere with how the suite functioned (something to do w/ registry codes as well). Yippee!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I've been using Office 365 University for about 2 months when the product suddenly stated that it was "Unlicensed." This is an email I received from Microsoft about 2 days prior:
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b6d873b-d2c8-45e2-98bf-8fd9a6eebb9d" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As you can see, it says that I've used 8 out of 5 installs, which means to me that I've maxed out the number of installations that I'm allowed for the product. Does this factor into losing the license of my product?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have:</div>
<div>1. Only used it for my computer.</div>
<div>2. Had to reinstall multiple times when I received the "Unlicensed Product" notice on my MS applications.</div>
                </div>

            The way I see it, the count has almost nothing to do with registry entries on your machine. The current activation count is kept by MS on their computers. And obviously it ran out of "fingers and toes" and got confused about the actual current number of
 activations you have. At a guess, it appears it "forgot" to count activation deletions.<br />
<br />
Sorry, you will have to phone MS support to get them to fix this for you. It will be an uphill fight, since this is apparently a new bug. Keep asking to be transferred to a supervisor or expert. The front line 'script monkeys' are highly unlikely to have the
 correct answer for you.<br />
<br />
When contacting MS support my personal favorite is the online chat support. Next favorite is twitter. Last is phone support.&nbsp; Note, you are probably talking to the same people on all three media, but it is too easy to "accidentally" disconnect a phone call.&nbsp;
 Plus, phone seems to have the longest wait time<br />
<br />

</b></span>
<p>I recently used online chat support myself. I found it had several advantages over phone support, even though you still contact the same outsourced, support personnel:</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No ESL accent issues</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Provides instant time stamped transcript</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When you get transferred to the “right” person, they can review the history</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If they don’t read history, you can copy / paste the past conversation to them, saving you having to repeat yourself</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They are more likely to go off line to ask other people for help (good for you)</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You don’t have to listen to “elevator muzak” then they are off line</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You have 2 hands free to surf the web then they are not talking to you</p>
<p>that waiting for online chat responses less frustrating than listening to elevator music.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And when I was handed off to someone else who asked redundant questions, I simply copy and pasted the earlier replies I had given.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus it immediately gives you a timestamped transcript which you can share with the world ... &lt;grin&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<b><span>Twitter - Make your Pain Public, maybe then MS will fix the problem</span></b>

<p>
<span>Sorry, there is no good answer to that. If you, and all the others with this problem start tweeting it, making it more public, maybe then MS will finally be inspired to find the fix to the problem.</span></p>

</p><p>If I enter <a href="http://www.gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.gmail.com</a>, I get to the sign in page but as soon as I click on my gmail account name, in order to then enter the password,&nbsp;the page closes and reverts back to google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening? I assume it is something to do with google and internet explorer but I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer any solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>You get billed 3 days in advance. The minutes are not released until the subscription cycle completes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time you purchase the subscription it is January 6th at 11am. The 200 minutes allocation goes from January 6th 11am to February 6th 11am.&nbsp; On February 3rd at 11 am it will attempt to charge you for the next month. If you used up your minutes before
 February 6th, your balance will remain at 0 minutes. On February 6th, your renewal will release your 200 minutes at 11am to be used from February 6th 11am to March 6th 11am. Your renewal will attempt to bill on March 3rd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cancel you subscription, the subscription will still finish its cycle. Purchasing the same subscription over and over will not award you any new minutes. You might only double or triple bill yourself. Only purchasing a subscription of a different
 minute amount (like 60 minutes) before your subscription cycle ends (less than 30 days), will release new minutes for that new subscription. The 60 minute subscription will follow its own cycle and will renew in the same exact fashion, unless cancelled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most people do not understand:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The 3 day early renewal cycle to ensure payment covers the next month.</p>
<p>2. They cannot purchase the same subscription over and over again to get multiple minutes in &lt; 30 days (200 minutes X how many times they purchase it).</p>
<p>3. Minutes are never released early, even if you consume all the minutes from the prior month. The goal is to find a balance where you consume all your minutes near the end of the month, prior to renewal.</p>
<p>4. Cancelling a subscription early does not allow you to purchase the same subscription early. You have to wait until the original cycle ends.</p>
<p>Ex. Buying a 200 minute subscription for a month and consuming all the minutes in 1 day. Even if cancelled and repurchased, the balance will remain at 0 minutes until the next cycle begins at the beginning of the following month (&gt; 30 days). You will not
 get another 200 minutes on day 2 if you cancel and repurchase the subscription on day 2. These are time-based subscriptions not anytime minute bundles.</p>

too</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, dragging an .eml attachment still works.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, for a workaround you could drag your .eml file into a WLMail folder, then use Forward as attachment and then drag that to an IE window.</p>
<p>BTW I have no intention of reporting this.&nbsp; I would be too afraid that the "fix" would be to completely remove this very useful, albeit quirky, functionality.</p>
<p>While using ProcMon to try to understand what was going on I noticed that the .eml file always gets a NTFS Alternate Datastream immediately attached to it by some service.&nbsp; So if that is what is doing it, perhaps you could also work around this by disabling
 whatever that service is (just stopping it probably would not be enough) after deleting the NTFS Alternate Datastream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That I managed to do but with difficulty.&nbsp; I haven't tried the ultimate experiment yet.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that we can use&nbsp; dir/r&nbsp; to list&nbsp; Alternate
 Datastream files.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all I know that Alternate Datastream is necessary and what makes the mshtml: protocol prefix be used.&nbsp; But it is strange IMO that the final Address bar contents are different for each case.&nbsp; Another thing I noticed and tried experimenting
 with is that that&nbsp; file://&nbsp; protocol address syntax (e.g. escaping special characters) might be needed (or other naming quirks employed--such as spaces being converted to underscores).&nbsp; But I reduced my testing down to this case&nbsp; C:\WTH.eml&nbsp;&nbsp; and it still
 happened.</p>

My comments about that thread would have me banned from every forum on the Internet, and I wish there were a&nbsp;guaranteed way of bringing it to the attention of someone who matters, like Chris Jones.&nbsp;I wonder why I hadn't seen it before. There are several issues
 at stake in it, of which the failure to display .eml files in an IE window play only a transient part.
</p>
<p>The first issue - images but no text - is presumably the same problem as <a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/thread.aspx?threadid=88833346-ac18-4cf9-9cf8-5cbc096dafda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this one</a>, which I'm sorry to have to admit I've been neglecting. The reason for my neglect is that the sample files that the OP provided opened as expected with text and all when I tried to reproduce the fault. Then the next time I tried dragging one to
 a blank IE window, the problem that prompted this thread reared its head. So I had difficulty formulating a plea for help in an IE forum, because I couldn't produce the evidence.</p>
<p>The second, that you've been trying to fathom - the infamous slideshow - has been around as long as Wave 4 with no sign of any resolution. I've bailed out and ignore the multitude of threads about it.</p>
<p>Back to the case in point. <br />
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>the .eml file always gets a NTFS Alternate Datastream</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the indexer at work. There are two ADSs (at least), OEStandardProperties and OECustomProperties. I think the standard ones are, well,&nbsp;standard ones (<em>filename</em>,
<em>size</em>, <em>datecreated, owner&nbsp;</em>etc), while the custom ones are the mail-specific properties like
<em>from</em>, <em>to</em>, <em>date</em>, <em>subject.&nbsp;</em>Having them makes it possible to show those properties in an Explorer details view, to display them in an Explorer preview and to search for them. I can't imagine the ADSs&nbsp;having any influence on
 IE's ability to display the file. It's also surprising that the Explorer preview (powered by the inbuilt W7 WinMail preview handler using mshtml.dll where appropriate) still works,&nbsp;even though IE has stopped being able to 'preview' .eml files.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;<br />
</em></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>I have zeroes for those in all zones</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise. 0 (0x00) means off, 0x03 means on and 0x01 means prompt. I changed mine to 1 for the
<em>Computer*</em>[1]<em> </em>zone (zone 0, the one I'm in when I drag a local file to an IE window), but I didn't get any prompt, regardless of whether WLMail was operating in
<em>Restricted </em>or <em>Internet</em>.&nbsp;I've posted on Eric Lawrence's blog - but the last time I asked him an awkward question, he didn't answer. Let's see what happens this time.</p>
<p>[1] <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic&nbsp;IE9</a> shows me the zone and whether protection is on or off, as well as the good old progress bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; I only meant to use it as an example of the new drag and drop symptom.</p>
<p>But, since you mention it, I think the common factor in all of the examples I have seen so far is&nbsp; Office Word.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my particular case (which will have to remain private) there was even VML involved which I will speculate could have broken various parsers
 used by both WLMail and IE in implementing these features.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am waiting for Tom to get back from his fishing trip to mention that idea in that thread.&nbsp; Tom is not the OP but seems keener to try things for me.</p>
<p>Also, that first E-mail example of yours (SRX June 11) gives the worst symptoms of all, e.g. Ctrl-F2 shows nothing, opening it from WE in IE9 shows nothing but strangely that doesn't cause any further error symptom.&nbsp; OTOH using my proposed workaround--using
 forward as attachment and dragging the attachment to IE fails?&nbsp;&nbsp;It also loops when I try to use Dev Tools to change to Quirks mode.&nbsp; ICIM I don't have any Office products installed on this partition.&nbsp;&nbsp;More significantly I suspect, Ctrl-F3 shows that it isn't
 even really HTML--more like a&nbsp;fragment of a proper HTML file, so perhaps you should let that one go?&nbsp; GIGO?</p>

Odd. I tried checking two copies of a message, one dragged from WLMail into a doc folder, the other forwarded as attachment, then copied from the cache to the same doc folder. One would open in IE, the other wouldn't. An fc /b on them showed no difference,
 but then that ignores the ADS, no? The only immediately discernible difference was the security warning on the properties sheet (<em>This file came from another computer...</em>) of the one that had been forwarded. Unblock the file, and IE9 turns up its nose.
 This must be the Zone ADS you're talking about.&nbsp;<br />

None at all. <br />

Yep. Although it seems reasonable for IE to treat .eml, .rss and .nws files in just the same way as .mht files (changing the extension has no effect either, by the way).<br />

Well, the zone/protection status message is certainly clickable just like it used to be. Were there others?</p>

<p>I'll keep up my sporadic investigation of the 'missing text' phenomenon. I'm also sure it has something to do with weirdnesses introduced by Word/Outlook. At one stage, I think I found that sticking a DOCTYPE declaration at the top of the HTML did help,
 but I made no notes and haven't yet rerun the experiment.</p>

Too bad that Unblock button is one-way.</p>
<p>So this proves that the symptom is caused by security/obscurity.</p>

 KB article I found which prove that there could be functional differences in this scenario due to IE9.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been meaning to try VPC to be able to compare IE9 with IE8 more readily.&nbsp;&nbsp; That might actually be a more practical way forward than trying to chase

Yes but most of them didn't have any icons.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the outstanding bug/deficiency which I suspect&nbsp;could have been&nbsp;what made the entire feature be dropped.</p>

            <p>You have a Document stuck in the Print Que and Printer is stuck pause.&nbsp;</p>

(this is&nbsp;<span>what it should normally look like)<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>If the Green button shows Resume and a right pointed Arrowhead, then:<br />
a) See if there are any Jobs showing in the Que<br />
b) If so delete them all.<br />
c) The click on button so that it shows Pause and the <strong>II</strong> in center.&nbsp;<strong><br />
<br />
</strong></span></li><li><span>Now Close Que and Printer &amp; Scanner Preference.&nbsp;<br />

</span></li><li><span>Now try to print your document.</span></li></ol>
<p>The screen shots are based on on my Printer. The look and feel of the Printer/Scanner and que will look different between different Printers and different Brands of Printers.</p>

            <p>John I am afraid it not just HP. Almost all the Major companies including&nbsp;<span>Microsoft are suffering the same Fate.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Its not so much Financial Problems. It is that companies rather than catering to their customers like they use to do and are supposed to do. Are catering to Board of Directors and Corporate office Officials to put more Jingle their pockets. Companies
 no longer care whether the burn their bridges with customers, or not. It seems to be Make as much profit as fast as you can. Go out in Blaze of Glory and start over again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Look at </span><span>Microsoft for example: &nbsp;Instead of having top notch Support Personnel that have actually worked with the Product inside and out. Now they hire third world Contractors that don't even know how to speak proper English, or Spanish,
 or French or whatever. They give them scripts to read from. If none of the scripted answers work then they are told to pass the buck and let someone else, that doesn't know
</span>either, try. It keeps getting escalated to the point where the customer says to heck with it. &nbsp;(Or Stronger Language.) Then quits using the product vowing never to return.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I am a Mac user I hate to say it "<strong>SO FAR</strong>" Apple is the only one to buck the trend They still have top notch tech support and you can even purchase with price of your computer additional 1-3 years of Phone support. I am not saying
 it will last forever, and They might start doing the same as&nbsp;<span>Microsoft in six months. &nbsp;That one reason Apple has such a loyal following. Even if product cost more. If you can get good service. Then the customers will pay if they are aware it takes money
 to provide support. And the BOD and Corporate don't get too greedy.</span></p>

 right clicking and selecting Save Target As.<br />
<br />
The only time Windows Mobile asks you to Save a file is when it doesn't recognize it, such as an unplayable .avi or .mpg (this is my second question, where to get plugins such as those and .avc files too for Windows Media Player Mobile, I've searched the web
 and haven't found much, why is Microsoft not trying to make a fortune with this as a plug-in on their site?).&nbsp; And so what good is saving a file that unusable to the system, this is a huge flaw with Windows Mobile in my opinion.<br />
<br />
When you come to a file that is playable in Windows Media Player Mobile, there is no way to choose Save Target or Save&nbsp; As, all you can do is click on it and then it starts putting machine code on the webpage, but will not automatically send this jargon to
 Media Player to play the damn thing.&nbsp; Instead you have to Stop the loading of this ***, highlight the web address and copy it, then manually (ctrl-v, guessed this myself) paste it into Windows Media Player, play URL dialog box.&nbsp; Then the worst thing happens,
 instead of downloading and playing it, Windows Media Player streams it and depending on your system's processor, this turns into a daunting task for it and the video is played horribly, displaying 1 frame for every 1000 or something like this.&nbsp; If the bloody
 thing would just let you save it to it's memory it would play just fine, but no that's too easy!<br />
<br />
I thought this issue would be resolved for sure in Windows Mobile 6, but as usual, it is just another flashy upgrade from Microsoft that fixes no problems.&nbsp; The system has sped up quite a bit from the Mobile 5, but still this glaring problem exists.&nbsp; I'm sure
 I just need some type of download manager, but again where do I find it?&nbsp; Microsoft is no help in this department...<br />
<br />
What also upsets me is that there is no automatic time updating to the OS, come on, just about every other device with a clock these days has automatic update and my phone has multiple ways of connecting to the internet, yet no auto time updater!&nbsp; That is just
 sad...<br />

            The save as feature is indeed not available. This is a great suggestion though. Regarding your issue playing avi and mpg files, I recommend TCPMP which you can download for free at http://picard.exceed.hu/tcpmp/

            Thanks I'll try that out.<br />
<br />
To not include Save As has to be the biggest Windows blunder ever!&nbsp; I mean how long has Windows Mobile / CE been around and nobody thought of this?&nbsp; You have downloadable files and you have memory, this equals the option of saving a file!&nbsp; It almost seems like
 some sort of sick copy protection of internet files or something?<br />
<br />
Do you think it is because people are so used to downloading things on their desktop and then syncing files over to their devices?&nbsp; Or maybe because there hasn't been substantial memory sizes on these devices until the last couple of years?&nbsp; I don't get why
 I'm struggling with this...<br />
<br />
Maybe if there was a way to disassociate files from Media Player, then it would allow the save as option because it doesn't recognize the file type, like it does currently on my device when encountering .avi and .mpg.<br />
<br />
Maybe the Opera web browser for Mobile will include this?&nbsp; Or a different browser?<br />

            Well, tried out Opera, and same issues, this is deeper in Mobile than the browser and must be fixed, if anybody has a way of notifying someone at Microsoft, please do, because this is an unbelievable crippling of software...<br />

<h2>            How to get mp3s as ringtones on x3-02</h2>
                    
<p>I have just bought a nokia x3-02 and have put a few mp3s onto the phone via bluetooth transfer (I'm on a mac and as far as i can see it's the easiest way to transfer stuff) but cannot see an option anywhere to assign songs as ringtones. It's driving me crazy!
 Please help. Thanks</p>

            You can also hold your finger on the mp3 file and a list of options related to the file will appear, you can then set it as a ringtone.<br />
<br />
This works also on all the other types of items (i.e. contacts...), in fact, this is how we open the item related menu on this touch-screen device.<br />
<br />
I think you must read the user's manual, all this is mentioned in there ;)

<p>i initially thought i couldnt set songs to my ringtone as well but heres what i did and maybe this will help you. go into settings &gt; profiles &gt; general &gt; personalise &gt; ringing tone:&nbsp; &gt; open gallery.&nbsp; Now at this point my music files folder says that it has
 zero files but if you scroll up to the top and click on "phone card"&nbsp; then scroll all the way down my music was in some generic folders at the end . From here it allowed me to set the songs as ringtones.</p>

<h3> prateekjindal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 5310 problem</h2>
                    I bought Nokia 5310 – express music phone on 1st December 2007 and thanks to superb quality that nokia is committed to provide that I was facing problems from the third day of purchase.<br />
IMEI number of my phone is : [IMEI removed] and it was shipped with Symbian Version 3.60 RM-303 dated 13th September 2007.<br />
Description of the problem: In my handset the Keypad light does not work properly. It works on its own will, that means it’s very often that keypad lights won’t work.<br />
When I reported the same problem on you website I received a mail from Nokia Care asking for my contact address and contact number.<br />
Then I received a call from another Nokia Care agent who said that he is calling from nokia and told that I may visit a Nokia Care centre in “Jayanagar 3rd Block (Bangalore)”. As there is a person named mr Sunil who can look into the problem. When I ask what
 can be the possible cause of the problem he said that it might require a software upgrade.<br />
Next week i.e. on 22nd December 2007 I went to jayanagar 3rd Block. I found one Nokia care centre but those guys told me that Mr Sunil Sits in Jayanager 4th Block. Anyhow I reported the same problem to them and they said they can upgrade the software but to
 diagnose the problem fully I need to leave my handset there. I told them to upgrade the software. Thanks to them, they did not upgraded the software rather reinstalled the same version again. So the problem still persists. After seeing this unprofessional
 behavior I decided to leave the place with my handset and went straight to Jayanagar 4th Block where Mr. Sunil sits.<br />
After reaching there the guy told me that they needed to check, I asked them to at least diagnose the problem and let me know. They opened the set and after diagnosing for half an hour told me that it has some hardware problem and they need 15-20 days to rectify
 the problem. When I asked them to return the handset they returned it but now its USB cover was not getting locked properly, looking carefully I found that they have not closed the handset properly. I asked them to open it and close again. They did the same
 but to my astonishment the problem was still there.<br />
Now please let me know what should I do. After reporting this problem to you all I got was one more problem.<br />
This is the last time I’m writing this mail and if you can not suggest a proper way then I will be forced to take a legal action by next week. One more thing I want to know is that on what basis do you allow a person to open up a NOKIA CARE centre. People who
 are not having adequate hardware and software and those who can not even close a handsets are working in NOKIA CARE centres.<br />
Now who is responsible for all these miseries I’m facing just because of your incompetency. Please don’t take this lightly I’m not going to leave this issue unattended.<br />
Prateek<br />
<br />

Moderator note: names of Nokia Care staff removed. We have no onjection to you recounting your experiences with Nokia Care, but please do not publish names of the staff to whom you have spoken.<br />

            Uh..Mr. Prateek...I wud like u 2 chek out somethin in ur 5310 ...I really dunno whether u wud've realised it or not, but did u ever know dat ur fone come wid a built-in lite sensor(its a small hole just beside de hole where u hear de other person speakin
 thru) &amp; de keypad light generally switches off wen de sensor detects enough ambient lightin &amp; comes immediately bak on wen de sensor detects dat dere's not enough ambient lightin visible enough 2 c ur keypad....<br />
<br />
Another thing Mr.Prateek, i really won't say dat de guys at nokia care r all dat worth it for posh shops they're put in, but one thing i shud tell ya they did rite...&amp; dat was to put de same firmware version of v3.60 in ur mob.....<br />
<br />
Wen u bot de fone originally, it must've come up wid a corrupted version of firmware v3.60....De guys at nokia care have de version of de same v3.60 wich is UNcorrupted as well as wich is better dan v3.63(wich was spposed 2 b de latest firmware update , but
 still had Bugs)<br />
<br />
Instead of runnin &amp; callin nokia care, i think u shud've tried to figure out dese facts 4 urself frm de numerous forums available on de net just 4 de nokia 5310....If u ever c reply, do lemme know if wat i told ya is workin or not...

I bought Nokia 5310 – express music phone on 1st December 2007 and thanks to superb quality that nokia is committed to provide that I was facing problems from the third day of purchase.<br />
IMEI number of my phone is : [IMEI removed] and it was shipped with Symbian Version 3.60 RM-303 dated 13th September 2007.<br />
Description of the problem: In my handset the Keypad light does not work properly. It works on its own will, that means it’s very often that keypad lights won’t work.<br />
When I reported the same problem on you website I received a mail from Nokia Care asking for my contact address and contact number.<br />
Then I received a call from another Nokia Care agent who said that he is calling from nokia and told that I may visit a Nokia Care centre in “Jayanagar 3rd Block (Bangalore)”. As there is a person named mr Sunil who can look into the problem. When I ask what
 can be the possible cause of the problem he said that it might require a software upgrade.<br />
Next week i.e. on 22nd December 2007 I went to jayanagar 3rd Block. I found one Nokia care centre but those guys told me that Mr Sunil Sits in Jayanager 4th Block. Anyhow I reported the same problem to them and they said they can upgrade the software but to
 diagnose the problem fully I need to leave my handset there. I told them to upgrade the software. Thanks to them, they did not upgraded the software rather reinstalled the same version again. So the problem still persists. After seeing this unprofessional
 behavior I decided to leave the place with my handset and went straight to Jayanagar 4th Block where Mr. Sunil sits.<br />
After reaching there the guy told me that they needed to check, I asked them to at least diagnose the problem and let me know. They opened the set and after diagnosing for half an hour told me that it has some hardware problem and they need 15-20 days to rectify
 the problem. When I asked them to return the handset they returned it but now its USB cover was not getting locked properly, looking carefully I found that they have not closed the handset properly. I asked them to open it and close again. They did the same
 but to my astonishment the problem was still there.<br />
Now please let me know what should I do. After reporting this problem to you all I got was one more problem.<br />
This is the last time I’m writing this mail and if you can not suggest a proper way then I will be forced to take a legal action by next week. One more thing I want to know is that on what basis do you allow a person to open up a NOKIA CARE centre. People who
 are not having adequate hardware and software and those who can not even close a handsets are working in NOKIA CARE centres.<br />
Now who is responsible for all these miseries I’m facing just because of your incompetency. Please don’t take this lightly I’m not going to leave this issue unattended.<br />
Prateek<br />

Hello Mr. Moderator,<br />
<br />
You have very proudly written that you have removed the names of Nokia Support Staff. Please also write what action have you taken for the same so that it can add some value to this forum.<br />
By the way i am a user of NOKIA 5310. And have problems with it i.e. it hangs a lot, it switches off by itself etc..<br />
I hope NOKIA has done all the required testings of the phone before launching it. The quality of the NOKIA products is degrading man. Please look into it.<br />
<br />
Will apprecite a quict solution from NOKIA regarding issues with NOKIA 5310.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            Bought my wife's phone December 2007. Microphone stopped working January 2008. For two months, only update is that "the unit is still being worked in their backroom". It's now April, finally got news yesterday that Nokia would be replacing the whole board
 and only the casing would be retained. I told them, why not replace the phone since only the casing would be retained. They said they don't do that. I told them that I would be expecting the phone to be fixed in two months since I am very confident of Nokia's
 service hehe.<br />
<br />
Nokia phones are not the only things losing quality, their customer service and support also.

            This is a user to user support forum. Please go through the forum to see if there are threads that describes your problem. Else wait for someone to respond to your question.<br />
<br />
If you are in a hurry please take the phone to Nokia care.Mods remove e-mail IDs and those posts, information which they feel is against forum regulations. Hope you understand.<br />

            We are provided with information about bad service experience at Nokia Service Centres in Bangalore. Unfortunately some relevant information was edited by the "moderator".<br />
<br />
It is very important for users to know which Nokia Service Centre is lame (or should I say a lemon). It is also important for her/him to know which<br />
"experts" to avoid from past experience of other users.<br />
<br />
In fact "Better Business Bureau" in several countries do exactly that. So a moderator should either take the responsibility of correcting the erring service provider, or else let us know freely and fairly the information.<br />
<br />
Censoring the information without any accountability is not very responsible.<br />

<p>Hi Prateek</p>
<p>Exactly the same thing I too experienced buying this renowned brand. My 5310's software corrupted, as suggested by every intellect I visited NOKIA CARE. Those people first denied but later accepted to upgrade the same, promising to return my hand set after
 3 days. Me lucky fellow got back my phone with CHANGED lcd which was discovered by other special guys of another NOKIA CARE. The both were unable to upgrade the version. The last centre changed lcd, charging a handsome amount updated the version and CORRUPTING
 the IMEI. Now my phone is paralysed as it suddenly shut down after every 2-3 minutes........ All thanks to NOKIA CARES</p>

<p>There are several C2-xx device models (C2-00, C2-01, C2-02, C2-03, C2-06... ) - not sure which of those you have, but indeed, as far as I recall none of them supports video streaming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are a few Youtube downloader apps available in Nokia Store (which would allow downloading some of the mobile compatible videos from Youtube to the phone, after which the video could be played locally), but as I don't &nbsp;have much experience from using
 them, can't recomment &nbsp;any specific app.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> dalethorngate  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove a message w&#47;too large attachment from Outlook Outbox&#63;</h2>
                    When creating message to send to colleague I attached a document with pictures that was too large 77000+KBs. It is stuck in my outbox. I am unable to retrieve the message or attachment to delete it. Every time I send another message, my computer tries
 to resend the original message until the limit is reached and then the new message will go around it. If I shut down the Outlook program before the process is finished then both messages are stalled.
