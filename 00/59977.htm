<h2>            Why am I not getting &#34;Feature update to Windows 10, version 1809&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Now I am using Windows 10 version 1803 and when I am checking for updates (in both metered connection and not metered connection) it says, "You're up to date", but no "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1809". Why?<br />
I am using ESET Smart Security as antivirus. Is that an issue?</p>

            Hi Md,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1809 update is being rolled out to 100s of millions of computers worldwide. Your number has just not come. So, no worry about your computer.
<br />
<br />You can do it immediately if you want it. Follow the below process.
<br />
<br />A. Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Uninstall any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can install it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Press Update Now. 
<br />
<br />If update now doesn't work - You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            At the very first splash screen at boot, press the key to change your BIOS settings.&nbsp; Once in the settings screen, look for a "boot order" setting.&nbsp; Check the boot order list to see if it contains a USB option.&nbsp; Older machines do not have BIOS settings
 for USB boot and simply do not support it.&nbsp; If you do see a USB option,&nbsp; then make sure it is higher in the boot order than your hard drive.&nbsp; If you don't see it, then you're out-of-luck unless your motherboard manufacturer has a BIOS update that does support
 it.<br />
<br />
I am assuming that you have a bootable USB drive.<br />

<h3> oz3050  say:</h3>
<h2>            Personal setting not saving &#40;default browsers, folder options...&#41;</h2>
                    Basically anything that I customize with my user account won't save. Default browser and email program all reset when the program exits. If I open FireFox and hit "make this my default browser". When I close the program and restart it it'll ask me again.
 Same goes for Thunderbird and IE. Taskbar items won't stayed pinned to the start bar after I shut down or log out. Folder options such as "hide extensions for know items" won't work at all. I uncheck it, hit apply and nothing happens. If I close the folder
 options window and reopen it, the box is still checked. If I create a new user everything seems to work fine. Is there a quick way to copy all my settings from one user to another? I tried copying everything in the USERNAME folder to the other USERNAME folder
 but not everything made it over, e.g. Thunderbird accounts and FireFox settings. This just started sunday morning after an update was installed when I shutdown late saturday night (technically early sunday morning).

            That is happening because of the corrupt user account. Create a new user account and it should fix the problem for you. copy all the required data from the old user account to the new one, as settings are not getting saved, hence they are required....;)<br />

Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro.

            Hi again.  
<br />
<br />I don't think it looks that bad from what you're showing.  What would make it bad if it was pegging out at 100%.  Unless it does that then it's using resources that are meant to be used.
<br />
<br />But this doesn't mean it's still not good to go over your install, because What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install.  So proceed with the steps I gave because they will find and fix any problems, optimize your install, and should resolve any unnecessary resource usage.

<h2>            Taalverandering game als ik deze wil kopen via xbox.com</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>Ik wil Lego Star Wars TCS kopen. Dit is een XBOX 360 game die backwards compatible is voor XBOX One. Ik kan deze game niet kopen via de Store op mijn XONE, enkel via de online store. Als ik de game wil kopen is de pop-up waarin ik mijn betaling moet bevestigen
 veranderd naar het Frans, terwijl de site in het Nederlands staat. Ook de titel van de game staat nu in het Frans.</p>
<p>Mijn vraag is: is de game dan ook in het Frans? Ik heb al met support gechat, maar ze hebben geen antwoord gegeven. (Mijn achievements zijn ook in het Frans, ik ben dus niet de enige)</p>
<p>Groeten,</p>
<p>Indy</p>

<p>However, any further questions should be directed to either phone support or you could try contacting the PET regarding the enforcement action at the following link.</p>

<p>Have you tried completely hard reseting your xbox? Simply turning off is actually only putting it into standby. Hold the power button for about 5 seconds (until it powers off) then turn it back on. When you turn it on you should see a green Xbox One screen.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            This is a wonderful compilation of Skype issues. 
<br />
<br />I would like to make a small request to you. Since Skype engineers don't keep a watch on the forum post, can you post this to Skype engineers. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers like below - 
<br />
<br />Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/</a>

                    I have a surface pro that has a broken screen. &nbsp;I would like to send in for repair/replace but have a question regarding the replacement unit. &nbsp;If they send a replacement unit - MS states that the unit will be "replaced with a similar device". &nbsp;My question
 is - will this similar device meet or beat current specs of the damaged unit that I will send in?

Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums. <br />

<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to enable the built in administrator account on Windows 8</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You need to run the command from an elevated command prompt. To do that you need to do the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press the Windows key to get into the Metro interface if you are not already there.</span>
</li><li><span>Enter <strong>cmd</strong> and right-click on the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> result that should appear.</span>
</li><li><span>This opens a list of options at the bottom. Select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> there.</span>
</li><li><span>Accept the UAC prompt</span> </li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Enter the following command to enable the hidden administrator account: <strong>
<span>net user administrator /active:yes</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you ever want to disable the account follow the same instructions, but run the following command instead:
<strong><span>net user administrator /active:no</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have enabled the account, you will see it listed in the user accounts control panel applet. Note that the account has not assigned a password to it, and that you should consider setting one to improve account security.</span></p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi Richard,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>If the Windows Update database is corrupted.</span></li><li><span>If the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) service does not receive a content link header.</span></li><li><span>If a required system file is registered incorrectly.</span></li><li><span>If Windows Installer encountered an error.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows security .dll files are registered incorrectly</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What are steps you have tried apart from running Windows Update troubleshooter?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to follow the methods mentioned below and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong><strong>
</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to manually reset the Windows Updates Components </p>
<p>a) Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
<p>b) Type <strong>CMD</strong> in <strong>search bar</strong>.</p>
<p>c) Right click on Command prompt and select <strong>Run in as administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>d) Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</p>
<p><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>net stop cryptSvc</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>net stop bits</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>net stop msiserver</strong></p>
<p>f) Now rename the <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> and <strong>Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the
<strong>ENTER </strong>key after you type each command.</p>
<p><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></p>
<p><strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</strong></p>
<p>g) Now, let’s restart the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</p>
<p><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></p>
<p><strong>net start cryptSvc</strong></p>
<p><strong>net start bits </strong></p>
<p><strong>net start msiserver</strong></p>
<p>h) Type <strong>Exit </strong>in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> to close it.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Now you may try running the Windows Updates and check if the above steps resolve the issue.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
I would suggest you to temporarily disable antivirus program installed on your computer and then try to install the updates. Refer the following link.<br />

<strong><span>NOTE</span></strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 2:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

    <title>UAC dims the display When Asked for Administrator Privileges - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dariuskay  say:</h3>
<h2>            UAC dims the display When Asked for Administrator Privileges</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a weird persistent issue which my Microsoft helper was unable to solve. Whenever I'm prompted for permission to run as administrator, I'm getting a dark screen with the sound of asking for administrator permissions, from which I can't figure out
 how to exit without ctrl-alt-delete; then the UAC prompt appears briefly but disappears. Previous recommendations have included an sfc but I can't run an sfc without administrator privileges, which don't show up. I created another user with administrator privileges
 (my chat helper's recommendation) but the same problem occurs for that user as well. Does anyone know what I can do at this point??</p>

    <title>Compensation for Xbox One hardware failure.....&#36;5. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shorday  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compensation for Xbox One hardware failure.....&#36;5.</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased my Xbox One as a Christmas present for myself, which means&nbsp;I bought it in December 2013. After a few months, my Xbox One decided it would like to pick and choose when and if it would like to read a disk, either game or DVD.&nbsp; If I was persistent
 however, and inserted and ejected the disk over and over again, it would eventually work however, so I decided to tough it out, as I didn't want to be without my Xbox.&nbsp; Now, after a little over 6 months of use, my Xbox One has almost flat-out refused to read
 any disks at all.&nbsp; Bear in mind that this is a $500 product that had a shorter lifespan than a blender bought at a dollar store.&nbsp; So I have decided to bite the bullet, and send in my Xbox One to be replaced.&nbsp; The estimated timeline is 2-3 weeks, which means
 this is a huge inconvenience.&nbsp; Not to mention when they send me a new unit, I will have to re-install every single thing I've installed over the last 6 months (can't wait).&nbsp; Understandably then, I called Xbox Support and inquired as to what sort of compensation
 I would be receiving for Microsoft's failure to build a product that could last longer than 6 months.&nbsp; The answer?&nbsp; 1-month of Xbox Live.&nbsp; A 1-year Xbox Live Gold subscription retails for $60, which means they feel that 5 bleeping dollars in credit makes up
 for their product's failure, as well as the gross inconvenience associated with it.&nbsp; The lady that I talked to on the phone said that was all she was capable of giving me.&nbsp; When I asked who I could talk to that would be able to do something more, she said
 to post on the Xbox.com forums, and that perhaps someone from Xbox's team would contact me.&nbsp; I asked her to instead provide me with a contact number for whoever would be contacting me regarding my post, and she informed me that they do not have a contact number,
 which I was confused by.&nbsp; I asked how she would contact them if she needed to, and she said email.&nbsp; So apparently there are people in the Microsoft organization who do not have a phone on their desk.&nbsp; Astounding.&nbsp; Seeing as I was getting nowhere, I thanked
 her for doing nothing for me and hung up.&nbsp; So here it is, mysterious Microsoft employees living in a pre-Alexander Graham Bell universe, here is my post on your forum.</p>
<p>Let the record show, I have owned an Xbox, Xbox 360, and now an Xbox One.&nbsp; I have had an Xbox Live Gold account for seven years, and have purchased many Microsoft games. (Long live Halo).&nbsp; So I ask again, is 5 dollars really all you can do to compensate
 me?</p>

<p>You should be under warranty still until 2015 sometime. &nbsp;Get it replaced/repaired and you should be all set. &nbsp;My Xbox does that too, but I think it's a software problem instead of a hardware issue. &nbsp;I could be wrong, however.</p>

<p>I guess given the fact that you opted to buy a brand new and untested game system, thus choosing to become a first adopter of the system in question, I would be forced to ask why you feel, given all the others out there having similar issues, that you should
 receive any kind of compensation at all? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been a first adopter for five out the last six major console releases (PS2, Xbox, Xbox 360, PS3, and Xbox One) and every single time I went into knowing that it's a new system and that there is going to be issues and in choosing to buy it early I was
 choosing to bear that burden. &nbsp;Where is my compensation for the 8 months of time in the first year I was without my PS2 for the 6 times I had to swap it out? &nbsp;The three times for the original Xbox? &nbsp;2 for the 360? &nbsp;4 times for the PS3? &nbsp;2 times for the Xbox
 One? &nbsp;You're having to swap yours out this one time, what is it you feel they owe you? &nbsp;$10, $15, $20? &nbsp;What's the going rate for your "inconvenience"? &nbsp;And then why haven't I received 10x as much for mine?</p>
<p>I hope I've proven my point by now. &nbsp;The $5 you were offered were actually above and beyond what their policy allows. &nbsp;That you found someone at all that was willing to do anything for you is a good thing. &nbsp;I'm sorry you are far to entitled to see that.
 &nbsp;So let me save you a lot of time and frustration here: &nbsp;You aren't going to receive any compensation. &nbsp;At all. &nbsp;The more you rally against it, and the ruder you become, the less likely they are to do anything for you. &nbsp;The support people you interact with
 are just people, and the more you attack them, the less they are likely they are want to bend policy to help you.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor, get it swapped out, get into a new console, enjoy your time playing. &nbsp;You aren't due anything other than that.</p>

<p>Well bigbenx88, how about we try to change the industry a bit. Rather than just accepting the release of untested products we should be holding these billion dollar companies to a higher standard. You really think it would cost them money to give out a years
 sub? Which I think would be more than fair. It also isn't unheard of for companies compensating you for purchasing a product that breaks. Blizzard is a great example of a company that compensates it's customers, whenever they have unexpected down time for
 even a day on WoW they give everyone a week for free. Also when I used to play WoW my account got hacked, they went above and beyond by retrieving all the items that were lost, gave me about double the gold that I had, and also gave me a month sub for free.
 That was for a product that was nowhere near $500.</p>
<p>Basically if more companies were encouraged to compensate customers for their failures they might realize that is it cheaper to release better / more polished products. Especially since the Xbox not reading discs was also an issue on the 360.</p>
<p>So instead of saying "Oh, well I never got compensated for product failures I had to deal with" Maybe you should have been demanding compensation from these companies and encouraging them to release a higher quality product. We all know they have the money
 to do it.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is in any manufacturing activity parts are bought from a multitude of venders, and given the millions of units sold and probably a few more millions manufactured there are bound to be failures of certain components. While yes a Utopia
 would be awesome, however that's not going to happen on this planet, I would hope that you would extend some grace. Yes, I understand you spent a lot of money for the XB1, but do you not make mistakes at your job for which you get paid? I make a lot of mistakes
 everyday and I'm very thankful for the grace my family, friends, coworkers, managers and strangers extend me each and every day. &nbsp;Everyone makes mistakes, the only difference is one mistake on MS's part or their component manufacturers part results in world
 wide anger. I really like the Microsoft brand and especially the changes they've made in their service and feedback mechanisms, it proves to me they are still working hard to be a great company and to lower the walls between the client (us) and the employees
 at MS. &nbsp;I feel that before you judge someone or a company it's best to understand them. Understand their goal which is to stay profitable so they can continue to support their products, the 1000's if not millions of decisions that go into place to release
 such a product. But maybe you do. Those are the things I try to remind myself of before I get mad about mistakes being made. Am I perfect? No, could I do a better job then them? No. Do I have some ideas on how it could be better, if yes provide detailed plans
 or suggestions along with encouragement for the things they do great already. Not saying that'll get you what you want but that's how I'd like to receive constructive criticism. My 2¢.</p>

<p>I think Liv hit the nail on the head there. &nbsp;It's not about just throwing my arms up in the air and saying "oh well", it's about understanding there is going to be issues. &nbsp;And it was a tested product, they sent out 100,000 beta consoles before the system
 was released and spent 18 months tweaking it. &nbsp;There comes a point where the controlled confines of a beta test are just not enough, it takes a release to really test the system. &nbsp;What matters is how the company responds when something goes wrong. &nbsp;That's
 why they offer a 1 year warranty, why they pay for the shipping, why they pay the repair costs and exchange costs. &nbsp;One RO from start to finish can cost the company upwards of $100 in shipping, parts, and labor. &nbsp;And lets not forget, MS isn't seeing $500/$400
 for every system sold. &nbsp;Their costs to vendors is roughly half that. &nbsp;So when you set up a RO for a repair or exchange, they're losing nearly half their profits right there.</p>
<p>I think the real problem here is the systemic problem with society today. &nbsp;People as a whole are over entitled. &nbsp;They think the that just because they buy something they are entitled to more than they're given. &nbsp;When you buy an Xbox you buy the system, it's
 parts, and the warranty that comes with it. &nbsp;You agree to those terms. &nbsp;Whining for more is just sad.</p>

<p>to me its not about compensation but more about customer service and how they handle the problem.</p>
<p>Some companies just don't care once they have sold the product.</p>
<p>To be honest Microsoft for me are quite good when dealing with system faults !!!! unlike some companies I shal not name.</p>
<p>The only time compensation should come in to it is if that product is not replaced or fixed within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>In the UK when you buy a product from a retailer they are supposed to deal with any problems for the first 12 months, they deal with manufacturer etc the problem with most people is trying to get the retailer to live up to the obligation they owe you and
 under government rules and consumer rights act etc they are to support that product within its 12 month warranty.</p>
<p>anyway getting away from the OP.</p>
<p>Compensation should only be given when</p>
<p>1) that product has caused physical injury or damage to you self or living area.</p>
<p>2) When reasonable time for fixing or replacement has not been met .</p>
<p>Yes we would love to live in a utopia of everything working perfectly but it doesn't happen !!! remember we are all human and mistakes can be made.</p>

    <title>Red Dead Redemption Compliments of the house&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Red Dead Redemption Compliments of the house&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;After deciding to create a new save for RDR i noticed i had golden guns, war horse and the deadly assassin outfit DLC's installed when i never bought them from the marketplace. &nbsp;I noticed also that at the main menu for RDR i clicked on installed DLC and
 it showed all the dlc i had along with "Compliments of the house" named dlc along with the golden guns etc.. i never purchased any of these nor frankly do i want them, now the problem is i cannot deactivate the golden guns or the war horse dlc because it doesn't
 show up in my HDD anywhere. Doesn anyone know whats going on? is this some kind of glitch? and how can i deactivate these DLC's.</p>

<p>I think the DLC has been included in the 'Compliments of the house' dlc, which seems to be part of the latest update. You can toggle golden guns on/off in Options&gt;Config. Just use another deed if you don't like the war horse, it does have the best stats
 though.</p>
<p>Started playing RDR again recently as it's been a while, thought I'd treat myself to the Deadly Assassin outfit, War Horse and Golden guns with money that was leftover - only for it to become free DLC just days later - just my luck!</p>

<p>Yeah the golden guns on/off toggle didn't show up in my options until i actually purchased the golden guns DLC on the marketplace (even though Rockstar gave me the dlc)... $1 no big deal.. i didn't mind the outfit but the war horse and the golden guns were
 definitely immersion breaking especially when i first started the game from scratch. Thanks Rockstar..but no thanks?

<h2>            The new annoying password security BULL&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all you wonderful 360 gamer's,</p>
<p>&nbsp; So recently, our annoying, toe stepping, EYE SPYING MS mongers have added this new retarded password security confirmation code request to gain access to our 360 profiles WTF!!!</p>
<p>I can't take all the BS that MS keep trying to implement on us without even putting up any kind of vote for the community to have any say on!</p>
<p>MS are just getting stupid now, i mean this *** is just as bad as 24 HOUR DRM. That was swatted as fast as USAIN BOLT can run an 100 meter race. First, log-in with our 4 button combination as normal, then request a code. Then go on another device or computer,
 log-in to another e-mail to receive the code. (No doubt &nbsp;MS are spying on some how) Then to go back to your Xbox to in-put that 4 digit code to access your profile....... (FACE PALM) "I just hope that we don't have to do this every time we log-in or every
 bloody day!! &nbsp;MS just keep it nice and simple for us all. What happens e.g. someones PC or phone breaks. Then we don't have access to our e-mail or to receive a text or phone call to get that code. YOU GUYS JUST NEVER THINK DO YOU!!!</p>
<p>START TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE COMPLICATIONS THIS CAN CAUSE FOR YOU CUSTOMERS. NOT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS INTERNET ON THEIR PHONES, NEITHER CAN THEY GO BUY A NEW PC STRAIGHT AWAY!!!!</p>

<p>You only really have to do it once on each device, you can choose to have it remember that device.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And if you cant access the internet, then what are you doing trying to change your Xbox profile. And as for not having a PC, you can always go to like a library, your neighbors or friends, or WAIT!.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Of course, if your account was ever compromised, then you would be complaining about how there is NO security...MS just cant seem to win huh?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, why would MS need to "spy on you". You WILLINGLY GAVE THEM all your information already.....</p>

<p>One time only, well that is cool with me then as i said in my main post. So Mike it's not bad at all. "I hope i don't have to do it every time i log-in or every day."
</p>
<p>I haven't tried to change my xbox profile??? </p>
<p>If you &nbsp;read my forum post correctly, i wasn't speaking just about ME, BLUNTMAN1138 I was generally applying the topic to everyone. Not every area has a library available to access the net. Ok, friends/ neighbours maybe. Now i'm not being a tit here but
 what about people who are anti-social, (Issues with being able to talk to others. With how many xbox live players i'd say there are a fair few) which with all the arguments that i hear online is what, 60%+ of the 360 community. I am simply thinking of everyone
 and not just a single person. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also for giving all my information, that's a little over the top, they have an e-mail and password. That's it, no bank details, no identity description, nothing else.
</p>
<p>I am more than sure something has annoyed you before that other people would think, what are you even moaning about!!!</p>

<p>STOP protecting the way MS do things guys...i get sick of that...</p>
<p>Im with ya that Its totally nice if MS wants to give us more Security &nbsp;- I apreciate that alot -</p>
<p>but listen : Why the F.....amily did they ask for an Email earlier ?</p>
<p>It should be possible for MS to write some automatic informations to every Gold Member via Email so you dont sit surprised in front of your box when first time shows up &nbsp;that Email and Password Security &nbsp;thing...</p>
<p>Its all about the handling with the customers....</p>
<p>lack of appreciation imo.</p>

<p>If you keep ignoring the security proofs it WILL LOCK YOU OUT of your account. The sooner it gets done the better. The BIGGEST reason MS is doing this is for more security. They are trying to make sure that you are the only one that has access to your account.
 They don't want the same thing to happen to them like what happed with Sony. A quarter of accounts were hacked and person information (credit cards, etc.) were lost. With the proofs it is a one time thing on the console and not enter it in every time you log
 on.</p>

<p>you said they dont want to have hacked accounts.....im fine with that, but:</p>
<p>like i said before there was no information about that secure logIn....</p>
<p>who knows....maybe its hackers who just want you to sign in your Email and Passwords....</p>

<p>Jack Fuu,</p>
<p>From what I have heard they are only doing that with a certain number of Xbox accounts in a certain time per a certain time period. What number and time period I don't know. It is honestly no surprise that there are some in the community that it hasn't happened
 to yet.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b907e072-febf-4e69-a643-96479134ffe1" title="Roberto Di Lello">
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to Xbox forums support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You've pretty much gone through all the basic troubleshooting steps that we'd suggest / recommend.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Helpful link) <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/console-turns-off-unexpectedly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot Xbox One unexpectedly turning off</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you considered taking the Xbox back to the place of purchase to have it swapped out?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, that is what I would do if I was experiencing that issue with a console that I just purchased 7 days before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would&nbsp;be the quickest way to get&nbsp;that particular&nbsp;issue&nbsp;resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're still under warranty, I would suggest setting up a call back from Customer Support so they can create a console repair order for you.</p>

<p>thanks a lot for your reply. Sorry it was a typo error, of course if it fails after 7 days must go where was purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happened after month of use, and now I'm living in another country so its no so easy to go back where I purchase, at least for a few more month. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reset it, and I think at least my data were deleted because suddently it power off again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if this light blink or this behavior has some reason? for example power supply issues or mother issues or something else? because if its a HW issue I do not spend more time trying to troubleshoot. I cant find any light code as we have with the
 xbox 360.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the suggestion to the other thread is not to close in a hard way, and you can separate it as moderator. thanks anyway.</p>

<p>Hi Roberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for closing the other post, when they are old threads we were instructed to just lock them and the poster if needs help could make a new thread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your issue, you state you are using plug extensions. Is it possible to plug it directly into the power source? ie. wall outlet. With other devices like power strips, ext. cords etc. they can cause issues like this if the console is not getting the
 power needed through these. If you can try a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
offline update</a> in case this is a software issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these and let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<h2>            &#34;Location is not available&#34; Error</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; When I first booted my computer, it took a while longer to boot after my log in than normal. When the desktop finally came up, a message appeared indicating "Location is not available". In the message it indicated that it was looking for "C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop"
 and apparently could not find it. The desktop at that point was devoid of any icons except for the Recycle Bin and most of the Taskbar icons were missing. The Start Menu was not functional. I proceeded to do a hard reboot on the computer to see if the problem
 persisted. When it booted the second time and I logged in this time, it came up without a problem. I checked the "C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile" folder to see if a "Desktop" folder now existed there. It did not. I checked two other computers (one
 Windows 8.1 and the other Windows 10) and no "Desktop" subfolder exists on them either. Why did Windows 10 come up with that error? Can I expect that to occur again?</p>

            <p>&nbsp; Thanks for your reply. The problem has not reoccurred (yet). My system came up normally today as it has in the past 2 and 1/2 months. What concerns me is these strange types of issues that seem to be happening with Windows 10. One day it is fine, the next
 day it could become unusable. The problem with the disabled Start Menu button and associated disabled Taskbar items has plagued Windows 10 since its release and no fix for this has yet come down from Microsoft. I am delaying upgrading my Windows 8.1 system
 until I am satisfied that Window 10 has been stabilized.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; Sorry I had not replied to you. I did not expect any further response to this post. It is hard to keep track of all these posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; It is unfortunate that your wife lost those pictures. As I mentioned, Windows 10 lacks stability. You need to back up all your documents, images, and data often because you never know when Windows 10 will hiccup and start butchering things. As an aside,
 it is not good practice to leave data on the desktop. You should create a folder using File Explorer to keep them. You can always create a link to the folder via a shortcut or pin it to Start or the Taskbar. I like to keep things in special folders that I
 create. That way I can access them regardless of what user I am logged in as.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; What happened to me fortunately was just a temporary glitch. When I did a hard reboot, everything came back to normal. It sounds like you experienced a different result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you tried searching for them using File Explorer? It is possible that the shortcut was deleted but the data still exists.</p>
<p>2. If worse comes to worse, you can use the Command Prompt to search the entire "Users" folder to see if you can come up with anything there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. Right-click on the <strong>Start Menu</strong> icon and select "<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. A command prompt window will pop up and you will be situated at the "C:\Windows\system32" folder. You need to get out of there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. Type "<strong>cd \users</strong>" (<em>there is a space between "<strong>cd</strong>" and "<strong>\</strong>"</em>) and hit "<strong>Enter</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>NOTE: do not type the quotes</em>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. This will get you to the main "<strong>Users</strong>" folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;e. If your pictures were in a ".jpg" format, type the following"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<strong>dir /s *.jpg</strong>" [<em>that is "<strong>dir</strong>" space "<strong>/s</strong>" space "<strong>*.jpg</strong>"</em>] and hit "<strong>Enter</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>Again: do not type the quotes</em>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;f. You will possibly get a long list of files. See if your pictures are among them. If they are, set up a folder in File Explorer to store them and move them there. Depending on where they are located, you may not be able to access them using File Explorer.
 You can do it in a command prompt. Let me know your results and we can go from there.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Which anti-virus software is installed on the computer?
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You may check if you can start the dependency service for DHCP client service.<br />
a. Click on Start and them type cmd and press Enter<br />
b. In the command prompt type: CMD /K SC QC DHCP<br />
c. Press Enter check if the dependency service is started.<br />
Verify that the Dependency Service / components are running<br />
a. ClickStart, type “DEVMGMT.MSC”in the start search box and press enter.<br />
b. In theView menu, clickShow hidden devices<br />
c. Double-click Non-Plug and Play drivers section<br />
d. Double-click the entryAncillary Function Driver for Winsock, and click theDriver tab<br />
e. Set theStartup type toSystem.<br />
f. Start theservice. Note down the error message if any.<br />
g. Similarly start the two other drivers namely:<br />
• TCP/IP Protocol Driver<br />
• NetBios over Tcpip<br />
h. Close Device Manager andrestart Windows.<br />
i. Now check if you can start the DHCP service.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2</strong><br />
You may also try to reset TCP/IP and check.<br />
To reset the TCP/IP stack go to this article and either click on "Fix it for me" or follow the instructions to fix it yourself:

<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
If resetting TCP/IP does not help, run sfc scan (system file checker) on your computer.<br />

            I didn't make any changes except for the files that were removed by removing the virus.
<div><br />
<div>I'm using Norton 360 for antivirus.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All the services were running except NetBios over Tcpip which was not on list.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also ran and had run before both method 2 and 3.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've also repaired the .Net Framework as I saw that in another thread.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue may occur if the Winsock registry keys are damaged or corrupted.<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Reset Winsock<br />
Windows sockets settings may get corrupted due to the installation of networking software, or perhaps due to Malware infestation. Try resetting Winsock entries to its default installation.<br />
Here’s how:<br />
a. Go to Start, type cmd and press Enter.
<div>b. Type: netsh winsock reset catalog in the command prompt and press Enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
You may also check if these services are started and set to automatic.<br />
<br />
<br />
•DHCP Client <br />
•DNS Client <br />
•Remote Procedure Call (RPC) <br />
•TCP/IP Netbios helper </div>
<div>Also ensure that the dependency services are started.<br />
Here’s how you check:<br />
a. Go to Start and type services.msc in the search field. </div>
<div>b. Press on Enter button.<br />
<br />
c. Double-click on the service and check the service status. It should be started.<br />
<br />
d. Also ensure that the startup type of the service is set to Automatic.<br />
<br />
e. Check its dependency services as well and ensure that the same is started.<br />

            I reset winsock and restarted the computer. &nbsp;still no go.
<div><br />
<div>Checked the services listed and all are running except TCP/IP Netbios helper which gives a 1075 error.</div>
<div>I checked the dependencies for this and found only Acnillary Function Driver for Winsock. &nbsp;Went to device manager and the Ancillary Function Driver for Winsock is started and working correctly.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
You may try to delete the registry entry and reboot the system. It should work just fine. it worked for me.<br />
a.Click Start, click Run, type regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.<br />
b.In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry subkey: <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dhcp<br />
<br />
c.Right-click the DependOnService entry, and then click delete instead of modify<br />
Note: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back
 up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. How to
 back up and restore the registry in Windows:<br />

            Deleting the registry key does not help. &nbsp;The Dhcp service seems to be running but not the TCP/IP Net BIOS Helper service.
<div><br />
<div>I did a search of the registry for TCP/IP Net BIOS Helper and found the key @%SystemRoot%\system32\lmhsvc.dll,-101</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know what it means but I don't have Imhsvc.dll on my computer.</div>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>in this case I would try a restore first. Do you have any restore points saved to back before this started happening?</p>
<p>If that fails you may need to do a re-install (make sure you back up all your files)</p>

<h2>            Windows was unable to complete the format</h2>
                    Hello!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I get this message saying that the format process could not be completed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Windows was unable to complete the format"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to format my USB flash drive by going to Computer, right-clicking on it and choosing Format. What am I doing wrong here? Why do I get this message? Why does it not complete the process?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use Vista Home Premium 64-bit and the USB flash drive is SanDisk Cruzer Titanium 2 GB.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <div>I just tested installing the SanDisk U3 Launchpad back on this USB flash drive. This system was present on it from the beginning when I first purchased it because it's a U3 Smart drive, but I uninstalled it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The U3 installer (LPInstaller.exe) creates two partitions on the flash drive, and it formatted the data partition as FAT32 with 4096 byte cluster, and the U3 system partition as FAT16 with 2048 byte cluster or "allocation unit".</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Windows recommended clusters are 4096 byte for FAT32 and 512 byte for FAT16.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then I uninstalled the U3 Launchpad again and the uninstall wizard formatted the flash drive. This time I had only one partition for data storage, just like any other regular flash drive. It was formatted as FAT32 with 4096 byte cluster.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried transfering two files to it and it all worked well and I could open them and delete them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then I tried to right-click the USB flash drive icon again in Computer and choose Format to try to format it. It was already pre-set to 4096 byte cluster and FAT32. Because this is what was already used. So I didn't change it and I just clicked Start button.</div>
<div><br />
<div>About 80% into the formatting process it abruptly stopped. "Windows was unable to complete the format".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then tried using the Disk Management console from Computer Management. Same thing here, I set it to FAT32 and 4096 byte. Only this time it completed the format sucessfully!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why doesn't it work when I go to the format tool on the Computer view? What's the difference between the Format tool and the Disk Management? Don't they both use the same dependencies/libraries?</div>
<div><br />
<div>There was actually one time that the Format tool sucessfully completed the format process. But only that one time! I could not repeat that success. It's rather strange that what works once doesn't work the second time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The 4K cluster size is little bit too large for a 2 GB USB flash drive. A cluster size of 512 byte would be more appropriate. But I find that the FAT32 usually performs better than FAT for most situations. The NTFS is not so good for USB flash drives,
 it's better for real disk drives. Also FAT is required by default for live Linux systems on stick, or BartPE.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Lesson learned: Don't ever use the Format tool from Computer in Windows. Use the Disk Management console instead!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks anyway!</div>
