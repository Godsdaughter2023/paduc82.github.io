    <title>Only have SD channels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> revy 50cal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Only have SD channels</h2>
                    
<p>So the one guide and option to tell the Xbox what channels to go to is working in the UK. The problem is there is no option for SD channels only, if I say watch sky one, it goes to hd. This is useless to me as I don't have the had channels. Also all the
 standard channels seem to be missing from the smart glass app so I can't even us that. I know a lot of people have hd. But does this really mean there can't be an option for SD only???</p>

<p>No, usually you can go to settings, one guide, then poke around (don't remember exactly where it is) then see if you can find a setting that says he and sd channels, sd channels only, and hd channels only. This may also be on the actual one guide itself

<h2>            Those spammers...</h2>
                    
<p>Most of the time I play Reach I'm in SWAT, but eventually I come out of my rut and jump into some Team/Squad Slayer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I can say is...grenades. Yeah I use them, but all I hear during games is the ***** sound of grenades. People seem to rely way too much on them. It's a small problem in Team Slayer, but it really annoys the heck out of me in Squad Slayer. I actually play
 Team Slayer over Squad because of Armor Lock. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No I'm not one of those people that goes into Armor Lock at every instance a bullet is shot, it's just a nice defense against storms of grenades.</p>

<p>The game has always been about the triangle of balance (Square in the case of maps with vehicles). Basically you have weapons, grenades and melee all at your disposal. In a perfectly balanced world, you would have exactly one third of kills and deaths by
 all of these systems (With vehicles, a quarter each). The data suggests otherwise, that the grenades aren't too powerful. Using Jetpack, Evade, Sprint, and Armor Lock you can avoid most deaths by grenades.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that being said, the data suggests that the grenades are underpowered, but people like them the way they are so. They do just enough damage to be viable weapons (Cough, Halo 3's Water Balloons Cough) to campers and groups of enemies but are also weak
 enough to not kill you instantly and by using Armor Abilities you shouldn't die all that much from them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're total deaths or kills by grenades is more than 10% I think that's the individuals skill level not being that high, not the game.</p>

<p>Grenades have been spammed in every Halo game to be honest lol. It's a solid tactic for taking down someone's shield in order to finish them off with your main weapon. Ideally you want to be able to use a grenade for every kill, but obviously that's not
 always possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the same thing with the melee. You use it to remove a huge chunk of your opponents shield/health so that you don't have to worry about your aim as much as they do in the shootout that's
<i>probably</i> about to take place.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Map Network Drive, Not Accepting Credentials, Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j__gatsby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Map Network Drive, Not Accepting Credentials, Access Denied.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Map Network Drive Not Accepting Credentials, Access Denied<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 7 I would map my drives, using \\HTPC\X$, it would prompt for credentials, would enter them, and it would map correctly with read\write permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, I do the same thing, when prompted to enter credentials I enter them and it says access denied and prompts me to re enter the credentials again. Have tried Windows Credentials, deleting, re adding etc. Username and Password are correct because
 they work when RDPing the HTPC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 they will map, if I leave the $ sign off, but if I put the dollar sign on the end to have read\write, it asks for credentials, when I put them in, it says access denied, and asks for them again?</p>

            <p>For what it's worth, I've got a similar problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a&nbsp;2012 R2 DC that uses a policy to&nbsp;create some mapped network&nbsp;drives to shares on a&nbsp;second 2012 R2 server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows 10 the shares are mapped - but they cannot be used,&nbsp;Windows 10 just sits and eventually the File Explorer times out when trying to open any of them. Needless to say, it all works fine under Windows 8.1</p>

            <p>It looks like I had the same problem and found a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows 10 Pro on a home network to connect to a Linux server running Samba.&nbsp; I use to be able to \\server and would get a list of shares.&nbsp; Right click and map a drive.&nbsp; Add my name, password, drive letter and I was done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First bug:&nbsp; Sometimes Win10 likes the IP address and sometimes it ONLY works with the hostname.</p>
<p>Second Bug: The username and password defaults have changed.&nbsp; Win10 prepends the username with the workgroup or domain name in front of your username, regardless of what it's showing you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now to map a drive I have to include the WORKGROUP that the server is a part of in my username.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp; In File Explorer I'll put in the address&nbsp; \\server name</p>
<p>&nbsp; When it lists the shares, I right click and select the checkmark for "Connect using&nbsp;different credentials"</p>
<p>&nbsp; Username:&nbsp; WORKGROUP\Username</p>
<p>&nbsp; Password:&nbsp;as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been the ONLY way I can get a drive to map, and I have tried IP's, and every option I can think of.&nbsp; The Jumbo packets doesn't apply for me since the Wireless card doesn't support it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bonus Third Bug: I have to do a Network troubleshoot and repair on the network cards after installing Win10, before the network get's a default route.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business not sending requests to Skype users</h2>
                    
<p>This seems to be a fairly common question but I don't see any posts that actually helped me get this working.</p>
<p>I have turned on Service Settings &gt; Skype for Business &gt; Let people use Skype for Business to communicate with Skype. My individual accounts under Admin &gt; Skype for Business &gt; Users &gt; users account &gt; External Communications &gt; External Skype for Business
 users and External Skype users are turned on. DNS all checks out when running the Find and fix issues on the domain.</p>
<p>I can search and find the users from the Skype Directory just fine, the Skype user just doesn't receive the invitation to connect.</p>
<p>What else am I missing to make this happen?</p>

<p>Hi Brain,</p>
<p>Based on your description, it seems all the required settings are configured. Therefore, I’d like to confirm the following information to look into the issue:<br />
1. What’s the detailed version of your Skype for Business client and Skype client?<br />
2. As it might take some time from 15 minutes to 72 hours before the DNS records take effect, may I know how long it has been since you add the related Lync DNS records?
<br />
3. Does this issue occur to other users in your organization?<br />
4. Have you tried to add different Skype users and check if the persists in all of them?</p>
<p>@PhilipGladwin, you are welcome to provide the answers to the questions above for our further troubleshooting as well. Or you can just post a new thread to get more dedicated support and our engineers will involve in the thread efficiently.<br />
<br />
Any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Sam</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue further, I’d like to confirm some more information:</p>
<p>1. Have you tried to untick Public IM Connectivity on Office 365 portal then wait about 30 minutes and retick the option?</p>
<p>2. Is the Skype client the latest version?</p>
<p>3. Please send us the Skype consumer client logs via the private message for further investigation.</p>

<p>4. Have you deployed a special environment such as Lync on-premises server, Lync Hybrid, etc?</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I've sent you a private message to collect the above information. Please follow the link below to read it:</p>

<p>1. Did this this morning after I removed the feature I waited 30+ minutes to allow for removal, another 30+ minutes for it to get added back on. Still no go.</p>
<p>2. Skype for sure is, I downloaded it from the site yesterday. Skype for business is as well as far as I know, with out enabling first release on Office 365 account and upgrading to 2016.</p>
<p>3. Couldn't find an attachment button here so I dumped it into OneDrive and shared in PM.</p>
<p>4. No there was no hybridization for any of the migration to Office 365.</p>

<p>When clearing DLC that didn't download correctly you need to delete the file by going to System&gt;Storage&gt;(Games or wherever it's located depending on the content) After you delete it you need to go to the top level of the device and press Y to bring up the
 maintenance menu and choose to clear the cache. &nbsp;Once this is done you should power of your console and then power it back on. &nbsp;This ensures the bad data is gone. &nbsp;If you don't take all those steps in that order that bad data can still be hanging around and
 just get written to the storage device all over again when you launch the Game/App.</p>

<p>UncrownedTabor - Firstly, please don't revive threads that are over six months old. &nbsp;You should start one of you own and detail your problem there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, the transfer tool is meant to transfer YOUR licenses to YOUR new hard drive or console. &nbsp;Using the transfer tool as a way of sharing with people outside of your home is considered marketplace theft/fraud and when caught will lead to permanent bans
 for the profiles and possibly the consoles involved. </p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Because I guess they are unscrupulously, trying to force people to upgrade.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">After realizing my dell cd was damaged when I had a problem that needed a reinstall, &nbsp;I was able to download a windows disc months ago with no issues and install it with my &nbsp;cd key on the sticker of the
 side of my dell case. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have ince lost the usb I made, But&nbsp;After this whole recent tuesday update fiasco and peoples machines breaking in as many ways as you can imagine. &nbsp;And having some weird issues myself, &nbsp; I wanted to make sure I had a install disc
 handy just in case, &nbsp;and to my shocking dismay, &nbsp;I found out MS is now preventing this.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Why? &nbsp; Why did they make this change?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">When I contact MS, &nbsp;they tell me its because win 7 support is ending. &nbsp; BUT THIS IS A LIE. &nbsp; Win 7 support is good till 2020.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">The only reason I need windows 7 is to play the latest video games. &nbsp; Otherwise I can use linux, &nbsp;which is what I'm going to start recommending family and friends to use. &nbsp;I feel not only would they &nbsp;have
 less headaches with linux, &nbsp; but I feel Microsoft is becoming very corrupt and untrustworthy. &nbsp;When I build my mothers machine for her I am going to give her linux mint.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I'm still a little in shock, &nbsp;because MS has just left a real bad taste in my mouth, and I will no longer support them or any company complicit in this scam.</span>

            <p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>

They should have kept doing it for another 5 years Andre, until their support officially ends. &nbsp; I believe a link provided by you is what I used last time. &nbsp;You really helped alot of people around the world Andre, and you deserve alot of respect. &nbsp; &nbsp;But the
 link you have provided now only has a contact to get dell factory recovery discs, &nbsp;not the windows discs. &nbsp; That defeats the purposes you described. &nbsp; It use to only cost 15 dollars for a windows disc from dell, &nbsp;but I have a feeling now Microsoft has made
 that illegal for them to do so. &nbsp; I have not heard back from Dell yet. &nbsp; So Now I have no options for the purposes you have correctly explained. &nbsp;None. &nbsp;I have to try and get turtle wax and fix the dvd, &nbsp;Because I cannot afford 119 dollars for windows 8, &nbsp;and
 I refuse to buy it on principle.<br />
<br />
People will tell you I have always defended Microsoft and their O/S security. &nbsp;But &nbsp;the latest patch tuesday and these recent revelations, &nbsp;have caused them to lose my support and respect.<br />
<br />
I refuse to download it illegally. &nbsp; Furthermore, &nbsp;when I build my mothers new computer, &nbsp;instead of buying windows 8 like we planned, &nbsp;I'm going to give her Linux Mint.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>I contacted Dell for a friends laptop who's drive failed last year and needed recovery media. I believe the cost was about $30.00</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like it either that you can't download anymore but if you plan to keep using Windows 7 then either purchase the recovery media or find a friend who has a retail (upgrade or full) of the same version as you have and make a copy of the DVD.</p>

They should have kept doing it for another 5 years Andre, until their support officially ends. &nbsp; I believe a link provided by you is what I used last time. &nbsp;You really helped alot of people around the world Andre, and you deserve alot of respect. &nbsp; &nbsp;But the
 link you have provided now only has a contact to get dell factory recovery discs, &nbsp;not the windows discs. &nbsp; That defeats the purposes you described. &nbsp; It use to only cost 15 dollars for a windows disc from dell, &nbsp;but I have a feeling now Microsoft has made
 that illegal for them to do so. &nbsp; I have not heard back from Dell yet. &nbsp; So Now I have no options for the purposes you have correctly explained. &nbsp;None. &nbsp;I have to try and get turtle wax and fix the dvd, &nbsp;Because I cannot afford 119 dollars for windows 8, &nbsp;and
 I refuse to buy it on principle.<br />
<br />
People will tell you I have always defended Microsoft and their O/S security. &nbsp;But &nbsp;the latest patch tuesday and these recent revelations, &nbsp;have caused them to lose my support and respect.<br />
<br />
I refuse to download it illegally. &nbsp; Furthermore, &nbsp;when I build my mothers new computer, &nbsp;instead of buying windows 8 like we planned, &nbsp;I'm going to give her Linux Mint.&nbsp;<br />

Yes you are correct, &nbsp;I can make my own ISO, &nbsp;or I can download a copy elsewhere. &nbsp;I just don't feel comfortable doing this and wanted a fresh retail copy for obvious reasons. But I guess I have to do what I have to do now. &nbsp; I don't have 100 dollars to buy
 windows, &nbsp;and I would never support MS again after this anyways. &nbsp; I'm still waiting on a reply from Dell.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 &#126; Contrast too high on Vaio laptop. Can&#39;t find way to adjust.</h2>
                    I upgraded my Sony Vaio laptop to Windows 10 recently. &nbsp;Going through the introduction, it lead to me brightness then contrast settings. &nbsp;While I was able to set the brightness (highest), I could not adjust the autoset contrast. &nbsp;I sell online and need
 the contrast to be more realistic when evaluating my photos. &nbsp;Is there a workaround for this issue yet?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and we are happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to update the Display adapters driver from the Device Manager and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps:<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on Start button and click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Select the Graphic driver from the list by extending <strong>Display adapters</strong>.</li><li>Right click on the Graphic driver and click on <strong>Update driver Software</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue still persists then, I would recommend you to download and install the latest video card drivers in compatibility mode from the manufacturer’s website and check if it works.</p>

            The brightness setting is to strong and fades the fonts when set below the top (brightest) setting.&nbsp; The "High Contrast" setting offers poor choices of colors for easy reading.&nbsp; I only want the original color settings, with less "whiteness"--fading.&nbsp;

            Your problem isn't the contrast, it is the gamma. Depending on your video card, you should find it somewhere in your display settings. Ex. Color Calibrate..

<h2>            BitLocker Recovery Key</h2>
                    <p>Earlier this week, my computer requested a BitLocker Recovery Key, I retrieved the necessary code from Microsoft, entered the digits and followed the required steps. The code was accepted, my computer restarted and everything worked like normal.
</p>
<p>However, this issue continues to pop up on a daily basis. Every time it appears, I type in the required code, restart my computer and continue to use it. What has prompted my computer to request the BitLocker Recovery Key and why does it continue to request
 this information on a daily basis. Do I have a virus? How do I resolve this issue?</p>

<p>as the subject describes. </p>
<p>Alt-f4 = no sleep option. </p>
<p>Signout&nbsp;to poweroptions = no sleep option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please advise.</p>
<p>once again, there is no sleep option. I am running windows 8 on a desktop. I am IT professional... and I'm lost. I don't know any solutions to this besides using a restore point or reinstalling the OS. Any tips pro's?</p>

<h2>            wordpad file disappeared instead of saving</h2>
                    <p>I closed a wordpad doc that I clicked to save and it disappeared. Usually I would see a screen that allowed me to name my document and direct it to a file.</p>
<p>How do I search for something that doesn't have a file name. Can it be recovered?</p>

            Hi Rick&amp;Jazz1
<br />
<br />It would be very unusual for Wordpad to allow a file to be closed without asking to save that file. Were you working on that file for a very long time and did it have a lot of unsaved content?
<br />
<br />Sadly, Wordpad is way too basic an application and does not have any file recovery capability. So if that file was truly not saved, then I am sorry, it will not be recoverable . . .

            Hi Rick&amp;Jazz1,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You will get the opportunity to give name if you do Save As. If you do normal save or press CTRL+S, you won't get opportunity to give name but it would directly save if it had some name. If it didn't have any name it should behave as Save As.
<br />
<br />Can you right click on Wordpad icon on your Taskbar and see the recent file list and see whether this is there?
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<span>Minecraft </span>).</p>
<p>В итоге купил <span>Minecraft </span>по сути два раза. Я сначала негодовал.</p>
<p>
</p><p>И что. Звоню в поддержку на следующий день. Объяснил ситуацию. 10 минут разговора и мне оформили возврат за один продукт.</p>
<p>Ожидаю возврат. В журнале покупок это отображено.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Большое спасибо! Респект за справедливость!</p>

    <title>Monitor Driver Problem w&#47; Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacobmarleyog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor Driver Problem w&#47; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>EDIT: I have found out both through talking to the manufacturer and some personal IT friends that the driver would not have any impact on this issue. &nbsp;I believe I have now determined that the problem is either the graphics driver, which I will attempt to
 update with a Beta driver, or is indeed a faulty monitor.<br />
<br />
Hello community!<br />
<br />
Last month I built a PC with Windows 10 Home 64. The monitor I selected is the Acer G257HU.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The display will occasionally blink on and off every second. The LED power light remains on throughout this. Turning the monitor off and on again will briefly stop the blinking, but it will have another blinking episode anywhere from 30 minutes to a day,
 though it has become more frequent in occurrence.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Troubleshooting:</span><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>I replaced the DisplayPort cable with a brand new DP cable. Problem persisted.</li><li>I tried using HDMI instead of DisplayPort. Problem persisted.</li><li>I tried using the monitor on a Windows 7 machine. After hours of strenuous use running multiple applications, problem did
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> occur. That said, it's possible that the problem could occur as I was not able to replicate the applications exactly and only tried for a few hours (in some instances it takes a day or more for the problem
 to occur).</li><li>I used an old LED monitor on the new PC. Under the same use conditions that caused the first monitor to blink, problem did
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> occur.</li></ul>
<p>Through this I believe I have ruled out a connection issue, a faulty motherboard and a faulty monitor, meaning the only difference could possibly be the Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Acer tech support and their only thought was that the Monitor is not compatible with Windows 10. On their website Acer has a driver for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 but not Windows 10. However on both machines that I used this monitor on, the driver
 was the same Generic PnP, driver date 6/21/2006, version 10.0.10586.0. I attempted to run a driver update on both machines and they both indicated I was using the latest available.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Status:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am scratching my head here. I asked a question on the website I purchased it at under their Q&amp;A and multiple buyers confirmed they are running this monitor without problem on Windows 10. I saw at least 1 comment on Newegg of someone having the identical
 problem as me.<br />
<br />
The only possible thing I can think of at this point is that somehow the people running it fine on Windows 10 are people who UPGRADED to Win10 (trying to confirm this) and somehow the driver was grandfathered in, whereas a clean install of Windows 10 is treated
 differently? I downloaded the Win7/8.1 driver and attempted to manually install it in Win10 and the system wouldn't let me. (I directed it to install from the driver folder and it just tells me I already have the latest driver without even trying to install
 it.)<br />
<br />
So. All that being said I guess my questions are thusly:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Why would using this monitor with the identical Generic PnP driver work fine on my Win7 machine but cause issues on my Win10 machine?</li><li>Did I miss anything in my troubleshooting? That is, is there another possible explanation outside of Win10?</li><li>If the only remaining potential fix is that I need to find a way to force a Windows 7/8.1 driver down Win10's throat working under the idea that the driver is actually compatible, but the system won't let me, is there a workaround?</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Jacob</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few people I know have had issues with installing drivers for monitors and such on Windows 10. Some (not all) have found that the following work around allows Windows 10 to accept the drivers for 7/8.1 (it seems that 8.1 drivers seem to enjoy more success)&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Might be worth a shot, if you do try it let me know if it works.</p>

<h2>            Cannot set &#34;English US&#34; as Windows 10 Display Language Hence Cortana not working</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 Build 10565 on my second laptop and cannot get English US set as the display language. As you can see below the English US is installed but not listed as the display language.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled all other languages, set my location, speech and region all to US. Annoyingly, everything worked just fine when the laptop was on the Windows 10 Public Release version. I have two other laptops set exactly the same way (one one Build 10565
 and on Public Release), and both show as English US set as the Display Language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to resolve this?</p>

<p>"Something wnet wrong , you can skip this for now or try again ; so if i skip it then it goes on for a little bit and comes up with another weird word and satys the same thing and it just keeps going like that.&nbsp; Unfortunately there are no windows 10 drivers
 for it on the HP site either so i am still on Windows&nbsp; 7 drivers.&nbsp; Is that the problem and if so does anyone know where I can find Windows 10 drivers for it?</p>

            Hi Kaspazzy
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If there are no drivers for Windows 10 on the official HP website, then that means there none elsewhere. It likely also means the system is not certified compatible with Windows 10 and you are running on an unsupported configuration. 
<br />
<br />As for the OOBE error, you can try Microsoft's recommended workaround:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020048/windows-oobe-fails-when-you-start-a-new-windows-based-computer-for-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402004...</a>
<br />
<br />or you can attempt a repair upgrade to see if it resolves the issue:

<h2>            Re-sizing chat window</h2>
                    I have used CTRL- to reduce the font size in the chat window, however CTRL+ doesn't work, so I now have writing so small it's impossible to read. How to I increase size again?

            Hey Tallster
<br />Maybe try CTRL+ ALT + + or CTRL+0 and see if that works.
<br />Hope this helps
