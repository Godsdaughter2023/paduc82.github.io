<h2>            Error code when starting a video editing program &#34;program has stopped working windows will close then program and look for a solution&#34;</h2>
                    When starting Cyberlink Power Director 8 an error message comes up and closes the program before it can start. Have also tried to use Corel Video Studio Pro x3 and have a similar problem except the message comes up after the program is closed<br />

<h3> silvee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 2019 HUP</h2>
                    <p>I purchased MS office home and business 2019 for my mac and now I cant activate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made a new microsoft account (since I bought Office from my employer website).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didnt allow me to make a password, only let me continue, and of course my Mac didnt save the password that I guess it made on its own. ..??&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cant reset password--- Ive tried. Too many times , I guess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So long story short I cant access MS account and therefore cant install it. Ive talked to customer service and they said I will need to transfer it to another account but when I reached out to the department they told me to, the guy was no help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So-- how do I go about changing the MS account associated with it now (the one Im locked out of) to a differnt MS account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone purchase is through Microsoft HUP (which i thibk means Home Use Program)?</p>

            Hi  SilVee 
<br />
<br />You need to deactivate it from within the old account.
<br />
<br />From any computer, go to your Microsoft account, Installs page and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/i...</a>
<br />
<br />Under PC/Mac installs used, locate the computer where you want to deactivate Office 365.
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate to deactivate Office on the PC or Mac.       
        </p>

<p>Thanks Andre,<br />
But if I do not have access to that MS account, how can i deactivate it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I attempted to access the account under "forgot my password" I got this email reply:</p>

            Hi Alain
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />To better understand the issue, could you please share some additional details:
<br />- which version of windows are you running Skype on?
<br />- which version of Skype are you using?
<br />- since when did the issue start to occur?
<br />- if you log to Skype Web (web.skype.com) with the same login and password, does it log successfully?
<br />
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida       
        </p>

<br />
<br />Pour mieux comprendre le problème, pourriez-vous partager quelques détails supplémentaires:
<br />- sur quelle version de Windows utilisez-vous Skype?
<br />- quelle version de Skype utilisez-vous?
<br />- depuis quand le problème a-t-il commencé à se produire?
<br />- Si vous vous connectez à Skype Web (web.skype.com) avec le même identifiant et le même mot de passe, est-ce que ça marche?
<br />
<br />Merci.

<h2>            Windows XP Pro &#40;SP3&#41; Backup Task Scheduling error 0x80070005</h2>
                    I have a problem related to my Windows Backup procedure and Task Scheduler.&nbsp; After creating a backup procedure, I hit the
<i>Advanced </i>button for additional procedures, and created a schedule for my backup, after which it asked for my user account password.&nbsp; Error 0x80070005 came up thereafter.<br />
<br />
This is a new build.&nbsp; On my old machine, I went through the same procedure, and last time I got this error, I removed my name from the account, and entered
<b>"Administrator"</b> in its place.&nbsp; The backup routine proceeded as scheduled.<br />
<br />
Must every scheduled backup procedure required to be run as an <i>administrator?&nbsp;</i> Or am I missing something that will allow me to perform this procedure and create a schedule as a
<i>user?</i><br />
<br />

            If your want the task to run under the XP Administrator account and usually on a new build that account has no password, if you try to create a task with that account and it has no password or you enter the password incorrectly, you will see a message
 like this:<br />
<br />
The new task has been created, but may not run because the account information<br />
could not be set.&nbsp; The specific error is 0x80070005:&nbsp; Access is denied.<br />
<br />
The task will still be created, but will not run properly. <br />
<br />
It is best practice for STs to assign them to run under an account that has a password.&nbsp; There is a way around it, but that would go against the best practices for STs.<br />
<br />
If you are compelled to use the Administrator account for some reason, assign it a password and use it for your Scheduled Task.&nbsp; The trouble with that might be that someday you might forget that password and could be in a small jam if you need the Administrator
 account for something.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
What some folks do is create a separate user account with an account type of Computer administrator (with a password) and use that account to run your STs.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can also use your user account - if it has a password, but depending on how you set up your ST, when the time comes for the job to run, it may just pop up on your screen while you are doing something else - that can be annoying and a good reason to create
 a separate user account just to run your STs.<br />

            I just recently attempted to run a backup task, using my name in the account space and a password.&nbsp; It would not run.&nbsp; Again, last time I was successful, I entered "Administrator" in the space where a name was required, and my password.&nbsp; The backup ran
 normally.&nbsp; I must assume that, given the setup I have, I must schedule the backup as an administrator.<br />
<br />
Is it quite possible that the scheduled backup procedure won't run with my user name (despite entering a password), because I did not set a password for my user name, the same password that would be required to log on to my desktop?&nbsp; I have an administrator
 password, but no user password.<br />

<p>I thought I recognised your gamertag, you're the person with the hard drive from GameStop is that right. I have a feeling it's the hard drive,something isn't quite right with it. Can you ask GameStop to verify that the drive is a genuine Microsoft hard drive

<p>Yes I'm the person with the hard drive from GameStop. And you're probably right but, I'm not sure if I could verify it or not cause I ordered it and my 360 from their website and they came all the way from Texas and I live in North Carolina. Or would I just
 need to call the number under the "contact us" part of their website or email them or something?</p>

<p>Personally I would give them a call or email them and enquire exactly what they do when they "refurb" these hard drives. Explain that you are having issues playing you original Xbox games and you have a feeling the drive may be defective in some way.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I take it none of the games you tried work which would lead me to suspect its the hard drive itself in that case as you say you tried all the suggested solutions.</p>

<p>I take it you did try deleting the latest system update and then updating your console again as described in the link I posted earlier in this thread and possibly formatting the hard drive before you update the console.</p>

    <title>mouse clicks somewhere to the side - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deevo  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse clicks somewhere to the side </h2>
                    
<p>When I click- my mouse clicks somewhere off to the side of where it is actually pointing.. so I have to point to somewhere to the side of what I want to click on</p>
<p>So whenever I am trying to clicking on something, my mouse clicks somewhere to the side of what I am actually trying to click on. So then in order to click on what I really want, I have to compensate by pointing somewhere to the side of what I want in order
 to click the right thing. Not sure if that makes sense.... but it is really annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span><span>Hello deevo,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Do you have a wired or a wireless mouse?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Do you remember making any recent changes to your computer (hardware or software) before having this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try the below steps to fix this issue:
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Connect the mouse to a different port:
</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You should connect the mouse to a different USB port if you are using a USB mouse.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Change the pointer scheme from Aero to none:</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on start and control panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Mouse. Open the mouse settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on the pointers tab. Under scheme. Change the scheme from Windows Aero to None.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This will change the mouse pointer appearance to the normal pointer.
</span></span></p>

    <title>Picture in a font folder&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kittycat_mew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Picture in a font folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So one day, I was downloading fonts. I open one of the folders so I could install the font. I come accross a "picture" file. It looked like a picture, and I'm pretty sure it was, and it was called, "Dinosaur.jpg (I don't know if it was .jpg or not, it just
 had the file extention name for a picture, and the icon was a picture icon)" I didn't open it, but I was curious to what it was. Does anyone know what this is? I can't find it anymore, I might have deleted it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just curious.</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>

            <p>Hi <strong>Abdul,</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community Forums. If I understand you correctly, computer crashes with error message Scanning and Repairing D:/ Drive (100%). I understand that it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help
 fix your issue and guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.</strong><br />
1. When exactly the computer crashes? Is it while performing any particular function?<br />
2.What is the exact and complete error messgae?</p>
<p>To let you know Event 41 is logged because power to the computer was interrupted, consider obtaining an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) such as a battery backup power supply. An underpowered or failing power supply may cause this behavior. For example,
 if you added RAM or additional devices or hard disks when this problem began, the power supply may cause the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let us now perform some troubleshooting steps. All the steps are to be performed systematically and in an order.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run
<strong><span>Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant</span></strong> to check if your computer is ready to install Windows 8 or not.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If the first method didn't fix I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices other than mouse and keyboard. Then try restarting the computer and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
If the issue persists I would suggest you to check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode or not.<br />
<br />
<strong>Let's first try to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check if you face the issue.</strong>
</p>
<p>a. <strong>Boot </strong>from the <strong>Windows 8 DVD</strong>.<br />
b. Click on <strong>Repair your computer.<br />
</strong>c. Click on <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>and then select <strong>Advanced Options.<br />
</strong>d. Select the option <strong>Safe mode </strong>and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><strong>Method 4:</strong><br />
Perform clean boot if the issue does not occur in Safe Mode. Set the computer in ‘Clean boot’ state to check software conflicts. Refer the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + R’ </strong>key on the <strong>keyboard</strong>.<br />
b) In the ‘<strong>Run’ </strong>windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’ </strong>and click ‘<strong>Ok’</strong>.<br />
c) Click the ‘<strong>Boot’ </strong>tab and uncheck <strong>‘Safe Boot’ option</strong>.<br />
d) On the ‘<strong>General’ </strong>tab, click to select the option ‘<strong>Selective startup’</strong>, and then click to clear the option Load
<strong>startup items </strong>check box.<br />
e) On the ‘<strong>Services’ </strong>tab, click to select the ‘Hide <strong>all Microsoft services’
</strong>check box, and then click ‘<strong>Disable all’.</strong><br />
f) On the ‘<strong>StartUp’</strong> tab, click ‘Open <strong>Task Manager’</strong>. In the Task Manager window under startup tab,
<strong>right click </strong>on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<strong>Disable’</strong>.<br />
f) Click ‘<strong>OK’</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 2: Enable half of the services:</strong><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <strong>Services tab</strong>, and then click to select the <strong>
Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
</strong>c. Click to <strong>select half of the check boxes </strong>in the Service list.<br />
d. Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then click Restart.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns:</strong><br />
<strong>If the problem still occurs, </strong>repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</p>
<p><strong>If the problem does not occur,</strong> repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</p>
<p><strong>If only one service is selected in the Service list,</strong> and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items:</strong><br />
<strong>If no startup item causes this problem, </strong>a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box
 in either step.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns:<br />
If the problem still occurs, </strong>repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</p>
<p><strong>If the problem does not occur,</strong> repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</p>
<p><strong>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, </strong>
and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</p>
<p><strong>If no startup item causes this problem,</strong> a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check
 box in either step.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 6: Resolve the problem:</strong><br />
<strong>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem,
</strong>contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:<br />
Note: </strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + R’ </strong>key on the <strong>keyboard</strong>.<br />
b) In the ‘<strong>Run’ </strong>windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’ </strong>and click ‘<strong>Ok’</strong>.<br />
c) On the ‘<strong>General’ </strong>tab, click the ‘<strong>Normal Startup’ option</strong>, and then click ‘<strong>OK’</strong>.<br />
d) <strong>Restart </strong>the computer and check with the issue.</p>

            As you said to start in safe mode. As soon as it restart it start repairing.. But the repairing fails.
<div>And from the log file i found that the cause for fail in Automatic Repair is corrupted driver msahci.sys.</div>
<div>But when i went to the desired location there was no such type of driver...</div>
<div>So the real cause is missing driver...</div>
<div>How can i solve this problem??</div>

            <p>When the IPhone 5 is connected to the computer, the device is not listed.&nbsp;Those listed are Local Disk C, my two external hard drives and DVD RW Drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked in the Devices connected to my computer and the Apple Mobile Device USB Driver is not listed with the devices and printers but in a third area called unspecified.&nbsp; When I right clicked on it and clicked troubleshoot it said that the Apple Mobile
 Device USB Driver is an older USB device and may not work with USB 3.0.&nbsp; It says to plug the device into an available USB 2.0 port, and click Next. Otherwise, click Cancel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to be so elementary in my understanding but&nbsp; would my computer have both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Gill74,<br />

<h2>            Piracy victim  Maybe&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    How do I reconcile my vitim of "Software Piracy"&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought a PC build from a builder - seller in 2005.&nbsp;It was for Karaoke performance shows.&nbsp; The pc was really not intended to be a desk top everyday. I just hooked it up to my wireless network to surf
 and look to renew some karaoke software and .......nightmare, &nbsp;microsoft starts authorizing and bing, now I get all the aggravation of the pop up and threats. I understand the problem but I think there should be a more economical way to reconcile.........
 not 150.00. There was, or is a COA&nbsp;key that I saw when I&nbsp;took delivery of&nbsp;the machine. The builder said it was a multi user license key.&nbsp; The key looked authentic and this builder sold many of these systems. I have 4 other comps here in my home, all with windows
 , 1 with windows 2000 it is an older laptop, 2 with XP home, 1 with Vista ,my new one. I have never pirated anything except maybe pirate booty ( Joking) you know like gold and silver uh

<p><span>Hi alex,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have already created a password, then you will need to change it to create a password hint.</span></p>
<p><span>One cannot hide or disable the password hint box unless you remove the password.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you click on the user account name icon or just hit enter key and check if it logs in, may be you have kept blank password.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then check if computer can login from safe mode</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Restart the computer to get back to the normal mode</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to login into computer in the safe mode then change the password of user account to enable the password hint.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What to do if you forget your Windows password</span></strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why this issue occurs is when the canvas size that is set to your Paint application does not fit with the image you've edited. To know more about your issue, we would like to ask the following:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried editing other image and check if the result would be the same?
</li><li>Can you provide us a screenshot of the image you're trying that resulted with that issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

            Yes, I tried editing another image and got the same result.&nbsp; Below&nbsp;is an example.&nbsp; Note that in addition to the white fuzzy edges, there are&nbsp;many black artifacts on&nbsp;the&nbsp;pasted image&nbsp;that are not part of the original&nbsp;(second)&nbsp;image.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d6f7e0c-75ea-490f-b5f0-26a889d3c48e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d6f7e0c-75ea-490f-b5f0-26a889d3c48e" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30e0daa0-4ac1-47ee-868c-02e72a31a704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30e0daa0-4ac1-47ee-868c-02e72a31a704" /></a>

<p>Hello, <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on the images that you've provided, the color palette on the right image where the missing part is showing when you paste it has a different texture. This can be a cause of the Paintbrush passing-through it accidentally as you erase the portion of
 the image. To isolate your concern, we recommend that you change the <em><strong>Color 2</strong></em> of the
<strong><em>Eraser</em></strong> <em><strong>tool </strong></em>to <strong><em>black</em></strong> and check if the issue persists. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Give us an update with the outcome. </p>

            No paintbrush passed through the image.&nbsp; Not only&nbsp;were white pixels added around the perimeter but also there are numerous black pixels on the white image not part of the original.&nbsp; The black fuzzy band at the bottom of the cupola was also added by Paint.&nbsp;
 I have done this with other images and white pixels were added around the periphery not in the original image.

<p>Still looking for a solution.&nbsp; This is vexing since I have previously&nbsp;cropped images and transparent copied and pasted them into other images with no problem.&nbsp; I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong this time.&nbsp; First of all, your previous reply said that the
 "...canvas size set to my Paint application does not fit with the image you've edited."&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore&nbsp;I reduced the copied image to a size that fits within the destination image but the problem was still there.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to&nbsp;my response to your latest reply, I don't
 understand your reference to a "different texture" of the color palette.&nbsp; Can you be more specific?&nbsp;&nbsp;As to&nbsp;the suggestion of changing color 2 of the eraser tool to black, I used a black background&nbsp;just to illustrate the problem.&nbsp; The actual copied image will
 be pasted onto a landscape scene with many colors so&nbsp;I'm not sure that changing&nbsp;color 2 to black will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the issue of random black pixels&nbsp;added here and there as well as a black&nbsp;"smear" on the base of cupola has not been addressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Roto.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            How can I locate the emails stored on Windows Live Mail 2011&#63;</h2>
                    My old computer ran on Vista.&nbsp; The motherboard died.&nbsp; I recovered the hard drive and am hoping to recover the emails stored in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; I have looked for the folder that several people have cited, but it isn't on my hard drive!&nbsp; Of course, I
 have chosen the option of seeing hidden files.

            <p>Hello Drew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you can access your old hard drive on your computer. We would need you to search for the location of your .EML files that is stored on your computer. Note that .EML files is the file type of your emails from Windows Live Mail. To do this, click your
<strong>My Computer </strong>and on the upper right side of the screen, you'll find
<strong>Search Computer</strong>.&nbsp;type <font><strong>*.eml</strong> and hit Enter.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>If your computer can still detect the .EML files, then right click a file and choose
<strong>Open file location</strong>. You should be able to see your Windows Live Mail emails.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Let us know the results afterwards.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Thank you.</font></p>

    <title>How to Upgrade, Clean Install Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Upgrade, Clean Install Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Technical Level: **NOTE: This does not include the install procedure for systems with Modern UEFI firmware (NEW BIOS). Not too much difference, but if you have a PC with this Modern UEFI firmware, you need to set the boot manager for boot order prior to
 installing Windows. Check online for info before proceeding. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thousands of people are and have been confused on getting Windows 10 free since before it was releases in July, 2015. The free is now gone after July, 2016 and you have to now purchase it. So I will help you. You have to follow a process before you can ever
 do a clean install from a flash/thumb drive you burned the Windows 10 OS ISO image on or if you burned it on to a DVD. I have did many computers already on the upgrades and then did clean installs after the upgrades on each computer. **"You MUST do the UPGRADE
 first"** so Microsoft can verify your legal copy of windows and then give you the new Product Key Code during the windows 10 upgrade that is yours for life if using with the same motherboard/computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;But you must be careful to do it properly especially if you have no backup DVD or flash drive for your current Windows 7 or 8 OS if you were to have to start all over from scratch. Most people never create a back up or restore OS DVD as Computer Manufacturers
 do not give you anymore, they make you create one after you buy their computers or you may be able to use the F12 on start up to restore your system back to out of box state or people lose them or if you have an OEM version, people lose or misplace those also.
 So to save yourself wasted time or screw yourself which is very possible, I suggest you do it correctly. You should always create a system image in Backiup/Restore because if anything ever goes wrong, you can restore back exactly how your PC was when you created
 the image. Keep your image updated every couple weeks. Do not over write existing image, delete it and create new images every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must first make sure Windows checks to see if your system is capable to install windows 10 such as drivers etc. There is an app for that at Microsoft website to see if you are good to go or not. If not, it will tell you which hardware is not compatible
 or why you can not install Windows 10. Microsoft pretty much has every generic driver needed to complete a successful install and then you can take care of the rest after install for devices and hardware if you have the software. Most software will work from
 previous Windows Operating systems, such as printers, etc. You can install drivers and software in other COMPATIBILITY MODES that worked on previous versions of windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8. This feature has been available since windows Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;When you do the upgrade first, all your personal files will be saved and will not be lost. You will have to of course reinstall most programs you had installed on the previous OS version you had as it has always been. But if you are going to do a clean
 install after upgrade then of course you would skip this part. But be sure before you do a clean install after the upgrade, to back up or save all your personal information or files on a DVD, separate hard drive or flash drive or you will lose it all on a
 clean install. **Most importantly, after the upgrade you will need your new "Windows 10 Product Activation Key Code" for a clean install. "YOU MUST HAVE THIS" To achieve this, go on the web site and download the little free app I listed below. Double click
 it and then write down on a piece of paper the WINDOWS 10 - 25 digit Activation Key Code. Be sure to write it down correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;********************************<br />
ProduKey v1.91 - Recover lost Windows product key (CD-Key) and Office 2003/2007 product key.
<br />
&nbsp;Click or Copy and Paste into browser address bar to download- Web Site:&gt;&gt;&gt; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;Description:<br />
&nbsp;ProduKey is a small utility that displays the ProductID and the CD-Key of<br />
&nbsp;MS-Office, Windows, Exchange Server, and SQL Server installed on your<br />
&nbsp;computer. You can view this information for your current running<br />
&nbsp;operating system, or for another operating system/computer - by using<br />
&nbsp;command-line options. This utility can be useful if you lost the product<br />
&nbsp;key of your Windows/Office, and you want to reinstall it on your computer.<br />
&nbsp;*********************************</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;First, Before starting the upgrade, find out if you have a 32 bit (x86) or 64 bit current Windows 7 or 8 Operating system and write it down so you do not forget. To do this go to "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System" &lt;&lt;&lt;you can copy and paste this
 into a window address bar to access it also. You must do this to know which tool to use that I will give you info on below if you want to do the upgrade through this tool instead of using Windows update to do the upgrade. I will never do a Service Pack or
 upgrade using windows update. Too many things can and will go wrong or an error may cause it not to install when it actually can and will install. I have always used a stand alone installer all the way back to Windows XP that can be obtained on Microsoft websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you choose not to use Windows update to upgrade or Windows Update will not work, go to Microsoft website and download the Media Creation Tool. This part is important because there are many variables and you need to use the correct one. You can not upgrade
 from 32 to 64 bit or 64 to 32 bit. And remember you want 64 bit OS. So the great thing is you can have a 32 bit OS and after you upgrade to the 32 bit Win 10 OS, you can then do a clean install of the Windows 10 64 Bit OS and yes, you still use the Windows
 10 Activation Key Code you retrieved after the upgrade of the Windows 10 32 bit upgrade. That Activation Key Code is reusable forever as long as you use the same motherboard. And now you can forever do a new clean install if you should ever have to and use
 this key code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;***Note: Strangely enough, unlike previous versions with no duplicate key codes, Microsoft will give you the key code per Creation Tool you use for the upgrade. Does not matter how many upgrades if you used the same downloaded Tool. Each tool is what determines
 the generated Key Code when Microsoft verifies your legal copy of Windows 7 or 8 and then you are giving the code. So you can or will get the same code for more than one computer. Microsoft does not care because this is their new system. Once they verify your
 legal copy and board ID then you can only use that code on that computer or motherboard anyways. So if you upgrade 2 computers and use the same tool by copying the tool to other computers, then you will get the same windows 10 Activation Key Code on both Computers.
 So that key code is recorded to each motherboards ID and already verified. It is fool proof and piracy protected and a simpler tracking and verification system for Microsoft.<br />
&nbsp;*******************************<br />
&nbsp;Download these tools on Microsofts websites. You only need the 64 bit tool if you currently have 64 bit:<br />
&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;"MediaCreationTool.exe" is used if you are currently running a 32 bit (x86) operating system.<br />
&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;"MediaCreationToolx64.exe" is used if you are currently running a 64 operating system.<br />
&nbsp;***NOTE: You only need the 32 bit tool if you currently have a 32 bit system for the upgrade (ONLY).</p>
<p>As of 12, 2017, I noticed that you may only need the MediaCreationTool.exe for 32 and 64 bit systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;********************************</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;After you download this tool, double click on it and select "Upgrade this PC" and select "Next" and complete the steps and the upgrade will begin. Be sure to back up your personal files and have windows preserve them to add after the upgrade to your User
 account. This can take from about 30 minutes to 3+ hours depending on your system.<br />
&nbsp;***NOTE: I would first unplug any printers, cameras, webcams and any unusual devices you may have plugged in. Be sure to leave your router/modem connected to stay connected to the internet during upgrade and clean install. This is how Microsoft verifies your
 legal copy of Windows on upgrade and allows the upgrade and install to proceed better installing updates it may need for a better install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If you have Windows 7 Ultimate or Pro, then you can get Windows 10 Pro. If you Have Windows 8 Pro, then you get Windows 10 Pro. If you have Windows 8 Home, then you get Windows 10 Home. If you have any other versions of Windows 7, then you get Windows 10
 Home. You will need to remember this if you decide to do a clean install after the upgrade. This is because you will then use the Media Creation Tool also for downloading the OS files and burning the ISO image on a DVD or flash/thumb drive. This app does both
 the upgrade and images for a clean install. And if you have a 32 bit system, surely you want to do a clean install of the 64 bit. Be sure you download and burn the right 64bit EDITION. When you use the Tool to create the Image, be sure to select the correct
 Language, the correct Edition you are allowed, and avoid the ones that have a (N) next to it as they do not install all the features such as Media. And be sure to select 64 bit Architecture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Ok so you have completed the upgrade. Now when I installed Windows 10 on several computers, it was prior to the November Windows update that is basically a Service Pack. But they do not call it that anymore. They called the update "Version 1511" which stands
 for "Year 2015, 11th Month". Having said that, it is now important to check windows update to install any updates, and if this new install or upgrade does not have the new Service Pack in it, then you will have to install it using windows update and any other
 updates for hardware etc. There is one thing that has outraged me and many others, windows has removed the valuable, useful and important features that older versions of Windows Update had. You can no longer select which updates you want to install or hide
 them and can not really control when they install and you can only postpone a restart for a few days. It is awful, but I have not encountered any updates that caused any issues except a flash player update for Internet Explorer and it was fixed in a few days.
 There is a 3rd party app that will access some hardware/driver updates and let you uninstall them, but I am not sure if they will not get re-installed automatically again. Total lack of control now. Remember, if you plan on doing the clean install too, you
 may want to just check out a few things after upgrade and avoid the windows Service Pack Update 1511 if it is not already in the upgrade or the image you burned. The reason is the Update 1511 could take another 30 minutes to 3+ hours to install, so you can
 avoid wasting this time at least on the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Windows 10 comes fully protected from viruses and malware and as you know windows firewall and all system security is state of the art these days as they were not in the past. You no longer need to buy and install these security systems like McAfee and
 Norton etc. It is all in Windows Defender which is the same as Microsoft Security Essentials that has been offered for free for last 8 years or so. I have only used it and never had any viruses or malware attack me as it caught them and neither has anyone
 else as far as I know. </p>
<p>&nbsp;So now you may want to check if all system drivers are installed and that your system is working correctly and good and may want to at least plug in printers etc and check windows update or install software and drivers for them from your CD's or DVD's that
 came with the hardware such as video cards etc. But most all drivers from Microsoft work great and you do not need the older drivers and app software for them. If you plan to do clean install, I would not waste time installing most all programs that we all
 use everyday as they all work on all windows operating systems. All programs can be installed to run properly as they did in an older version of windows. That is why Microsoft is the best. Windows 10 is a new user interface. It has a little 7 and 8 in it and
 then the new infrastructure and they kind of mix and mingle together. Windows 10 is completely different than previous versions. Most people do not even set up their systems so they can easily access things and they do not set many features and security for
 many things. They just use the default installed settings which is beyond me because they lose out on so much and it makes it harder to use your computer in default settings. So Windows 10 is a bit confusing until you use it for awhile and explore. Plus all
 the new live features built into it. I will explain this next.<br />
&nbsp;***NOTE: To check system drivers in Device Manager, copy and paste into a window address bar&gt;&gt;&gt; "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System". Then click (TICK) "DEVICE MANAGER". Select 'View" in the top of the new window, and Tick "Show Hidden Devices",
 Look to see if there is a red or yellow symbols next to any device. if not you are all good. If there is, check to see if it may be for an external device you may have connected such as printer, or maybe Audio or Video card, etc. If it is not for an important
 internal hardware device then you are probably ok to proceed with the clean install and you can get the drivers for it later online from the manufacturer as they most always have updates for most all devices. Some may not have any for Windows 10 yet or never
 will, but Microsoft most likely has most all of them as I have not had any missing on many computers that are all different.<br />
----------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So now this is the moment you decide to clean install, which that is the only way most would have it. Any upgrade is an install over a previous version. Although it is the new operating system, the older version is still there and all the info to restore/revert
 back to older version is part of the operating system and it also is using up that extra storage space on your hard drive and could cause possible issues months down the road. So now if you do not like windows 10, this is your chance to restore back to Windows
 7 or 8. If you like Windows 10, I would proceed with the clean install. Be sure you have the info and did what was mentioned earlier before you proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So If you have your DVD or Flash Drive ready and your paper with your 25 digit Activation Key Code, then insert it and restart your computer. Then follow instructions to start the install. Be sure to format your hard drive using quick format. You do not
 need to create any extra partitions. It will be NTFS (FS=File System) format. This will remove all previous data for a clean install. It will take between 30 minutes to 3+ hours.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Ok here is what you will encounter on the upgrade and clean install during the installation, besides entering your Key Code on a clean install. You will see a different set up process then you have seen before. If you buy computers that have the OS pre
 installed, then you may have never did an upgrade or install. But Microsoft has giving Window 10 for free for the first year to U.S.A. residents for reasons. 4th OS in short few years, XP was great, 7 was the best, 8 had issues and Vista was a disaster. Their
 system now is built for todays technology and ability to use all your devices and connect them and access them in many ways and use your (Advertising ID) or Microsoft account, which is your email account to access things across platforms and devices and locations.
 This includes your free or purchased one drive to store your files on, the cloud, and many more features so you are always able to access anything you need no matter what device you have or where you are in the world. So they designed the OS to make it easier
 for this to happen then it used to be and because of todays advances. The OS is for all of their devices and any PC. But Microsoft has incorporated advertising into the operating system. They have also opened you up into this new world of providing some of
 your information for different reasons and for uses of apps and features and so they can collect this info about you which makes money.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do these installs, I would just leave these confusing settings on what they have them on until after the install. Then in the new settings main app that can be accessed on the right hand side of the taskbar after the Time and Date, you can then
 learn how to turn off many features to protect your privacy. It will take some time using this new settings app and to figure out many security and privacy settings. You can even set more security setting by logging into your Microsoft email account and clicking
 on the link in this setting app that will lead you there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is even live tiles on the Start Menu of apps that are live and connected to the internet. You can turn them off. The start menu is completely different then you ever had before and has sub menus for more listing throughout the start and programs menus.
 You also can only log out by right clicking on windows logo on the left hand corner of the taskbar. So it makes sense that we get windows 10 free for some of these reasons sharing our info and the advertising. The new Cortana is the typical search tool for
 files, commands or apps on the system or internet, but Cortana is a wizard. Once you complete the set up process, if you choose to do so, then it learns about you over time to make your experiences better. It serves other valuable purposes too, but for it
 to work, this information is not completely private. well it is and it isn't. Get what I am saying. The new web browser Microsoft Edge has a couple cool features and they say it is awesome, but personally it is not that great. I will stick with Internet Explorer
 or Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So now repeat the things you did after the upgrade and all windows updates and install any programs and software you want or need and set up all your goodies how you like them, folders and options, internet explorer options - security/access settings and
 features if you know how to, your Home network and sharing options, Join the Home Group for more features across your family's home network, etc and the rest of the goodies and tweaks and enjoy. Lots of great new features and overall pretty awesome! You can
 also in your user account settings, choose to sign in to Windows with your usual local Windows log-in name and password or choose to log in with your Microsoft account which will have you always signed in to all your Microsoft accounts and services. Your display
 name on the windows log-on screen will also have your last name and email address (if selected) displayed on log-on screen when using Microsoft account to log on to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;One last thing, windows 10 uses less resources. It runs very nice and has a faster response time. However, they claimed that the start up/reboot was faster. that is far from the truth with a lot of complaints which is really no big deal. But during the
 boot up, do not panic if the screen goes black for up to 10+ seconds, especially right after an install or restart after certain Windows Updates or programs you installed. The slower your computer is, the much slower the boot up/update or install process will
 take.</p>

<p>You can delete the other duplicate post. But a glitch, I don't know. </p>

</p><p>Greg Carmack Community Moderator&nbsp;stated I was banned and he did not know why, but yet I can post comments now.

<p>
</p><p>Andre Da Costa&nbsp; Community Moderator&nbsp;may have been the one. I don't know. Just appears odd right after our posts to each other this happened.</p>

<p>Also in my profile, Some Discussion Posts I created are not there anymore in my activity log. I also can not find them under filter all for all. I think they are being removed by someone there that has some personal issues against me.</p>

<p>Close all processes of that browser, from Task Manager, and trying again. This helps me frequently with Internet Explorer.</p>

</p><p>I do not have a problem accessing it. And I delete all my temp internet files about after every time I use IE or any browser. &nbsp;I said in my profile, since it is messed up, that in my list of posts and comments I have made, that some of my own discussion
 posts are now missing. so I would either have to use saved link I have for it, do a search of the title in search, or spend an hour in discussion tab to find it on a page instead of accessing my profile page and selecting it from there like all the other ones.</p>

<p>Some of these problems may be resolved tomorrow (Jan 1 in the US) when the Forum Owners determine why you became an A. User. Wait and see.</p>
