<h2>            Windows Live Account &#38; Synced Windows 7 Contacts - SMS Problem</h2>
                    I have recently created my contacts in my Windows Live account &amp; synced it with my Windows 7 phone, however I am unable to send an sms text message to any of these contacts, until they have sent me a sms text first I can reply to.
<br />
I have checked the contact's mobile numbers, which are correct &amp; the Windows 7 phone recognises these contacts as being in my Contacts list when I have received a text (again suggesting the number is correct) but I cannot make the first contact, I just get
 "can't send message, try again". <br />
As I can reply to sms texts, it would suggest there is nothing wrong with my mobile provider, so anyone offer any advice?

            Go to <a href="https://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contacts.live.com</a> and go to a contact that's having an issue. Make sure the mobile number has no formatting. Example: (123) 456-7890 looks like 1234567890. Use the drop down box above the mobile number field
 to get the country code. Save the contact, force a sync on the phone (Settings&gt;email + accounts, hold your finger down on the Windows Live account and choose sync from the menu that appears)<br />
<br />
Once the sync is done, attempt to tap "text" from the contact's card and see if it works, preferably a contact you already have no message history with.<br />

            Hmm interesting, so I removed +44 from my handset (&amp; didn't sync with Windows Live) &amp; tried again &amp; the same thing, "can't send message, try again". So I guess that would suggest either the handset or provider?! Is that right?<br />
<br />
Update.. I'm looking to move mobile providers at the moment &amp; today have tested a different sim in my phone &amp; I get the same problem, so I guess this means a handset OS issue maybe?<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think :-) <br />

            Just to update as no one else has ;-)<br />
I have done a hard reset on my phone (ie. switched off, hold down the volume buttons on the phone &amp; switched on the phone &amp; selected reset) instead of a soft reset &amp; now I am getting txt messages withoutt any problems.<br />
Not sure if there is a difference in the reset options (I would have thought not) but thought it worth mentioning.. now to set up my phone again<br />

            Another update, just when you think it's fixed it isn't &amp; has got potentially worse!<br />
I have a contact who has sent me a SMS text &amp; I can't even reply to them, as well as the same problem as before, ie. not being able to initiate a SMS without being contacted first.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions, as this is driving me nuts!<br />

            Hi there<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if we are having the same problems as I haven't lost my Contacts, as all my Contacts are held centrally within my Hotmail acount, so even if I lost/replaced my phone they would sync to a new device without any problems.<br />
<br />
If however we are having the same problem then I do have an update. After numerous attempts to get Microsoft involved but not getting any useful answers I spoke with HTC who said they would report a bug to Microsoft as the problem appears to be how my phone
 uses the two separate fields for the mobile number within Hotmail.<br />
<br />
To explain, when you add a Contact within Hotmail, you must enter the mobile phone number &amp; a country code. These two fields should combine to give a UK number of +447******* for example, but with Hotmail Contacts it presents the number as +4407*******, so
 leaves in the preceeding 0 which is not a valid number format. They suggested a workaround that involved me manually removing the 0 from all my Contacts mobile numbers, which was very very time consuming.<br />
<br />
Seems madness to me that my Microsoft phone does not interact with my Microsoft Contacts, but I'm not sure if this is limited to my phone as an issue, but I suspect not as I have seen other reports of the same issue. I'm hoping someone from Microsoft can acknowledge
 the issue &amp; advise they are working on a solution.. but who knows!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :-)<br />

Samsung Ominia W, fully updated, xactly the same issue. Sometimes a restart/reset of the phone helps, but rarely. Contacts really need redesigned for mobile - Live contacts not suitable.<br />

    <title>Windows Mobile Device Center and Windows Mobile 5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewbelcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Mobile Device Center and Windows Mobile 5</h2>
                    I got a new computer with Vista and so have had to switch to Windows Mobile Device Center from Activesync 5.2.<br />
<br />
When I connected it, I was asked for a password, but there was no explaination for what password was being asked for. I tried a number of different passwords, trying to work out what it was actually asking for. I think I must have had too many attempts, as
 now I am not asked for a password, but I cannot get it to connect at all. It shows has having a connection in the network connections, but I am unable to connect in Windows Mobile Device Center, or find anything else.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what password is being asked for? How can I get it back to the stage where it is asking for that password so that I can actually put it in.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Andrew<br />

    <title>Incompatible Product Key and No Disk Drive for Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leannedube  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incompatible Product Key and No Disk Drive for Installation</h2>
                    I bought the Microsoft Professional Plus 2010 from my school to install on my Acer One netbook with Windows 2008. The computer does not have a disk drive to install the program, however I did not think that would be a problem since the 2010 app was already
 installed on the computer, all I needed was a product key. I paid for the disks and the product key, but when I enter it, I get an error saying the key is invalid. Upon further investigation, I find out the student version key is not valid with the retail
 version of Office 2010, and it is not valid for the downloadable version of the program on the Microsoft website. Is there a way to legitimately install this program on my computer, or did I just waste money?

            <p>An easy solution is to copy the contents of the disc onto a temp folder on a flash drive using a computer with an optical drive, then transfer the temp folder to the target computer using the flash drive, and then installing from the temp folder you copied
 onto the target computer.</p>

<h3> drew1903  say:</h3>
<h2>            Seek spelled S-e-a-r-c-h</h2>
                    <p>Something happened to come to mind, why doesn't matter... anyway, decided to share it, to mention it... not sure how much it's used, sometimes.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>A lot in the Forums speaks to finding things, accessing things, functions &amp; or data, navigating, drilling down. Point being, one can Pin things to Start &amp; or Taskbar.&nbsp; W/ Windows 10 that can, also, be to a Start menu, including, optional, Live Tiles. Will
 put this such that it can be applied to both 8.1&nbsp; and 10, as well as pre-8.1<br />
<br />
This goes for both a machine and the Net...<br />
<br />
"Seek &amp; ye shall find"&nbsp; IT translation, Search &amp; find.&nbsp; It's quick, easy, efficient &amp; effective.... use Search.<br />
<br />
Sure have whatever Tile or icon on Desktop &amp; Pinned to wherever BUT, whenever one wants something (data or other)&nbsp;and that includes doing something (a check, a tool, a function)
<strong>in 8.1</strong> &gt; Start screen or ALL Applications screen (same, hit Win key)&nbsp;and begin typing for whatever you have in mind... up it comes before one can finish typing.&nbsp; In
<strong>7 and 10 , </strong>hit Win key and begin typing, same deal... up comes whatever you needed.&nbsp; Still, simply using Search or Search box.
<br />
Usually can't finish writing whatever... couple of characters &amp; it has well gone to work... it's quicker than you
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwindowssecrets.com%2fforums%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fsmile.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saves SO much time, effort &amp; thought and UI &amp; OS not @ the heart of the matter as Search is across the board. Let the machine grab it or take you.&nbsp; Just give it your thought.&nbsp; Lessens where &amp; how.&nbsp; Keywords, phrases, both work.&nbsp; For CP items, too... path
 to cmd, for example... just write 'it' into the Search box or on those screens in 8.1<br />
<br />
No worries, just a passing thought; might save a lot of 'grief', maybe... always subjective.&nbsp; Try it, for a bit, maybe,&nbsp;if you're not accustomed to it, already.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<p>I can see no sign of BCM in Outlook.</p>
<p>It's clearly in a loop, so how do I install?</p>
<p>I have ACT 2010 installed - could that be the problem? I'm very, very loathe to unistall this, as it is my live CRM system. It is a pig to reinstall too!</p>

<p>&nbsp;**Just did another search and found the solution! Thankyou to Maxwell**</p>
<p>This works:</p>
<p>Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Run &gt; copy and paste the following text 'Regedit' without quotes in the Open field and then press Enter</p>
<p>locate&nbsp; the registery key&nbsp; 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager'</p>
<p>Check to see (on the right) if there is an entry named: PendingFileRenameOperations.&nbsp;<br />
If it is present it might have the value of a file Similar to this</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
PendingFileRen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_MULTI_SZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \‘\C \Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp\ose00000 exe</p>
<p>If that key is present then:<br />
1. Back up this registry key:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager<br />
It can be backed up by Right-Clicking on it and selecting "Export to file".</p>
<p>2. Delete ONLY the PendingFileRenameOperations value - NOT the Session Manager Key<br />
3. Immediately try running BCM Setup again.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac 15.11&#58; &#34;Connection to the server failed or was dropped.  Error code&#58; -3253&#34; &#40;POP mail&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the last update to Outlook for Mac (15.11) I've been unable to connect to any of my POP accounts. &nbsp;I get the following error:</p>

<p>
</p><p>My Exchange account is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what happened in the last update that could have caused this and, more importantly, how to fix it?</p>

            You might try going&nbsp;to Tools in the menu bar then selecting Accounts. Select the email account and&nbsp;uncheck the ssl connect checkbox. Close out and then try to get mail (Send/Receive). If that does not work,&nbsp;you may&nbsp;need to change the port numbers.
<p>Here is a page that gives all kinds of setting and infor for various accounts:</p>

<p>Maybe some of those settings will help.</p>

            <p>Thank you for trying to help! &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I tried all of that and none of it helped. &nbsp;In addition, the fact that this started immediately after the update makes it 100% clear that it is related to something they did. &nbsp;The update change log says "networking improvement," which in Microsoft
 speak means "we broke the networking." &nbsp;The problem is they are never convinced that they could have possible done anything wrong until one of their own geniuses finds it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution is to wait until they find out what we already know: the last update had a bug.</p>

            I also am having this problem immediately AFTER the update this morning.&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; I do not use exchange, have a POP mail account and now cannot get mail from Outlook.&nbsp; I can get other places, but this is a problem for a sole proprietor business that needs
 to link to MS calendar, etc.&nbsp; I wish MS would check their updates more thoroughly before releasing.&nbsp;

</p><p>Here is what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Remove Outlook v15.11 from Applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Install Outlook&nbsp;Microsoft_Outlook_15.10.0_Updater package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All account configuration and profile preserved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook v15.10 has back again~ </p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem solved (temporary)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish MS noticed this issue as serious matter, and resolved with next update!</p>

                    <p>
</p><p>When I went to "save as" for a new document and clicked "browse", it just started loading and wouldn't stop for 20+ minutes. In that time, it wouldn't let me access any of my other documents (the cursor was changed to a "loading" cursor) or close any of
 them. When I tried to close <em>any </em>of my documents it said that I "had a dialog box open", but it won't let me close said dialog box because it's stuck loading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't take any notes on it in class today so I closed it for a while. It had stopped loading when I got home, so I tried to save it again. It just caused the same problem all over again. This is my first time coming across this issue since I got my
 laptop last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the pre-installed microsoft office (365 personal) and my laptop is a hp cloudbook 14.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Is this a problem with one document or all documents or something in between?
<br />
<br />You may want to review How to Troubleshoot Problems that Occur When You Start Word
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/921541/how-to-troubleshoot-problems-that-occur-when-you-start-or-use-word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/921541...</a>
<br />
<br />Does it happen if you open Word in Safe mode?
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-O...</a>
<br />
<br />Safe mode is not a way to regularly use Word, but it is a valuable diagnostic step. If your problem goes away when you use Safe mode, we can walk you through other steps that may help eliminate the problem. Please write back.
<br />
<br />If it works in Safe mode, you may want to look at the following while waiting for more information from me or here on the forum.

<p>Sometimes programs get "confused".&nbsp; They can "hang", just do nothing, "twiddling their thumbs". Office programs do that fairly often. But most of the time it clears in just a couple of minutes. By the time it had hung for 20 minutes I would stop the program.
 To do that you would have to use the "task manager" (search for it in the Start menu).&nbsp; Find the problem program in the Task Manager, Processes tab.&nbsp; Right click on "Microsoft Word" and select "End Task". That will completely kill it.&nbsp; Another option would
 be to stop and start Windows.&nbsp; I'm guessing you used Windows "Sleep" or "Hibernate" when you took the computer home.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that you're unable to enlarge the print size when printing in Outlook.
<font>I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me go ahead and see how I will help resolve your issue.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I've actually simulated your issue and found that there's no option to do this if you're referring to enlarging the font size of your print. What I advise you to do is to download the email into MS Word and from there, adjust the font size
 of the email to be printed.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font><font>
<p>Write us back if you have other questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            OK, I apologize for my rant.&nbsp; (I have deleted it above.)&nbsp; I have found a solution... switch to Mozilla Firefox as your browser.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
In the upper left corner, click on the Firefox drop-down.&nbsp; Go to Print --&gt;Page Set Up.<br />
<br />
UNCHECK "Print to fit page width".&nbsp; (The greyed-out "<b>100%</b>" will turn black.)&nbsp; Click [OK].&nbsp; Problem solved.<br />
<br />
Incredible.&nbsp; After and hour of trying to find a solution, two minutes after I rant and take my frustrations out on you, I find the solution.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Again, I truly do apologize for venting at you!<br />
<br />
This may also work in Internet Explorer if you can find the "Print --&gt;Page Set Up".&nbsp;
<br />

            <p>The simple answer is yes, but depending on the font chosen your client may not be able to edit the received presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Font foundries can create fonts with different permissions. Most foundries put restrictive permissions on fonts to limit the ability of end users to pirate the fonts from documents. Not that I've ever heard of a single case of anyone stealing a font from
 a PowerPoint file, but technically it is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find out what permissions a font has by double-clicking on it. Initially you'll just see a preview of the font in various sizes. Click on the
<strong>Properties</strong> button in the upper right, then choose the <strong>Details</strong> tab in the Properties dialog. Look for
<em>Font embeddability</em>. Most commercial fonts are set to Preview/Print permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your client will get the following results depending on the corresponding permission:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Embedding</strong> - You simply can't embed these fonts at all.</li><li><strong>Preview/Print</strong> - You can embed these fonts, but your client will not be able to edit the resulting presentation. When they open it, they will see a dialog that says:<br />
"The presentation cannot be edited because it contains one or more read-only embedded (restricted) fonts. To edit the presentation, you must remove the restricted fonts, or you can open the presentation as read-only." Then the dialog states which fonts are
 read-only and displays 2 buttons <strong>Open Read-only</strong> and <strong>Remove Restricted Fonts</strong>.</li><li><strong>Editable</strong> - Embedding these fonts allows embedding and also allows the end user to edit the document using the embedded font. The fonts that come with Microsoft Office have an editable permission.</li><li><strong>Installable</strong> - The font is not only embeddable but can also be installed on the recipient computer. I've never actually seen any font with this permission.</li></ul>

<h2>            Can Windows Defender just erase any program it finds dangerous without asking me first&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Win Defender for years as main anti-virus, with no issue.</p>
<p>Lately, however, I've noticed that it's deleting software without questions asked, and notifies me after the fact. I have no understanding of what exactly Win Defender team is doing in order to set a software as threat, or the level of this threat, but here
 is one example where I find you are going over the line:</p>
<p>I am using software called "DriverAssist" to keep my drivers up to date. This software works great for me, it's been working great for almost a year now, it's fixed at least 2 drivers that Windows was unable to automatically install and saved me the trouble
 of googling everything and fixing this myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this morning, I wake up to the fact that DriverAssist has deleted this software. When I try to download it, I can't because "virus detected". When I ask for more details, you give me this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/using-defender#1TC=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 Defender Antivirus</a>&nbsp;detects and removes this program.</p>
<p>
This program makes misleading or fraudulent claims about the files, registry entries, or other items on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the one hand, this program has not made any fraudulent claims, no involuntary charges were made to my credit card and my computer works fine after installing it. It allows me to control if I open it at start-up or not, if I should schedule scans or not,
 so I really can't think of any good reason why you are doing this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you can just delete software from my computer and mark it as VIRUS for "misleading or fraudulent claims", this does not seem to be exactly accurate or fair. Here's the wiki definition, in case you missed it:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">A
 computer virus is a type of malicious software program ("</span><strong>malware</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">") that, when executed,&nbsp;</span><strong>replicates&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">itself

<p>Now, I tried restoring the program, and it worked for a bit, and then it got detected and deleted again, and you're just giving me a hard time using
 software I want to use and I know is safe to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For one, I suggest you re-evaluate this software. Then, I suggest you do not delete software that was installed for months without asking users first and sending a clear reason why the program should be deleted. "Fraudulent claims about files, registry entries
 or other items on your PC" is vague at best. Then, clearly differentiate between threats and their levels. I assume this process is done automatically, and in my case poorly, to say the least.

<p>This kind of fear mongering is exactly what is moving people from PC to Mac, from Windows to Linux.</p>
<p>You profit from offering users "security", but are acting like the drunk bouncer, throwing customers out just to show that you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Considering all this, here's my questions:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">1. How to allow this software through stubborn Windows Defender once and for good?</span></p>

<p>Hello and thank you for your time, PA Bear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. 2013</p>
<p>2. Windows 10 Pro 64 bit, installed 2-3 weeks ago. Initially the computer had no operating system.</p>
<p>3. Custom built by me.</p>
<p>4. Never used any other security except Windows Defender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. None</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Windows 10 Pro 1709 build 16299.19</p>
<p>
I hope my answers help, although I cannot see a direct connection.<br />
The post you gave me is from 2015, the software was completely different back then.&nbsp;<br />
To clarify, I am not looking to remove, but keep this software, which has been a tremendous help for me lately and for which I have a paid subscription.&nbsp;<br />
Windows Defender sees it as threat, I am imagining there is an answer for why, it's just not clear to me or not a publicly available answer. What can I do to keep this software on my computer? Right now, it's being deleted as soon as I download it. My friend
 who also has the Driver Assist installed is experiencing the same, so I doubt the answers above will be any good. What we need is a way to exclude this from Defender scan, or for Defender to actually mark programs correctly, instead of fear mongering unsuspecting
 users.

<p><span>There are lots of ways to take back control if you’re sure that a “threat” isn’t really a threat. You can just set an exclusion for the app:</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also turn off Automatic Remediation in order to get the option to allow threats immediately upon detection (when they’re detected on-access and are subject to Automatic Remediation):</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>This is actually a little more useful now that we’ve lost the ability to allow a detected threat in the new Windows Defender Security Center app.</span></p>

<p>I agree with GregMich, there are plenty of ways to include a threat in exclusions list. However, it's a matter of principle here. A false positive like this will likely destroy a small company that is providing useful service. This will affect so many customers,
 it's hard to count. Clients of whatever software MS marks as threat will be affected, and so will all employees of the software company, and everyone here is a MS customer. It's a really aggressive stance to have a false positive like the one reported here
 kept as a threat without actually investigating. The reasons offered are indeed vague, like JohnSka shows, so my only conclusion here is that MS is very successfully bullying the market, taking advantage of most customers' lack of technical knowledge. In fact,
 there is no international legal climate that any company can use against MS marking their software as virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is, once Microsoft will mark this Driver Assist software example here as virus, what can Windows user do to actually download this software? We can include it in the exclusion list once it is installed, but I just tested and the downloaded file
 is removed immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe this is just a classic case of whale versus small fish. Before it's even all debated, the small fish will be eaten and digested :)&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>It might not be easy to get Windows Defender to ignore what it sees as a “threat”, but we have to grant that vigilance is a virtue for security apps. I think you can probably download your app
 if you just turn off real-time protection and the Windows Defender SmartScreen. Then you’d need to set up your exclusions if they weren’t already in place. But that’s something that I haven’t done and wouldn’t do. I very seldom have issues with drivers; and
 when I do, I always go directly to the manufacturer’s website. Vetting a second-hand distributor isn’t always easy, and the scammers are everywhere these days. And that means that some honest people are going to get thwarted by overzealous security concerns,
 so I can understand where you’re coming from.</span></p>

Submit a file for malware analysis</a> - page at the&nbsp;Windows Defender Security Intelligence website.&nbsp; If the developer of an application doesn't wish to take the time or effort required to understand and remove the offending items that caused Microsoft to classify
 it&nbsp;as unwanted software or malicious software, then it will continue to be displayed as such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These criteria and rules are designed to protect those of us who simply don't have any wish to deal with items like DriverAssist, which is well known in the security and malware removal&nbsp;communities as a highly questionable application.&nbsp; I believe from what
 I've seen in these that Driver Assist has been properly classified, though as with GreginMich I'd never even think of using such obviously pointless software and so would also never personally know if it had cleaned up its act.</p>
<p>

 In most cases, more reputable organizations have simply moved on to the more modern and secure development tools that Microsoft has been attempting to get them all to use for several years now.</p>

<p>Rob,</p>
<p>Thank you for your articulated answer, honestly did not expect to be able to have an actual debate on the topic :)</p>
<p>While I can only agree with your arguments, I believe you are missing a few key points, that I'd still like to bring forth to this discussion:</p>
<p>1. While I included DriverAssist in the exceptions list, I noticed the installer was still being detected as threat. I noticed that the detection is inconsistent, as this software was found to be a high level threat, then "severe" threat, and now it's only
 a "medium" threat.&nbsp; This inconsistency makes it look more like there is no well defined way that Defender identifies threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. While I agree that Windows users can always go to the manufacturer site to grab their drivers, you are ignoring a considerable percentage of Windows users who are, in fact, computer illiterate, to various degrees. Such people (my own friends and family
 included), are frustrated with the fact that their choice is to either buy Apple for their "it just works" reputation and pay a high price, or buy Microsoft running PC, cheaper, with the risk that "it just does not work" from their point of view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The page that you provided that describes how Microsoft identifies malware... That is very specific, up to a point. It's either an old, not updated page, or simply incomplete. I currently see threat level as Medium, category as "Potentially Unwanted Software",
 and under Details, I see "This program has potentially unwanted behavior". The lack of any specific information on why this particular software is a threat just looks like inefficiency and injustice to me, and still points to exactly the kind of bully behaviour
 on Microsoft's part that I was talking about above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be 100% fair, once a user sees "severe" or "high" threat, they will be alarmed, and this is a point where MS just takes advantage of people's security concerns/fears. And in this case, Defender will just go ahead and delete it, so that's not right. Even
 in the case of a "medium" threat, with no specific information as to why this particular software (and others, I am sure) has been marked and/or deleted, it just looks like Microsoft can do anything it wants in regards to services provided by other companies.
 Wasn't it the same thing back in 2000 where Microsoft was ruled "an unlawful monopolist", basically destroying Netscape browser? It is, to a large extent, the same thing here. Microsoft is providing the same service (in this case, driver installation) as another
 company, so they will just try to destroy it while it is still small and can't possibly fight back. Who suffers? Well, the developers suffer, some customers suffer, but never really Microsoft, they are too big and a monopoly in too many areas of software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To end my argument: I have tried 3-4 driver installing software and concluded that this driver assist software is the only one that actually works 100%. It's also the only one that is detected as threat. Coincidence? I find that very hard to believe!&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>It does sound like there might actually be a problem with the classification of the app, and that it should actually be classified as a Potentially Unwanted Application. If it were properly classified as such, then the detection would not be made until
 PUA Protection was enabled. The default behavior for Windows Defender is to ignore Potentially Unwanted Applications:</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Of course it’s still possible that it shouldn’t even be included in the PUA classification – if it doesn’t actually meet the criteria. So the issue needs to be reported. I’m not sure about the status of this link, but you might want to give it a try:

6280 was confirming the previous post, you can't (can not) install the Symbian S60 OS on an S40 phone.

            for one thing you CAN NOT even upgrade an S60 v.2 to v3, nor can you update an S60 V3 FP0 to FP1, and the same is tru with S40...<br />
<br />
S40 CAN NOT be CHANGED to S60, note that it is not an upgrade, besides the fact that there are many hardware considerations which is one of the main reason that you can not put an S60 software in a phone that is using an S40 software...

            just consider my friend that you can't upgrade from s40 to s60 as much as you can't upgrade from windows xp to windows 7. Like the other guy stated, there are important hardware specifics that must be changed. Solution? Buy a more recent device that is
 built for and runs nokia series 60. That's it
