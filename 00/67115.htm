            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would need more information to help you better. Which version of browser are you using? This is probably a compatibility issue with your browser. If that's not the case, it would most likely be a firewall issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if the issue persists in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>. To boot in safe mode, check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17076/windows-8-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable any third party anti-virus installed on your computer and even the firewall. If the issue resolves after disabling the anti-virus, you might need to check the setting with the anti-virus or uninstall and reinstall it back. If the issue does not resolve,
 then make sure you enable the software back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more in-depth support regarding that error, we advise you to post your concern to
<strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet</a></strong> so we can get answers from our advanced users.</p>

<h2>            Selected disk has MBR Partition Table on a EFI system. Windows can only be Installed to GPT disks.</h2>
                    I am trying to install W7 Ultimate 64bit OS onto a computer that has UEFI BIOS, and I keep getting the message "Selected disk has MBR Partition Table on a EFI system. Windows can only be Installed to GPT disks"<br />
I used Mini tool partition software to change the drive to GPT, but the message I am getting now is "Setup was unable to create a new system partition or locate existing system pertition"<br />
After contacting the manufaturers of the Mini Tool Partition software, explaining the problem, they said I was doing all that was needed to be done, and to contact Microsoft.<br />

</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 and in the last week I have been having problems with wifi connectivity where I now cannot see or connect to any wifi networks. Everything else is working fine.</p>

If you have any version of Vista besides <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">basic</span></strong>, try using the Snipping Tool. You can save it to the folder you desire. Here is the

<p>
</p><p>Hi, I need help but with a different problem. I am using windows 10 now on this laptop and everything is different than on my PC with Skype. I just encountered this problem today trying to open my voicemail. I see the icon is different than it was this morning.
 I am not sure why it ask me to sign out in order to view my voicemail but it does it automatically and then it ask me for a password when I was already in my Skype account. I type in the password and then it says it does not recognize it but after about 10
 times it opens up and tells me there was an error and I need to access my voicemail from Skype again over and over. At it is now I cannot access my voicemail. It shows I have some but impossible to hear them as they will or is not allowing me to open them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I take it a step further and it takes me to live something with some other name I know nothing about and after I open that name up it is totally different than my own Skype name. It seems that Microsoft has created this problem and I wish I could delete
 that name but when I open that name it automatically goes back to my email address and there is no way it should be associated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can delete all these different names on my Skype account? I really need to get my voicemail as I have been with Skype for many years as a paying customer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*****</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Microsoft has my other email listed for a password code change for Skype and other accounts and when I request a code it will change the password to my email verification for the code account. I give up on Microsoft, they really need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist me if you can,&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks, </p>

<p>Is it after a system restart, or after you have powered the PC off then on again?</p>
<p>

<p>If this is the case, the method will alter depending on the make/model and mainly the type of PC.</p>

<em><strong>Coin Cell 2032 change</strong></em>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>There is a small shiny coin cell battery in your computer.&nbsp; It is almost always the standard 2032 .&nbsp; This battery is recharged by your computer but has a life of about 5 to 8 years.&nbsp; This battery keeps constant power to the memory that contains today’s date
 &amp; time as well as a lot of the features in your system.&nbsp; When it starts to fail, it commonly will start asking you to re-enter the date each time you startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Notebook PCs it is likely going to be difficult to find the battery and will require a special part, requiring the services of a technician.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Desktop computers, this is an easy change:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Unplug the power to your computer</li><li>Hold the ON button in for 7 seconds</li><li>Lay the computer on its side with the side where the wires are, down</li><li>Remove the side panel</li><li>Peer in there and you will see a shiny silver battery about 1/2″ in diameter.&nbsp; It looks like a quarter. &nbsp;That’s the battery</li><li>Go to just about any store and buy a 2032 coin cell battery.&nbsp; They cost less than $5</li><li>Find a very tiny flat bladed screw driver (like one used for your eyeglasses)</li><li>Very carefully pry the battery loose.&nbsp; It will pop up so be prepared to catch it.</li><li>Press the new battery in with the embossed markings on the up-side facing you.</li><li>Close the side panel</li><li>Turn it up vertical again</li><li>Start up the computer</li></ol>
<p>Your computer&nbsp;will now need to have the date and time set but only once more — at least for this 5 years.&nbsp; You need to enter the BIOS, which you do by pressing F2 &nbsp;immediately on startup&nbsp;&nbsp;in most systems to get to the place where the date and time is stored.&nbsp;
 Put in current time and date.&nbsp; Close this the way it tells you to save what you did.&nbsp; You may hear more whirring and chugging while some of the stuff is again set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once Windows is up and running again</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click once on the time/date in the bottom right corner</li><li>Click on Change date and time settings</li><li>Click Internet time</li><li>Click change settings</li><li>Select time.b.nist.gov and click the Update button — this will synchronize the computer clock with the US govt time labs system</li><li>Close</li></ol>

<h2>            How do I startup and use Windows 10 without entering a password&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I first upgraded to W10 my PC started up as normal. Suddenly, this week on switching on I get the cave scene and am required to enter a password.</p>
<p>Is there any way of disabling this procedure. The only people using my PC is myself and my wife. I do not want a password, I do not need a password and to be perfectly honest I wish I'd never done the upgrade. For my use it has nothing going for it.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to disable the the necessity to sign in.</p>
<p>I Have gone to settings and set that sign in option to never but does`not appear to affect start up.</p>

            <p>Hello krazykat9999,</p>
<p>We get this error when we are either unable to see the registry's system hive or it is actually corrupt.</p>
<p>In order to remedy this, we will need a Windows XP CD.&nbsp; If you do not have a Windows XP CD then you may borrow one from a friend for repair purposes.&nbsp; If we are unable to obtain the CD in any way, there is an alternative process that we can use.&nbsp; Please
 let us know and we will send this information as well if necessary.</p>
<p>To boot into recovery console, use the following article:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Description of the Windows XP Recovery Console for advanced users</a></p>
<p>After logging in, use the chkdsk command to check the drive for errors.&nbsp; <br />
This will take some amount of time and should not be interupted:</p>
<p>CHKDSK C: /p&nbsp; &lt;Press Enter&gt;</p>
<p>Again, this will take some amount of time to complete.</p>
<p>If this does not work, please refer to the following article to go back to a backup copy of the registry:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to recover from a corrupted registry that prevents Windows XP from starting</a></p>
<p>Let us know if you have any questions on this.</p>

<h2>            Bitlocker recovery key</h2>
                    Laptop suddenly shut off and then started a windows update. Now it wants a bitlocker recovery key. Had no idea what that was until today when this all started. Microsoft support was no help. Automated and kept sending me in circles to the same place that
 couldn't help me the previous times. Is there no one that actually works tech support on weekends? How do I find my bitlocker recovery without doing a reset?

            I have been to that page many times, as I feel like I am going in circles.&nbsp; I suspect I am locked out of my computer because I just graduated from college yesterday and I had a student subscription to Office365. It probably expired. I do not wish to reset
 my computer and it seems the only other option is to subscribe to onedrive or Office365 or some other paid service the automated operator mentioned on the tech support line. Not sure what it was because the office is closed&nbsp; so no one could help. I just want
 to get into my computer and there doesn't seem to be any way to get in unless I pay for a subscription or speak to an actual person.

            Hi Jaith.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unless your school encrypted the files on the PC and didn't give you a Recovery key then this is not normally how they'd take back your school Office 365 subscription.  It's way more than I've ever heard them do before.  
<br />
<br />But to be sure I'd contact the school tech Help Desk to ask them because it may be a known issue they can help you with.  Most schools that provide such software have Help desks to keep it running.  
<br />
<br />You don't even have to use Office 365 if they want their subscription back.  You can install the popular free LibreOffice or Open Office: <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.openoffice.org/</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice...</a> which are fully compatible and will open your existing Office files and work almost as well.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot find the Recovery key then I'd wipe the drive and reinstall  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do you have a file backup or can still sign into OneDrive to download your personal files from there?  
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder in Onedrive using Folder protection, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks.&nbsp; It's not an issue with my school subscription. Turns out that is good for another 6 months. Microsoft tech support says it's a Dell issue. Dell tech support says it's a Microsoft issue. This all happened after a windows update today. Tried bringing
 it up through cmd window. I'm only getting the numerical password, which is actually a 32 digit alphanumeric. Recovery key does not show. I never set up a bitlocker recovery key so I am effectively shut out of my laptop. Manufacturer reset&nbsp; cannot an option
 for me.&nbsp;

            You can go to another PC to create the bootable media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create the latest Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Wireless Network Connection properties error</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would like to know the possible causes for this:</p>
<p>When I&nbsp;click the properties of my wireless network connection status, there's a message being prompted out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Some of the controls on this property sheet are disabled because one or more other Network property sheets are already open. to use these controls, close all these property sheets and then reopen this one."</p>
<p>I can't proceed further.</p>
<p>I wonder why this message is being prompted out since I didnt open&nbsp;any other network properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            DVD RDL</h2>
                    I have windows 8.1 pro full version I just tried to copy pictures from my pictures folder to a DVD RDL and it asks me how I want to use the DVD like a flash drive using to delete and copy files to it? Or burn to it and nothing can be copied or deleted
 on it? I clicked use as flash drive it then formatted 8.5 GB's or close to that and I did not copy any files to it I ejected it, then later reinserted it and tried to copy picture files to it and it asked me to the same question again and tried to format it
 but showing 0GB's formatting and then windows could not complete the format and it closed, how do I use my old DVD RDL's I have many and I have not tried to use or burn one in years as in like 10 years. Is the problem I am having because of windows 8 not able
 to watch DVD's or use DVD's or what? I was no expert 10 years ago I know you needed software program to burn DVD's but I thought I could easily copy pictures from my pictures folder to it just in windows. But I can't what do I need

            <p>Windows has something called Live File system that will use packet-writing to format a CD or DVD so that it can be used like a floppy or flash drive.&nbsp; Packet writing is an inherently risky method of saving files and it should never be used to save anything
 important.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>Dual-layer DVDs can also be troublesome when it comes to being read by other PCs or drives, although most burners being sold today can handle them OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should use a flash drive if you want to be able to (a) save things you can afford to lose and (b)
 do a lot of copying and deleting.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to make an archival disc, you should be able to burn DVDs in Windows 8.1 without formatting the disc, but you will not be able to add to it or delete from it.&nbsp;

<h2>            hw do i import audio files from an mp3 player connected via usb port into my audio player on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a(n) Coby 828 mp3 player and I have no problem sending any type of file to it from my laptop. However, I cannot seem to send audio files from the mp3 player to my laptops media player in order to burn some music to a CD. Is there some way to do this

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What happens when you try to send mp3 files to computer? <br />
2. Do you receive any error message?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow these steps and check.<br />
a. Connect the mp3 player to my computer via USB cord. <br />
b. Once connected, either a pop-up will appear asking what you want to do. <br />
c. Click on open files to view. If no pop-up, go to My Computer and you should see it listed as a removable media/ drive. d. Open and then drag and drop or copy and paste to where you want them on your computer.</div>

Hi Alistair, <br />
<br />
Go to Start, Run, copy/paste the following command in bold type and click OK: <b>
services.msc</b> <br />
<br />
Can you see <b>Background Intelligent Transfer Service (</b>BITS<b>)</b> in the list of services? Here's a pix of what it looks like.
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04457aac-d84c-45e3-b8f1-349a3cf67b38" /><br />
<br />
If it's missing, do the following. <br />
<br />
Open the Windows Search tool, copy/paste the following and then click Search: <b>
qmgr.dll</b><br />
<br />
Search should show that file in the following locations:<br />
<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32<br />
C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\bits<br />
<br />
Provided they're all present, do the following to register the service.<br />
<br />
Go to Start, Run and copy/paste: <b>regsvr32 qmgr.dll</b> and click OK<br />
<br />
Do the same with this file: <b>regsvr32 qmgrprxy.dll</b><br />
<br />
Reboot the system and then copy/paste this command into the Run field:<br />
<b>%windir%\System32\rundll32.exe setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 132 %windir%\inf\qmgr.inf</b><br />
<br />
If you're prompted to insert the Windows installation CD, ignore that and in the dialog box at the bottom, change the path to
<b>C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386</b><br />
<br />
Restart the PC again and then go to Services and you should be able to see BITS in the list.<br />
<br />
Next, go to this link and install the&nbsp; IE8 cumulative November update:<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41074<br />
<br />
Finally, go to the Windows Update site and you should be able to download normally.<br />

Here's the general link for all the November IE patches. IE7 is the second one up from the bottom.<br />
<br />
http://search.microsoft.com/en-gb/DownloadResults.aspx?rf=sp&amp;q=KB2888505<br />
<br />
Try and install that even though you're getting the error when you try to start BITS.<br />
<br />
By the way, turn off Automatic Updates before you begin. If the IE7 installation is successful, you can re-enable auto updates again if you wish.
<br />

<br />
That indicates that BITS cannot download the files. <br />
<br />
Can you check in Services again and make sure it's present. If it is, double click it and then set the Startup type to
<b>Manual</b>. <br />
<br />
Next, click the <b>Log On</b> tab and make sure that all hardware profiles are set to "<b>Enabled</b>". There may only be one.
<br />
<br />
Then go back to the <b>General </b>tab and click the <b>Start </b>button. If BITS starts, go to the Windows Update site again and then try and download just a couple of files. This means you'll have to remove the checkmark from 103 of the 105 available downloads.
<br />
<br />
If it still fails, do the following. <br />
<br />
Click Start, Run, type: <b>notepad </b>and click OK. <br />
<br />
Copy/paste the following commands into Notepad:<br />
<br />
<pre>net stop wuauserv

OK, next step. <br />
<br />
Go to the Windows Update site, click <b>Custom </b>and then in the left hand menu, click the link to "<b>Review my update history</b>"<br />

Double click a couple of red Xs for failed installations which will launch a popup. In there will be the error code associated with the failure.

            This is a known issue with 1803. It has been happening with new update that new drive is getting uncovered and you start getting low space notifications. You can do following to hide it and there will be no harm anywhere.
<br />
<br />Type diskpart in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Diskpart and Run as Administrator
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />select volume g
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />remove letter=g

            Hi Bernadette.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> There is an issue where Version 1803 adds a drive letter to the Recovery partition that should be hidden because it's only used for bootable repair tools that in previous edition of Windows were on C drive.   Then it reports that it is full.  
<br />
<br />Look at your Disk Management by right clicking Start button to open Disk Management, examine the drive in question for it's size and position.  Is it a small drive around 450mb that isn't being used for storage or data by you?  If not then continue with my steps here to remove the drive letter.  If it is a data partition that you're actively using, then post a screenshot of Disk Management, which we read like a doctor reads X-rays:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />To remove the drive letter: 
<br />
<br />Since a smaller Recovery  partition is to meant to be hidden it can't have drive letter removed in Disk Mgmt like other partitions.   So you can wait for Windows Update to deliver a fix for this as promised, or take these steps now to remove it:  
<br />
<br /> 1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove. For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “D”, note the volume number for Drive D.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter.
<br />
<br />select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4. In the example above, if the volume number for drive G is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />remove letter=&lt;drive letter&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;drive letter&gt;, substitute the drive letter you want to remove. In this example, you would type: remove letter=G
<br />
<br />7. Close the Command Prompt window.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Microsoft is aware that previously-hidden partitions are improperly being assigned drive letters after installing the April 2018 Update.  As a result, they now appear in Disk Management and File Explorer.  These partitions are typically recovery partitions used by the Windows Recovery Environment or by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  It is not recommended that you attempt to delete or reformat these partitions as this may have adverse effects on your ability to recover Windows.  Microsoft is currently working to address the issue in a future Windows Update, and we’ll update this thread when a solution becomes available. 
<br />
<br />(Update 5/14/18:  The solution that will soon be released via Windows Update will only prevent this issue from occurring for devices that install the April 2018 Update after the solution is released.  If you've already installed the April 2018 Update and are experiencing this issue, you'll need to follow the steps below if you want to hide these partitions.)
<br />
<br />Although you can safely ignore these partitions, if you prefer do away with the low disk space warnings and hide the partitions so they no longer appear in File Explorer, you can do so by manually removing the partition’s assigned drive letter.  To do this:
<br />
<br />1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator:  Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove.  For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “G”, note the volume number for Drive G.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter. 
<br />
<br /> select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4.   In the example above, if the volume number for drive G is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />remove letter=&lt;drive letter&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;drive letter&gt;, substitute the drive letter you want to remove.  In this example, you would type: remove letter=G
<br />
<br />7. Close the Command Prompt window.

            Hi Bernadette, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume G
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=G
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />That's It1

<h2>            5 Minutes of DVR gameplay</h2>
                    I know that this feature of the Xbox One saving the last 5 mins of gameplay is supposed to exist, but I have no idea where to access it. I go to the Game DVR, but I only see my clips that I recorded. I want to be able to see the last 5 minutes of gameplay.
 Maybe this Is my error, or added to the long errors Microsoft have made with this console.

<p>5 is not enough anyways. &nbsp;I use ElGato so this doesn't affect me, however, for those that don't and rely on the gamedvr, 5 minutes is not long enough. &nbsp;20-30min would be sufficient (long enough for a MP match in most games to conclude).</p>

<p>I'm not sure of a 5 min replay option, but you can manually start and stop a Game DVR recording. &nbsp;"Xbox record this" only does the 30sec record, but by snapping out and starting a recording and snapping back in you can record as long as you want (I believe)
 and then do the same to stop recording.</p>

<p>You can use the Upload Studio to make a game clip that's about 5 minutes long. Then you can take that clip &amp; add another 5 minutes to it, &amp; so on... So, it takes work, but you can potentially have videos that are far longer than just 5 minutes...</p>

<p>ok, ive used the DVR extensively. I love doing YouTube montages and for a few years ive been without a PC. I started using the DVR to record moments almost every time I play and there's a whole bunch of annoying issues with it.</p>
<p>5 minutes is NOT long enough. I wish I could record full matches when I do good. Can't do that.</p>
<p>Xbox, record that. Doesn't always record what you wanted it to. In fact most of the time it records exactly before or after what you wanted it to. I've resorted in snapping the DVR and recording the last 5 minutes every time something happens. Which brings
 me to the next issue.</p>
<p>Recording the last minutes and then playing, even touching the controller while its capturing will most often than not give you glitchy, jumping game clips when you review them. So ive then again had to resort to doing absolutely nothing in game while its
 capturing the clip. And you absolutely have to wait for not only the notification to pop up saying clip recorded, but also wait for the snapped game DVR to also stop doing its thing and say "5min captured". Or you will end up with choppy glitchy corrupt clips.</p>
<p>If i capture less than 5 minutes, i do 3 sometimes, the DVR usually doesn't capture what i wanted it to. So many times ive had epic moments only for it to record me in the pause menu, or hiding in a bush, behind a wall, whatever i was doing waiting for for
 the DVR to capture the clip.</p>
<p>Capturing takes way too long. Seriously guys it takes like 10 min to capture a 5 min clip sometimes. And once in a while it will capture it instantly like i think it was intended to. This is few and far between though, maybe 4 times since ive had the system.</p>
<p>Upload studio issues, "sorry, there's something wrong with that clip and it needs to be removed". This has got to be the single most annoying BS thing to deal with when im trying to review and upload clips. Basically if you have a random clip that when you
 press the menu button on, it doesn't have a title and it cannot be saved, you can try to upload it or trim the back half of the clip and it will pop up with that error message and remove the entire clip from the upload studio editor. You can't do anything
 with a clip that does this except watch it. Can't edit, can't upload, can't do anything but completely delete it. And ive had many awesome moments ive had to delete because of this random no explanation garbage. The system is what captured it and the system
 is what has the clip. I see no real reason why it should be corrupt. </p>
<p>Lastly, while uploading your clips, you can't do anything but stare at it upload. If you have a 5 min clip it will take roughly 40 min to finish. You can't even watch tv while its uploading or upload studio closes. There's your top notch multitasking right
 there. I've resorted in unplugging my cable box from the Xbox just so I can watch tv while I wait for it to upload. And there goes another great feature I loved.

<p>Glactic Geek, you cannot add 5 min clips on top of anything that's over 5 min. Once you create a clip that's over 5 min it will not let you upload it. If you use the multiclip editing option, which gives you the option to put 5 clips in with each other,
 the total amount of time still cannot exceed 5 min, AND, it has to have at least 5 clips in it. Can't do any less. Every clip slot has to be full. Stupid.</p>

            You might even remove the sd card from the camera and check and see if the little switch on the side of it is in the locked position.

    <title>No connection to my network or internet after modem replacement - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No connection to my network or internet after modem replacement</h2>
                    I have recently had my modem replaced (by the same model) due to a recent random disconnection/connection problem. Now, one of my computers (running Windows 10) cannot connect to the network and internet or show any of the other networks (including mine)
 that are in the neighbourhood. I have talked to a number of "tech experts" at my ISP and they say it is a Windows 10 problem and that I should contact Microsoft to obtain the fix. This, despite the fact that I had reconnect the old modem and the computer worked
 fine. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

            IS it a USB modem that installs itself, IF so put in your old modem disconnected from the net and then insert your new modem into another USB port. Wait a while 3 mines if nothing happens unplug the old one. USE eject command.

            You can do a normal complete image restore (well close to normal) just using the&nbsp;USB&nbsp;Flash drive&nbsp;and a formatted, blank hard drive (with a system partition at least as big as the partition which it replaced) - and of course the backup drive.&nbsp; I see no
 reason why a bitlocker restore would be any different - after all, it's&nbsp;just added encryption to the process (though the exact procedure may vary because you may need to provide a password to authenticate the restore function and decrypt the files as they
 are restored - which is why it doesn't occur from the CD).&nbsp; Of course, this means you need to have done a complete image backup using bitlocker (not a full backup or a file backup).<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps.
