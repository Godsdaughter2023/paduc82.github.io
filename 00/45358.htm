    <title>Xbox One Region coding for blu ray and DVD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Region coding for blu ray and DVD </h2>
                    Hello. I live in the UK and received an XBox One on 22/11/2013 from Amazon UK. My problem is that it will not play my region b locked (UK and Europe) blu rays and DVDs. I get an on screen response of "This disc will not play due to the region code setting
 of the player". Everything else, as far as I'm aware is OK with the Xbox One. I would expect for the Xbox One that is supposedly set up for the UK market to accept my discs. Has anybody else been affected by this problem. Anybody have any ideas? Any solutions?
 Thanks.

<p>Hmm that is certainly odd. When I get my new system with working optical drive I am going to try using my UK region blu-ray disks in my american x1 and see how it works. I know the system is not supposedly region-locked, but with movies that may be something
 different. Yours not playing the disks of your region is the first I have ever heard of anything like that. Are you using that blu-ray player app from the Live marketplace?</p>

<p>Yeah. You don't have any other option but to download it from app store. I do find it odd that it's caused this problem. Never had to download any software before to use a blu ray player. Always worked straight out of box. Not contacted Microsoft support
 yet. </p>

<p>Are none of your blu ray or dvds working? That would be extremely odd if none worked. If none worked you might have a an American xbox.</p>

<p>Ok just to update you guys.</p>
<p>My uk xbox wont play usa standard def region 1 dvds</p>
<p>It will also not play usa blu ray region A dvds</p>
<p>It will play region free blu rays and region B blu rays and region 2 standard def dvds.</p>
<p>So its basically same as a normal uk blu ray player.</p>
<p>I thought there was a rumour that the x1 was region free blu ray. Unless it means the games are region free and playable on any x1</p>
Either way im happy coz ill only be using it as a games console

<p>Yeah they mentioned region free, but likely they meant for games and even there I think they said only region free where allowed.

    <title>Surface Pro Type Cover - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meenalpatel1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro Type Cover</h2>
                    <p>Hi...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently did an update on my Surface Pro (5th gen) and the type cover stopped working a few hours later. The touch pad works, but not the keys. I have done every solution I read online.. Updated keyboard drivers, two button reset, updated firmware, uninstalled
 keyboard drivers and then re-installed, reset computer, cleaned the keyboard connections. Nothing has worked!!! I'm at my wits end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in the UK and am currently traveling in Africa, so I have no access to a Microsoft store. Is anybody able to help me????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!</p>

            <div>You probably tried re-installing the typecover driver (and this should have been</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.Select the search box in the taskbar, enter device manager, and select Device</div>

<h2>            Automatic repair - Your PC did not start correctly  loop</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello, i am having this issue and i have tried many ways in fixing it however i have not been successful. I have a self build PC and i haven't encountered any problems with the PC for around a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifications:&nbsp;</p>
<p>OS : Windows 10</p>
<p>CPU: AMD Athlon x4 x845</p>
<p>GPU: AMD RX 460</p>
<p>Storage: 1 SSD(60GB) containing Win10, 1 HDD with 500GB with most of my files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, i have tried pressing advanced options --&gt; troubleshoot --&gt; reset this PC --&gt; keep my files and remove everything, however it runs in to a problem with the message "there was a problem resetting your PC. no changes were made" and for remove everything
 option it says "there was a problem resetting you PC". The solutions i tried for this was sfc /scannow in CMD but this gives an error "windows resource protection could not preform requested operation". The second thing i tried was chkdsk /r c: with CMD, but
 this has an error "failed to transfer logged messages to the event log with status 50". Something else i tried was DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /systemrestore and the error "dism doesn't support servicing windows PE with the /online option" shows. I have
 also done these about 3-4 times each with and without safemode and safemode with networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, i have tried disable early-launch anti-malware protection and the error still persists. Same issue with start-up recovery option in troubleshoot --&gt; start-up repair. System restore and system image recovery have the errors "not restore points have
 been created on your computer's system drive" and "windows cannot find a system image on this computer" respectfully. I have done bootrec.exe /fixmbr, /fixboot , /rebuildbcd and /scanos (also says total identified windows installations: 0, I am not sure if
 its supose to to say 1); anywho, the error loop persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, i have tried using a bootable flash drive with windows 10 setup. I press advanced options --&gt; use a device --&gt; then pick my USB. Then i click : next --&gt; repair your computer --&gt; troubleshoot --&gt; start-up repair --&gt; windows 10. I wait for about an
 hour then the error "start-up repair couldn't repair your PC" shows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thing i was doing on the computer was coping over normal documents from my PC to a flash drive, then i left my PC idle to which i arrived at this problem after 2-3 hours. I suspect it may be a driver issue with the Flash drive i was using, however
 i don't know how to make sure its a driver issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You!</p>

            So i have tried what the link suggested and used different configurations for my RAM sticks(i have 2 x 4GB RAM and 2 ports on the motherboard) to see if any were corrupted, i reset the BIOS but sadly i didn't receive any errors related with the RAM; also
 i can't test the RAM as windows wouldn't boot to desktop. I can't remover the GPU since my motherboard has no built in graphics as well as the CPU. So now my computer is only connected to a keyboard, mouse, monitor, the GPU, the one SSD with windows and the
 2 x 4GB RAM sticks.&nbsp;

<p>P.S. and it still wouldn't allow a hard reset or allow me to install a fresh copy. I also disconnected the SSD with the HDD connected and a USB with windows setup to install win10 on the HDD but it says you can only have one copy of windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing i can do is format the SSD but I am unsure if it would wipe windows 10 aswell.</p>

<p>Yes, but i can disconnect it and use the USB to boot from. I was trying to install windows the HDD but it failed. The SSD has the installed version of Windows 10 and the USB has the setup tool for Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT : when i say boot, i don't mean boot me to the desktop, it takes me to the setup screen which allows me to set keyboard/input methods, time/currency format and language.</p>

            Can you try signing in using the email address and password associated with your Skype ID?
<br />
<br />Can you go to a desktop computer running Windows, macOS or Linux then try signing in from there?
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your smartphone?
<br />Which version of Android is installed?
<br />
<br />Try below steps and see if the issue still persists:
<br />
<br />Go to your Phone settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.
<br />
<br />Look for Skype and then select Force Stop &gt; Clear cache &gt; Clear Data &gt; Uninstall.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling, kindly do a reboot on your device.
<br />
<br />Once it pop-up, please install Skype using Google Play Store.
<br />
<br />After installing Skype, please do another restart before signing back in. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Go to APK site, APKMirror <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.apkmirror.com/</a>, and downloaded and installed and voila! the problem was fixed. It installed Skype for Android 8.25.0.5, which actually I prefer to the previous version I had.
<br />
<br />Don't know if this would be an approved solution for Microsoft, (I did do malware/virus scans on the file and the site appears to be reputable), but it worked for me.
<br />
<br />Thought you might want to know, it could be an option for people like me, since their device is not rooted, who can only disable but not uninstall and reinstall Skype for Android.
<br />
<br />Actually, this is effectively a reinstall in all but name, but for it to work, you do have to enable "unknown sources" in the security options on Android.

            First open a browser and verify whether your Microsoft account login ID and password combination is working.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a>
<br />
<br />If login ID and password is all-right, reset your Skype client on Android.
<br />
<br />Open Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Locate Skype &gt; ForceStop &gt; Say yes to prompt if any comes (You won't lose any data) &gt; Now uninstall and reinstall Skype from Play Store.

<p>You do Realise that Bungie is expanding and doing different things. Meanwhile 343 industries is taking on the saga, 343 Industries is a group of Bungie employees and some new people from Microsoft. The Halo Series is not over. There will be more Bungie day's
 but on different games "This is an asumption" but bungie will always be there and if you are worried go to there website and summit a discussion there.</p>

<p>Correct. Neither Bungie nor Halo are going anywhere for the forseeable future. I just checked out Bungies Lates game: Crimson steam pirates. (aka pimps at sea). Halo: CE anniversary is looking fantastic too.</p>

<p>What was your favorite moment of bungie day, and whats your&nbsp; favorite Halo quote. What is the most memorable moment of Halo for you? Bungie has sent Halo out with a bang... but its just getting started.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Favourite moment of Bungie Day:&nbsp; Getting Blue Flames.</p>
<p>Favourite Halo Quote:&nbsp; Too many to list.</p>
<p>Most memorable Halo moment:&nbsp; A 2 hour <em>Halo Wars</em> match that was a war of attrition in which I won.&nbsp; Nothing to do with Bungie directly though.</p>

<p>Good question. I will be a reduced-price title right off the bat, which helps. If you play MP halo its a no brainer but if you just do SP? .... Personally I think so. There is new content there (terminals are great) and some other bonuses hidden throughout
 so it will let you unfold more of the halo story, which I know you like.</p>
<p>If you have a 3D tv it looks great too. It doesnt look like just a reskinned old game.oh, and it has multiplayer and achievements to boot.
</p>
<p>I was on the fence before but now that I've sat down with it, I'm considering it a 'buy'.</p>
<p>Of course tastes are subjective so mileage may vary.</p>

            Assuming the issue is with Windows.
<br />To better diagnose the issue,
<br />Right click Start&gt;Command Prompt-Admin and type in the following command:
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />You will get a window, take a screenshot using snipping tool and paste it it next reply.

<h2>            Skype Icon in MAC dock no longer has a red indicator dot showing someone has started a conversation</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed the latest Skype Update and it is entirely different in that it is no longer obvious that someone has started a conversation. I have the skype alias on my&nbsp;dock which is on the left side of my screen. I run skype all day long and have
 many windows for different programs open on my computer. I would only respond to a message when I saw that red dot showing me that someone was talking now that is gone.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Fresh start</h2>
                    Hi y'all. First let me say that there isn't much on my pc that is of any vital importance to me or anyone in my household. Since all my pictures have somehow changed to read only, yet everyone here has full access but I cannot make use of them at all,
 and have probably somehow screwed something up in there that I do not know how to fix. So...I am considering doing a&nbsp; "Fresh Start" through the Defender program. I originally started with Windows 8 and was given Windows 10 for free shortly after I purchased
 the PC so I do have info on the 10 program and it is linked to my Microsoft account. I honestly thing that just getting it back to like new is my best option because&nbsp; 1) my grand daughter used it quite a bit when she was 9 and 10yrs old and it's hard to tell
 what she may have downloaded and quite frankly it's hard to tell what I may have as well. There's so much stuff that I am completely oblivious to in the file lists that i am overwhelmed with it all. Also, recently I was ta

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Reinstalls the version of Windows that your PC came with (either&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;or&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8.1) and removes your personal files.</li><li>Removes apps and drivers you installed.</li><li>Removes changes you made to settings.</li><li>Reinstalls any apps your PC manufacturer installed on your PC.</li></ul>

 thought that whatever it showed I should remove. But that was after the PC started messing up and my files had already gone missing. I don't have USB drives and discs and such, but what about the Activation Wizard or Troubleshooter that it refers to in the
 Defender part of Settings? Wouldn't it work to the same result? That Fall Creators Update was when I first started noticing things were gone. I could never get it to update into my PC. Finally, that 1st link isn't loading which is yet another issue I'm having.

Go ahead and do the fresh start from Defender then. The first link just worked for me. So I don't know why it didn't for you. It is much simpler to use the Fresh Start so go ahead. If you do not want to save any of your files and to me it sounds like you shouldn't

    <title>Offline System Link Problems With Gears Of War 2 And 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bl4nk fl4nk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Offline System Link Problems With Gears Of War 2 And 3</h2>
                    
<p>I am posting every piece of information I have since I haven't seen a single solution to this problem yet. I have one downloaded copy of Gears of War 1 from the Judgment preorder. I have one copy of the Gears of War Triple Pack, containing one disc copy
 of Gears of War 1, and one disc copy of Gears of War 2. I have four disc copies of Gears of War 3, and one disc copy of Gears of War Judgment. I have two Xbox 360 Slims. I have every Gears disc installed on my main console, and I have every single map pack
 for every Gears game downloaded onto both Xbox 360 Slims. I have three Xbox LIVE accounts, two of which are only a 1 month membership for now, but I plan on Family Pack blah blah. Being connected to Xbox LIVE, everything works perfectly fine and how it was
 meant to operate on every Gears game, including Gears of War 1, Gears of War 2 and Gears of War 3. I can't say it works on Judgment, because I only have one copy. Overall, there is no problem there. The problem I, along with MANY other Gears gamers on this
 VERY FORUM, is that my offline Gears System Links are a fail. I can load the downloaded version of Gears of War 1 on my main console, I can insert my disc copy of Gears of War 1 in my secondary console, I can System Link both consoles together for any game
 type, and I can maintain that connection for as long as I want. I tried to do the same with both disc copies of Gears of War 2. The secondary console was able to connect to my main console and join my game, even long enough for the match to load up and for
 me to switch to my Gnasher. Within seconds, "the connection to the host has been lost," and Teklom and REGIPONY left the game. I've tried switching hosts, signing in as Teklom on my main console. The problem persists. I signed out of Teklom and signed into
 REGIPONY, and hosted the match. We were able to get into the game, but within seconds, "the connection to the host has been lost." I signed back into BL4NK FL4NK, and let Teklom and REGIPONY both individually host the match, where the same problem arose. Gears
 of War 3 suffers from this same exact issue. I have read that many people have switched from Ethernet to CAT5, from Ethernet to CAT6, from Ethernet to Crossover Cable and every combination in between, to which no solution has prevailed. Many people have even
 chose to connect their System Link wires through a modem or router, and then into the other console, but this did not solve anything either. I tried deleting and re-downloading all my GamerTags, but it did not work. I've tried deleting all the map packs off
 of both consoles, but the problem was still there. I tried re-downloading all my map packs, and this did not work either. I tried deleting the disc copy installations that were on my main console, and it still had no reward. I re-installed all the discs onto
 my main console, and I even made space to install the Gears of War 3 disc onto my secondary console, but I still had no solution. I have not changed the MAC address of either Xbox 360 Slims. I have not changed any network settings on either console. They both
 connect to my Wireless Router, and they both have an Open NAT type, but listen to this: The Xbox 360 will not remain connected to Xbox LIVE forever. It will one day become obsolete. I hope to one day introduce my future unborn children and my future unborn
 children's future unborn children into the Gears Universe. I want them to experience the joys(and sorrows) of playing Gears of War. Having multiple screens and multiple Xbox 360's just makes it even better, especially when there are 10 people who are all well
 known and loved by each other all enjoying one game together as if it were the Superbowl Sunday. Please, somebody find a solution to this problem. I will forever be grateful. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>*Update* I've even tried deleting my system cache on both Xbox 360 Slims. This did not work either. Changing the DNS does not work either. The discs are in fairly moderate condition. The game does not freeze. The game does not exit and return to the Xbox
 Dashboard. The game does not sign any Gamer Profiles out.</p>
<p>**Update** STILL nothing is working. I've even tried adhoc now. Still no solution? Nobody knows what to say? Why doesn't anybody figure this out? It has been 176 (ONE-HUNDRED SEVENTY-SIX) days since I posted this thread, and it even has 512 (FIVE-HUNDRED
 TWELVE) views now!!!</p>
<p>***Update*** I originally posted this thread on the Epic Games Forums. I'm updating and re-posting it here.</p>
<p>****Update**** I am now updating and re-posting this thread on the Xbox Support Forums. I have now tried to System Link a game of Gears of War 2 AND 3 on two completely different consoles other than my own two. The same problem persists. I have tried talking
 to Xbox Customer Support before, and I am not the sole person having difficulties with this. Try for yourself, and you will see what I mean. Turn off your router and try starting up a system linked game of Gears of War 2 or 3 for more than 10 minutes, with
 no internet around your consoles. I encourage people to tell me their success stories. I've heard multiple times that an update bugged it. I guess it might be a plausible reason, seeing how Epic Games never addressed the issue, and Xbox Customer Support told
 me last time I contacted them to bring my issue to Epic Games. Now I will post my issue here, and I will now continue to re-update both threads, the one at "http://forums.gearsofwar.com/showthread.php?1652-Offline-System-Link-Problems", and the one here, once
 every month until the Xbox 360 no longer supports Xbox LIVE. My post on the Black Tusk Studios Forums now has 15 (FIFTEEN) views, and 1 (ONE) reply, advising me to post this issue here on the Xbox Support Forums. Once again, I will be monitoring both posts
 monthly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player and OneDrive</h2>
                    I am using Windows Media Player with Windows 10.&nbsp; I have deleted Groove Music.&nbsp; I prefer Windows Media Player. I have all of my music saved to OneDrive.&nbsp; I have other copies on my hard drive.&nbsp; Windows Media Player sees both and in the Library it shows
 two copies.&nbsp; How do I limit it to seeing only one copy without having to delete the files from my hard drive.&nbsp; I want the One Drive to stay in case I need to reformat, but I also want to keep copies of my files on my HDD in case I lose internet.&nbsp;<strong><em>What
 setting is there that will limit my viewing of one or the other and possibly separate the two?&nbsp;</em></strong> The problem is when I try to add them to a playlist, Windows Media Player adds two copies of each song.&nbsp; I only want one copy of each song. &nbsp;

<p>You may not understand how to use OneDrive effectively. You do not need to have a separate local copy on your computer;&nbsp; the local copy (sync'ed w/ OneDrive) should be fine.&nbsp; If you decide to reformat your hard disk, that will not delete the cloud copies.&nbsp;
 When you reinstall Windows &amp; it prompts you to login to OneDrive, doing that will re-download all your OneDrive music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, if you temporarily need the space on your local computer, you can use the OneDrive settings to "unlink" your account.&nbsp; Once that is done, you can delete the local copies.&nbsp; When you want them back, just start up OneDrive again, &amp; it will download all
 your music.</p>

            These **** don't know what they are talking about. It's simple, I have the same problem. Just open Windows Media Player and go to Organize - Manage Library - Music. There you can delete or add the location where music is stored and synced. In your case,
 just delete the OneDrive folder in the menu then you won't see two copies anymore.

    <title>CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED after update to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED after update to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1 some weeks ago. After few hours of use, watching a video, the blue screen showed UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION: I had to restart and I had to disinstall McAfee but unfortunately it didn't solve the problem. Than I
 start receiving a new error, CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED. This happens almost everyday. &nbsp;The blue screen shows "we are getting informations" but the percentage doesn't increase at all, the computer freezes.
</p>
<p>I had to send the notebook to assistance on July beacuse of some problems, I don't want to damage the hard disk another time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus Zenbook UX301L</p>
<p>I've installed Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you very much,</p>

            <p>I have the same problem with my Asus ZenBook UX301L and Windows 10 Enterprise 1607 (OS Build 14393.82)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since one year I experience crashes (BSOD), display freezes (a few seconds or permanent), display driver restarted by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to come from display driver compatibility with this hardware. This PC worked fine on Windows 8 and windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regularily updated the driver from Intel driver download. The last version <span>
15.40.25.4463 (</span>20.19.15.4463 reported by Windows Device Manager).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to have a true analysis of the problem with this computer and it's display under Windows 10. The generic BSOD documents aren't helpfull.
</p>
<p>

            I assume your "924 printer" is really a Dell Photo All-in-One Printer 924.<br />
<br />
I also assume your "error #1203" says something like "Cartridge Error 1203."<br />
<br />
If both of those assumptions are correct, the message means that your ink cartridge should be replaced.&nbsp; Are you using genuine Dell ink cartridges or are you using cut-rate ink cartridges?<br />
<br />
You may be able to continue using the current cartridge by means of the "Scotch® tape" fix described here --&gt;

<br />
<p>Error 1203 is a very interesting error code. Here is what I found out about error 1203</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error 1203 is a very interesting cartridge error. It means your catridges overflow even from brand new catridges after a several prints or right after you refilled the catridges. Check to see if ink are smeared on the holder where the contact panel with
 the cartridge</p>
<p>Solution:<br />
I use the lint free cloth(coffee filter work great) with a few drops of water to dampen and clean off those contact on the holder and my printer work again.<br />
Then before you print anything, you should run aligned the catridges a couple times then run clean catridges a couple times.<br />
Print the test page to see how it's look and way you go.<br />
Be sure not to leave any debris of lint free cloth(coffee filter work great on those holder contact panel.</p>

    <title>Xbox One faulty touch-sensitive power button&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One faulty touch-sensitive power button&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've got an old Xbox One, one of the originals that has a touch sensitive power&nbsp;button. Over the years I've not been very active on it. Around 2014 I noticed when in really hot weather, it would register power button touches on its own, making it turn off or on randomly. In the winters it seemed to be a bit better, but since recently,&nbsp;often I can't get it to stay on, even though it is very cold weather. I touch power, hear the power tone,&nbsp;it boots up and then I hear the power button tone again without touching it&nbsp;and it just switches off.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>I wonder what's the solution? I want to sell it but if there is a fix that wouldn't cost too much&nbsp;it would be better to sell in working condition. Thanks for any help!</p>

                    Hi, I am an administrator on my laptop that's running Windows 10. I went to my accounts page to remove some of my old accounts, when I clicked on the remove button, literally nothing happened. The blue wheel came up and that was it. No error message, or
 completion message. I THEN clicked on the "Change Account Type" button and same thing. What's going on and how can I fix it.
