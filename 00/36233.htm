                    <p>Facebook app gives error "Invalid source"&nbsp; when trying to play videos posted to Facebook.</p>
<p>Anyone had this error, and is there a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info - it seems that the videos in the Channel 9 app don't play either - I just get "the video failed to play"</p>

            <p>Same here. Two monitors and an nvidia GTX 980. I had to reintall the OS but today have had no issues with driver 353.30. The OS hasn't tried to change it. So fingers crossed. But I agree that windows should let the user decide when and what drivers to install
 so these things won't happen. This idea was bound to fail as soon as I heard they were going to try it. But live and learn I guess. I really hope they fix this quick so we can stick with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If you right click my PC and go to Advance System Settings then Hardware then manage Device Drivers there is an option so the OS won't try and install Device Drivers. Now I just changed it on my computer so I don't know if it works yet. But you guys
 should give that a try.</p>

            This is absolutely ridiculous, Allow users to do optional driver downloads for Hardware it is that simple, When I tested the OS and it wasn't to problematic. What happen between march and launch of the OS that is causing so many issues? It is nuts the
 amount of work that I as a user has to go through to fix my pc. Again make hardware updates optional as it is clear you have done next to NO in house testing of hardware that the general population would have. That includes basic card models from Nvidia of
 400 series to the SLI/980TI.

            <p>Updated to Windows 10 on July 30. Starting with the very first reboot the recovery menu pop up. First times I was able to call System Restore. Read about Nvidia drivers causing problems so I tried uninstalling before rebooting and it worked fine, at least
 for a few times. Then I started getting a blue screen with the message "Your PC ran in a problem and needs to restar. We're just collecting some error info, and the we'll restart for you...VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGMENT_INTERNAL" but it never got to the Log screen.
 Couldn't even log in Safe Mode...so I tried resetting Windows 10, and it failed. After losing almost all day I had no other choice but to "Reset to the Windows version that came with this PC".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone fix this issue soon, til then i'm sticking with 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: sorry for my bad English, hope it was clear enough</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think I got it working after a few reformats. So here's the fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't install, I repeat, <strong>don't install </strong>your Box or OEM&nbsp;version&nbsp;graphic&nbsp;driver when setting up windows 10. Let windows update do a clean install of the driver on your graphic cards. It should work after that. I haven't tested this, but&nbsp;it
 might&nbsp;help to&nbsp;uninstall your graphic&nbsp;drivers before upgrading to windows 10. </p>

            <p>It really feels bad when a well working PC shows abnormal behavior after having an upgrade which is highly in demand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest all facing this issue to please <strong>UPDATE YOUR GRAPHICS DRIVER FROM WINDOWS UPDATE AND YOUR NVIDIA DRIVER FROM "NVIDIA WEBSITE" BEFORE WINSDOWS UPDATE INSTALLS THE NVIDIA DRIVER. THE LATESE NVIDIA DRIVER IS PRESENT IN ITS WEBSITE, SO
 PLEASE BE SPECIFIC WITH YOUR NVIDIA GRAPHICS CARD MODEL AND ITS DRIVER FOR WINDOWS 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Better keep the nvidia driver 353.63 windows 10 qualified driver downloaded and ready before upgrading. Hope everybody of you succeed in this process.</p>

catastrophic issue reported at NVIDIA</a>. Thought it was a problem with the driver. So it's a Windows problem with the current (2015) ISO then? Long time, no fix!

<h2>            Gears of War 4 account issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago I decided to play again to Gears of War 4 on PC.</p>
<p>When the game starts, it first says that the account used in the Windows store is different from the one used in the Xbox live account.</p>
<p>Then, I receive another popup saying that it cannot synchronize data in the cloud.</p>
<p>And on the main screen, on the top right it shows that I'm logged with my (Xbox live) account, but unable to connect to services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disconnected from my account inside the game, checked the email addresses used in the Windows store, Microsoft account and Xbox live account. And they all match!</p>
<p>I have to say that I changed my email address a few months ago from an unused @msn to my main @gmail address. But everything looks good from my point of view.</p>
<p>I also completely re-installed to game, but it doesn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I miss something ?</p>
<p>Has anyone had the same issue ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fabian.</p>

            If possible try logging out of your gamertag in the Xbox App on the PC then restart the PC.&nbsp; After that relog your tag into the Xbox App and see if that works.&nbsp; It may be an issue with the email change.

    <title>Why is Windows 10 repeatedly re-re-redownloading after a failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theodisc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows 10 repeatedly re-re-redownloading after a failed install</h2>
                    <p>I live in a lodge. I have to use wi-fi that is, to be ununctuous slow, intermittent, unreliable and just plain EXPENSIVE. I do not have the luxury of having uncapped data using a Precious ethernet cord on my very own personal dearly belovèd, yet now bereaved
 static IP address from my own IP provider de choix any more in the privacy of my former home of twenty-one years. I'm now, for now, stuck existing, living in a boarding house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, I digress. Why is the upgrade re-downloading after it fails to install? Why isn't it still sitting waiting to be reinstalled in my hard drive once I have removed the offending program that was stopping and error coding it from installing? Why are
 you making me spend another ten dollars on more data each time it's not there where it should be upon reboot after a failed install? Surely the annoying program that has been irradiacated[sic] from my Aurora R4 par moi (the offender was PSI Secunia I believe)
 would not cause a mighty OS such as Windows 10 Upgrade to just shatter would it? It must be somewhere hiding in Windows 7 for me to directly re-install it, must it not? Can you tell me where so I can go straight back to re-installing sans the expensively expensive
 Windows 10 re-re-download please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw MS, you really should owe me a tenner after the first time I had to re-download this "up"grade.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Can you or another kind helper please tell me how to access the downloaded Windows 10 update in my computer please so that I can try to reinstall it. I'm trying all that you ask, but the thing will not install. I'm seriously not re-downloading it all over
 again for a fourth time. I just do not have the data left, nor the money to buy any more data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this upgrade not available for free on a disc so that I can install it myself without all of these hassles? I cannot even find the download in my system to try to re-install it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm seriously having second thoughts about using Windows 10 if problems have already arisen before I can even get the thing to install properly onto my super computer. If it will not even install properly then it already looks to me like it is a candidate
 for Windows 8's lemon status. This is causing me to get the warning bells already: First Internet Explorer, then Windows 8, and now Windows 10, although hopefully I will turn out to be very wrong about the tertio.</p>

            <p>I'm seriously having trouble getting this installed. I've just found out today that the upgrade has used yet ANOTHER three whole gbs of my precious data yet all over again re-downloading this infernal upgrade for the FOURTH time now, even although I do not
 have this upgrade ticked to do so. I did not give it permission to re-download the upgrade, yet it is doing so even tho it is not &nbsp;ticked in "optional" updates to do so. There is even enough room in my OS HDD for it to be installed to, yet I get given an oblique
 code that says I need to disable what ever it is to move this thing forward and get it installed. It's not retrying to install when I restart the computer either and every time I try to click on the upgrade history in updates it starts it's rigmarole re-downloading
 again which I already have, the gods know where, somewhere in my HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to find where one of these downloads is so that I can try to re-install the thing. This has gone from a mission to grind to an expensive impediment.</p>

            <p>Who is MS kidding?&nbsp; Windows 10 Upgrade is in no way free!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the past six months I've spent literally days, if not weeks of my time,&nbsp;waiting in phone queues, staring at a PC that requires responding to "Try Again" on a network glitch, getting "UnKnown" errors, that thousands have seen too, only to have "Restoring
 your previous version of Windows" (Win 7 Prof.&nbsp;64) shoving me back to downloading AGAIN over a supposed "high speed" connection that drops without my provider taking responsibility.&nbsp; from MS's CEO to the lowers support person, none of them would work those
 hours without compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft..</p>
<p>SHAME&nbsp;for...</p>
<p>1) not allowing the download to remain available on the PC for subsequent attempts..</p>
<p>2) leaving a VERY commonly experienced error in the "Unknown" state..</p>
<p>3) not allowing the media creation tool be an upgrade tool to&nbsp;avoid having to re-download over the internet rather than deleting all the users programs with a clean install..</p>
<p>4) abandoning the software and customers who naively believed and followed your lead in making Microsoft their OS..&nbsp; I've been with MS from&nbsp;DOS through Win 3, 95, 98, XP, 2000, 7, 8.1..&nbsp; what a dope I've been..</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck has MS done with their quality control.&nbsp; Why have they no shame releasing products untested, why are they not ashamed of using their customers time to test their products and then try to tell the world&nbsp;it's free while holding those same customers
 ransom for products they've already paid for many times over?</p>
<p>
</p><p>SHAME..</p>
<p>For&nbsp;the loss of network bandwidth across the country and the power consumption as millions of PCs are overheated working so hard to download, copy and install...&nbsp; Many thousands on the web blogs indicate their PCs&nbsp;overheat,&nbsp;fault out and leave them&nbsp;to start
 all over again from scratch.&nbsp; The power costs associated with re-re-running the downloads and updates so many times, not to mention the&nbsp;then paying the air-conditioning costs to remove the excess heat&nbsp;generated&nbsp;in&nbsp;the home and office buildings!</p>
<p>Microsoft bills themselves as a "green" company..&nbsp; NOT!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why don&#39;t I get the &#34;get windows 10&#34; app on my Windows 8.1 PC&#63;</h2>
                    I just got a Dell XPS8700&nbsp; Desktop with Windows 8.1 on September 15th of 2014. I have 5 other PC's in my home. 4 have some version of windows 7 and 1 is a recently purchased laptop (May, 2015). All of them have the little Windows icon in task bar on the
 bottom right of the screen, i.e. the "get Windows 10 upgrade" app, but the Dell XPS8700 doesn't. As it happens, 4 of the 6 PC's in the household are mine, personally. I can't speak for my wife and son, but I really want to upgrade my Windows 8.1 to Windows
 10. I have been testing the Windows 10 technical review version for several months now as a "Windows 10 insider" on the very machine I want to upgrade. So, why is that the only machine in the house that is not offered the option to upgrade?

            Software's/devices are nowadays intelligent and they start using the appropriate device when needed. FWIW Intel one is a built-in graphics device into the motherboard which isn't for gaming and when you run a game or a Software that needs more graphics resources automatically AMD one is triggered.

            Hi Caige, you cannot use both at the same time, sorry!
<br />
<br />When you are using your system under normal usage, the Intel HD Graphics will be generating your screen. Then when you put your system under pressure, like playing a game or doing something graphically comples the AMD radeon HD 7400m will automatically be switched to.
<br />
<br />This is done by software on your system and you can have no control over that . . .
<br />
<br />With some systems there is software that allows you to specify which graphics to use on certain applications, but never both . ..

            <p>Sorry, but console bans are not reversed and there is no way to contact the enforcement team regarding console bans. When you purchase a used console you assume the risk for any previous modifications or unauthorized activity. The only thing you can do is try to work with the people you bought it from for a refund.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try installing the fingerprint drivers compatibility mode and check if the issue persists. This is to check if this is caused due to any driver compatibility issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Windows 8.1 article to install older programs/drivers in current version of Windows Operating System. The steps for Windows 8/8.1 applies to Windows 10 as well.</p>

<h2>            Are systems with 32 GB eMMC drives no longer updatable&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to update my HP Stream (that runs on the non-replaceable 32 GB eMMC) using the Media Creation Tool (MediaCreationTool1903.exe), but it only upgraded the OS to the 1607 update. The laptop has a bit over 5 GB of free space and there is nothing I can
 free (other than a browser and Skype, there is nothing I can delete, and I cleaned up the drive including the system files, old updates, etc), so I used a USB flash drive for the upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a bit of research and according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-pc-with-under-32gb-storage-no-1903-update-for-you-says-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-pc-with-under-32gb-storage-no-1903-update-for-you-says-microsoft/</a>,
 it looks like there is not further upgrade for me. Is this true? Does it mean all systems running on a 32 GB eMMC drives will be permanently stuck on the 1607 update? What about security patches?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone share Microsoft's official stand on this? Thanks.</p>

            Hi Alek, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you 10GB more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

            I would not mind this as an option (did not realize that the 32-bit Windows saves 10 GB of hard drive), but according to the article I mentioned: "Microsoft has raised the minimum storage requirement for Windows 10 version 1903 to 32GB for
<strong>both 32-bit</strong> and 64-bit Windows." So it would be nice to see the official Microsoft policy before I waste a few hours on the reinstall (it's my mother in-law's system, so I'd need to apply a foreign language pack and it was a hassle to set it
 up the last time I did it for her; don't want to invest in it if it eventually ends up being no longer supported).

            Hi Alek.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can move your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folders into OneDrive and then set them to On Demand so they reside in the cloud and only have download links on the PC:  
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />You can also offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive you can install on the same PC (even in the DVD drive bay) as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.  You could also install a larger SSD/HDD. 
<br />
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version update since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place.
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>. 
<br />
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you. 
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p>Thanks Greg. I will go over the links when the <em>tenforums </em>site is back (seems to be down now), but it still does not answer my question and I do not see it covered in the articles I checked so far (e.g.
<em>Clean Install Windows 10</em>). Let me reiterate:</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview?irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2000142_aff_7795_1243925&amp;tduid=(ir__arh2b3ufjckfrmdq0cigmvmrvu2xjmz9phwdcwdn00)(7795)(1243925)(je6NUbpObpQ-e3q_O2jYmFwS01ugjXWrXg)()&amp;irclickid=_arh2b3ufjckfrmdq0cigmvmrvu2xjmz9phwdcwdn00#section-30---minimum-hardware-requirements-for-windows10-for-desktop-editions?ranMID=43674&amp;ranEAID=je6NUbpObpQ&amp;ranSiteID=je6NUbpObpQ-e3q_O2jYmFwS01ugjXWrXg&amp;epi=je6NUbpObpQ-e3q_O2jYmFwS01ugjXWrXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview</a>&nbsp;(section
 3.3.1), Windows 10, version 1903 requires 32 GB of hard drive space (for both 32- and 64-bit versions).
<strong>Does this mean that starting with version 1903, systems with 32 GB eMMC will not be updatable?</strong> (Given that the 32 GB minimum is for the OS only.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that there are tweaks you can use to install Windows 10 updates on 32 GB systems (I have used them in the past), but these were before 1903. I have not seen any explicit confirmation that update tweaks will work on version 1903, so I do not want to
 go through the hassle of backing up settings and apps, reformatting the drive, etc. only to encounter the
<em>insufficient space to install the OS </em>message.</p>

            We'll have to see going forward if this is going to be the case.  I'm waiting to hear from those who are staging their Version Upgrades from flash sticks so no staging space is needed on a smaller HDD, whether these can run now since  there is also a known issue with attached USB devices covered here:

<br />
<br />If you choose to try the Upgrade this way, please advise to help others.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unaware of any minimum requirement change, but after reading your post, and the replies, I realized I had a similar machine that I had not used lately and decided to try updating to 1903..</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an Off-Brand 8" Tablet with the same eMMC 32GB drive you mention, and only 1GB Memory.. It came preinstalled with Windows 8 32 bit.. It has since been upgraded to 8.1 and numerous Win 10 builds.. Most recently from 1607 to 1809... I have never done
 a clean install, but rely on backup images saved when the installation was fresh...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade from 17763.437 (1809) to 18362.30 (1903) went smoothly, although it took over 2 hours...</p>
<p>I did this by Mounting the 1903 32 bit ISO that was on a flash drive and running setup.. There were no alerts concerning free space, drive size, or etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you try a clean install of the 32 bit Windows 10 you will probably need a wall powered USB 4-Port Hub or more, along with a USB Keyboard and Mouse.. Plus room for any other USB device you may need...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Touchscreen will not work while using installation media...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After one of the earlier upgrades I had problems with the Touchscreen drivers and the Screen Rotation and Lock... I eventually found a fix and it has not reappeared, but I have not yet tested it with 1903..</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... After reading your link to section 3.3.1, my interpretation is that a minimum 32GB
<strong>drive</strong> is now required... Not specifically free space..</p>
        </p>

            Thanks,&nbsp;slance310. You may be right about the space requirements, but according to the specs, Windows 10 1809 x64 requires 20 GB of space, and I cannot see how this can be the case, when just the OS on my laptop takes about 27 GB. Question, how did you
 keep the ISO image mounted after a reboot during the installation?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How much space you need to upgrade to the 1903 is dependent upon how you do it.. If you do it through Windows Update or the Create Media... Install Now... method, it takes much more space... The reason being is he way it is downloaded and created... The
 needed files are downloaded... THEN converted to installation files and\or a ISO... This can easily take up nearly 8GB all in itself... Then there is the issue of the&nbsp; "Old" windows being saved in the Windows.old folder.. This can be deleted, but not until
 after the fact..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you manually upgrade from a ISO on a flash drive or external HDD, you will not need that extra 8GB of space...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the spec sheet you mentioned is regarding a "Clean Install", and what the installer will accept for drive size.. An upgrade is a entirely different ballgame due to the already existing files... The only thing I can suggest is to be sure the "Windows.old"
 folder has been removed... That is the largest offender by far...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say the OS is taking up 27GB of space, I would guess that a large part of that is the result of a couple of hidden files on C:\.. The PageFile.sys and Hiberfil.sys.. The pagefile is for memory overflow, and the hiberfil is for Hibernation type storage
 and the functioning of Fast Startup...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both can be turned off temporarily to free up space... The Pagefile can also simply be reduced in size as well..</p>
<p>At times I remove these files to clean up my OS drive with a defrag... Then turn them back on when it is finished... I have had no ill effects from this... But with only 1GB of memory available, you may want maybe just reduce the size of the Pagefile, or
 leave it alone...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't check the sizes before replying, so I can't be more specific at the moment...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can turn off the Hiberfil.sys by entering the command Powercfg -h off into a Command Prompt or Powershell as Admin.. The turn it back on with Powercfg -h on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can show the hidden folders\files through "Folder Options"... View tab..</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Pagefile, right click on This PC.. Properties.. Advanced System Settings... Performance-Settings button... Advanced Tab again, the "Virtual Memory" at the bottom..</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the ISO is concerned... I unplugged the flash drive during the first restart... By the time of the restart, all of the needed files have already been copied to the internal drive..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not actually know if you can manage an upgrade to 1809 or 1903... As suggested by Dave, your best bet may be to switch to 32 bit, but that may bring up issues with drivers and such..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrades have access to preinstalled HP drivers, a clean install may not... You might check with HP and see what is available as far as a switch to 32 bit... They may have a 32 bit version of their preinstalled Windows available...</p>
<p>

            Good point on the driver support. HP only shows drivers and firmware for the 64-bit version of Windows. I would not risk installing the 32-bit version. Thanks for the suggestions.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's unfortunate... About your only option would be a clean install of the 64 bit version as a workaround to insufficient space..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did a disk cleanup of my 32 bit installation... 12GB was removed.. That would put a severe limitation on available space, and I'm sure your's would be a good bit higher..</p>

<h2>            After latest optional update KB3022345 sfc &#47;scannow gives corrupted files</h2>
                    <p>Hi<br />
Could somebody check this, but it looks like this update causes corruption.<br />
I run sfc /scannow and I get :<br />
<br />
Could not reproject corrupted file [ml:520{260},l:114{57}]"\??\C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Diagnosis\DownloadedSettings"\[l:24{12}]"utc.app.json"; source file in store is also corrupted<br />
2015-05-06 21:16:07, Info CSI 000001b9 [SR] Could not reproject corrupted file [ml:520{260},l:114{57}]"\??\C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Diagnosis\DownloadedSettings"\[l:66{33}]"telemetry.ASM-WindowsDefault.json"; source file in store is also corrupted<br />
<br />
I searched a little bit and found this:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://thetechcookbook.com/windows-8-update-kb3022345-causing-corrupt-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Tech Cookbook – Windows 8 update (KB3022345) causing corrupt files</a><br />
<br />
It looks similar but I'm not sure that solution on that page is applicable to W7 64 bit.<br />
I confirm this, because I tried sfc /scannow before update and worked without error.</p>
<p>After update I get this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />
<br />
Edin </p>

            <p>Its a nasty little update this KB3022345. I can confirm that I have opted for Option B in this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a thread regarding this matter</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/command-prompt-sfc-scannow-corrupt-files-found/809cd697-54d6-4240-9811-b6760cd821ba?msgId=2c7a8408-d5b0-4720-94ec-e7e703ea564b&amp;rtAction=1432533358452&amp;lc=2057&amp;auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was given the tip and some very...... useful information on this matter of uninstalling the update, then go and look for it and then hide it. I then did an sfc/ scannow problem fixed 'no corrupt files found'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problem with opting for option B is that when MS have an update for correcting this KB3022345 most people will have it uninstalled and hidden and&nbsp;might cause further problems.</p>

<p><span>Hello FRANKLYNCUMBERBATCH,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using the
<strong>new Skype (8.xx),</strong> unfortunately, there is no option to delete entire chat conversations at once. It can only be deleted one at a time. Right click on a contact, then select the
<strong>Delete conversations</strong> option. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if you're using the
<strong>classic Skype (7.41)</strong>: Click on <strong>Tools</strong> &gt;<strong> Options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Privacy </strong>&gt; <strong>Clear History</strong>. This will delete the chat conversation of all your contacts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you need anything else.</span></p>

    <title>Blue screen when trying to reboot with 3 monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jadams0289  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue screen when trying to reboot with 3 monitors</h2>
                    I have a Dell computer running windows 7 with a G450 Multi-Monitor Series graphics card from Matrox. When all monitors are disabled under display properties except the main display windows works just like it should. You can shutdown the computer normally.
 when i try to enable one or more displays everything works fine until it is time to reboot. if you hit restart or shutdown i am getting a BSOD. The blue screen only comes on if multiple monitors are enabled. otherwise it works fine restarting and such. Any
 info will help! Thanks in advance!

<p><span><span><strong>Hi jadams0289,<br />
</strong>Looks like the issue is with the graphics card drivers.<br />
Uninstall and re-install the drivers for your display adapter that should fix the issue.<br />
</span></span><span><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Device Manager window, Locate display adapter device.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the device and select uninstall.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp; On reboot, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.<br />
e. If that fails, install the latest drivers for your display adapter from the manufacturer website.<br />
<strong>Update drivers: recommended links:</strong> <br />

    <title>Ongoing issue with HDMI signal loss - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randolph savage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ongoing issue with HDMI signal loss</h2>
                    <p>I've had an ongoing issue with HDMI signal loss with HDR games - previous post:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/xbox-one-x-intermittent-hdmi-loss-of-signal/e3e34417-a816-41ad-9908-f100539fa273">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/xbox-one-x-intermittent-hdmi-loss-of-signal/e3e34417-a816-41ad-9908-f100539fa273</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying a multitude of things including what's in that post with some XBOX settings with YCC disable, switching the video output from 10&nbsp; bit to 8, etc - It seemed like I may have resolved the issue but didn't want to jump the gun.&nbsp; Fast forward to
 yesterday, while playing a non-HDR game, my picture dropped entirely - no signal at all.&nbsp; After my usual troubleshooting to get it back which could involve unplugging/replugging the HDMI cable or switching inputs - it remained off and would flicker in and
 out of a picture to black screen/no signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I moved the same HDMI cable from the XBOX to my 4K DVR which worked perfectly fine on the same input as the XBOX and same cable.&nbsp; Which brings me to my question: is there anything else that can be done beyond sending into Microsoft?&nbsp; I just
 can't justify spending $229 for what seems to be a potential HDMI output issue on the XBOX.</p>

<p>Hi Randolph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that your Xbox is still having issues with no video signal, I know that can be frustrating. I looked at your original thread on the issue and I noticed that you had not attempted an Offline system update which is something I would recommend
 at least trying before considering sending it in for repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow this link&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution</a>&nbsp;and select "I need to update my console offline".</p>
<p>To use the Offline System Update, you'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Windows-based PC with an Internet connection and a USB port. </li><li>A USB flash drive with a minimum 4 GB of space formatted as NTFS.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Give that a try and let us know if the Xbox Troubleshooter page loads up.</p>
<p>
</p>

            Hi Randolph, after sending my first onebox one x back for no hdmi signal issue after less than a month the same issue happened. This time on the phone with xbox support I did a restart holding the disc button and the power button until I heard two audible
 signals from the xbox. Then I was instructed to do a factory reset with keeping my games and apps. This worked and saved my from shipping my console again. I am not sure why this has happened again but try it to save you from any additional hassle. I paid
 almost $500.00 not $229.00 and I can sympathize with you for sure. If you want to try this call xbox customer support and let them talk you through it. Hope this helps you Randolph. The only other thing that you and both can do is buy a Playstation. I am not
 yet aware of hdmi handshake issues with Sony's console. Best of luck from me. I want to add the the Microsoft rep on the phone today was AWESOME! Give them a chance to help.

<p>Hi Randolph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that there is still no signal. If the troubleshooting steps mentioned by Brent did not help, then I highly suggest at least trying the offline system update that I mentioned before right above Brent's post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This link <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><div>First thing you'll want to make sure is that the startup troubleshooter screen pulls up.
<ol>
<li>Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.
</li><li>Wait 30 seconds, and then plug the power cord back in.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>BIND</strong> button (located below the Xbox button on the console) and the
<strong>EJECT</strong> button (located on the front of the console), and then press the
<strong>Xbox</strong> button on the console. </li><li>Continue holding the <strong>BIND</strong> and <strong>EJECT</strong> buttons for 10-15 seconds.
</li><li>Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the
<strong>BIND</strong> and <strong>EJECT</strong> buttons after the second power-up tone.</li><li>The console should power up and take you directly to the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the screen shows up, then you can follow the rest of the instructions on the link on how to format a USB flash drive for the Xbox One to download the offline system update files.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro pressure sensitive pen&#63; How pressure sensitive and any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faeleena  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro pressure sensitive pen&#63; How pressure sensitive and any tilt&#63;</h2>
                    For artist in love with Wacom's technology the specific details of this is really really important. I suspect that Microsoft doesn't openly advertise the pressure sensitivity because many users don't understand that it depends a lot on the software being
 used and until a month ago, there were some problems with the drivers. <br />
<br />
Collectively the internet says 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity. This means nothing to most people, but wacom users understand. Also, I can't find ANYTHING about what degrees of tilt it has. (Useful for digital paintbrushes, supported by photoshop.)<br />
<br />
Please, I would like some official information about this. I'm definitely considering buying one for myself as my mobile art-solution.<br />

<p>The C drive also has bitlocker installed.&nbsp; While I know the password to unlock, I cannot remove Bitlocker with regular account.&nbsp; Also the Key back up is in the Administrators My Document folder, which I don't have access to now.&nbsp; So&nbsp; I Can't elevate a Command
 Prompt to enable the&nbsp; Administrator Account. I resorted to factory reset the machine, BUT it requires the Bitlocker key that I do not have access to.</p>
<p>Do I own A brick now?</p>

            Hi Paul
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You gonna need to do a direct clean install. 
<br />
<br />If you are using Windows 10 Enterprise, you will need to download or obtain reinstall media for it either through IT or the Volume License service center.
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10 Pro.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
