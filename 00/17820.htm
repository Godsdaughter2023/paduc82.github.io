<h2>            Phone Microphone and Bluetooth Problem</h2>
                    When my Lumia 800 connects to my car handsfree kit I am unable to use the phones own microphone to use any voice control features such as dialling and message creation. Is this an issue with the phone or an issue with windows phone? I ask as I am able
 to use the microphone on my work iPhone and Nokia N8 whilst it is connected to the handsfree kit and its quite frustrating that my I can't with my windows phone. Thanks in advance, James.

I would expect that to happen James.&nbsp; It it pairs to the cars handsfree system, it will use all the features.&nbsp; It makes no sense for it to connect to the device's mic at the same time.</p>
<p>If your older device did allow that mic on the handset to be used, then I would say the mic on the car's system was not enabled.</p>

            Thanks for the response, but I have to disagree with what you have said. I also have a company phone (iPhone 4) and use the same car &amp; handsfree. As stated in my
<u><i>original </i></u>post &nbsp;I am able to still use all the voice control features using the iPhone mic and it automatically reroutes the mic to the handsfree as soon as it has recognised any command it is given - such as redial, call home etc. On the WP7 this
 isn't possible I would hazard a guess that a simple software update would enable the mic to be used and then to redirect audio once it has completed the command requested. Its quite disappointing that simple things my iPhone&nbsp;(and old symbian phone!) can do
 WP7 cannot.&nbsp;

            why has this been marked as answer to the question? It doesn't answer the question, but is one persons guess at an answer - that isn't correct.

<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>In reply to this quote, you are wrong, the cars mic is on - I hold the home key on my iPhone and say " Call x" then it calls the person i requested and automatically changes from the iPhone mic straight to the car mic as I can then have a&nbsp;conversation&nbsp;using
 the hands free.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Furthermore I wouldn't really call an iPhone 4 an old device, and also surely an older device shouldn't have more features than a brand new one? Like I said, a simple update would no doubt rectify the problem.</div>

            <p>It appears that WP routes the input function to the BT input when it is connected. I can initiate voice recognition on my Focus or HD7 in the normal way, holding down the Window icon, or holding down the multifunction key on my BT device. The device can
 either be a headset, or my car BT set.</p>
<p>When I hold down the call button in my car, I can see the voice recognition screen pop up on my phone and can then activate any of the normal options speaking to my car BT set. I don't need to speak loud enough for my phone to hear, or hold my phone up so
 I can speak into its microphone.</p>
<p>My guess is that MS just implemented things differently. The Nokia and iPhone appear to&nbsp;allow the &nbsp;built in microphone to accept voice commands, while the WP has routed the voice command function to the BT channel.
</p>
<p>I can imagine your car handsfree may not react to your initiating the Voice function from the phone, but you might give holding down the call, or multifunction button, a little longer and see if that doesn't trigger the Lumia to go into voice control mode,
 and use the car mic to listen then. I think that would actually be preferable as it is more 'handsfree' than having to hold up the phone to talk to it.</p>
<p>BTW, I can trigger my iPhone into voice command holding down my BT car kit call button too, and leave my iPhone in my pocket.</p>

<h2>            Touch AND Mouse modes - A discussion</h2>
                    <p>While I think a lot of people welcome the Mouse friendly direction of Windows 10, myself included, there are times when the Touch centric UI and full-screen Start Screen and Apps was helpful... such as&nbsp;when kicking back and browsing the web or&nbsp;News app,&nbsp;playing
 music at a party,&nbsp;doing demo with other people gathered around the computer, etc. I understand that Microsoft is working on "Continuum" mode that achieves this, but I am worried that this will only apply to computers with a detachable keyboard and not Touch
 computers with fixed keyboards like my Dell M3800/XPS15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution to this whole mess turns out to be rather simple. You know that ubiquitous Keyboard button on the taskbar? Turn it into a toggle (similar to the Touch/Mouse button in Office) that switches between
<em>universal&nbsp;</em>Touch and Mouse modes that ALL apps can respond to rather than leave it up to each individual app or bury the Start Menu / Start Screen toggle deep in a Properties tab somewhere. I did a little write up with pictures that I think explains
 it well.<br />
</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt Microsoft will pay attention, but I'd like to hear other people's&nbsp;thoughts on this. I'm pretty much on my last leg with Microsoft- very disappointed- and am on the verge of giving up and getting a MacBook + iPad as my primary devices. The synchronization
 between the two devices (iMessages, etc) really lowers the barrier of having 2 devices. But I'm really hoping MS gets the Windows dual-use thing right. So far, they haven't.</p>

            <p>I think the start screen is great now, however it is nice to have the option to automatically switch to the metro start screen, without to go through settings and logout log in steps. An icon that we can press in addition to a key combination to switch between
 metro and desktop mode without using the start screen would be a very nice addition. sometimes I like to put metro start screen in the background using my desktop pc.</p>

            <p>Congrats - Well written discussion you appear to have it in a nutshell and covered the subject well, I really have nothing more to add, other than, I agree with what you have written &amp; explanation on OneDrive,&nbsp;better&nbsp;integration is required.
</p>
<p>On thing I am &nbsp;interested in is the switching between Start Menu &amp; Start Screen as mentioned by
<em>(Dr Sam), </em>that has to be made simpler. </p>
<p>They (MS) have the next 6 mths. to fix it, hopefully&nbsp;for the better.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Like you I have a&nbsp;touch computer with a fixed keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, if you are using a touch device, then it needs an option to operate similar to windows 8, it is early days yet with 10 and the preview is really just to show off the desktop side, touch is coming later</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I have seen though, its just reversed the roles</p>
<p>
</p><p>8 was good for touch users</p>
<p>many thought 8 was poor for desktop users</p>
<p>
</p><p>10 so far is good for desktop users and poor for touch users</p>

            I have an HP 11T X360 which goes into tablet mode when you fold the keyboard behind the monitor. Actually deactivates the keyboard and mouse. Do not think this is a feature of W 8.1 but something HP built into the firmware. Still, it is a wonderful feature!
 Looking forward to getting W 10 on this laptop.<br />

            I think with hybrid devices they need to have it automatically between start screen and start menu when switch your device like folding the keyboard back. then keep it in start menu for non touch and start screen for touch. They should also have an icon
 to switch quickly between the two no matter what you use.<br />

            <p>I just had to phone this in! I installed the W 10 TP on the aforementioned HP 11T x360. Did the install on Virtualbox. Had to create a custom resolution in VB to allow a full "full screen" which worked out well! Using half of my RAM and only 2 of the Pentium
 cores but it works pretty good on this lower end Win 8.1 laptop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The impressive part is how it works when I fold the keyboard under the screen... works just like a tablet should (keyboard disabled)... swipe in from the right and get the charm bar to get to the start screen or press the "Window" button to get the start
 screen, or press the start icon to get the start menu. I did have to enable the touch keyboard toolbar option but it works, too!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will be hard to wait a year for the RTM for W 10. So far I've had only one old program that will not work: OpenVPN. But as this is to "play" with I'll keep trying!!!</p>
<p>

</p><p>This is why Microsoft should absolutely do this -- setting one quick and easy "touch or mouse mode" button should switch every app's default state back and forth, touch/mouse. &nbsp;Because if an app programmer doesn't set an alternate mouse mode, or an alternate
 touch mode, or if people have to keep switching it back for every app, then people aren't going to blame the app programmer, they're going to blame Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Windows Update 17711-&#62;17713 0x80070643 and pending restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogueunit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update 17711-&#62;17713 0x80070643 and pending restart</h2>
                    1. SoftwareDistribution/Downloads cleared multiple times<br />
2. Tried update from PSWindowsUpdate module -- nothing<br />
3. Used System Restore to the day before, still nothing<br />
4. Rebooted, shutdowned -- nothing again<br />
<br />
What to do? Resetting on this exact build may kill my programs, as I've made stupid mistake of deleting data required to rolling back to a stable system and lost my ability to rollback with programs untouched. It would be easy to fix this issue by getting my
 hands at new installation image with separate installer, but for some unknown for me reason this is unavailable.
<br />
Also, this page (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/938205/windows-update-error-code-list) doesn't list my error code.<br />
<br />
So, questions:<br />
1. Maybe there would be someone from support team and that someone would give me an image to upgrade my system?<br />
2. What does my error code means? Some unofficial third-party resource listed it as INSTALL_FAILED, which isn't really helpful.<br />
3. Is there some better way to read WindowsUpdate.log? I mean, with filtering and stuff, like Event View, but for Windows Update's logs.

If you have not cleaned it out before doing a clean install or reset do this; copy the Download Folder in File Explorer to a USB or another drive on the disk.&nbsp; Then use it to install the downloaded programs rather than wandering all over the Internet to download
 the programs again.

0x80070643 "windows 10" .&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>It would be such a productivity booster if MS would replace these cryptic codes with understandable text messages, but they'd much rather keep adding silly stuff that most of us haven't the slightest use for.&nbsp; :(</p>

<p>A bit of a status update.<br />
<br />
Okay, sooo, I've googled the error (which I probably should've did in the first place), but that didn't actually helped.<br />
Ran DISM and SFC, which reported that everything is okay (it is clearly not), tried to update. Then I've freed some disk space from ~20GB to ~60GB and also examined my services. BITS, Windows Installer and Windows Insider services were stopping after some random
 time, Windows Update Medic was stopping very frequently. Wrote little Powershell spinner which was activating these, but my automation was stopped by Permission Denied on everything except BITS (no dumb here — launched Powershell as admin). With a heavy sigh
 I proceeded to an update while constantly refreshing services and starting them up when needed. After this circus update failed (not just silently, but with an 0x8024200D error in the logs (it's a WU_E_UH_NEEDANOTHERDOWNLOAD according to the link in OP post).<br />
So, I gave up on this, tried to reset PC from settings. Guess what? It failed too.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that there is no viruses and such stuff — Defender reports zero threats, tasks look legit (the ones that I actually examined were all known), processes is quite cool, but now I will try to attack this problem from malware removing side.<br />
<br />
Additional info:</p>
<p>- Troubleshooter mentioned something about service registration. It fixed that thing, though<br />
- All updates were made with PSWindowsUpdate module. It's a third-party, but as far as I understand it must use some system interface to updating services. With my own eyes I saw how SoftwareDistribution\Downloads is filling up with quite update-like data,
 and then WINDOWS.~$BT filled with pretty valid-looking installation data, though setup.exe, when I ran it by hand, purged it all and then innocently said that something is wrong and I should reboot. Sheesh.<br />
<strong>- I don't know how to make Windows Update from Settings actually refresh it's state. Really, maybe some kind of a kick button would be good.</strong></p>
<p>- My Event Log service is also broken — Application logs is filled with "Error opening event log file Parameters. Log will not be processed. Return code from OpenEventLog is 87", but all other categories are working as intended. This behavior was observed
 after 17711 update and I took it for some new build feature and ignored, because it actually disappeared for some time, but now it's back with ~15% of CPU used to do completely useless work. SNMP service is using up much CPU as well, it appeared simultaneously.<br />
<br />
In Safe Mode BITS and Windows Update, probably obviously, don't work. Clean booting with only Microsoft services and no autoruns haven't changed anything at all. The only solution that I see is a 17713 ISO. Again, would be VERY grateful for it, so maybe someone
 from Microsoft would be so kind to send it for me on e-mail or somehow, because that would be the easiest fix for all the problems that I see.</p>

            &nbsp;I don't know if this is the same problem I had, but mine went through the update and rebooted.&nbsp; When I hit ENTER though, it was back to 17711.&nbsp; Then I got a popup saying it had gotten a boot error 0x1900101-0x20017<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;So I've run:<br />
. SFC /Scannow followed by<br />
. dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
. followed by a troubleshooter for Windows Update problems.&nbsp;<br />
.&nbsp; Then I cleaned out the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download folder&nbsp;<br />
After the above I started Windows Update again, and the upgrade from 17711 to 17713 ran successfully.&nbsp; :)<br />

            Status update again. Would be better if it would finally be a Windows update, however, but it's not.<br />
<br />
I dropped attempts to understand various logs and stuff. None of the solutions above work for me — DISM reports that all is cool, SFC too, now I understood how to reset Windows Update and still all my attempts were futile. So now I decided to look upon files
 in SoftwareDistribution\Downloads directory, and found that Windows Update kinda successfully downloaded everything that it needs, because ESD files are there. I've found some script to convert the update folder into full install ISO, tried to upgrade with
 it and, of course, you see already that this post isn't ending yet. Then I installed that same ISO on a completely clean virtual machine. Surprise — it worked flawlessly, even with 20GB restriction that I've proposed because waiting for fixed virtual disk
 to take shape was too boring. Also I've checked how BITS and another services behave, and yeah, they're down when unneeded, it seems. Okay then, if the install files are valid, but GUI installation fails, we can always try DISM. I tried. On my first attempt
 I've made a mistake and installed Windows on wrong partition, thus unwillingly I've tested that /Apply-Image doesn't purge destination and I probably can use it to update existing installation. So my second attempt was finally targeted at right partition,
 but...<br />
<br />
/Program Files/WindowsApps is off limits for DISM. It just can't, throwing "Access is denied" in your face like it's not you who bought this computer for your own money and you can't just break things with wrong command like an owner that you are. I even tried
 to boot up into Windows RE, login through Administrator account (the one that is disabled by default) and then trying to do it, but got the same denial of access.<br />
<br />
I hope this saga will conclude with the Good finally winning over the Secure.

<p>The last one. I've finally shot myself in the leg.<br />
<br />
DISM wasn't able to overcome some flags in files which said "No". Because of that, I've deleted WindowsApps folder from image and applied it, but it got completely wrong, being unable to load and stuff. I've probably forgot to do something important before/after
 applying image, but anyway, can't be helped now as I'm loading up another ISO and reinstalling it as cleanly as possible.
<strong>The mystery of failing update dies with that system installation.</strong></p>

<h2>            Referencing a Cell in a Separate, Closed Excel File with a Variable File Name</h2>
                    <p>I am interested in referencing a cell located in another excel file with a variable file name AND while the file is closed.&nbsp; I've read a few community postings suggesting INDIRECT would be a great solution if the target file is open.&nbsp; But that's not the
 case here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some postings have suggested using INDEX as an alternative when the file is closed, but I'm not clear on how to use INDEX in a similar manner because I want to create file name using variables such that the resulting file name (and possible index cell range)
 is a text string.&nbsp; So how to use that text string with INDEX??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone might have a suggestion for me.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Unable to Access MS Store Beta - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottieb.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Access MS Store Beta</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, I cannot access the MS Store Beta as part of the technical preview (i.e Grey icon, not the Green store icon which is working).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue began when the "roll back to previous version of windows" was accidentally selected during boot (as an aside, it's really silly to not have a confirmation message when this is selected.&nbsp; It's pretty easy to do this on a gen 1 surface touch screen!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the roll back was accidentally selected, I quickly turned the machine off.&nbsp; After further investigation, I quickly came to the conclusion that the roll back really needed to complete as some parts of the system appeared broken; and so I did so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technical preview was re-installed,&nbsp;but I was unable to log back on.&nbsp; After even more investigation, it seems that my local account was now corrupted.&nbsp; I've since recreated a local logon account and re-linked to my outlook account. Everything appears to
 be working as expected, except I cannot access the MS Store Beta - only the old store is available (which prevents me accessing the Office preview)</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO...! I have no idea how to restore this.&nbsp; I've run the system diagnostic tools (refresh and restore), I've ensured that the region settings are en-US.&nbsp; All windows updates are installed (with the exception of Update for the English Input Personalization
 Dictionary - KB2881553 - which will not install for some reason) Running build 9926 on Gen 1 Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas???</p>

<h2>            How do I stop Outlook.com from automatically logging me out and automatically logging in another account&#63;</h2>
                    How do I stop Outlook.com from automatically logging me out and automatically logging in another account? I want to stay logged in on my PC. This happens, normally overnight. I will be logged into my Outlook.com account (email &amp; calendar, occasionally
 contacts) but when I take my PC out of sleep mode Outlook.com will log me out and automatically log my wife in, with her User ID and password. I have on infrequent occasions logged my wife in on my PC but I always log her out and I NEVER cache passwords, so
 I don't know how it does that.&nbsp;

            Dear Buckeye,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />If there are mutliple users that are using the same device it is better to use different browsers or in Private mode. It is even better to use different accounts to sugn in. If you have Windows 10, your wife can login with her acount to the device or you can create a local account for her.

            Hello Buckeye, my name is Wendy Jones, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />If you are login on Outlook web and you have this behavior, you need to do a clean browser data as show the following link: <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/ahic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://kb.iu.edu/d/ahic</a>
<br />In addition you can access in private mode and verify if the issue still persist.

            Hi Buckeye, 
<br />
<br />Thanks for contacting Us. 
<br />
<br />It is better to login in Windows by creating 2 local accounts want for you and the other one for the other use. This ways outlook will not logging you out to sing in in another account since there is only account signed in the pc with the specific local user created.
<br />
<br />In addition:
<br />
<br />How to Turn Off Automatic Login in Outlook
<br />
<br />Click the File tab. Choose "Account Settings" under the "Account Information" list.
<br />
<br />Click "Change" in the Email tab. Choose "More Settings."
<br />Select the Security tab. Check the box next to "Always prompt for logon credentials."
<br />
<br />Click "Apply." Log out of Outlook and log back in.
<br />
<br />Additionally:
<br />
<br />The scenario is single sign on enabled for the tenant. User use one account to log in computer (in the same tenant domain) and Office 365. IE and Office apps will automatically sign in their work/school accounts. 
<br /> 
<br />If you are not in this scenario, based on my understanding, the behavior is more related to IE and operating system. As I mentioned you above you need to log in with different accounts, we suggest you use private window and different browsers (e.g. Edge, Chrome, Firefox) to open them. It’s better than sign out the same browser window to log in another account as there might be cache/cookie issue when using the same browser window. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />
<br />Victor

<h2>            Download to Word 2008 Mac&#59; I try to download a Doc.X but it calls up Word 2004 from my applications. How do I make Word 2008 the preferred app for this situation&#63;</h2>
                    To start with, Word 2008 icon is already in the dock. Now I have a document from the web that I want to open. When I double clik the document as it appears in download, the icon for Microsoft Word 2004 appears in the dock and then I get a message that
 says "This document was created in a newer version of Microsoft Office. Do you want to convert it?" Then I play along and clik "convert" Then I get a message that says "There is not enough memory or disk space to convert this document." That, of course, is
 not true. I am operating an iMac 2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with Mac OSX 10.5.8<br />

            I'll assume that your Word 2008 installation functions correctly. You can confirm this by dragging a document to the Word 2008 icon and its opening in Word 2008.
<div><br />
<div>To change the default application for a document that Word 2008 can open, proceed as follows:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Finder</li><li>Locate one such file and <u>single click</u> on it to select it</li><li>In the Finder's main menu, select <i>File &gt; Get Info</i>&nbsp;(or press <i>Command i</i>)</li><li>In the information box that appears, go to the section that says "Open with" (you may need to click on the disclose triangle to display a dropdown menu)</li><li>In the dropdown menu you should see the icons for several applications, and one of them should be Word 2008 (if not, select
<i>Other...</i>&nbsp; at the bottom and locate Word 2008 in <i>Applications &gt; Microsoft Office 2008</i>)</li><li>Once the preferred application is selected, click on the <i>Change All... </i>
button</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>You will have to repeat this for every file type that you want opened in Word 2008 (usually only those with extensions
<b>.rtf</b>, <b>.txt</b>, <b>.docx</b> and <b>.doc</b>).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why would the Finder give prevalence to Word 2004 over Word 2008 to begin with? One possible reason is that you installed Office 2004 (or its converter) after installing Office 2008.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The message you are getting is erroneous and probably the document is too complex for the converter. You will find the latest converter for Office 2004 in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open XML
 File Format Converter for Mac 1.2.0</a>. If you are going to install it, do so <u>
before</u> performing the <i>Change All</i>&nbsp;operation.</div>

    <title>My brand new E71 went for a swim in the pool... and something is no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johanpanter  say:</h3>
<h2>            My brand new E71 went for a swim in the pool... and something is no longer right. Battery or phone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just recently bought a E71, and when&nbsp;enjoying a particularly sunny and beautiful day the damn thing hops out of my pocket and into the pool and sinks promptly&nbsp;to the deepest part of it (of course). It was turned on at the time of the incident. After a
 minute or so&nbsp;I manage to recover it only to find&nbsp;strange numbers covering the screen, the kind of numbers that potentially could net you&nbsp;a 100&nbsp;million euros in some lottery somewhere, or in some other place nothing more than a really broken phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disassembled it as far as I could, meaning back cover, battery, sim card and memory card. I let it dry for the next couple of days, helping it along with a hair dryer, and when I got bored of that, the exhaust of my laptop computer at work. Then I gave
 a brief prayer, and reassembled it, and turned it on only to find that.... everything seemed to be working exactly as it should! Hurray, praise the lord and exorcise the daemons! Phone, camera, microphones and so on.. Nothing amiss, at least nothing of what
 functions I had managed to uncover&nbsp;that far&nbsp;during the mere week I had owned it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now there is a problem though. A snake in paradise. The battery life has shrunk to rougly one day, and that is without doing any excessive talking, photoing, surfing or other battery draining activities. And that leads me to my question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could the swim in the pool have affected the <strong>battery</strong> (lithium-ion BP-4L) in&nbsp;some way so that it no longer gives a full load/works properly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is it more likely a problem with the <strong>phone</strong> itself? Something damaged within the hardware?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate any ideas on this since buying a new battery is fairly expensive and not something I want to do if the phone's likely to be the faulty thing here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading your post. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You did the right thing by turning it off immediately and letting it dry out before using it again. Unfortunately, even if it is now dry, the deposits left behind may cause some contacts to corrode among other things. Phones resurrected from a drowning normally
 have a limited lifespan afterwards. There is always the exception to the rule, of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regards to the battery, it is a lump of highly reactive cocktail of chemicals. Who knows what the chemicals and minerals in the water may do to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I were you, I would continue praying and count every passing day that it works as a blessing. Be sure you backup regularly, in case the inevitable should happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks. Yeah, most likely (knock on wood) there will be trouble due to this incident in the future, even though there are none right now. It is all well summed up in the phrase "life is a **bleep** and then you die". But I guess what I would like a qualified
 guessing answer to&nbsp;is whether this loss of battery capacity is due to damage on the phone or to the battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Because if it likely is the battery, I might consider buying a new one to utilize on this phone&nbsp;as long as I can before it explodes on me in a hail of corrosion. If it likely is the phone, I will probably not bother with a new battery&nbsp;but beg, coax and
 threaten my insurance company for a new one instead. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>What you could do is do download and install Nokia Energy Profiler using the link below. Run it for a while and tell us what the baseline power usage is. It should tell us if your phone is using more power then it is supposed to or otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Stop using your phone if the battery starts bloating or getting hot.</p>

<p>Ok, my upbeat friend. I took your advice and used the power tool on my phone, and lo and behold, the thing eats current like there is no tomorrow. Which, obviously, there isn't since the thing have shut down by then due to low battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems that during idling it eats&nbsp;around 40-50 mA. When the screens lit ut it goes up to maybe 80 mA. Seeing as the battery holds 1500 mAh, which according to Nokia's specs should give around 12 days of idling.. Well, that would mean a normal idling
 consumption of around 5 mA... So, in essence: something is f:ed up, way f:ed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The flashing volt sign shows 3,73V. Dunno if this is normal or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what do you guys think (qualified guesses of course),&nbsp;is it a problem with the phone or has something happened to the battery and will replacing it give me sweet 5 mA again?</p>

<p>I guess there is something wrong with the phone then, that makes it&nbsp;eat more&nbsp;way more current that it should. If it is the phone, would anyone venture any guesses as to why everything works fine after the triple volt into the deep end of the pool,&nbsp;aside
 from that&nbsp;it is using much more current now? Maybe it is something that will "go away" with time? Dammit, I sound naive. Hope is last to fail humanity.</p>

<p>The battery output voltage of 3.73v is pretty normal. Idling at 40-50mA is high. You are right, it should be idling around 5-10mA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like to me that the battery is fine but your phone is shorting somewhere. Maybe there is still a little moisture in it. Fingers crossed, it will dry up in time and resolve itself. However, I will say from experience that your odds are not great,
 but there is always hope. In the mean time, just remember to back up your phone regularly.&nbsp;</p>

            LOL :)<br />
<br />
Water ingress is a nasty thing, which is why it tends to do things like void warranties for example.<br />
<br />
When a device like this gets fully immersed in water and is subsequently dried out, there can remain deposits of gunk on the circuit boards, which conduct electricity and thus contribute to discharging the battery much faster.<br />
<br />
Water can even seep inside integrated circuits and wreak havoc in there.<br />
<br />
Sooner or later your phone is going to give up the ghost so I suggest you start reading through the fine print on your home insurance policy to see if it covers appliances going for a swim without a swim suit.<br />
<br />
A last-ditch operation you can try in an attempt to clean any impurities that may have deposited inside the phone, and I know this sounds nuts, is to drown it again, but this time in demineralized water (like the stuff you're supposed to put in your iron).<br />
<br />
Take the battery out, dunk the phone in the water for a few minutes. Then take it out, drain it, stick it in a bowl and cover it in uncooked rice, put the bowl of phone risotto in a warm place (such as an airing cupboard) and leave it there to simmer for 48
 hours.<br />
<br />
One of three things will happen:<br />
<br />
1) Nothing. No better, no worse. At least you tried.<br />
<br />
2) Problem solved or at least situation improved. Yay!<br />
<br />
3) Phone worse off or maybe even completely dead. This was going to happen anyway sooner or later.<br />

            <p><strong>EDIT:&nbsp;</strong> <em>C2 Formula edited to reflect observation by fin_modler</em></p>
<p>Text to columns might work, except for the decimal.</p>

</p><p class="contentCodeblock">B2:&nbsp; =TRUNC(A2/$B$1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select C2 and fill right to G2</p>
<p>Select B2:G2 and fill down as far as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to suppress trailing and leading, zero's the method will be more complex.</p>
<p>Use the same formulas.</p>

<p>Use the Format Painter to apply that format to all the cells in the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, depending on what you want to do with negative number inputs, things may change.&nbsp; My formula will place a minus (-) before every digit.&nbsp; But that could be changed depending on what you want for output.<br />

<h2>            How do I hide my gmail address from people responding to my domain name&#63; </h2>
                    Explain your issue in full detail here: When I send an email from my domain (business) address, it shows up in some respondents mail boxes as "sent from (gmail address) on behalf of (domain address). I would like to eliminate or hide the gmail address
 from those emails - it's confusing to clients. If they just hit reply, the email comes through my domain address and is routed to my gmail. If someone just uses my domain address, I don't have a problem receiving emails. But people sometimes ask which address
 to use. I'd rather business clients just see the domain address. How do I do that?&nbsp;<br />

            If you're using gmail as your outgoing server, then you're stuck with it, I believe.&nbsp; Gmail does not allow hiding the gmail account's real address when sending through the gmail server.

<h3> firstcobalt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Imported G Suite pst data not visible in O365 Outlook</h2>
                    <p>We created pst files from our g-suite accounts and did a local pst file import in the users' &nbsp;outlook profile on a desktop. We can see the data (folders/emails) on the local desktop, however when the user sets up a new outlook profile on any other desktops
 the folders are all empty and the emails are missing. The view is the same when we view it in web mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My research on this issue points to a property of IMAP folders that causes the imported mail to be "invisible". Is there a fix for this ?</p>

<p>Hi FirstCobalt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, please follow the steps to check the folder size:&nbsp; Right-click the primary folder, choose
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the size is zero, you should check the .pst file, and then, re-add the .pst file again to check the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, please try repair the .pst file to check the issue, please see:

    <title>print copy numbers on documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valeriab  say:</h3>
<h2>            print copy numbers on documents</h2>
                    <p>Dear experts,</p>
<p>I need to set up a way to print copy numbers on documents.</p>
<p>The conditions: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- documents will be different every time (it is labels - so it really depends on product; we will have to print e.g. 50 times label1, 40 times label 2, etc);
</p>
<p>- documents cannot be changed prior to opening them - so if a field needs to be inserted it needs to be done automatically and every time. Though all the documents look alike - so the same spot would be OK for all of them.</p>
<p>- numbering needs to start always from 1 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this feasible in Word and in case how?&nbsp;I have no experience at all with VBA programming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for your kind reply,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

    <title>How to purge mailboxes in Exchange Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexandru cazacu  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to purge mailboxes in Exchange Online</h2>
                    <p>I made a video about this a while back, which can be found here:&nbsp;https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Welcome-to-the-Office-365-Support-Corner/How-To-Video-Purge-Soft-deleted-mailboxes-in-O365.</p><p /><p>The scope of this article, is to re-share the above video :) and to provide some sort of a transcript on what is discussed in the video:</p><p>Why would we want to do such a thing, you may ask. The most obvious reasons are:<br /><br />- provisioning of new mailboxes results in conflict<br />- we have issues with an active mailbox and we discover that the cause is a soft deleted mailbox that has the same details (this can occur during an e-Discovery)<br />- we are performing a migration from on premise Exchange to Exchange Online, and mailboxes are not being migrated and we have errors<br /><br />Let's begin by discussing a bit our today's Agenda:<br /><br />What was the previous behavior of a soft deleted mailbox in Office 365 ?<br />What is the current behavior of a soft deleted mail
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/delete-or-restore-mailboxes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2016/10/31/change-in-behavior-for-delicensed-exchange-online-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><strong>1. How can a mailbox go into a soft deleted state in Office 365?</strong><br /><br />- Login to Office 365 Admin Center and go to Active Users<br />- Select a user that has Exchange license assigned and delete him<br />- The user will go to Deleted Users in Office 365 Admin Center and his Exchange mailbox will go into a soft deleted state<br />- Purge the user completely from Office 365, using PS command <strong>Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -RemoveFromRecycleBin -Force</strong><br />- The user will be hard deleted, but his mailbox will still be in a soft deleted state, but it will no longer have the ExternalDirectoryObjectId populated<br />- ExternalDirectoryObjectId is in fact the ObjectID of the Msol User that we just hard deleted<br />- Important to keep in mind that only when deleting a user while still having a license assigned, or if the mailbox is placed on Litigation Hold or In-Place Hold, will cause the mailbox
 User<br />- The solution here is obviously to first purge the soft deleted Msol User with <strong>
Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -RemoveFromRecycleBin -Force</strong><br />- After the user has been hard deleted, we confirm that we no longer have an ExternalDirectoryObjectId populated on the soft deleted mailbox and we run the usual command:<br /><br /><strong>Remove-Mailbox -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -PermanentlyDelete</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>3.3 The operation couldn't be performed because it is outside the writing scope of this server&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />- This is encountered when we again follow the steps from scenario 1, but the user is synchronized from Active Directory<br />- Or instead of following the steps from scenario 1, we simply either delete the user from local Active Directory and run a sync, or we just move the user into an OU which is not synced with Office 365, case in which again AAD Connect, will trigger a soft deletion
 of the user in Office 365. Again, the user is remove while still having the license assigned.<br />- After the user has been soft deleted, we go further and we hard delete him<br />- We go directly to scenario 2 and try to purge the remaining soft deleted mailbox, but we receive the above error<br />- The issue is caused by the IsDirSynced flag setup on the soft deleted mailbox<br />- To bypass this issue and completely get rid of the soft deleted mailbox, we must first reconnect the mailbox to new, unique test user, by running this command:<br /><br /><strong>New-Mailbox -InactiveMailbox &lt;address of soft deleted mailbox or guid&gt; -Name &lt;new unique name&gt; -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID &lt;a new unique UPN&gt;</strong><br /><br />- Do not attempt to use in the above command the parameter UserPrincipalName, as the system will not let you, instead go with MicrosoftOnlineServicesID<br />- After you press Enter on the command, you need to specify a password for this new user mailbox. Keep in mind that you 
<strong>Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox | Remove-Mailbox -Permanently</strong><br />- The solution is to purge mailboxes once at a time, or run these 2 commands in Powershell:<br /><br /><strong>$mbx=Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox | select ExchangeGuid</strong><br /><strong>$mbx | % {Remove-Mailbox -Identity $_.ExchangeGuid -PermanentlyDelete -Confirm:$False}</strong><br /><br />- We use the ExchangeGuid in order to avoid having issues with duplicates<br /><br /><br /><strong>3.5. Mailbox is placed on Litigation Hold or In-Place Hold and cannot be deleted - Litigation Hold</strong><br /><br />- We create a user mailbox and we place it on Litigation Hold<br />- After a while we decide to delete the user mailbox that we have created and we begin by removing the Msol User in Office 365 Admin Center (removing the license or not, does not affect us, since the mailbox is placed on hold)<br />- We also purge the user completely from Office 365 using Powershell command "<strong>Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName ***
</strong>and then&nbsp;<strong>Remove-Mailbox -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -PermanentlyDelete</strong></p><p /><p>- Another switch to keep in mind, is the <strong>ExcludeFromAllOrgHolds</strong> used with the Set-Mailbox cmdlet only for inactive mailboxes.<br /></p><p /><p><strong>3.6. Mailbox is placed on Litigation Hold or In-Place Hold and cannot be deleted - In-Place Hold</strong><br /></p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Below instructions apply to an older scenario when In-Place Hold was setup through the Exchange Admin Center e-Discovery feature.</p><p /><p>- We create a user mailbox and then we include his mailbox in a mailbox search in Exchange Admin Center/e-Discovery<br />- During the mailbox search setup, we also check the box "In-Place Hold"<br />- After a while we decide to delete the user mailbox that we have created and we begin by removing the Msol User in Office 365 Admin Center (removing the license or not, does not affect us, since the mailbox is placed on hold)<br 
<strong>Get-MailboxSearch -InPlaceHoldIdentity &lt;In-Place Hold GUID&gt; | FL Name.</strong> This command will show us what mailbox search contains this inactive mailbox.<br />- The next step is to remove the mailbox from the search that has been place on In-Place Hold, and we again use Powershell to do this:<br /><br /><strong>$InPlaceHold = Get-MailboxSearch -InPlaceHoldIdentity &lt;In-Place Hold GUID&gt;</strong><br /><br /><strong>$InPlaceHold.Sources</strong> - we determine what mailboxes are included in the search that is place on In-Place Hold<br /><br /><strong>$InPlaceHold.Sources.Remove("&lt;LegacyExchangeDN of the inactive mailbox&gt;")</strong> - we remove the inactive mailbox that we need to purge, from this mailbox search<br /><br /><strong>$InPlaceHold.Sources</strong> - we check that the mailbox has been removed from the search<br /><br /><strong>Set-MailboxSearch $InPlaceHold.Name -SourceMailboxes $InPlaceHold.Sources</strong> - we modify the search with the updated list of mailboxes include
Remove-Mailbox -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -PermanentlyDelete</strong><br /></p><p /><p><strong>3.7. Exchange Online can't disable the mailbox "John Doe" because it's placed on hold</strong><br /><br /><br />Please refer to this article: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_exchon-mso_o365b/exchange-cant-disable-this-mailbox-because-it-is/44ce9f30-7683-4c67-b52c-b7658cdce0ec

            <p>Tables have no order - they should be viewed as "buckets of records". If you want to see records in a particular order you must use a Query and sort the data there. A Combo Box gets its data from either a Table (in which case the order is whatever Access
 finds convenient) or a Query (which you can sort yourself).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the ... icon by the Row Source property of your combo box, and accept Access' offer to create a Query. Select Ascending or Descending (as desired) under the field that you want sorted and close the query. Access will ask you to verify the change -
 do so, and your combo will now appear sorted.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Theoretically, the performance of Excel 2016 depends on the hardware environment and the complexity of the data in the workbook, the better of the hardware configuration, the higher of the performance.

    <title>Outlook 2007 PST File Does Not Compact - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcw2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 PST File Does Not Compact</h2>
                    PLEASE HELP!<br />
<br />
After a house cleaning involving deletion of several folders and much of the contents of many others and emptying the Deleted Items, I tried to "Compact" the PST -- this has always worked in the past -- but it didn't get appreciably smaller.<br />
<br />
So I exported all folders that I still want to retain (including Inbox, Sent Items, and Contacts) -- all of these exported PST files total to only about 470 MB -- deleted them, emptied the Deleted Items again, and tried again to "compact":&nbsp; Still no size reduction.&nbsp;
 The PST remains about 1.6 GB even though there is no longer anything in it (at least that's visible) and Mailbox Cleanup/View Mailbox Size also reports almost no contents.&nbsp; (The largest item listed there is about 45 MB in the Journal, which I don't know how
 to empty -- journaling isn't even turned on.)<br />
<br />
I'm running e-mail only with several POP3 accounts -- no Exchange (or other) servers involved -- on a Window XP SP3 system.&nbsp; (I did save a copy of the original PST file before the major surgery.)&nbsp; I'm not sure what else to tell you....<br />
<br />
Can I somehow replace the PST with a blank one (preferably WITHOUT losing all of my accounts and other settings!) and then import (or open and copy) the exported data back again?&nbsp; Or what cam I do to fix this broken PST?<br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated! -- JCW2<br />

            <p>Within Outlook, or using the mail applet in the control Panel add a new data file. Then in Outlook using the Folder tree view, copy or drag/drop data to the new pst, set this pst as the default data store</p>

<p>You might initially want to run scanpst.exe against that pst to see if it finds/fixes any errors</p>
