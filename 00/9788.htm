<p><span>Hi Lyneg,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the operating system installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you tried this using Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 this happen with any specific website?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check to see if the following steps help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If you are using browsers other than
 Internet Explorer then you may want to try uninstalling them and check if the problem persists.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Vista - Uninstall or change a program</a></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not arise after uninstalling these browsers then you can contact the respective support for browsers and check the cause of
 the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check for the problem using Internet
 Explorer. If the problem also arises with Internet Explorer then you may try optimizing Internet Explorer and check if the problem continues.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue.&nbsp; When I try to change a property of a document that I had previously edited, it responds with "Error:The file is locked for shared use by &lt;my user name&gt;".&nbsp; At the time of this message, the document was not open in either the online
 or desktop editions of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the case in two different browsers (Chrome and Edge), so I think browser cache is not a factor.&nbsp; Also, as requested I tried accessing properties via the ellipsis (More -- Properties) with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had opened this particular document in the online edition of Word, then chose from it to switch to the desktop edition, after which I closed the tab it had been open in online.&nbsp; This may be a factor.&nbsp; It would be worth attempting to reproduce the problem
 in this way.</p>

<p>Hi Gloria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestions.&nbsp; The file was unlocked this morning, so I was able to change the property.&nbsp; If you/Microsoft further investigate this, I think you will find that (3) and (4) can be ruled-out.&nbsp; There were no changes to my permissions around
 this time, and I did open and save the file to see if that would unlock it (it did not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned previously, a likely factor is that I first opened the file in Word online, from where I chose to open it in Word desktop, after which I closed the Word online tab (in Chrome).&nbsp; I suspect that something about this process causes the file to
 remain locked after it is closed in Word desktop.</p>

    <title>Location of Power Icon&#47;Button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason806  say:</h3>
<h2>            Location of Power Icon&#47;Button</h2>
                    <p>First off, I love the return of the Start Menu!&nbsp; I love that I can expand, and minimize the Start Menu!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, I hate that the Power Icon/Button is located in the center of the screen, next to the maximize button.&nbsp; I also hate that when I make it full screen, the Power Icon/Button moves to a completely different location of the screen, the upper right corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Power Icon/Button is too important to be moving around like that, however I do like it being in the Start Menu and not hidden like it was in Windows 8.&nbsp; When shutting down after a long day, I don't want to play "Where's my shutdown button"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems minor,
 but I'm used to my power button being&nbsp;in a&nbsp;place I can shut if off almost without looking.&nbsp; Now I have to find it, either in the middle of the screen or the upper right corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My suggestion... place to the left of the user Name, or maybe Put it where the username is, and move the&nbsp;username to the center of&nbsp;the Start Menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the screen is maximized it will still be in relatively the same location.&nbsp; It will always be on the
 Top Left of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Power Icon&nbsp;...&nbsp;User Icon and Name.....................................................................................Maximize</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Power Icon ........................................User&nbsp;Icon and Name ..................................................Maximize&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry if this seems silly, but next to the maximize button is a very awkward location for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far it is the ONLY thing bugging me about Windows 10.&nbsp; Home Run, Microsoft, and well done!</p>
<p>

This is not right that Microsoft should offer a staged background download and such even with different devices of intenet&nbsp;access- that&nbsp;Microsoft should not be able to protect its download content and be it even in stages&nbsp;to ensure all it right and correct
 and even then to inform the client on just where proceure is or to the fault that&nbsp;Microsoft should be&nbsp;able to correct out (or auto re-do a section). This is very bad news from Micrososft. I have tried to upgrade on two different computers and each have come
 up with the same, same&nbsp;fault error Code 80240020 ), and further I cannot afford a repaeated 3.5 Gb of data download on each computer. I don't have these problems likes with Ubuntu. Are you really saying I have to download all over again 3.5 Gb of data like
 again and again until Microsoft is satisfied. This is turning into a right nightmare

            <p>After getting the OK to download windows 10 and install, it has failed 24 times today, 8/6/2015, 2 times yesterday and 2 times the day before. I have tried every single help tip I found on Microsoft website and not one worked. I guess I can't update to windows
 10 from windows 7 sp1 64bit.&nbsp; All updates for windows 7 have been installed and I have disconnected my vonage phone and router and plugged in directly to the computer. If there is any help out there that I haven't tried please let me know. One of the errors
 and the latest error is 8024000B. I have spent hours online trying all the help tips that were available and none worked.&nbsp; At this point I have given up.

<h2>            How to kill the damn ribbon in office 2010 and higher</h2>
                    Per a friend at MS, the basic menus and such are still in there.&nbsp; They were not removed, just hidden.&nbsp; I have tried for two years with the blank blank ribbons, and I still hate them.&nbsp; I want the old menus back.<br />
<br />
He won't tell me how - says he can lose his job if he tells and gets caught telling how to kill the ribbon.<br />
<br />
Has anyone found the methods to kill the darn thing across all of the office suite at once?&nbsp; I am stuck with the versions due to being "issued" machines.&nbsp; Otherwise I would have already scrubbed them and put on 2003 versions.<br />
<br />
I am NOT interested in the replies dealing with change your attitude and similar.<br />

            Your <i>"friend at MS"</i>, is putting you on. The ribbon menus are here to stay; at least until the next GUI revision.
<div><br />
<div>If you want the old menus back, look into some third party add-ins that will reproduce the old menus (with additional new commands) in the Office 2007/2010/2013 applications. There are many available but I'll decline from recommending any one over another.
 Talk the 'issuer' of your machine and tell them how your productivity has lowered with the ribbon menus. Perhaps you can get them to front the bill for one of these add-ins.</div>

<h2>            Deleted One Note Notebooks appear in list.</h2>
                    <p><span>I have used One Note since 2013 - and deleted quite a few notebooks. But 7 notebooks still appear on the list - both in One Note - Web Version and in the PC version of Office 365. I cannot find any of the corresponding files, neither on OneDrive nor
 on my PC. </span></p>
<p><span>If I try to open them, 6 of the 7 gives the message "cannot find the file you are looking for", but if I right click on them I get a file address. However not an address I have access to.
</span></p>
<p><span>The last I can open, but it is empty, and I cannot find the corresponding file on OneDrive.
</span></p>
<p><span>I started using OneNote on Office 2010, then Office Prof. 2013 and now on 365 Home.

<p>Hi <strong>Jens</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I got your concern correctly, there are deleted notebooks that are still appearing in the list of your OneNote notebooks. In line with this, since these notebooks are showing in both
<strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/notebooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote Online</a></strong> and
<strong>OneNote app </strong>(OneNote 2016) included in your Office 365 subscription, I’d just want to confirm if you’ve already tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using another browser in accessing <strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/notebooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">OneNote Online</a></strong>.</li><li>Signing out of your account from the OneNote 2016 app and signing in back.</li><li>Signing in to your account using the <strong>OneNote for Windows 10</strong>. If you don’t have this, you can download the app
<strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try checking default storage location for backup files of OneNote on your PC, if theses deleted notebooks are still visible. Go to this location:
<strong>C:\Users\<em>user name</em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote\<em>version</em>\Backup</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The suggested steps are for isolation purposes if it happens across all versions of OneNote and some maybe steps to troubleshoot this concern.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

<p>Hi. </p>
<p>I have answered in the order of suggestions.<br />
</p>
<p>Before I wrote the above, I have tried Firefox, Chrome and Edge. I have deleted the cache. The results are the same.<br />
None of the 7 "false" Notebooks have been used since 2014, but they still show up.<br />
When I hover over the link, the address for one of them is is shown to be https://d.docs.live.net/87ff473255673d10/A-C/A-C<br />
When I copy this link into Edge, I get the answer "Could not find file"<br />
<br />
I have signed out of my account and on again. All the old "false" notebooks were there again.
<br />
BUT: Notebook created a new empty notebook with exactly the same name as my primary notebook.<br />
So I had two notebooks available in OneNote with the same name. <br />
I could find and delete this new empty notebook. <br />
But If I then signed out again and signed in, OneNote again created a new notebook.<br />
(I have my Notebooks in a separate folder "OneNote" - neither in the root directory, nor in the documents folder)<br />
<br />
I have tried to download OneNote for Windows 10. The answer on the link was "OneNote is allready installed"<br />
And the only option was "Open OneNote" - nothing to download and install on https://www.onenote.com/download<br />
When I opened it from the page I can see the same notebooks. And when I try to open, I get the message: "Not found"<br />
<br />
I use One Note on my Android devises too. None of them shows these "false" notebooks.
<br />
<br />
On: C:\Users\jens\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote\15\Backup there is nothing other than the two active notebooks.
<br />
Everything is dated 2018 or 2019. </p>
<p>There are only version 15 in C:\Users\jens\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jens</p>

<p>If it was that simple, I would not have bothered to write a question to the community.</p>
<p>In the recent list in OneNote there are only the two "real" notebooks. I can right click on those and close them.
</p>
<p>No problem. However I am not at all interested in deleting the real notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the zombies, I can click on "more notebooks". </p>
<p>A pop up window appear with 7 zombie notebooks. There I have but one option:"open" and when I try to do that I get the answer: "file not found"</p>
<p>Please come up wit a better suggestion than this. </p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to us with result after trying the suggested steps. To further check on this, may I confirm in which version of OneNote do these notebooks have deleted from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I’d just want to verify if you’ve already tried using the
<strong>Close This Notebook</strong> option that can be found in both OneNote 2016 and OneNote for Windows 10 upon right-clicking each notebooks that shouldn’t be appearing anymore. If you haven’t done this yet, you try to do so. To do this, go to the list
 of notebooks, right-click the specific notebook that should already be deleted completely and select Close This Notebook from the list of options.</p>

<p>The zombie notebooks are all from 2014. I worked at a university and had a university license for the office pro - full version. In 2014 it must have been Office 2010 pro. I 2015 or 2016 we changed to Office Pro 2013. I had that until I retired late last
 year. The I subscribed to Office 365 Home. </p>
<p>I did not see the zombies in Office Pro 2013. They appeared in Office 365.</p>

<p>I will add to the above.</p>
<p>I followed your instructions and closed the new empty notebook (The one which was created, when I logged out of OneNote and logged in again)</p>
<p>Now this deleted notebook is closed all right and the file deleted from OneNote.
</p>
<p>BUT now it appears as a zombie notebook along with the rest from 2014. </p>
<p>So my conclusion is: If I accidentaly close one of my active notebooks, there is no way, I can restore it. It will be another zombie.
</p>
<p>Am I right in this conclusion?</p>

<p>I appreciate the information you’ve provided. In line with your conclusion, if a notebook is accidentally closed, this can still be retrieved in OneDrive as long as it’s not yet permanently deleted from the OneNote account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm if you’re still seeing the deleted notebooks in your account even if you’ll sign into either OneNote 2016 or OneNote for Windows 10 using another PC or computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you already tried searching for all the <strong>.one</strong> files in OneDrive to check if the deleted notebooks will appear from there? See this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0457c21a-65d0-49b4-835a-1f46fbc5469c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0457c21a-65d0-49b4-835a-1f46fbc5469c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If the deleted notebooks are no longer showing at all in OneDrive, there’s a possibility that these deleted notebooks that are appearing in the OneNote desktop version may be cache or temp files which are stored in the PC. To further
 isolate this concern, I’d recommend that you try <strong>signing into another user profile account in Windows</strong> or
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new local account</a></strong>. From there, you may sign into your account either through OneNote 2016 or OneNote for Windows
 10. In this way, we’ll be able to see if the same issue will occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.</p>

<p>First: I found the notebook, I deleted in the wastebasket - I must have overlooked that yesterday.<br />
<br />
Now for the zombies.<br />
<br />
I have searched for all .one files on My OneDrive. Only those that are active in my two active notebooks appear. Nothing else.<br />
<br />
I have logged into my Microsoft account from my wife's PC. OneNote 2016 (version 16001....) shows the same zombie notebooks as on my PC.<br />
<br />
The web version looks exactly the same as on my PC.</p>
<p>So the zombie notebooks are not on my PC. They are somewhere in the cloud. Unacessible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>kind regards</p>

                    <p>I have a Micromax canvas winW121 and it's wifi and bluetooth is not working after windows 8.1 update2. It's displaying the message " Can't do this right now" Try again in a little while. if the problem continues , restart your phone and try again. I have
 tried everything from soft reset to hard reset,even tried restoring my phone to the stock OS, but nothing worked. Even installing the insider app didn't work as unfortunately microsoft has not yet released any windows !0 updates for my phone owing to the biased
 about it's own set of devices only. It started working after downgrading to the stock o.s only to pester me with abrupt restarts and ultimately both the wi-fi and bluetooth again stopped working. i tried updating to windows 8.1 update 1 but it didn't work
 out also. Now what am I supposed to do. this is my primary phone please help.</p>

            Hi SJ999,
<br />Welcome to the outlook.com Community. I am an Independent Advisor here to help others. 
<br />IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol. It is the vehicle it is used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. A folder cannot be set to be a certain protocol. 
<br />If you log into <a href="https://outlook.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com</a> can you view your folders on your email account? You have come to this forum for support of your problem. In saying that I will try to help. 
<br />A few questions so we can maybe troubleshoot further. What application and version are you using on your laptop? 
<br />What email Client are you using on your Phone? 
<br />What is the extension of the email client you are having problems with? Not email address just what it is after the @ sign on your email. 
<br />
<br />If using the Android application 
<br />Go to the settings then go to apps
<br />Go to email ( the inbuilt email app in android)
<br />Go to more settings
<br />On top click on the email address itself
<br />Go to folder sync settings
<br />Change the settings from manual to every 15 minutes of each folder one by one
<br />If using the outlook application I will need to know more details on the type of account your using 
<br />For Outlook Application click on link below and log in with your Microsoft account on your laptop and remove your Mobile device. 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/m...</a> 
<br />Select Yes in the confirmation box.
<br />Go to your mobile device and power it off completely.
<br />Restart your mobile device after a few seconds, and then sync your mailbox again.
<br />If none of the above works please answer the questions I have posted. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

            It's also worth noting that even if the message with the attached .exe file had left the Outbox, recipients probably wouldn't be able to use. Blocking .exe file attachments is commonplace, because of the security risks involved. You might try putting the
 file into a .zip archive, which should also reduce the size of the attachment.&nbsp;

    <title>Wrong Versions Listed on Marketplace&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captainvideo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong Versions Listed on Marketplace&#63;</h2>
                    After going to Marketplace on my phone, I see that I have 2 updates available listed under "my applications". The 2 "updates" listed are for "My Phone", and "Windows Live for Mobile"<br />
<br />
The My Phone version listed on Marketplace is 1.6 (released 12/30/09), and the Windows Live for Mobile version listed on Marketplace is 11.1 (released 1/22/10).<br />
<br />
The problem is...after doing both updates, I'm still with the previous versions of both apps. (My Phone 1.05...Windows Live for Mobile 10.7).<br />
<br />
The My Phone version listed on Marketplace doesn't seem to make sense, and the Windows Live for Mobile version listed is brand new (based on the release date)...so, what is the problem with the 'versioning' on Marketplace...and how does one get the newer 11.1
 version of Windows Live for Mobile?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Bob<br />
<br />

<div>That may explain the 'problem' with the My Phone versioning process, but not with the 'newly' released (just 1 day ago) Windows Live for Mobile version on Marketplace, as the older version of that *did* correspond
 to 'normal' versioning procedures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The previous version of Windows Live for Mobile available on Marketplace was 10.7...the problem is that when you try to get the 'new' 11.1, you still get the old 10.7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And to add to the confusion related to the version of Windows Live available on Marketplace...if you go to the MSFT Download Center, you can get a newer version than the one you get on Marketplace (but still
 not the new 11.1)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Marketplace gives you 10.7.0060.xxxx, and the MSFT Download Center gives you 10.7.0061.xxx</div>

            That was also the case for Bin Maps. The version that was available in the Marketplace was trailing behind the version that was available through direct download. For applications coming from other entities this is also the same in a number of cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'mnot quite sure where the 11.1 version number came from. I can't find a listing of all the different builds. I found two builds for 10.6 and two builds for 10.7. If all four of those went through the marketplace then I could see this producing versions 10.6,
 10.7, 10.8, and 10.9 in the Marketplace. That still leaves us two builds short of the 11.1 version labeling. The only other explanation I can think of would be some one editing the text in the application description (yes, editing the application description
 for an app does also resut in a change in version number). <br />
<br />
The builds I found:<br />
<br />
10.6.46.80<br />
10.6.53.1000<br />
10.7.0060<br />

            <p>Hello Tuomas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having updating.&nbsp; I have not been able to find a lot on this error.&nbsp; The most common references I have found have been in relation to updating apps.&nbsp; I would like to start by asking you to clarify
 what kind of update/s you are trying to complete.&nbsp; Also, detail where you get this error.&nbsp; In the Zune software or on the phone itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple things you can consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are trying to update applications or games, try via alternate connections.&nbsp; You can turn off Wi-Fi and or cellular data by going to settings &gt; wi-fi/cellular &gt; OFF.&nbsp;
</li><li>Again if you are trying to update apps, try to update at different times of day.</li><li>If you are trying to update the OS through Zune, the first thing we suggest is to try another computer on another network.&nbsp; When you do this, try to get a second cable as well.&nbsp; This test should allow us to determine if the issue you are having is related
 to your phone, your computer or the cable.</li></ul>
<p>Please provide the following details as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the current OS version running on your phone, tap settings &gt; about &gt; more info.?</li><li>What is the error message that comes along with the code you are receiving?</li><li>If you are trying to update the phone's OS, what OS is running on your computer?</li><li>Who is your mobile operator?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.<br />

    <title>Hard to connect to PC &#43; Slow Sync - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hard to connect to PC &#43; Slow Sync</h2>
                    
<p>Started using a new Mobile 6 HTC 6800 Pocket PC phone two weeks back and had little issue connecting with ActiveSync 4.5 and Windows XP.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last few days, however, I am having quite a bit of difficulty to either connect (half the time it can't find the device or finds it but says it can't sync) or, if it does start the sync, to get the device / laptop to exchange all the
 information, even with a manual sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thinking the docking station was the issue, I'm connecting direct to the USB&nbsp;cable, but&nbsp;the updating&nbsp;still crawls (over 20 minutes)&nbsp;before cancelling&nbsp;the sync.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't think of anything that has changed to my laptop setup over the last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Attaching photos to Outlook for Mac 2016 e-mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n_hxo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Attaching photos to Outlook for Mac 2016 e-mail</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have recently installed Outlook 2016 for Mac through Office 365 and wanted some help attaching photos, I am relatively new to using Mac's and perhaps this is my problem (I have to say I am very very very unlikely ever to buy a Mac again for work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to attach photos to e-mail and them just stay as attachments as at the moment when I add them they show up in the e-mail and are huge, making the e-mail very very long. I would be happy if they just showed up as thumbnails until clicked on but I don't
 like it as it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I copy and paste pictures in I just get the file directory in the e-mail and not the picture? I really dislike how there seems to be no simple way to do anything on Macs, they seem to make it purposely different from Windows, furthermore on Windows
 I like how there's a million different way to basically everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was Apple's complete lack of competence in their bundled "productivity suite" which made me go ahead and purchase Office 365, having the latest Office already on my Windows machine, in the first place. Their e-mail program is a complete joke. Furthermore
 the word and excel equivalent don't save as standard into *.docx and *.xlsx compatible files , who on earth do they think uses their bundled suites that they're so full of self importance that it is incomprehensible to them that people would like their files
 to be automatically compatible with the 90+% of the worlds computers which run Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the rant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers for any help you can provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nick</p>

<h2>            Start Menu not working, Search, Cortana not working, Windows Uninstaller not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;Toshiba Laptop which used to be&nbsp;Windows 8.1, and upgraded for free to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I also have multiple problems since the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I've tried the various solutions on the Internet, but none of them seem to be working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Start menu - if I click on the windows button, it says I need to log off and restart&nbsp; That little blue screen can't be minimized, and is very annoying</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Recently, I tried to uninstall the stamps.com software, and it said my Windows Installer is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Yesterday, Start Menu actually worked once (just the left menu without the tiles came up), but then it went back to not working after a reboot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like it to stay working because I'm afraid to click on the start menu in case the little blue pop up
 came back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd &nbsp;really like to fix this problem which has been plaguing me for 4 months (ever since I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10).</p>
<p>I won't upgrade any of my other computers till this is resolved.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me get it working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very&nbsp; much for your help!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Frances</p>

If Office was a retail version and you have the install <br />

the new system.<br />

    <title>N72 Unable to connect to external GPS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webdeepak---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N72 Unable to connect to external GPS</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have a N72 and have recently installed Nokia maps on my phone. Also upgraded to phone to the latest version<br />
<br />
I'm not able to use external bluetooth gps receiver to act as GPS location provider for Nokia maps.<br />
When I start Nokia Maps it asks for pairing bluetooth devices and I search and find GPS receiver and connect but after few seconds it asks me to connect again.<br />
<br />
I can connect to the GPS receiver via simple bluetooth pairing device.<br />
<br />
The GPS I'm using is the following.<br />
BN-905GR - Bluetooth GPS (NEW)<br />
<a href="http://www.bluenext.co.uk/bluetooth-gps/bn-905gr-inav-bluetooth-gps.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bluenext.co.uk/bluetooth-gps/bn-905gr-inav-bluetooth-gps.html</a><br />
<br />
The GPS receiver flashes the GPS light meaning it has locked into satellites but how do I get this information to Nokia maps to use?<br />
<br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

            It is incredible, the same happened to me today.<br />
The pairing is ok, but not Blue tooth connetion between phone (E61i) and GPS antenna when I open Nokia Maps or Google maps.<br />
I've just given back to the shop the GPS BT antenna and consequently I can't check if the solution I've found in another post is right.<br />
The suggested solution is to enable the GPS blue tooth in the positioning settings.<br />
I don't know where is this setting in your phone but, according to the above mentioned post, on N82 or N95 is:<br />
Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Positioning &gt; Positioning Methods &gt; Bluetooth GPS &gt; Enable.<br />
In my E61 is under Menu &gt; tools &gt; positioning &gt; GPS Bluethooth.<br />
In my phone this setting was not enabled.<br />
Please let me know if the solution is ok or not, so I will buy again the antenna.<br />
Best regards<br />
Piero

            Hi Piero,<br />
I called Nokia support yesterday and asked them where GPS positioning is on N72 as they say needs to be set for Nokia Maps to accept GPS reading from the external receiver.<br />
<br />
To my amazement "They couldn't find any..."<br />
<br />
They have logged the call and willl call Head Office in Finland and will get back tome within 2-3 working days.<br />
<br />
I shall keep you updated.<br />
<br />
So the story so far, there is no GPS positioning method in N72 and other lower versions of the Symbian mobiles. But you can get the maps.

            Nokia did call me and said that there was a problem with Nokia Maps on N72. FULL STOP. Meaning with all Nokia N72s.<br />
<br />
They took the GPS receiver that I'm using and will test the software again and will get back to me within ONE working day.<br />
<br />
This was THREE days ago and I haven't heard anything so far.<br />
<br />
Will keep you updated.

<h2>            continuum and network file transfer</h2>
                    I have a microsoft 950 and the continuum dock.&nbsp; Is there a way to access network shares using continuum dock / big screen so I transfer my photos from my phone to my NAS storage device.&nbsp; I can hook up the phone directly to the computer via a USB cable,
 but it would be nice if I could just do this via the continuum interface.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unable to download Office 2010. Error - Product key not eligible for free download</h2>
                    <p>Original title: office 2010 activation on windows 8.1 - product key but no disk<br />
<br />
Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been asked before, but I've tried those suggestions, and they haven't worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just purchased a new computer, and I want to reinstall my 2010 Home and Student office. I still have 2/3 installations available, and I have the product key, but not the disk itself, which is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going onto the 2010 backup page on the microsoft site (the one people usually link to), and in-putting the product key, but when I do that, the error message says that the product with this key isn't eligible for free download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong? Is there another page?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in the UK, if that makes a difference file-wise....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited to say: Ideally, without having to call in, because the mobile signal is terrible where I am, and it's impossible to stay on the line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
