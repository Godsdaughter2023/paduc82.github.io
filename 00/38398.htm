<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)"><span><strong>On 28/12/2018. Last month, day 28, I got the last Windows Update version 1809 build 17763 or something like that, since then I started having issues with my sound and issues with Forza Horizon
 4, since that day my game kept crushing and lagging and so on, so I decided to use Windows recovery tool thing to get back to the previous update/build, and so I did, everything worked fine until I started the game and lots of hours of game-play were lost,
 I was lv 180, and now I am 35... , I can still see the last achievements on the Xbox app account on pc. What can I do, please help me.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)"><strong>Already tried reinstalling the game, also tried resetting the game data from Xbox and then re-</strong><span><strong>syncing, I also deleted the save game directly from the directory on the PC, started
 the game,&nbsp;</strong></span></span><strong>re-</strong><span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)"><strong>syncing the data successfully and same old save-game.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)"><strong>Also posted this on Forza.Motorsport forums like 10 days ago, no one answered, I also sent a ticket to Turn 10 Studio, no answer, I have friends that tickets automatically
 deleted after 20 days without any answer.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)"><strong>I've found similar if not the same cases like mine where Turn 10 offered the person who lost the data, his garage value money back and the cars, that is what I want, but
 it doesn't seems Turn 10 even care about its customers, we pay $100 to lose our data that we worked for in the game..., a big company like this doesn't have the right people to address our issues ? How is this even possible?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">This is not acceptable !!!!</span><br />

The solution did not address my problem.&nbsp; All it did was show me how to select it.&nbsp; What I'm trying to say is those options are no longer available to get to the double-side print screen.&nbsp; Do I need to re-install the driver?<br />

<h2>            Licence Transfer for Black Ops 3 Season Pass&#47;Digital Deluxe Edition request</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am contacting in regards to a licence transfer request from a banned account that I have with the gamertag "xx Bazzaa"</p>
<p>This account was banned early november and I understand the reasons why it was banned and am not here to ask for it to be unbanned. I &nbsp;here to politely request to the XBLPET a licence transfer of the Season Pass or my Digital Deluxe Bundle of Black Ops 3 to my new account. That is all I am asking. It is the most expensive thing on my account, and it would break me to buy it again. And with the upcoming dlc 5 being released, i would really love to play it. I hope this gets to the right people and I hope this request is granted. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hi
<span><span>lottsafreckles</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since when are you facing this problem? Do you get any error message? Did you make any changes to your system?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Boot the computer in safe mode:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To use a Safe Boot option, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple
 operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Select an option when the
<strong>Windows Advanced Options</strong> menu appears, and then press ENTER. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c. When the
<strong>Boot</strong> menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<span>If it works fine in safe mode, you infer that any third party programs are causing the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2: Clean Boot</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Put the computer in clean boot (to figure out if any third party software is hindering the process)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check with the Step 1 (Perform a clean boot):- if everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services
 are causing the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have
 to update or install a higher version of the program and also remember to put the computer back to normal startup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 3:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Download flash player removal tool from adobe site:
</span><a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/141/tn_14157.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/141/tn_14157.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can download and reinstall Flash Player from this link:

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I open my MDI files&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: Why can't I open my zillion MDI files? Did I say zillion, yes zillion!<br />
</em><br />
Let me say first that I print a lot of documents to the computer, in fact my 80G computer is full and I'm having to move things to an external hard&nbsp;drive.&nbsp; I had updates to my computer last night.&nbsp; Today when I started it I could no longer open my mdi files.&nbsp;
 One time before I had a problem after an update so though it caused a great deal of stress I was sure that if I followed the same steps this time I would again be able to open them.&nbsp; I tried and I tried but I couldn't get them to open.&nbsp; How can Microsoft arbitrarily
 stop a program from working or change the destination?&nbsp; I can understand if they change the way the printer works, or the type of document it creates, but they could at least allow the prior documents created to still open/work.</p>
<p>What do I do? I have a zillion mdi files, all important to me.&nbsp; I have been so stressed today trying to figure out what to do; everything I tried hasn't worked and I need some of these files right away.&nbsp; Any ideas that have worked for you?</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help/advice you could give me.&nbsp; My husband is looking online for PDF software because I don't know how long Microsoft will support the printing software they are using now for printing to the computer.&nbsp; Is there something else I should
 use that I can count on?</p>
<p>Sorry I have so many questions, I just can't take this again.&nbsp; I would appreciate any advice you can give me regarding this.</p>
<p>Thanks again. </p>
<p>^j^May you and your loved ones be blessed with peace, love, joy, and health now and forever.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>OOPS, SORRY I should have told you I have Windows 7 and Office 2010.&nbsp; Thanks</strong></p>

    <title>Windows Update killed wifi on my Thinkpad laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david-rubin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update killed wifi on my Thinkpad laptop</h2>
                    Just applied automatic Windows Updates and it killed my wifi. &nbsp;Automatic installation of the "Intel Driver Centrino Advanced-N6200 AGN" failed, as did subsequent attempts to manually install that driver. &nbsp;The network is up, because my phone and tablet
 can connect wirelessly. &nbsp;The Thinkpad can connect via ethernet cable, but not wifi. &nbsp;Suggestions?

<p>
</p><p>If no joy then download the latest supported WiFi driver from the manufacturers support site for your laptop make and model and see if that installs ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;right-click the update if its&nbsp;represented and hide it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>downloaded driver from intel and tried to install. &nbsp;got a result of "success" when i ran "repair" from the Intel Proset/Wireless Software and Drivers (15.11.0.7 Windows 7, 32-bit) for legacy adapters. &nbsp;rebooted as instructed. &nbsp;still no wifi.</p>

            Hi Eden
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK

            Hi EdenGamer1 
<br />to prevent windows asking for a password on boot
<br />click start 
<br />type netplwiz and press enter 
<br />untick "users must enter a username and password..." 
<br />click apply 
<br />(if it is already unticked, tick the box and click apply then untick it again and click apply)
<br />you will be asked for a username and password (used to automatically log on). 
<br />if you are using a Microsoft account enter the FULL email address. 
<br />enter and verify your password and click ok 
<br />next time you boot the computer it will automatically log on. 
<br />
<br />NOTE - there is no need to switch to a local account, it WORKS perfectly well with a Microsoft account, as long as you enter the full email address in the username field. 
<br />blank passwords are NOT a good idea.
<br />do not forget the password.
<br />
<br />to prevent it asking for a password when waking from sleep, go to settings -&gt; accounts -&gt; sign-in options 
<br />under "require sign-in" select Never. 
<br />
<br />hope that helps please let us know if you experience any problems.

            is it a microsoft account or a local account?
<br />did you enter the correct details when prompted?
<br />if the username or password is not entered correctly when setting this up, windows will still prompt for a password.
<br />if it is a microsoft account, your username is the full email address associated with the account.

    <title>Terrible network speed when connecting monitor via displayport - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> estruyf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Terrible network speed when connecting monitor via displayport</h2>
                    <p>When I connect my surface to an external monitor via the displayport (VGA, DVI) the device starts lagging. The network speed is terrible once connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a network test when my Surface Pro 4 is not connected to an external monitor:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/504cf424-320f-4dac-9fad-2dd6c19cb633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/504cf424-320f-4dac-9fad-2dd6c19cb633" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once an external monitor is connected, the speed drop looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d04f68f8-7cf0-43e9-b503-179d9525c79e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d04f68f8-7cf0-43e9-b503-179d9525c79e" /></a></p>

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us. Do you connect the external display directly to your Surface via the mini display port on the Surface or via a docking station?&nbsp; What's the outcome if you try using a different display port adapter ?</p>
<p>Also, please make sure you have the most current updates installed. </p>

<h2>            Unable to access start menu folder &#40;as well as others&#41;, under the users&#47;owner folder.  I get access is denied.</h2>
                    My wife and I are both running windows 7, x64 on different laptops.<br />
On my wife's laptop, I noticed that I am unable to access several folders under the c:/users/owner folder (owner being owner name).&nbsp; Folders like Local Settings and Start Menu, give an access denied error.&nbsp; I tried going into the properties to change the access,
 but get the same thing when I try to save the changes.&nbsp; I get access denied.&nbsp; We are both admin's on our machines, and I can get into these folders just fine.&nbsp; I also noticed that on her laptop, the folders in question appear to be shortcuts, where on mine,
 they are regular folders.&nbsp; <br />
Does anyone have an idea why she cannot access her own folders on her own computer, when she is an admin?<br />

            <p>Oh.&nbsp; Just re-read and had the epiphany we needed to end this.&nbsp; I think..&nbsp; Hah - yeah - those folders are not what they used to be.</p>
<p>Even if you get in them - they TRULY have nothing you need.&nbsp; Those are junction points - not what you are trying to get to (if you know why you are trying to get into them even.)</p>
<p>Local Settings in Windows 7?&nbsp; That's now at: C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Local</p>
<p>Start Menu in Windows 7?&nbsp; That's now at C:\users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu</p>
<p>(Or all users Start Menu: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu)</p>

            Hi benedicimickala 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi benedicimickala 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

    <title>Can&#39;t save documents or pictures in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martits  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t save documents or pictures in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10, my administrative permissions have been blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to save a document or picture in either the Documents, Pictures, Music, Downloads, Videos, or Desktop folders I get one of two message. The first is this:-
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"You don't have permission to save to this location. Contact the administrator to obtain permission. Do you want to save in the Pictures folder instead?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click 'yes' and try to save it in the suggested folder and it shows the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other message is if I open an excel document and try to save it again, I get this message:-</p>
<p>"Cannot access read only document C:/xxxxxx/xxxx/xxxx/xxxxx"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know why I am being blocked so I have gone into the folder properties and changed the security settings to give full access to anyone and also unchecked the 'read only' box, but the settings the changes don't save. I can't unblock these folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am forced to save my stuff to USB stick. Bare in mind I have never had this problem until I installed Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Just for anyone else with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the issue is fixed for me but I'm not sure if it'll last or it is a proper fix. I couldn't do any of the steps mentioned above but after the latest Windows 10 update, I tried the thing I tried at first and it seems to have saved properly now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Right click on the folder (eg Documents, Pictures etc)</p>
<p>2. Select 'properties'.</p>
<p>3. Select 'security' tab.</p>
<p>4. Select 'edit'.</p>
<p>5. Select 'system'.</p>
<p>6. Ensure all the 'allow' checkboxes are ticked.</p>
<p>7. Do the same for the other users and homegroups (eg 'home users', 'administrators')</p>
<p>8. Click apply.</p>
<p>9. Click 'OK'.</p>
<p>10. Go back to the 'General' tab.</p>
<p>11. Untick the 'Read only' box.</p>
<p>12. Click 'apply'.</p>
<p>13. Click 'ok'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to have worked for me for now but when I go back to 'properties', the 'read only' checkbox remains ticked. So there is definitely a problem with Windows 10 here.</p>

            Try it again, but make sure you tell IE to "NOT" restore your last session.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, attempt to click on the "x" on each tab (you probably already tried that, but do it again) to close them and leave one open.&nbsp; Then, click "HOME" and close
 the web browser.<br />
<br />
Now, if doesn't work, then open the Control Panel and go to "Network and Internet" and under "Internet Options", click on "Delete browsing history and cookies".<br />

<p><span>Hi Philippa – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>Well, preventing hackers is not a easy task. However, I might give you some advice of what you shall do. First off, turn off that
 hotmail account and cleanup your PC from viruses and “keyloggers” – next, make a new hotmail account that nobody knows accept some of your friends which you trust.
</span></p>
<p><span>Do not talk to much about your new account or your password or password length.
<br />
<br />
Be careful, and check the PC for keyloggers. A keylogger is a program that is designed to log physical key presses and store them in a file and send them over Internet by mail, using the SMTP port 25.<br />
<br />
As the hacker retrieves the mail, he opens the *.txt and finds your address and the password.
<br />
Next, he will sign-in to Windows® Live and reset your password and change your profile information.<br />
<br />
I hope you find this information useful and if you need any further assistance, <br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information was helpful…</span></p>
<p><span>Have a nice day…</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,<br />
Fisnik</span></p>

Try to install the game in a new user account and check if it helps.<br />
Create a new user account and check if it works.<br />

    <title>Problem using &#34;open with&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem using &#34;open with&#34;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
My apologies first if I have posted this in the wrong forum.<br />
If so, can you direct me to the right forum.<br />
<br />
I am using Windows7, with all latest updates installed.<br />
I have just installed a new version of a design program I have used for years, called "Design Spark v5.0" (DS).<br />
It uses files with the extensions&nbsp; .sch and .pcb<br />
<br />
It all works fine when I launch the program, then use the Menu - File - Open to open an existing design.<br />
But I like to just click on the .sch or .pcb filename and have it open. Windows 7 naturally does not recognize the file type, and asks me to select a program. I normally have no problem with this, and indeed with the older DSv4.1 there was no difficulty.<br />
<br />
But now when I browse to either the executable, or the desktop shortcut, for the program, and select "open", it does not add it to the list of Other Programs, and so I can't nominate it as the program to run.<br />
<br />
I have tried the Design Spark Forum, with reply as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not able to reproduce your problem on my Win7 installation. In my case designspark appears in the "open with list" after I added it manually.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is more a Windows problem than a designspark problem. Or maybe there are some conflicts with
 other DS installations or so.<br />
But you can try the following.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Regedit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Got to <span style="font-style: italic">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.sch\OpenWithList</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Right click on the right side =&gt; New =&gt; String Value <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Name the new String as a character which is not already in the list. In my case "c"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Set the value to "designspark.exe"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Edit the String "MRUList" and add you new created String name to the value of "MRUList", in my case is was "ab" and now it is "abc"<br />
<br />
So I tried the above suggestions, with result as follows:<br />
In fact designspark.exe was already listed there, and on the MRUlist.<br />
Just to be sure, I added it again with a new letter, and added that to MRUlist,<br />
I also have tried setting designspark.exe as the default.<br />
The registry editor accepts all this, but it all makes no difference.<br />
I have of course re-booted just in case that is required.<br />
And finally I have completely removed and re-installed designspark v5.0., so I don't think there should be any conflicts with older DS installations.<br />
<br />
The problem remains.<br />
The DS Forum responder cannot reproduce my problem, which suggests there is nothing wrong with DesignSpark, but rather it is something to do with my installation of Windows.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
Many thanks,&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Has anyone successfully used Clonezilla in Surface Pro 3&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We have been using Clonezilla to capture and restore image to computers. Our company decided to make the switch from laptops to Surface tablets. We are still in the testing stage with Surface, but we can't seem to use Clonezilla to capture the image. I can
 boot from a usb with Clonezilla but when the window to choose the language comes up, Clonezilla freezes. Another issue we have been trying to figure out is when we do sysprep OOBE, the Surface crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody had any success with imaging Surface Pro 3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I'm actually in the process of doing that as I speak/type!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This guy posted the following...</p>
<p>http://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/89307-how-i-got-clonezilla-to-image-our-surface-pro-3s</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I didn't do this (I read this after I had started).</p>
<p>Its a bit of a pain, mainly due to the single USB port but mitigated if you know the gotchas!</p>
<p>I decided that, due to the single USB 3 port, rather than use a flash drive, I'd use a USB HD instead so I could put both the clonezilla live image and the images on it.</p>
<p>I used: Tuxboot to ensure the HD was bootable with Clonezilla live.</p>
<p>http://clonezilla.org/liveusb.php</p>
<p>Gotcha 1). &nbsp;Ensure you format the HD as Fat32 for booting Clonezilla (this requirement related to EUFI in the Surface Pro). &nbsp; If you don't do this then your tablet will not boot from the USB and will just return you to Windows. &nbsp;In my case I created two
 partitions, a very small Fat32 drive and the rest was an NTFS drive for my images. &nbsp;I'm guessing you got all this based on your post above but this is for completeness for other interested readers.</p>
<p>Gotcha 2). &nbsp;The surface pro has some kind of protection on it which inhibits what it classes as unsafe boots. &nbsp;You need to disable this in the (minimal) BIOS. &nbsp;To avoid repetition (and save me some typing), check out the top link from this post for info.
 &nbsp;Additional to this I had to mess around with Bitlocker settings once I had disabled this secure boot thing. &nbsp;Again, you must have solved this according to your post.</p>
<p>Gotcha 3). &nbsp;After doing all this and booting from the USB drive (details in the other post on how to boot from USB for other readers), the Surface Pro keyboard stopped responding after the Linux boot. &nbsp; I initially thought the thing had frozen but this was
 not the issue. &nbsp;<strong>Maybe this was your problem too?</strong> It is at exactly the same point (language selection) where it *appeared* to have frozen. &nbsp;I suspected some driver issue so then I experimented and got a USB HUB out, plugged in a wired keyboard
 and rebooted.</p>
<p>This time all was well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its literally just finished saving the image now. &nbsp;Dare I attempt to restore from image to test it....</p>
<p>Yup. &nbsp;I have the Windows rescue disk to hand, just in case.</p>
<p>If this turns out to be a problem then I'll update this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Damn it, I went to the bathroom and tripped over the USB cable while attempting to restore the image!</p>
<p>So I've started it again though it seemed to work so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking of a way of doing all this without a HUB (for better portability). &nbsp;I guess it's possible to create a bootable microsd card and just use the single USB port on the Surface Pro for the wired keyboard. &nbsp;That is assuming you have enough room
 left for the image(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For speed of restoration/saving images, I'm going to try partition the Surface Pro's main drive and use the second partition to store disk images. &nbsp;That is if I can shrink the main disk. &nbsp;SD's don't like to be defragged!</p>

            <p>Booting clonezilla from microsd and using the surfaces pros own (partitioned) SSD to store the disk images worked a treat if anyone is interested (after a few teething problems). &nbsp;It now restores in around 7 minutes and I just need a USB keyboard and the
 microsd (no hub or anything else).</p>
<p>Obviously you want to take a backup of your disk image elsewhere though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and, do yourself a favour and disable BitLocker in the control panel unless you really need the additional security.</p>
<p>Seems to have quite an impact on the SSDs performance.</p>

            <p>Hello Martyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you outline please how you managed to successfully clone the Surface Pro 3's using Clonezilla, I'm in the process of trying to setup 40 units but I'm not having much luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Clonezilla for many years so I know the basics of it, but trying to run it on these machines I'm getting all kinds of errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd already come across the Spicework posting which I've followed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of Clonezilla did you use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To outline my setup I've got:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>64GB Surface Pro 3</p>
<p>I've setup Windows from a clean install from scratch - updated drivers / firmware etc</p>
<p>I have an External USB 3.0 driver, with 1 small Fat32 Partition which contains Clonezilla Live, and a 2nd NTFS partition which contains the images.</p>
<p>USB 3.0 Four Port Hub</p>
<p>USB Keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On one occasion I managed to create an image file with no problem, but when I tried to restore it to another machine it just fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spend hours and hours trying to get this working, and it's starting to get me down now!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help / advice / tips / gotchas that have not&nbsp;already been mentioned would be great as I've tried&nbsp;all my usual tips and tricks from doing this sort of thing for the last 10 years and this&nbsp;has really failed me :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried using FOG but can't get it to see the FOG boot menu from PXE boot (using the official Microsoft USB Adapter) and I've also tried getting my head around Windows WDS / Deployment Workbech - but this works in a totally different way to Clonezilla/Fog
 and I find create a custom image is sooooooo slow to try and restore!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope somebody can post me an answer to what I might be doing wrong with these machines!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Matt</p>

            <p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are having difficulty. &nbsp;I hope my reply does not come too late, I haven't checked this email address or this post for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the latest version of CloneZilla and I used the latest version of TuxBoot to make the MicroSD bootable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you are doing all the right things, Fat32 for CloneZilla live, etc.</p>
<p>In what way does it just fail? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it fail to *boot* after restore? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it fail *during* restore?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it give you some error code/description?</p>
<p>If it is failing during restore (and I'm totally guessing) I wonder if your hub is causing you problems while restoring from the Ext USB drive? &nbsp;Does it work when using an internal partition or microSD card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the sounds of it, you are definitely getting to boot CloneZilla and select options. &nbsp;I am using the basic/beginners option, not touching key map, etc and (after a few teething problems) its all working fine for me.</p>
<p>I did at first make a mistake in that I saved the *disk* rather than just the partition to image and I had problems when I attempted to restore that from the image.</p>
<p>So then (after I rebuilt my destroyed OS from Windows backup) I saved just the main partition to image. &nbsp;I didn't touch any of those other partitions that Windows creates (two at the start I think) though I did eventually destroy the windows restore partition
 (at the end of the disk) to save space.</p>
<p>It all worked pretty smoothly for me after this, I made another partition image just this weekend.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm a programmer by trade so this is just a hobby for me and my preferred backup solution so I'm afraid so I can't comment on PXE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply! It wasn't too late... I'm still struggling to get it to work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally flattened the Surface Pro 3 and reinstalled Windows from a fresh install onto a reference machine - I deleted the partitions and allowed Windows Setup to create these partitions. (I'm installing Win 8.1 Enterprise)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to create a successful image file of a Surface Pro 3 DISK but it fails on restore, using different versions of clonezilla I've had mixed results - one version (can't remember which at the top of my head) restored sda1 sda2 sda3 and failed
 whilst restoring sda4 which I believe Is the C Drive partition in my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version I'm currently trying again creates the image fine but when I go to restore I get the message saying unable to find target partition sda1 and doesn't then attempt to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did try just doing an image of OS partition, but that failed too - I'll try doing another reference image tomorrow on a fresh machine and leave the other partitions in tack and try just taking a clone of the OS partition again and see if that works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>do you know what variation of the latest build you used? Did you use the Ubuntu based version or Debian - and was it the amd64 version or i686-pae ? I'm assuming you used the latest stable version or was it latest testing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached some of the screenshots I get when I try and restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst ive been trying to get Clonezilla working in this scenario- I've also been trying to get it to work with MDT and custom image files but find that so sloooow compared to sector imaging like Fog/Clonezilla!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

            <p>Morning Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeez - what a headache! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are alluding to, this does definitely look like a software/version issue. &nbsp;There's no other magic I've done to get this working above and beyond what you have already done and I strongly suspect you know a lot more than me in this field. &nbsp;I guess
 I've just been lucky!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me I used the latest stable release - "clonezilla-live-2.3.2-22-i686-pae.iso".</p>
<p>I just used the i686-pae drop down for file type ISO from this page...</p>
<p>http://clonezilla.org/downloads/download.php?branch=stable</p>
<p>I'm also just using the Windows 8.1 version that come installed on the Pro but I suspect the OS has nothing to do with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in other forums that people recommended using the uEFI secure boot version though I don't think the one I successfully used was this secure boot.</p>
<p>From the error messages in your screen shots, it looks like it is an issue with setting up the partition table for the new gpt format. &nbsp;Ironically maybe the uEFI secure boot version is causing the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried using the version listed above? &nbsp;For both saving an image and restoring?</p>
<p>And it may be worth just trying the main partition initially, maybe even back to the same machine. &nbsp;Just to test that this works, then build on from there if it does.</p>
<p>If you like (after work so it will be this evening), I can perform a backup and get my camera out so you can compare output?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Trying to think about this more logically, with regards to what worked and what didn't...</p>
<p>As I said, I didn't touch the first two partitions that Windows created before the main partition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure why there are two but I guess *one* of these two must contain the boot loader and this must be in the GPT format for the EUFI bios to be able to see and boot from it. &nbsp;Somewhere along the boot process this must pass execution control onto the
 main partition that has the Windows installation on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, given that all I saved/restored was the partition with Windows on it, then I guess its possible that CloneZilla in general has issues with setting up GPT formats and therefore this might explain why people suggest using this uEFI secure boot and why
 you are having limited success.</p>
<p>Your use case is different to mine as I am not needing to setup boot sectors and GPT disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked in Disk Management.</p>
<p>I have the following (in order) on Disk 0...</p>
<p>1). &nbsp;350MB Recovery Partition</p>
<p>2). &nbsp;200 MB<strong> EFI </strong>System partition</p>
<p>3). 100 GB *<strong>NTFS</strong>* Partition - C:\ this is my Windows installation/partition.</p>
<p>4). &nbsp;137.81 GB NTFS Partition - D:\ (a spare partition I setup so I could store disk images and other data on it). &nbsp;Not relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, note that partition 2 is the <strong>EFI </strong>system partition - this must be the GPT formatted partition that the UEFI bios is using to boot from. &nbsp;My
<em>Windows </em>installation partition is just <strong>NTFS</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This givens me an even stronger suspicion that the issue is with CloneZilla not being fully compatible with the GPT format (or at least one must be very selective over picking the version to use). &nbsp;It just happened to work for me because I only touched the
 NTFS partition. &nbsp;It maybe there is a version that does work correctly with GPT (e.g uEFI secure boot) or maybe not. &nbsp;This isn't a problem I've had to solve for my scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you could try first is just seeing if you can save/restore just your Windows Partition (as I suggested in the last post). &nbsp;This might go along to confirm my suspicions.</p>
<p>Total guess work in general but, if that succeeds and you are lucky then it might be that the EFI system partitions created by the installation of windows DO NOT CHANGE between versions. &nbsp;I.e. &nbsp;Your enterprise Windows may have the exactly the same EIF system
 partition as the default one. &nbsp;If that is the case then you will just be able to restore to the windows partition to clone your machines. &nbsp;This should be easy enough to test.</p>
<p>Failing that, you are probably going to have to experiment to see if you can find a version that fully understands EFI. &nbsp;This secure boot thing looks like the right way to go but I suspect you've already tried it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, used MDT or whatever else to restore <em>just</em> the EFI partition (this is only small so should not take long). &nbsp;Then use CloneZilla just to restore the Windows partition as NTFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this assumes you want a version (of the EFI partition) created from a specific Windows version other than the stock installation. &nbsp;If you are cloning/restoring just from stock EFI partition then I see no reason why just restoring a modified Windows
 partition alone (using the same version I did) should not work. &nbsp;In short, don't touch the EFI partition with CloneZilla.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you get on, &nbsp;this could be a looong day!<br />
</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Martyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your detailed responses - they're very much appreciated!! I've had a bit of a break thr today! I restored one of the Surfaces back to factory defaults using the USB key I created to make the Microsoft Recovery disk - this restored
 all the original partitions - I then then make a couple of changes on the desktop for testing and took an image of just that partition, the portion saved with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i then took a second Surface Pro 3 (with factory defaults in place) and restored the image to just the Windows partition and that worked!! So that was a success!</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I will try next is run the Windows setup and instead of deleting all the portions, I will leave them all as they are and just format the Windows partition to reinstall Win 8 Ent - then setup as I want and clone that partition do restore - I'm hoping
 (fingers crossed) that this will work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted on the Clonezilla forums to see if the developer has any idea why I'm not able to do a whole disk image to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update this topic with my findings when tested so others will know for future if they find themselves in the same position!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks once again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Matt</p>

            <p>Awesome, glad you got there in the end!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this lack of being able to restore the entire disk probably relates to EFI and compatabilities with CloneZilla. &nbsp;Hopefully the developer may be able to shed some light and suggest the right version for this problem!</p>

            I recommend that you do a manual update for this KB. 
<br />
<br />1. Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. You can download the updates from Microsoft Catalog and update manually. Search for relevant KB in the Catalog.

            Hi David, that is a major cumulative Update, some users are reporting problems installing that update
<br />
<br />The most successful method would be to download the offline installer from the Microsoft Catalog page and install using the resulting msu file
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />
<br />Note down whether Windows is 32bit or 64bit
<br />
<br />Click the link below and download the appropriate version of that update (x64 or x86)
<br />
<br />When the download completes, double click the msu file to begin installing 
<br />

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Are you sure that it is 500 MB partition as Windows 10 requires few GBs for itself.

    <title>Outgoing calls not connecting on Skype 7.56 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outgoing calls not connecting on Skype 7.56</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently been experiencing an odd issue. I've tried calling Skype users from our main studio computer on both computer&nbsp;and mobile and my outgoing call does not connect. It continually makes the small clicking sound as if it's about to connect, but never
 initiates the ring tone. Incoming calls&nbsp;all seem to be working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried calling my own Skype account on my iPhone from the Skype account in question and the same thing occurs. I get a notification in the chat on my iPhone that I have missed a call, but it does not ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume this might be a network configuration&nbsp;issue on the main Skype&nbsp;machine? I tried updating to the latest version, but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Luke</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the first time that you are experiencing the issue and have you already tried a different network connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now try these steps to troubleshoot:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open your Skype app and click&nbsp;on any contact to pull up the chatbox</p>
<p>2 . Type <strong>/dumpmsnp </strong>manually then press Send</p>
<p>3. After getting the series of messages, type <strong>/msnp24</strong> then press Send again</p>
<p>4. Sign out and sign back in again on your Skype application and check if the issue will still persist</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above suggestion doesn't work, please do a complete uninstall/reinstall of&nbsp;the Skype app on your device by following the steps on this
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12073/how-can-i-completely-uninstall-and-then-reinstall-skype-for-mac-os-x?q=uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="click here">
link </a>and check again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Zella_A</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both of your suggestions, but with no luck. I ran the commands then signed out and back in. Problem persists. Then I uninstalled&nbsp;and reinstalled the latest version of Skype. Problem persists. I also tried on both a wired and wireless connection,
 with no luck. I thought&nbsp;since my wired connection is configured to be a static IP address, that might have some effect. No dice. Could there be some network configuration issue that is interfering&nbsp;with outgoing calls? I am able to call phone numbers, just
 not other Skype users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Luke</p>
