<h2>            I need to recover purged emails from my hotmail</h2>
                    I accidentally deleted everything from my inbox in my hotmail, and I did as the help suggested to recover the emails... my recovered emails were moved, then I selected a few that I no longer wanted from my deleted folder and purged them. &nbsp;This action ALSO
 purged the items that I had selected to "recover". &nbsp;These particular emails that I had originally recovered, I desperately need! &nbsp;PLEASE HELP ME get them back!! PLEASE!

    <title>Double-click AFTER the end of your document... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Double-click AFTER the end of your document...</h2>
                    <p>Disclaimer: I'm a technical trainer at a law firm and have advised the user to just&nbsp;<em>stop doing this</em>; but she keeps asking and I am intrigued by the behavior (since I'm a geek). AKA: why does this even do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, open up Word and turn on your Show/Hide option (just makes this easier to watch). I've been able to do this without entering ANY text, but you're welcome to enter some if it makes you feel better. :)</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>double-click <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">after</span> the last/only paragraph marker (<strong>on the same line</strong>) - EXHIBIT 1 below
<ol>
<li>if you do it just to the right of the marker, you should see a tab inserted</li><li>if you do it further to the right, still on the same horizontal line, you should see a different/longer tab inserted</li><li>BUT... press ESC on your keyboard and it goes away</li></ol>
</li><li>double-click <strong>BELOW</strong> the paragraph marker, maybe 4-5 lines down - EXHIBIT 2 below
<ol>
<li>you should see hard returns added where you double-clicked</li><li>if you do it even further DOWN, it just adds more lines</li></ol>
<ol>
<li>BUT... press ESC on your keyboard and it goes away</li></ol>
</li><li>*NOW*... do either/both of the items above
<ol>
<li>But type some text this time...</li><li>pressing ESC does nothing; the text is saved and now your document is a bit odd (line spacing reverts back, among other settings that don't follow)</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>Again, I suggested that the user just stop doing this. I couldn't get her to give me a solid answer as to how/why she even noticed this. Why would you click outside of your content like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, does anyone know (1) how to turn this off (if possible?) and why this would be there (cause I'm curious)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANKS!!!</p>
<p>

            <p>What you are describing is the Click and Type function in Word. You can turn it off at File | Options | Advanced. Go to the "Editing options" section and clear the check mark next to "Enable click and type." Click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have noticed, when you make use of click and type, blank paragraphs as well as excessive tab characters are added to the document.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A document never needs blank paragraphs, because having them present only means that you duplicate paragraph formatting for no good reason (instead use Spacing Before/After, Line Spacing, etc. to position text).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, it is best to turn off Click and Type.</p>

                    <p>Your blogs show this has been a problem since 2013. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>THERE ARE NO SOLUTIONS POSTED so please stop sending me to posts that do not show a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are trying to setup <a href="http://Outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook.com</a>&nbsp;to work with email from
<a href="http://Hostmonster.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hostmonster.com</a>. &nbsp;I have spent 2 weeks with Techs and Chats from both
<a href="http://Outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook.com</a>&nbsp;support AND Hostmonster support. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOT Possible to use these two together. &nbsp;Please fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://Outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook.com</a>&nbsp;Error Message is "There is a problem connecting to the SMTP server" no matter what we try. &nbsp;<a href="http://Outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook.com</a>&nbsp;tells me "level 3 techs are working on it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But maybe it is time to get another level on it because I see the same question coming up over and over and over with no posted solution dating back to 2013 and it effects other hosting companies besides Hostmonster.</p>

<h2>            Resizing PowerPoint printouts on OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I'm a student, and as so many others, my profs use mostly PowerPoint for lessons. I like using the PowerPoint print out function that inserts powerpoint slides directly into OneNote. The only problem is, they get inserted way too big. I can make each slide
 smaller and reformat it, but with 30+ long slides, I'd rather not spend my time doing that. Is there any solution where I am able to resize all the slides at once?</p>

            The functionality which you are seeking is one of the demanded features in Onenote and currently not possible. 
<br />
<br />One workaround is to adjust zoom size i.e. hold CTRL and use mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and zoom out.
<br />
<br />If you want the functionality the the only way out is to use Ontastic add-in which provides this functionality..(But this is not free and being a student, you might be on a tight budget)

<h2>            HTML View of Organizational Browser</h2>
                    <p>I am using Sharepoint 2013 Online. I added the Organization Browser Web Part and made sure that each profile had a manager listed. In IE with Silverlight, I see the entire organization from the CEO to their direct reports to the next level, etc. So far,
 so good, that's what I want!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I switch to the html view, all I get is myself and my direct reporting chain, but that's it. I do not see my bosses peers, nor do I see above my boss. I was hoping to use the Organization Broswer so that any employee could browse the organization,
 however, it only appears that it works in the Silverlight view not the html view. Can anyone shed some light on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can I get rid of this message '<span style="color: rgba(47, 74, 108, 1)">It is recommended to install Silverlight</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 74, 108, 1)">&nbsp;for
 a better Organization Browser experience.'</span>&nbsp;when in html view?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi B,<br />
<br />
If you mean in the Silverlight view, you can see all the levels for your colleagues, but in the HTML view, you only can see your manager as the top level (cannot see your manager's boss),&nbsp; I'd like to explain that this is an expected behavior. In the HTML view,
 the top level is the manager of that user. It's different from the Silverlight view. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
For the second issue that Silverlight always asks for installing, you may try the solutions in following articles:<br />
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webapps/2013/05/03/internet-explorer-continuously-prompts-for-installing-silverlight-when-it-is-already-installed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Internet Explorer continuously prompts for installing Silverlight
 when it is already installed</a><br />

            <div><strong>This solution article provides information on how to report abuse and SPAM in Outlook.com</strong><br />
<strong>To report spam or unsolicited emails:</strong><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></em><br />
<em>* Non-MIcrosoft customers should address an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Depending on the originating mail domain: hotmail, msn,live, or Outlook.com). Attach a copy of the
 spam email to this email and send it. If we do not receive a copy of the email as an attachment our ability to take action against the spamming account is severely impacted.</em><br />
<em>* We ask for a full copy of the email so that we have conclusive evidence showing from which Windows Live Hotmail account the SPAM was sent. It is possible that the email address was spoofed, and we don't want to mistakenly close a non-spamming
 account.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>To report abuse:</strong><br />
<br />
 harassment, impersonation, child exploitation, child pornography etc, received</span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>from a outlook.com account</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">should
 send their complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with all the relevant&nbsp;information (abuse@hotmail, or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</span></em><br />
<em>*<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>If you are being threatened please call your local law enforcement.</strong></em><br />
<em>*<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If you wish to report abuse against a non Microsoft account, please send the complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** , where xxxxxx.com is the text that appears after the "@" symbol in the sender's e-mail
 address. For example, if the unwanted email came from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then report the email message to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. You can also use the site http://abuse.net to identify the correct abuse reporting address.</span></em><br />
<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: rgba(235, 0, 115, 1)">* In addition to these ways of reporting Spam you can also click the "Report Spam," button in your email program.</span></em></strong></div>

<h2>            Exclusive Q&#38;A with the new Skype team &#40;08&#47;29, 9-11 am PST&#41; - Broadcast Link Added</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone<br />
</p>
<p>In November of last year, the call went out for eager Skype fans to join the Skype Insider program, the place to try out new features and help shape and enhance the Skype experience. The response over the last 10 months has been overwhelmingly positive.
 The Skype Insider program was officially created, and quickly solidified itself as the go-to place for usability feedback, bug fixes, as well as suggestion for new features.<br />
<br />
Throughout this past year, your participation has been crucial in testing our brand new releases before they make it to the public build. We have always valued your enthusiasm and early input on new Skype releases, but these past few months have cemented the
 role you play in the Skype ecosystem. Your feedback has been invaluable, and saying we could not have done it without you would not be an exaggeration.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As a small token of our appreciation, we would like to invite you to&nbsp;<strong>an exclusive Skype Broadcast on Tuesday, August 29th 2017, at 9-11am PST.</strong>&nbsp;The team behind the new Skype will share with you their journey so far, discuss their plans for Skype’s

<p>Be great if Microsoft people would read the forum, there are some very useful comments and suggestions on there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, and most importantly:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Skype is a video call platform, it had a unique set of features that justifiably lead to sector domination.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Skype is NOT a social network platform, never has been, if you force it into being a social network for children you will destroy this once very valuable &amp; useful platform</span></em></strong>, just like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(to refer to a comment already posted on the forum)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"You buy up successful companies, and then "improve the user experience" to the point where the end result is unusable and loathed by most users. Worse, you keep doing it,
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and not learning from mistakes.</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You bought Multimap in the UK and changed it to Bing Maps.... every update made it worse than it was.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You bought Nokia, and installed Windows on their phones, destroying their business in the process.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You changed Hotmail into Outlook, and the latest Windows version is so slow and unresponsive it is verging on unuseable.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You bought Skype, and keep tampering... it wasn't broken, so there was no need to fix it. The latest update on Android is by far the worst software I have ever used On my Samsung Galaxy S5, you have turned using the keyboard into
 a horrid experience. The characters typed lag behind significantly, and the vibrate that goes with a key down lags too. I didn't ask for messages from another to be coloured blue with white type...and all the other idiot ideas you have included.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is an old adage, "if it ain't broke don't fix it". Microsoft should stop tampering with things... a bad reputation is often made worse, and I'm getting fed up to the back teeth of it."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To which we should at least add the debacle of the Zune player &amp; Windows phone within Microsoft’s own portfolio.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I sincerely hope that Skype does not follow this really well established Microsoft tradition!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Perhaps this observation may clarify the fundamental problem?</span></p>
<p><span>A frequent error of judgement by Microsoft, such a fundamental principal of product design and presentation with the following illustration, usually in the first few lessons in training: &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>People buy convenient on demand fire, not matches,&nbsp;</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft has always focused on the product rather than the service offered by the product.&nbsp; Perhaps a useful illustration is in the comparison with Apple, Steve Jobs focused almost fanatically on the end user experience, to make
 the product as elegantly transparent to the goal achieved as possible, in the match context about the convenience and accessibility so the fire was achieved with minimum intuitive effort; the opposite of Microsoft’s approach to focus on the product so that
 the product becomes all consuming with little thought to how the product will actually be used.&nbsp; I dread to imagine the results of Microsoft going into match manufacturing looking at the direction with Skype &amp; their other products, thoughts include:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>online registration with proof of identity before match ignition is possible,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>completion and online confirmation of risk assessment to check for combustible vapour etc before ignition is possible,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>age verification in initial online registration for your box of matches costing a few pence / cents? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps this is a major factor in Apple’s valuation being approximately twice that of Microsoft despite the legacy of Windows running the largest (though falling) proportion of computers, although Microsoft have left the phone business
 having nearly destroyed Nokia compared to the iPhone dominating smartphone revenue generation</span></p>

<p>Please do not lose sight of the nature of Skype as a strongly established product, with a large user base resulting from the unique set of features it had leading to justifiable domination of the video call sector.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>“<span><em>This is NOT a game.&nbsp;</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>It is insufficient to simply and hollowly request patience while you hobble my critical service and business. Perhaps I can have more patience if you send me a phone that I can call on, and reimburse me
 for lost time and loss of income while you toy with this important application. Of course I am sure there is no hope of that.&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>Of course evolving and migrating services is a part of the business and I realise that. That said, when MS acquired Skype, they moved into the telephone business and that is NOT something that you just
 screw around with and for frivolous stuff like adding colours, graphics, etc whilst losing functionality.&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>Testing and trialing of these new features and designs should not be tested in the wild, but should be an option within a control group that has elected to test it, and can easy roll it back if they need
 to. This was NOT the case for this latest instalment of technicolour dung.&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>This counsel should not need to come from me. A company such as MS should have sufficient talent and experience to know and understand these things.&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span>If you are serious about making Skype a serious platform for paying customers (like me) to use as an alternative to traditional phone service models, then you need to treat it like a serious alternative.&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span>Sure if after the bulletproof and perfected mechanics of an intuitive, conventional phone interface are absolutely perfected, and you want to roll out some skins, colours, and bells and whistles as an OVERLAY,
 yes, that is fine. But to fundamentally change the nuts and bolts of a functioning app and CRITICAL application, just so you can pimp it and migrate it to the cloud, illustrates a fundamental lapse, or woeful misunderstanding of the business you entered into
 when Skype was acquired.&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><em>Kindly employ some people that understand the telecommunications business (like me for example), so that you might attract and retain customers, pilot new cosmetics ONLY WHEN THE MECHANICS HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY

<p>Skype was the premier app for these calls by a large margin until recently with the new versions of Skype across a number of platforms that are massive degradations of Skype's core function, and introduction of features that are irrelevant to this core functionality,
 described by many on the forum as social networking for children. &nbsp;Perhaps part of the issue would be the choice of Electron for the new versions? &nbsp;Have seen many comments that Electron framework promotes lazy programming significantly reducing app usefulness,
 amply demonstrated by the destruction of Skype functionality going from Linux Skype 4.3 to Linux Skype 5 series, and the massive reduction of Skype ratings on Android Play Store &amp; iOS App Store, accompanied by deluges of negative reviews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions.are: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When is Microsoft going to restore the missing long standing core functionality of Skype to the new versions, perhaps the biggest degradation being to the Linux app having ignored the repeated requests for similar functionality in the new versions to the
 long standing stable version whilst the Linux community gave their free labour debugging new versions of Skype saving Microsoft a significant cash sum?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you trial this new direction in a stand alone version of Skype such as Skype-lite before pushing this unwanted destruction of a once dominant and elegant app onto the main user base? &nbsp;I would note that amongst my contacts, I am the only one in
 my large social media contact base that is posting to Skype, most who are complaining of the serious degradation of Skype will not post as they feel a lack confidence in one of more of the following:</p>
<p>Technical competence,</p>
<p>linguistic competence (English is their 3rd, 4th or 5th language and is not strong enough to deal with this forum),</p>
<p>screen space, many of my contacts only have an about 5 inch screen as their sole internet connection, a forum like this is quite a challenge with such a small screen,</p>
<p>connectivity, the bulk of internet users outside the well connected parts of the world such as S Korea and Europe only access the internet with a cell phone network connection that by definition will only be a few meg compared to tens or hundreds of meg
 with fibre connections, although this forum does not have the very high bandwidth requirements of advertising funded forums, it still requires quite a bit for people on metered weak connections; even US internet connectivity is very patchy with many complaining
 about 1meg connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are you not acknowledging the massive dissent with the direction that Microsoft is taking Skype, well illustrated by the iOS App Store and Android Play Store ratings widely reported on the forum, or are you really intent on destroying Skype as the leading
 video call / internet telephony app with the aim of appealing to a small segment of the population, the early teenage group?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do Skype developers read this forum and consider the comments?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many unanswered questions on the forum, are Microsoft staff going to go through the forum to reassure unhappy users that their concerns are going to be addressed very fast, or tell them to go away as Microsoft want to delete Skype's core functions
 and move it into another area such as social networking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Microsoft be responding quickly to these issues? &nbsp;It is very painful for many to have to put relationships effectively on hold whilst Microsoft gradually meanders towards resolving these issues, are are you trying to push the Skype user base to move
 onto other apps even though at the moment there would appear to be no other apps offer the unique functionality that Microsoft is removing from Skype? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you consider for desktop Skype adding the option of two interfaces:</p>
<p>Classic: the simple and very space efficient design expressed in Skype for Linux 4.3 and Mac Skype 2.8 with separate window for chat conversations (great for communicating with those outside the call that are not relevant to the call) and ideal for smaller
 screens and those more focussed on the service that Skype offers of video telephony as a collaborative tool;</p>
<p>Modern: the space wasting design with large icons and lots of empty white space for that part of the Skype user base that use Skype on it's own without reference to other apps and on larger screens (the reason why I moved to Linux for laptop to retain the
 space efficient classic layout).</p>
<p>Preferably with the same long standing user controls and features, or even synchronising these controls / features so that they are equally available across all desktop Skype versions? &nbsp;Monetising the app could simply be done with small banners not significantly
 increasing valuable screen space needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you going to restore the sort threads by thread views option that have been deleted in this forum redesign? &nbsp;The deletion has reduced the visibility of the most popular threads that are usually negative about the new direction for Skype, similar to hiding
 previous floods of dissent such as moving on from Mac version 2.8, the Linux repeated requests for similar functionality in the new version, or the flood of dissent over the new direction Microsoft are taking Skype with the removal of sort threads by popularity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also note that not recording such an important interaction for the future of Skype is perhaps symptomatic of the error of Microsoft's ways here? &nbsp;Communication is a supportive function for many many other aspects of life in work, play and maintaining
 family relationships etc., with that communication often revolving around the content of other applications, for my contact base Skype is never the only app running; however, Microsoft appear to have a product first and resulting function second attitude leading
 to this awful debacle and degradation of Skype, the matches or convenient on demand fire issue</p>

<p>Until the new versions are functionally equivalent to the outgoing versions, will you host the previous stable versions for:
</p>
<p>Linux (4.3), </p>
<p>Android (7.43) </p>
<p>&amp; iOS (pre 8) </p>
<p>etc. </p>
<p>so that those dissatisfied with the direction of these new versions (as so many clearly are as not seen positive Skype review in my brief explore of Android Play Store for example), can safely revert to an earlier version&nbsp;prior to this debacle, without the
 risks of malware compromising their devices?</p>

<p>Listened to all of it now. &nbsp;Very disheartened, Skype is no longer Skype, the core function of effective video call app is being dropped so that it can become a social network for children.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess Jedihomr is right, they are enjoying playing with Skype, guess that is why they are taking Skype off in this direction? &nbsp;Still pretty sure that Microsoft is still product focused and not 'how product is used' focused, i.e., the focussing on the match
 &amp; not the convenient on demand fire. &nbsp;This is not how any of my contacts use Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The feedback they are listening to would appear to be completely different to the feedback on this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Critical app here used many times a day, that is becoming useless for maintaining close relationships, having tried the new versions and found that the new features are of no interest, and the features actually use have been deleted, can only communicate
 as updating has been put on hold for most devices, those updated are now unavailable for communication. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The features I use are 'on backlog', so how many tens of millions of people are you asking to:
</p>
<p>put their relationships on hold whilst you meander through the backlog,&nbsp;</p>
<p>how long would you be happy to not see your child for whilst you meander through the backlog (really understand that one having been through the issue described by fathers4justice which is about as painful as you can get in civil society),</p>
<p>how long do you want people to not video call their physically distant husband / wife / fiancee / partner / etc. whilst you meander through your backlog,</p>
<p>etc. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Philippines for example, more than 10% of the population have moved abroad mainly for work, which therefore affects nearly every family in that country with other countries in a similar situation; many of these are only able to maintain their family
 relationships through Skype, that is a video call application, not the toys that the Skype developers seem to think that we want, a video call application that runs as simply as possible so that multitasking with other applications is possible, or runs well
 with a mobile phone on a weak signal inI areas where there is effectively no landline calling infrastructure. &nbsp;Bundling these other apps into Skype will increase the bandwidth requirements beyond the available bandwidth for most of my active contacts, the
 new Linux version is unable to sustain a call that stable Linux is able to maintain for long periods, although having been disgusted by the direction the new Skype started heading, I fear that it may be insurmountable to persuade them to update now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just checked App Store rating, current rating 1.5, overall down to 3 now. &nbsp;Play Store seems to be mainly first timers rating it, with a sprinkling of experienced users giving it 1 star out of 5. &nbsp;So looks like the App Store is not on the developers list
 of feedback sources.</p>

<p>Hi Zaihed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10666/windows-phone-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hard reset</a></strong> will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned
 on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings, etc will be removed from the phone. If backup is turned on under Settings, you can restore your apps and settings after performing a hard reset (as long as you initialize the phone with the same Microsoft Account).
<br />
<br />
You can reset your phone under <strong>Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone</strong><br />
<br />
Note that resetting your device will not remove any OS or firmware updates. You will
<strong>remain on the same version</strong> of Windows Phone after the reset.<br />
<br />
Please create a backup before performing the hard reset as the phone memory will be wiped out. For creating a backup, here's how:

    <title>Publisher 2016 NOT RESPONDING and LAGGING - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pinky 4 wheel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 2016 NOT RESPONDING and LAGGING</h2>
                    <p>Hi.. &nbsp;I have a brand new computer.. No previous software or programs installed. &nbsp;It came running Windows 10. &nbsp;I signed up with Office 365 and downloaded publisher 2016 which i pay monthly for. &nbsp;I am running with 8GB. &nbsp;I imported my current project into publisher
 to continue working on it on this new computer. &nbsp;Every time I click it flashes "not responding" at the top and I have to wait about 10+ seconds... When I try to move boxes around there is serious lag and the boxes do not move with me... I have to wait. &nbsp;I
 spent 2 hours inserting 8 pictures and trying to format them. I thought my file was too big so I tried opening a brand new document and starting from scratch with only one page and had the exact problem. &nbsp;I uninstalled and re-installed to see if there was
 a glitch, but no difference. &nbsp;It was doing the exact same thing on my old computer as well, and thought it would change with my new faster computer, but no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a fix? Or a different software program that is easy to use and will get me my finished project? &nbsp;I am under a serious fast deadline. It is a book that will have about 40 pages and lots of pictures and text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help (using language for a non techy). Thank you. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Safe mode and Office repair are the valid standard trouble shooting processes.&nbsp; I suspect that they won't help with this problem, but it does not hurt to try them, just use a little time and they MAY find a cause for your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, your problem sounds familiar.&nbsp; When Office 2013 was released, and to a lesser extent many people reported similar issues with Word and Excel. To a lesser extent with Powerpoint and Visio. I don't recall seeing anything about Publisher, but I could
 have simply missed the few that were posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The similar problems caused in the other applications had a couple of common causes.&nbsp; I'll give you tips for the other applications, you will simply have to ignore the application and try to adapt the suggestions to use them in Publisher. Most should be
 adaptable ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Oops, I found one specific for Publisher 2013 &lt;grin&gt; ... )</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong><span>Publisher 2013 Slow</span></strong>
<p><span>I ran across another possible fix:</span></p>
<p><span>In Publisher go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced and check ‘disable hardware graphics acceleration’.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<strong><span>Excel 365/2016 Slow</span></strong>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/39f06e90-c2c8-43e4-9f10-2a7c65894271">Excel Office 365 2016 So Slow that I cannot use it</a></span></p>
<p><span>Bob,<br />
Certainly appreciate you looking into this. I had already disabled graphics acceleration. Besides, the comparison was performed on an out-of-the-box Surface Pro 3, with i5 processor and Win10. So the comparative test is done on only one computer, works very
 good with the old version of Excel on this Surface Pro. Hard to believe its graphic drivers are wrong, too, since both the computer and the software are Microsoft products.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I can't install Office97 on Win10, I guess it has 16 bit installers or something, so I run it on XP on a virtual drive (Oracle VM VirtualBox) on the Surface Pro. It works great. Also, Excel 2010 seems to have no problem running my "test" program
 at a reasonable speed (a Monte Carlo simulation, see earlier post).</span></p>
<p><span>I have installed 32 bit Office 365, but it is a 64 bit computer, of course.</span></p>
<p><span>There's also a wait state item&nbsp;(wowspl or something like that) that has to be cleared first through Task Manager whenever Excel2016 is run.</span></p>
<p><span>Too bad there isn't a switch to run it in Excel97 mode (keeping all the mathematical error corrections that came with the more recent versions, of course). I don't use much of those bells and whistles on the
 new version, so wouldn't miss them, if it made it run faster. <br />

 no CSISYNCSLIENT.EXE process in the background... Somehow, this started when I used OneNote via Outlook 2013 for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span>What this process does is build a very large cache of indexed Office files on your local drive. &nbsp;For me, the cache was ~5GB, or about equal to the combined size of my Office files. &nbsp;That would be fine provided I had extra space available
 on my SSD, but I don’t. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I discovered that simply turning off this option does not automatically delete the cache and free the space. &nbsp;To recover the disc space I closed the Onedrive&nbsp;application&nbsp;and then deleted everything in C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\OfficeFileCache.
 &nbsp; Keeping the “Use Office” option turned off has resulted in a much smaller cache.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MS needs to document the cause/effect of this option so people understand the impact it has on their system.</span></p>

<strong><span>Slow Word 2013</span></strong>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Sluggish response in my office 2013 Word document editing was due to using the navigation pane only. I use navigation pane often since I typically work on large documents. Once I turned off the navigation pane, response is as expected.
 No other settings or features caused this poor response in Word 2013 because I tried them all! This “fix” proved to work on all my installs and a colleague’s office 2013 install.
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I have found that switching between all page viewing modes: read mode, outline, etc. and going back to print layout fixed the lag problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I experienced a similar issue with slow typing speed in Office 365 Word. I edit a substantial number of Word and Excel documents for work and found the Onedrive storage incredibly beneficial for working remotely.</span></p>
<p><span>I realized though that documents which are being edited from Onedrive, not a local copy, experience the slow typing speed issue.</span></p>
<p><span>The fix: &nbsp; From word: &nbsp;File, Options. Word Options has an advanced tab on the left labeled ‘advanced’. About 3/4 of the way down, a category for ‘Save’ options exists. The default setting has ‘Allow Background Saves’ checked. I uncheck
 this option and instead check ‘Always create backup copy’ and ‘Copy remotely stored files onto your computer, and update the remote file when saving’.</span></p>
<p><span>I assume that if you’re storing the files on Onedrive, or Dropbox, or web, or maybe even some external drive or flash memory this background save could be lagging and result in typing slowness. Either way, I changed the advanced options,
 and no more problem. Maybe it’ll work for you.</span></p>
<p><span>Excel didn’t have the option, and I usually save a local copy anyways due to the working file size.</span></p>
<p><span>*I run windows 7 with office 365 and windows surface pro with win 8 and office 365. 4gb memory each.</span></p>

<p><span>Answer</span></p>
<p><span>I have had the same problem on many computers and tried every solution I found on the web and nothing worked(registry changes, office settings(save display and more)).&nbsp; As a test&nbsp;I copied the files from my Onedrive folder to the desktop
 and everything worked well - typing was as fast as office 2010 - the slow typing&nbsp;was a one drive problem. &nbsp;Wanting both the benefits of Onedrive and the ability to type without lag I did the following:</span></p>
<p><span>1.Created a folder outside of Onedrive call Onedrive-Local.
</span></p>
<p><span>2 Downloaded MS SyncToy to sync Onedrive-Local to the Onedrive folder which uploads to the cloud.</span></p>
<p><span>Now I only work out of the Onedrive-Local folder and things are fast.&nbsp; The files get synced and I have access to them on the cloud.
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I had DisplayFusion installed on my machine. Quitting DisplayFusion immediately resolved my issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After quite a bit of experimentation, I found that many of the solutions proposed helped (marginal improvements) with the speed of the text entry in Word (I am using Word 2013 - delivered with Office 365 subscription).
</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, I thought the issue may be with performance or hardware compatibility related to Windows 10 (I am using a &nbsp;a preview version of Windows via Bootcamp dual-boot setup on a new Macbook Pro with Office 365 installed).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the end, I found that the main problem was change tracking!...I was editing an excerpt of a larger document which had “Track changes” activated. I can only imagine that the tracking of deletions was causing some sort of efficiency issue
 in the processing. </span></p>
<p><span>I have about 80% free RAM and a Quad core i7 system (16Gb of memory of which 80% is free, 100MB reserved for Word, so not a memory usage issue - must just be inefficient code)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I confirmed the Track Changes setting was main issue by activating all the animation etc (the other fixes proposed). Those factors did not cause the original issue to re-occur.</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly, when my word locks up with this issue, the performance of the remaining applications is relatively unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong><span>Hide Track Changes</span></strong>
<p><span>I found that if I set the tracking drop down to "No Markup", the lag goes away.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This way you can continue to track changes, just not see them in real time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<span>Windows Performance Options – Turn Off Animation</span>
<p><span>Some users have found that turning off Animation in Windows helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the Windows Search to find “Performance Options”. In the Visual Effects tab you have 4 options:
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Let Win choose what’s best for my computer</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Adjust for best appearance</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Adjust for best Performance</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Custom:</span></p>
<p><span>The simplest fix is select “Best Performance”. That turns off all of the “fancy” frills that MS think make Windows “look pretty”. Otherwise you can select “Custom”. In there, as a minimum, turn off the “animation” options. You may also
 want to turn off other effects to speed up the perceived performance of your computer.

<strong><span>Slow Excel 2013 - Rubber band effect, delayed Response time when typing – Disable Excel Animation feature</span></strong>
<p><span>In Office 2013 MS added a funky new UI feature called “Animation”. It is supposed to “smooth out”, or some such nonsense, cursor movement in the applications. I first noticed it in Excel 2013. I found it so annoying that that “feature”
 alone was enough to completely turn me off from using the whole Office 2013 bundle. Fortunately, or not (?), I found these fixes.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I have exactly the same problem, Excel2013.</span></p>
<p><span>Just opened a new spread sheet, typed the nr 1 in cell A1 to A22, took me about 10 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>Took excel 55 seconds to display, looks like slow motion.&nbsp; &lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The article in the first link has a link to another article with a downloadable file that will make the change without you having to edit the registry manually</span></p>
<p><span>There’s an easier fix for the “rubber band” animations in Excel - just turn them off

<p><span>Alternate, related solution</span></p>
<p><span>I’m using Windows 8, and found a different solution there:

<p><span>To disable Windows animations (this is secondary IMHO, but may be required):</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>On the metro start screen type Edit,
</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>&lt;tab&gt;, &lt;down Arrow&gt; to then move the search results down 1 to “Settings”</span></p>

 may vary </span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>double click on it</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>provide the admin password to display the “System Properties” dialog</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>In the “Advanced” tab, Performance section, click on the “Settings...” button to display the “Performance
 Options” dialog</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>Personally, I prefer to select the “Adjust for Best Performance” option to get rid of the frilly
 “bells &amp; whistles” that do not contribute to efficiency of my system.</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>At a minimum, confirm that the “Animate controls and elements inside Windows” option is disabled/unchecked.
</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>Click on Apply</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>OK out</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>boot the computer</span></p>
<p><span>Under options &gt; advanced &gt; turn off<span>&nbsp; </span>
“allow editing directly in cells”</span></p>
<p><span>Here is another idea worth looking at :&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I have had this problem also when authoring user guides.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Eventually I found that if I switched off the “Maintain compatibility” check box in the Save As dialog the problem disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span>Word may be scanning each element to make sure it maintains compatibility.</span></p>

<p><span>Hello Jacques,</span></p>
<p><span>I just saw this, and I can explain it. In 2013 we went to a more secure algorithm across Office - not just in Excel. Excel 2013 uses SHA-512. It makes only milliseconds of difference with one call, but in those cases where code runs, protecting
 and unprotecting many sheets, it all adds up to a terrible performance issue. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Because it is considered a security risk to modify that, all request for a change have been turned down. The development team will never do anything to make Office less secure. See

<span>&lt;snip&gt;</span>As well as what Steve said. On one PC a new Windows 10 update insisted on installing a "<span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Standard VGA Graphics Adapter" driver which caused lots of problems.

<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>And just to add a few bits to the whole video driver issue, some of the hardware drivers come from the hardware manufacturers, and by the time they make it through incorporation into a shipping version of Windows, may be out of date and
 not include the latest fixes. &nbsp;So in addition to disabling hardware accel as a test, it's worth looking to see if newer drivers are available from the manufacturer of your video card.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>And, odd though it may seem, PPT wants a reasonable printer driver installed and set as the default printer driver. &nbsp;You'll want to be sure you've done that, even if it's just the XPS driver that ships with most recent Windows versions.</span></p>

<p><span>Visio 2013 x86 was super slow on a Dell Vostro machine running Windows 7 Professional x64. After a series of troubleshooting, I traced the problem to the accelerated graphics. Just disable the it. Here’s how:
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">

<p><span>This issue is most noticeably on machine with dual video chip set.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>******</span></p>
<p><span>I have found slowness with Visio 2013, and found that turning off Snap to Shape intersections fixed the issue. ( View \ Visual Aids \ Snap &amp; Glue \

<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>UPDATE: I have gained a slight performance boost by disabling the “Animate Controls and Elements inside Windows” option in System Properties &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Performance Settings. &nbsp;Still not quite on par with Visio 2010, but
 we’re getting there.</span></p>

<p><span>Anyway, this might not apply to everyone, but I saw a few other comments from people who also have Optimus-enabled laptops.</span></p>
<p><span>Basically, I’m forcing Visio to be rendered by my Quadro, instead of allowing it to be rendered by the Intel.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the Nvidia Control Panel and open check the “Manage 3D Settings”</span></p>

<p>hi joosterit,</p>
<p>do you want to use custom content type as well as all the office online types? actually, when you create a standard document library in sharepoint, you can set the document type to be word, excel etc. however, it's not using different content types there,
 instead it just set a template used in that library by the document content type. if you choose to use the custom content type, then the default content type will be disabled.</p>
<p>if you want to give the users the option of creating new word, excel etc content types from the new menu, i suggest you create new content types for each document type such as powerpoint - powerpoint template. below is an example:</p>
<p>1. create a site content type powerpoint inheriting from the document content type.</p>
<p>2. in advanced settings of the powerpoint content type, uploading a blank powerpoint file as the template.</p>
<p>3. go to the library settings &gt; add from existing site content types &gt; add the powerpoint content type.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=02dda4f5-bdf2-4025-b982-d11c882bcde0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d02dda4f5-bdf2-4025-b982-d11c882bcde0" /></a></p>
<p>4. then you will see it by clicking the “new” button.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7f6c5147-e758-4782-b90a-9712b959a938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7f6c5147-e758-4782-b90a-9712b959a938" /></a></p>

            Hello
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />In case it is a personal account of Outlook.com that you use in your devices I recommend the following although you may have done it.
<br />
<br />Surely you have already made the name change from the Outlook profile and the profile of your account, in any way I compare the links, so you enter the name you want in both.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://profile.live.com/cid-90564c8607fa5a2f/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://profile.live.com/cid-90564c8607fa5a2f/</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/profile/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/profile/#/</a>
<br />
<br />Now and very important after performing the previous step, it is necessary to remove the devices associated with the email account, so that they request information update again. Enter the following link <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/devices</a>
<br />
<br />Note: It is necessary to wait a maximum of 24 hours before the server updates the information and the changes appear. It is also important to have that that the old mails continue with the previous name.
<br />
<br />Tell me how you are doing and if you have additional doubts!
<br />
<br />Greetings Dayamis.

            My Outlook account is working fine.&nbsp; The problem occurs when I use the Outlook Android app to send an email from either my Yahoo or my Comcast email.&nbsp; The recipient only sees my email address, but not my name.

<h2>            Incoming Email in outlook 2016 taking long to appear.</h2>
                    <p>My incoming mail appears in my Time Warner inbox shortly after it was sent to me. However, it takes a long time after that to show up in Outlook.
</p>
<p>Also, after I open Outlook it takes a long time for all the new emails that arrived since my last session on Outlook to appear.
</p>
<p>This has only been happening recently, maybe 1-2 weeks now. I can't think of any changes to my system or software in that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thx,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bC</p>

<p>A box called "Outlook Send/Receive Progress" appears for only a second. I see a green progress bar go about half way across the box and then the box&nbsp;disappears. Inside this box there's a box labeled "tasks" and "errors".&nbsp; In this box I see two lines; the
 first has my email address under "Name" and "completed" under "Progress". The second line has "synchronizing subscribed folders for........" under "Name" and "processing" under "Progress".&nbsp; Again, I can only see the box for 1 second before it disappears, so
 I can't look closer or make any selections.</p>

            No every thing seems working OK now. I didn't do anything to solve this. Does it sound like there's a problem in the synchronizing subscribed folders?

    <title>moving pst files from one user to another - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>             moving pst files from one user to another</h2>
                    I have recently activated an admin user&nbsp;account and transferred daily email traffic to a standard account from the admin account. The last 2 years contacts and outlook folders are still in the admin account and I would like to transfer them to the standard
 account and de-activate Outlook from the admin account. I have attempted to copy/move the (admin) pst file into the new standard user account without success.<br />
Can someone <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">please</span> help with some simple instructions to help move the appropriate files to the new account and "disable" outlook in the admin account.<br />
I am a first time user of any forum so please go easy on me!

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You can login to your Standard account and try the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Browse to C:\Users\&lt;user name of admin account&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>2.</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Right click on PST file-&gt; copy.</span></p>
<p><span>3.</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Browse to C:\Users\&lt; user name of standard account&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>4.</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Right click-&gt; paste.</span></p>
<p><span>5.</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Open Outlook-&gt; File-&gt; Open -&gt; Outlook data file and select outlook.pst &nbsp;from the location C:\Users\&lt; user name of standard account&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook-&gt;ok.</span></p>
<p><span>6.</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>If you want to set this pst file as default click on Tools-&gt; Account settings -&gt;Data files-&gt; click on the pst file -&gt;click set as default at the top-&gt; click ok, close and open
 outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>7.</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Copy your account setting from Admin account and enter the same account settings in Standard account.</span></p>
<p><span>8.</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Once the &nbsp;email account is set up in the Standard&nbsp; account, login to Admin account -&gt; open Outlook-&gt; Tools-&gt; Account settings -&gt; Click on account -&gt; remove account, that will
 remove your email account in old Admin account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note:</span>

</em></p>
<p><em><span>1.</span>
</em><em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></em><em><span>Select Organize&gt; Folder and Search options</span>

            What did you try before? You need to log into the Admin account and find and move the pst files to the shared folders so the other account can see it.&nbsp; The default location is C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook.&nbsp;
 Once you move the pst, you can open it in the other profile using File, Open, Outlook Data file.
<br />
<br />
You can delete the profile from Control panel, Mail but its not necessary.
