<h2>            Mentions &#40;Sharepoint&#41; not working properly</h2>
                    
<p>Dear MS Team and Everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all I am sorry if I am raising a questions that might have been posted before, but I could not find proper answers to my certain user case scenarios. This concerns primarily the Sharepoint sites and how to ease access to different parts of a sharepoint,
 to end users, as well as what is the best practice to manage users and their machines without investment to on-premise solutions. At, last I am part of a small non-profit and as a young IT student assistant there are a lot gaps in my knowledge, so please bear
 with me.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Q1: The mentions on primary news-feed (sharepoint) doesnt work</em></strong></p>
<p>I love the idea of having likes, mentions and hashtags on news-feed for sharepoint sites as it makes life simply easier to navigate trough all the post within the site. But, also it does really help to get inspired and updated on the things that arent just
 part of your routine but also interest.. I have tried the News-feed and was able to create hashtags and sort information based on it, but I could not get the @Mentions feature working. I have tried several times, different O365 Accounts and Local Profiles.
 Each time I have started mention by @ in news-feed, the dialog window appeared shortly without possibility for me to choose people I want to mention. I have got it working, eventually, on a machine that was signed into Azure AD. So my questions is, is it a
 necessity for this feature to work to be on signed using Azure AD Tenant or there is another problem, with our set-up? I have used different accounts and browsers that include: IE, Edge, Chrome &nbsp;and Firefox. Only way to get it work Join Azure AD and use IE,
 but still quite buggy..</p>
<p><em><strong>Q2: How to link Sharepoint collection with Primary sharepoint collection</strong></em></p>
<p>My question is best explained by an example. Lets say I am writing new document in Word and I wish to save it into sharepoint I go to Save As &gt; Company Sharepoint and new dialbox window appears. In this windows I can see a main site collecition ORGNIZATION
 MAIN SITE COLL,, unfortunately I &nbsp;cant see other site collections in my organization and I have forgotten the address to a site collection. Therefore, I cant safe document into a Site collections required . like ORGANIZATION FINANCE or &nbsp;ORG. IT etc. Is there
 a way how to edit WEBPART (I hope that is the right term fo save as Dialog box of sharepoint Master site collection) in SharePointDesigner 2013, &nbsp;so it shows links to other site collection and there no need to use different workarounds like mapped drives etc.?</p>

<p><strong>Q3: Is there a way how reset sharepoint site settings? Combinaton of languages re-occur within O365 apps.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Our main sharepoint site mentioned above has been initially set-up in danish language, after changing primary lang. for all offfice365 apps there are still some components that dont show in english and also applications like SWAY tend to not to be shown
 in corporate language, which is English.So is there a way how to start from scratch and go trough scratch? Or force language for Sharepoint sites and O365 apps?.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q4/Q5 Is it possible to move the AD services to azure VM? What does Intune does and is there a pricing plan for non-profits?</strong></p>
<p>Last question, &nbsp;we would like to make sure that all the machines on premises are having same policies and that the accounts and user files are accessible by using O365 tenat in Azure. At the same time we dont want to invest into a new server solution based
 at the office, would it be possible to create Azure VM that leverage need for aniother equipment? We are definetly going to deploy the Azure VM for our NAV Dynamics, so we want to use the VM to the full. If that is not possible or it is quite inneficient security
 risks and what if server goes down are there any other tools to achieve similair effect? Is it Intune? can we acually let people Sign On and get the same experience no matter what corporate workstation they are using? Can we achieve that with InTune? From
 what I have read it is possible to achieve this and actually also control machine remotely (push updates, install apps etc) but what are the biggest advantages or what is deal breaker when taking in consideration of deploying hybrid or off-premise solution?
 Also we are non-profit organization are there any discounts on Intune for non-profits? What is more cost effective for us, having an Intune+ Azure VM with NAV Dynamics and SQL or Azure VM + hybrid /or Azure VM only/On premise only, if possible?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much for any kind of help you are able to provide, on these topics. If you require more information, please, do not hesitate to contact me. Also, I am kindly sorry if I am &nbsp;repeating some of the already answered questions. At last we are so
 far enthusiastic about O365 features and upcoming changes to the service. Hope you have a nice afternoon, With best</p>
<p>Rudolf P.</p>

<p>hi rudolf,</p>
<p>glad to hear that it’s helpful to you. if you have any other questions, feel free to let us know and we’re always here for you.</p>
<p>meanwhile, about your question to manually create the recent folder to see all the site collections, we can’t make it now. as the recent folder is generated automatically when you have opened a document from a site collection, if you’d like users to see
 all the site collections, may be you can let them open the document from the common used site collection first and then go to the
<strong>recent folders</strong> and pin them, then these users will not lost the direction to find the specific site collection again and again. you can also share a document list containing all the site collections with these users and let them copy these
 links to the save as dialog box directly to find the site collection if they forget the link of a site collection.

<p>hi rudolf,</p>
<p>in regard to your questions:<br />
<em><strong>q1: the mentions on primary news-feed (sharepoint) doesnt work</strong></em><br />
<strong>a:&nbsp;</strong> it’s&nbsp; not required to sign into azure ad to get the @mention feature work.<br />
for the @mentions feature in the newsfeed, if we currently not follow any people, we need to type the @ character and then start typing the name of the person we want to @mention, then the user name will be listed as the following screenshot shows:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d3608da2-9086-4fde-bfd0-d01e6f3a2d28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd3608da2-9086-4fde-bfd0-d01e6f3a2d28" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
if we have followed some people, when we type the @ character, there will come a list of the followed people:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b4fee1c8-aaf0-4381-9b1e-ab5696a28f41" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db4fee1c8-aaf0-4381-9b1e-ab5696a28f41" /></a></p>
<p>for more details, you can see this article:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-features-to-a-newsfeed-post-155f0b0b-5438-4a91-80fa-d56ffb22b4cd#__toc319070553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">add features to a newsfeed post</a></p>
<p><em><strong>q2: how to link sharepoint collection with primary sharepoint collection</strong></em><br />
<strong>a:</strong> it’s not feasible to edit webpart for save as dialog box of sharepoint master site collection via sharepoint designer 2013. as when we use save as feature, we’ll see the recent folders or current folders of sharepoint site collection via
 clicking sites-company name, if we have opened some documents from that site collection, it will generate the recent folder automatically in the save as dialog box for our selections. also we can input or copy the url of the site collection to the dialog box
 directly to save the documents. <br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1cad7347-4643-493b-a1f3-0abbba375000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d1cad7347-4643-493b-a1f3-0abbba375000" /></a><br />
<br />
<em><strong>q3: is there a way how reset sharepoint site settings? combinaton of languages re-occur within o365 apps.</strong></em><br />
<strong>a:</strong> the initial language will be set up due to your region, even if you have changed the default language, the changes will not be rolled out to all the office 365 apps or pages. if you’d like to see the new language in office 365 apps, you
 can go to <strong>office 365 portal page &gt; office 365 settings &gt; language</strong>, change the original language to the new one.<br />
for sway page, as a temporary workaround, you can change the language via the <strong>
change language</strong> option on the browser as below:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d52fb21f-2f82-4b88-9b2f-44458fedb7a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd52fb21f-2f82-4b88-9b2f-44458fedb7a9" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>q4/q5 is it possible to move the ad services to azure vm? what does intune does and is there a pricing plan for non-profits?</strong></em><br />

<h2>            Rules Wizard - how to get OR instead of AND&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've just switched to Outlook 2007 as Windows Live Mail is a pig wearing a pig costume at a pig party. I have previosly used Outlook 2003, and I'm pretty sure that you could specify that rules were ORed with each other rather than ANDed by clicking the word
 "and".</p>
<p>For example,&nbsp;I want a rule like this:</p>
<p>if ((sender = fred) OR (subject = "pigs in space"))<br />
&nbsp; {do something}</p>
<p>The wizard creates rules with a hardwired AND, like this:</p>
<p>if ((sender = fred) AND (subject = "pigs in space"))<br />
&nbsp; {do something}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outlook Rules have never supported OR - Outlook Express (the predecessor to Live Mail) did.</p>
<p>You'll need to use two rules -&nbsp;one for&nbsp;sender is Fred, a second for subject is pigs in space.</p>
<p>Filters dialog supports OR when you use the QueryBuilder or SQL - but this is only used with Search folders, Views, Advanced Find, and Automatic formatting.</p>

            You don't give a lot to go on - is this only one number? or many? &nbsp;What type of filter?
<div><br />
<div>If you have a list of numbers, you can do an Advanced Filter. Assume that the values are in A2:A100 and you only want to see even numbers. In a non-adjacent column (say, F) enter this in row 2 (leaving row 1 blank)</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; =EVEN(A2)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Select a cell in your data range in column A, choose Data/Filter/Advanced Filter, and enter A2:A100 in the List Range box, and F1:F2 (BOTH cells) in the Criteria Range. Click OK.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want to do an AutoFilter, then you can use a helper column. With the same scenario as above except wanting to see odd numbers, in B2 enter&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;=ISODD(A2)</div>
<div><br />
<div>and copy down to B100. Then with a cell in the range selected, choose Filter/Autofilter, click the dropdown for column B, and choose TRUE as the criterion.</div>

<h2>            OneNote not working</h2>
                    In the newest version of Windows 10, 9879 as of now, the windows store version of OneNote becomes completely unusable. The icon is a blank sheet of paper and when I open it up it hangs at the screen that says OneNote then minimizes. In the taskbar it also
 has no icon. I've tried reinstalling it and restarting my computer dozens of times. Thanks for any help in advance.

            Some applications from Windows Store do not work &amp; cannot be updated. Those are application specific compatibility issues as I &amp; others have tried numerous methods &amp; workarounds, but with no success. So only thing to do is to report it &amp; wait for an update.
 Remember, the applications there are built to be compatible with Windows 8/8.1

</p><p>Maybe, should mention, again, Win10 Builds are betas &amp; a work in progress.<br />
<br />
So many things I read in the Forum are treating 10 like it is a primary daily-driver, a GA OS and it is not!<br />
<br />
Don't expect it to act like that.&nbsp; Don't expect perfection.&nbsp; Currently it is a long way from GA.<br />

            <p>Yup ... ClassLive Pro works on my laptop with build 9879 (most of everything I use works so well that I wiped over Windows 7 and got rid of all the Lenovo bloatware, plus reclaimed a 16 GB back-up partition that, for whatever reason, I was not allowed to
 back up on DVD with Lenovo software, go figure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my PC, different story. &nbsp;CLP worked awesome with Build 9860, and failed with 9879. &nbsp;Chances are, I have something conflicting with Java that prevents CLP from loading properly (I have several programs that rely on JRE on my PC, so between them and the
 build update, something hiccuped).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Goes with the territory. BUT, we suffer for the greater good.</p>

            <p>There must be something off with your Windows 10 local Admin account.&nbsp; I expect that you upgraded from Windows 7, since Windows 8.1 is more likely to have already been using a Microsoft Account login and would have just transposed that login to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the account you are using an Admin account and not just a user account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How difficult would it be to back up everything and do a clean install of Windows 10?&nbsp; You could also try creating a new user with your desired MSA login, rather than switching your current Windows login to a Microsoft account login, at least to see if that
 works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is something I wrote up on ways to test a clean install of Windows 10 without first erasing your existing install.&nbsp; This would prove whether a clean Windows 10 install will fix the issue (which I expect it will).</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have Windows 10 Pro, you could also install Windows 10&nbsp;in Hyper-V to test your MSA login on a clean install.&nbsp; Although it would not activate Windows, it would work for testing the MSA login.</p>

<h2>            Feedbacks of Asha Software Platform &#38;amp&#59; device based on it</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am new user of Asha 503(RM-922) &amp; Asha Software Platform(1.1.1). From the first day of my using I have face lots of problem on it. New Asha OS has lots of bug &amp; that should be taken care. That's why I am writing this thread. Comming to the points</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;Whenever I try to charge my device keep switch it off. Charging becomes never end. I usually charge overnight but in morning device shows still charging. It isn't happing every times but most of the times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;When I plug in charger when device is on there is a audio-visual alarm. That is good. But it completes charging while device is on there is no audio-visual alarm. So how can one know that charging is complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;Sometimes I have notice that after using for a while total amount of remaining charge increased autometically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;A full discharged batt. takes times approx. 170 mins to get fully charged. It is too long to wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;There is no profile for handsfree. But we need complete features for it like Autometic answer, Voice Call, Volume Control, Change track etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;Wifi disconnect autometically in regular basis. I have tried several Access Points(like my laptop, router of 2-3 makers) but end up with same results. But with android no problem at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;Sound quality of music player is really very good. But if there is equalizer then it would be awesome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;Whereas voice quality is not so good. I know it depends on many factors like network coverage, bitrate etc. I have tried with BSNL, Airtel &amp; Vodafone but didn't get good result. Albeit Nokia claiming device has noise cancellation &amp; HD voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;You know in India there is so noise pollution even in office also. If someone sending you a series of instructions over voice it is always very hard to to get it properly b'cause of surrounding loud noise &amp; if lists are long then it is hard to remember
 sequentially. So if there is a call recorder apps it would be very helpfull. I know there is obligation regarding call recording. But you know what there are always chance to misuse of technology but that's not mean that other don't have chance to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this moment I got all these points. If I encounter something else I will post here. I hereby requesting all members who using Asha OS device plz feel free to share your viwes here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plz do consider these points whenever you gonna realise new updates of Asha OS.</p>

<p>No idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TP-Link has the group-key update-period disabled (0) normally. I thought that might be the cause. Furthermore, I use your TL-WR740N&nbsp;here – and do not have any issue. I should see such an issue, because my Nokia Asha 501 is attached to my VoIP server running
 all day long. However, one question: How are these access-points connected? Not at all, via Wi-Fi or Ethernet? If via Ethernet, do they all have the same SSID (WLAN-Roaming)?</p>

<p>First of I don't have any wifi router till date. The routers I named here these are belongs to my friend &amp; far away relatives. I went there only to test my Asha503. So there is no question about that they are inter connected. Only wifi which I am using that
 is Virtual Wifi hotspot in my laptop nothing else. I don't have VoIP yet. Maybe it's my bad luck.</p>

<p>Misunderstanding. My Nokia Asha 501 is connected with my Wi-Fi all day long (because I am running VoIP). If I would face your issue, I would see that on my VoIP server. It is not the other way around: Because I am using VoIP, my connection is stable.</p>

            Assume that you mean Windows 8.1.&nbsp; However, it is not the bitness of the Operating System, but the bitness of Office - 32-bit or 64-bit, and there is a flavour of the proofing tools for each - i.e. 32-bit proofing tools and 64-bit proofing tools.&nbsp; You
 need to make sure that you download and install the correct version.

<h2>            Back and home buttons not functioning</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days ago, I noticed that the back button on my Lumia 920 failed to respond at times and I'd have to use the home button to escape out of whatever I was doing. Then yesterday, both the back and home buttons failed to work. The search button is still
 functioning but the phone isn't really usable as the only way to exit an app is to turn the phone off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a power cycle, a hard reset, and then I returned the phone to factory settings, which put it in a "gears" situation for about 6 hours until I finally got it to boot up again. That didn't fix the button issue.</p>
<p>Nokia says, since I had the screen locally replaced several months ago, &nbsp;the phone is no longer under warranty. They wil&nbsp;not repair it at their service center in Texas and my only recourse is to send it to Palco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke to Palco and they are unable to give me any information as to whether the phone is repairable. They just want me to spend money to send it to Alabama, give then $15 + shipping to diagnose it - they say it will take 5 - 10 days just to diagnose the
 problem. I can't be without a phone for 2 weeks if I don't even know if it can be repaired. I'm angry that the only authorized repair center in the U.S. is in Alabama and they have no techs you can speak to on the phone. It's really the worst customer service
 I've ever seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anybody else ever experienced this issue? Were you able to get your phone repaired? I am going to see the guy that replaced the screen for me, but when I spoke to him on the phone he thought it was odd that 1 of the buttons still worked and wasn't at
 all convinced that he could fix it. He's never seen this problem before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any guidance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HB</p>

            hi mate, sorry to hear of the problems you have been experiencing. unfortunately, as Nokia Care centres are run independently of Nokia as their own franchises, there is not much that can be done except persist with them on the issue. perhaps they can give
 you a loaner device.<br />
<br />
as this is a user to user forum only for Nokia products and services, there is unfortunately nothing more that we can do for you here.

<p>So, my friendly neighborhood phone repair guy took the phone apart today and swapped parts with a working phone that he had there for a screen repair, and the phone still didn't work. He put the parts from my phone into that phone and it sitll worked. So,
 it isn't any replacable parts that have failed. He thinks it might be the mother board. The phone is 51 weeks old. I don't know what it would cost to replace a mother board -</p>
<p>It's unbelievable that in the entire USA there is one authorized repair center. The person who answers the phone there doesn't know anything and I've tried to get an estimate off their website - I've tried 3 different browsers and the drop down menus on
 the estimate page just don't work. I'm afraid to trust them with my phone if they can't maintain a website.</p>
<p>Does anybody think this phone is worth repairing?</p>
<p>Should I get another Nokia? I can get a 520 to use for the next year for $100 but I'm concerned about investing money in another Nokia.</p>
<p>Advice?</p>

<p>If the technician thinks&nbsp;your Lumia 920 have the Back, Windows and Search buttons problem stemming from a defective motherboard, then&nbsp;the motherboard&nbsp;can only be replaced by Nokia Care, it can never be repaired by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But still it's best to get it checked at a Nokia Care center and bring your proof of purchase for a manufacturer defect claim&nbsp;as what adrainhughes said then they will tell you what they can do to save your phone since your phone had a screen swap that won't
 affect the warranty at all.</p>

            <p>I too have this problem, but with my ATIV Odyssey. The navigation buttons will not work. I've turned on and off and on again my phone, taken out the battery and such, done multiple resets, but it will not work. I'm just lucky it's worked for the two years
 and I'm due for an upgrade in ten days.</p>
<p>Best of luck to anyone else with this issue.</p>

            <p>I have also been having this problem with my Lumia 928. It first started over the summer, and I was just about to call it quits, then it resolved itself out of the blue. It worked fine for about a week, then started have "spurts" of not working. I blamed
 the Windows 10&nbsp;update at first, but I guess that's not the problem. My touch screen works fine, I just can't exit a program once I get into one without turning the phone off and rebooting (HUGELY frustrating). I went all summer with it being wonky. There were
 times I thought I noticed that having it outside in the heat aggravated it. But I'm not sure. It's getting worse lately (three months later).&nbsp;And it's recently been exiting programs on it's own (which sometimes&nbsp;temporarily resets the back and home buttons
 so they work-lol) and Cortana has been so possessed I turned it off. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My next desperate step is to back everything up and try the factory restore. Has anybody tried that?</p>

<p>hello im trying to figure out if i should buy the 365 student version, but there is something that confuse me.<br />
<br />
it says in the shop <br />
<br />
For 2 PCs, Macs, or tablets including iPad, Android, or Windows, plus 2 phones</p>
<p>So does this mean that i can install on two different laptops and then additional also on two phones ( android in my case).<br />
So 4 devices in total.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Managing activeX combobox listfill range</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I was wondering what is the easiest method to manage a comboboxes listfillrange.&nbsp; Basically I have a defined name range as the list fill range.&nbsp; I want the user to be able to not only select from that list but also add new items to the list and delete items
 from the list.&nbsp; After each add or delete the modified list with be resorted alphabetically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Dan-</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ability to add/delete items to the listrange from the combobox itself is not (to my knowledge) built-in functionality for end-users. Here are some recommendations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding items:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First and foremost, unless you have run into a problem with no other workaround, I recommend using the forms control combobox and stay away from all activeX controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You don't mention whether you are using the combobox on a worksheet or userform. I would suggest a userform, where you could use a separate textbox for adding new items, then add it after your named range, and use the worksheet functionality to sort the
 list (all triggered by a command button after a new item is entered)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If you aren't already, I suggest making your named range dynamic, so you don't have to change the range every time a new item is added</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the combobox directly on a worksheet, then the approach would be similar, but you might use a specific cell to enter new items (somewhere adjacent to the combobox location). Then use worksheet_change or a commandbutton to trigger code to
 add the new item to your list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting items:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an item is selected, you can return the ID (listID?) of the selected item, and use that to delete it from your source list. You will need to trigger this with a commandbutton or similar trigger</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH</p>

<p>How do I install actual version of "word/excel/power point" from Office 365, onto my own hard drive?? I don't always want to have to use the "On-Line" versions of these programs, so how do I install them so I can work in a more traditional way.....don't
 want everything to be on-line/in the cloud ONLY....how do I get it&nbsp;both ways??</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>Could you let us know which Office 365 subscription are you using? Office 365 Business Essentials, Office Business Premium or Office 365 E3 plan?</p>
<p>As Office suite is not included in all the Office 365 subscriptions, to make sure you can install the Office application on the local, you need to own a proper Office 365 subscription license first. Here I’d like to share with you the following article about
 which Office 365 subscription contains Office application:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office-applications-service-description.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office Applications Service Description</a></p>
<p>If you are using Office Business Premium or Office 365 E3 plan, to download and install Office application, you can go to
<strong>Office 365 settings &gt; Settings &gt; Software</strong>. Also you can click the link below and login with your Office 365 account to install it:<br />

            I'm guessing that the "foreign" languages are French and Spanish?&nbsp; I suspect that the factory installation assumed you were from a location with limited languages.<br />
<br />
I suspect the only way you will be able to get more languages is to uninstall, download the installation file and re-install.<br />
<br />
BEFORE you uninstall, make sure you have your Product Key (not Product ID).<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Because we cannot change region of App Store like in other OS, why you don't release Cortana for iOS worldwide?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will take a century to wait Cortana availability in all languages. The whole world speaks English.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>These are typical required questions used by surveys, save for the last one (Perhaps MS is fishing for people who like the Microsoft Band?
<del>I tried.</del>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email in the screenshot looks pretty official, but the URL is a tad odd as I would of expected a more official Microsoft property based short link (like how OneDrive has "1drv.ms"). But it is from a valid Market research company, and I've gotten legitimate
 emails before from tech companies that used third party survey/research companies, so it's not a stretch either to believe it's legitimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, I'd say 50/50 chance this is legitimate, as there is nothing outright illegitimate about it, but at the same time one would think that Microsoft would&nbsp;power their own survey system for something like this, and one may also ask why they didn't just
 post this in the Insider hub or push a notification about this to registered insiders.</p>

            Not seen this one but it sounds very similar to one I had in October last year soon after starting the first preview. Full of absolute rubbish and I had to give up when asked to make a selection where nothing applied. Never did find out if there were any
 actual questions about the preview.

<p>
</p><p>By the way, one of my test machines got a "location services" icon in the notification bar. Just the general settings, one being to allow Cortana access to my location, apparently she can't or won't work without it. Although when I asked her where the cat

<p>I'm having an issue with a hybrid deployment between Exchange 2010 and Office 365. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the EMC, under On-Premises, The local mailboxes do show up, under Recipient Configuration-&gt;Mailboxes. &nbsp; But All mailboxes show up in Recipient Configuration - Entire Forest. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the EMC, under Office365, no mailboxes show up under Recipient Configuration - Mailboxes. &nbsp; &nbsp;As with On-Premises. &nbsp; Clicking directly on "Recipient Configuration" displays all mailboxes, both local and cloud. &nbsp; Local Mailboxes show "Recipient Type Details"
 of "Mail User", with Cloud mailboxes of Type "User Mailbox". &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving a mailbox from the local database to the cloud works, but the mailbox never shows up under Office365-&gt;Recipient Configuration-&gt;Mailbox</p>
<p>I did receive an error:</p>

<p>Processing data from remote server failed with the following error message: &nbsp;...The request for the Windows Remote Shell with ShellID ... failed because the shell was not found on the server. &nbsp; Possible causes are : the specified shellid is incorrect or

<p>Hi Travis,<br />
<br />
This issue was reported at Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident <strong>EX34703</strong> starting at Thursday, November 26, 2015, at 4:17 PM UTC.
<br />
<br />
There is no end-user impact: impact is limited to administrators only. Administrative users are unable to manage mailboxes through the Exchange Management Console (EMC). As a workaround, administrators may be able to use the 'find' feature to locate specific
 mailboxes.<br />
<br />
For more detailed information, we have updated in the following primary thread. <br />

    <title>E66 bought in hong honk has asian languages only - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E66 bought in hong honk has asian languages only</h2>
                    a friend's old man bought her a E66 on a trip to hong kong. It seems to only have asian (picture) languages on it.<br />
<br />
I tried updating the firmware with the updater. The update worked. Version 102.07.81 was already on the phone and the same version was re-installed via the update. It still only has asian languages (presumably the first list I got after the flash was a list
 of languages - all pictures!)<br />
<br />
Is there some way i can flash the phone with a firmware version that contains english?<br />
<br />

<br />
Language packs are not available to the general public. Only Nokia Care Points can install them.<br />
<br />
However, all Nokia phones have English in them plus any other languages for the region where they're sold.<br />
<br />
Performing a hard reset on the phone ought to make it revert to English:<br />
<br />
Power it off.<br />
<br />
Press and hold '3', '*' and 'call' (green) buttons.<br />
<br />
With these buttons held down, switch the phone on and keep them pressed down until the phone shows signs of life such as the Nokia "handshake" logo or the language selection screen.<br />

            The key combo seems to have worked but the language selections are stil all asian pictures when it resets!<br />
<br />
I think I'll hand it back to the owner and wash my hands of it :)<br />

            I am having the same problem. The reset is what got me into this in the first place. The language pack on the Hong Kong phones has Chinese as the default, then English and a few others. So, the default is Chinese, and when you reset one of these phones,
 you had better know how to read Chinese or you are stuck.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info that only Nokia Care Points can install a new language pack. I've been searching for this info for several hours. It seems that language selection should be offered to the general public. As in my case, a Chinese default language phone is
 pretty inconvenient.

                    <p>Many times, many users in my contact, ask a question - Can Excel VBA help users to extract information from a PDF file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few years back I did find one such macro shared by someone on the web.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today I do not have that code and neither do I have any other information / links where one can find sample code OR more detailed explanation on how to write such a code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone aware of any such sample code ?&nbsp; OR any such site which shares detailed information on this?</p>

            Most of the code you will find on the web is based on other installed applications or 3rd party tools. In addition, things change over time and when you try the code, you will find that most of it does not work anymore.
<br />
<br />Anyway, you can only open native PDF and extract the text. If the PDF is protected then it will not work.
<br />
<br />Therefore, there is an easy way to try something: Open the PDF with Word!
<br />
<br />Since 2013 Word can open native PDF and convert the PDF to Text.

            Hi Rajesh, here is a sub you could probably adjust to suit your needs, with it you can open the PDF file and extract its contents using the Adobe library. The code relies on having Adobe already installed ion the PC and uses a dll that is installed as part of that
<br />
<br />Function getTextFromPDF(ByVal strFilename As String) As String
<br />   Dim objAVDoc As New AcroAVDoc
<br />   Dim objPDDoc As New AcroPDDoc
<br />   Dim objPage As AcroPDPage
<br />   Dim objSelection As AcroPDTextSelect
<br />   Dim objHighlight As AcroHiliteList
<br />   Dim pageNum As Long
<br />   Dim strText As String
<br />
<br />   strText = ""
<br />   If (objAvDoc.Open(strFilename, "") Then
<br />      Set objPDDoc = objAVDoc.GetPDDoc
<br />      For pageNum = 0 To objPDDoc.GetNumPages() - 1
<br />         Set objPage = objPDDoc.AcquirePage(pageNum)
<br />         Set objHighlight = New AcroHiliteList
<br />         objHighlight.Add 0, 10000 ' Adjust this up if it's not getting all the text on the page
<br />         Set objSelection = objPage.CreatePageHilite(objHighlight)
<br />
<br />         If Not objSelection Is Nothing Then
<br />            For tCount = 0 To objSelection.GetNumText - 1
<br />               strText = strText &amp; objSelection.GetText(tCount)
<br />            Next tCount
<br />         End If
<br />      Next pageNum
<br />      objAVDoc.Close 1
<br />   End If
<br />
<br />   getTextFromPDF = strText
<br />
<br />End Function

<h2>            Visio cannot import data from Excel</h2>
                    <p>When selecting "Custom Ranges" while creating a diagram from an excel sheet nothing happens, I can successfully select the range in Excel however visio doesn't seem to pick up on this, leaving the '&lt;select data from workbook&gt;' prompt available instead of
 dragging the data through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still import the data conventionally but this is incredibly time consuming and defeats the purpose of my Visio purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any fixes? I've checked online and there doesn't seem to be any other similar issues.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Gareth_beacon,
<br />
<br />My name is Stefan, I'm an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />It is likely that the tool is not working properly, since it indicates that it is extremely slow and does not present an adequate behavior, I can suggest repairing the tool, the steps are in this link, as well as additional alternatives in case he persists the problem after the repair, for more details see here:
<br />

<br />
<br />It is a pleasure to help you, I hope that the information I have shared will be useful to solve the problem.
<br />
<br />Have a good day

<p>I'm a fan of using the PC Suite for messaging particularly. I just downloaded the new version in order to go with my new Nokia909/1020. First of all it tells me that I need to cancel the File transfer Mode in order to connect via USB. which I would like
 to be alble to do but the phone does not give me a menu that allows me to do this. I connect using the bluetooth and it tells me I'm connected in non-compatible mode of course. Help! I enjoyed&nbsp;using the PC Suite with the prior Nokia. The Settings menu does
 not give me "connectivity" as an option or " connections". Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>These are references to a range formated as a table.</p>
<p>[# This Row].[Column B] = is the equivalent to a cell reference or $B2, assuming you ar on row 2.</p>
<p>ProjectA[[#All],[Column E]] = is the evivalent of $E2:$E100, assumning there are 100 rows in the table. However writing this way means the formaul will automatically include any new rows added to the ProjectA table.</p>
<p>Project C[[#Header],[Column F]]&nbsp;is equivalent to $F$1, the heading at the top of the column, in a table named Project C.</p>
<p>The above assumes that&nbsp;A1 is the first&nbsp;cell in the table, however it could be anywhere in your workbook, there's no need to prefix these refernces with a sheet name like conventional cell references.</p>
<p>This link explains them in more detail.</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/using-structured-references-with-excel-tables-HA010155686.aspx?CTT=5&amp;origin=HA010147120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/using-structured-references-with-excel-tables-HA010155686.aspx?CTT=5&amp;origin=HA010147120</a></p>

            <p>May not really be a Windows 10 problem. Are both PCs using Windows 10 and the result is the same.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are both PCs using a cable to the router or are they wireless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to reset your router either by going into the setup via a web browser, using the IP address for the router. Or press the button on the back of the router, you need the router instructions to find it.</p>

            Actually, Office Standard and Pro Plus are limited distribution, not available to the general public.

<br />You might be able to get pro Plus through your work if they support the Home Use program, aka HUP.
