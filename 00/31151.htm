<h2>            Windows is storing credentials for a site with an odd alpha-numerical URL</h2>
                    <p>In my Credential Manager I see information being stored for a site with no name and an odd URL, and I am concerned that this may be linked to some sudden and odd behavior on the part of my PC (sudden and dramatic slowdown on start up times, my PC telling
 me I don't have admin rights, and a notification from the Steam game distribution service that someone tried to access my user account from Zurich...all of which started yesterday.) Here is what it says in the Credential Manager:</p>
<p>
</p><p>f186f92d-9381-b68e-164b-4caf9346b734 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; r.</p>

</p><p>Everything else in the Credential Manager is recognizable, including things like Dropbox, McAfee, Facebook and Skype. I have no idea if this was here prior to my problems starting yesterday, but I thought I should investigate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run two full scans with McAfee and gotten clean results, and I'm about to run Microsoft Safety Scanner to cross check. If anyone can help me with this I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found an app running in the Task Manager called NTKernel.exe with an associated "user" ID that matches the Unknown App ID that I listed above. It has permission to completely control and run my computer. I tried searching for the web for some more info
 but didn't come up with anything other than it is a way for the OS to communicate over a network with other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to "End Task" but I am fairly sure that whatever this is still exists on my PC and will either start up again on its own or whenever I restart my computer. Also, I have noticed that the onboard Windows anti-virus and Defender programs have been
 shut off (Windows Firewall is still up,) and I am unable to restart them. I am unclear if this is something this app has done or just a routine consequence of having McAfee running.</p>

            <p>Hi Rawk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for you post on this forum. Please let’s know the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue. The reason why the inbuilt Windows Defender security program is disabled is because you are using the McAfee on the computer.
 When you use more than one security program on the computer, there would be conflicts between them and that would disable either of them on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since, you suspect a virus or other malicious software infection on the computer, let’s first perform a complete security scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner from Safe Mode with Networking and check the result.</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Boot the computer in Safe Mode with Networking and Perform a Complete Security Scan</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Step 1: Boot the Computer is Safe Mode with Networking</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows, we can start the computer in different advanced troubleshooting modes to find and fix problems on the PC. One of such troubleshooting mode is Safe Mode with Networking. Here we start Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services, including
 the network drivers. Please refer to the steps in this article to boot the computer in safe mode with networking:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After booting the computer in Safe Mode with Networking, let’s download the Microsoft Safety Scanner and perform a complete security scan on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Step2: Run Microsoft Safety Scanner and check if there are any infections on the computer.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner from this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Download Microsoft Safety Scanner</em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Important: When running a scan using an anti-virus program, any data files that are infected may be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s also perform a clean boot on the computer and find the app associated with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “<strong><em>How to perform a clean boot</em></strong>” and follow the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows
 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” from this link:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” given in the
 section “<strong><em>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</em></strong>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the above
 link.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with the updates.</span></p>

            Just a side note has this person ever had a remote user help him do something on his PC? I had a similar URL on my PC which I just noticed this morning, but my PC has not had any problems recently. I did not copy the address down. I couldn't clip or copy.
 My Antivirus works fine. &nbsp;I have had an instance last year where I was having a problem with my touch screen and HP. under warranty. helped me with it. I think CS logged on remotely, wonder if that was it? Any way, I just deleted whatever it was, I am curious
 to see if it returns.&nbsp;

<h2>            How do I get my headphones to show up as a separate device when plugged in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium with the latest Realtek HD Audio Manager. When I plug in my headset to the front panel jacks, Realtek recognizes the headset and microphone. In the Sounds menu, the microphone shows up under recording devices just as it should,
 however the headset does not. I can hear sound comming throuh the headset just fine, but it does not show up as a separate Playback device. I need to know how to get the headset to show up as a separate device. Any help will be greatly appreciated, Thanks!</p>

<p>It's good.</p>
<p>I've done the first five 'intervals' on the campaign and it's a solid shooter. Short on scares but good fun anyway.</p>
<p>The MP is very good: 'Contraction' is basically CoD Zombies.</p>
<p>'*** Run' is rush to get to the next checkpoint whilst keeping ahead of a creeping wall of fog... enemy AI do thier best to slow you down and just 1 player dying stops the game...reviving is a must. Great mode.</p>
<p>'Soul Surviver ' starts with one 'infected' player who then tries to infect the other players who have their hands full with the enemy AI.</p>
<p>'Soul King' has the players killing for 'Souls' which are dropped when a kill is made. You collect the souls and the one with the most is the Soul King who is visible to all players. When killed you lose half of your souls so this game can change a lot right
 up to the last sesonds. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Its a good game but the campaign is VERY short. Also one of (if not the) best co-op games this year in my opinion.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge not tracked in child account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my kid I have setup a child account, and use Family Settings to monitor her usage. Recently we have set up her account in such a way, that she uses Microsoft Edge for using the internet. However, this usage of Microsoft Edge is not listed under recent
 activity. There are no other problems with Edge - inappropriate sites are blocked as requested. But nothing is tracked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can get the tracking of Microsoft Edge up and running?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jorrit</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model number of your laptop?<br />
2. Have you contacted the manufacturer of your laptop?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the methods mentioned below.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Test the keyboard in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> and check if the issue persists in safe mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it works in safe mode, perform <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clean Boot</a> and check. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong> : Follow step 7 to restart your computer as usual, after the test.</div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>a. Check If on screen keyboard funvtions normally.</div>
<div><br />
<div>b. If possible, try connecting an external keyboard and check if the issue persists.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue does not persist if could be a hardware issue and would suggest you contact the laptop manufacturer.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            I cant seem to get GTA5 to download...</h2>
                    Hello. Today I spent $60 in the xbox marketplace (which isnt relevant) and attempted to download Grand Theft Auto 5 onto my 250GB pre-shine slim console. I am very frustrated as it will NOT download. It was stuck on 0% for nearly over a half hour, and
 finally went up to 3%. WOO, 3%!!! (Horrible..) Anyways, it was at 3% for about 5 minutes, and then IT RESET BACK TO 0, forcing me to wait another hour. It did this 3 times in a row. I have cancelled the download, deleted the "incomplete" game file, and attempted
 redownloading it countless times, and this did not help at all. I keep getting the same result. This isnt my first time having this problem, though. My previous problems included: Simple game updates refused to download, Xbox updates refused to download, and
 some games refuse to download. Game updates are just fine for me now, and I havent had an xbox update since that last one. Lots of games I attempt to download from the 'Games with gold' section- unless they are indie games- sti

<p>I recommend rebooting your network. Unplug the modem and router for about 1 minute each. Then plug in the modem, followed by the router.</p>
<p>This usually clears up network problems.</p>
<p>Also try deleting your cache as well as this can clear up some issues as well.
</p>
<p>If it continues, I'd try working with Xbox Support on the issue.</p>

 the Services window loads, navigate to the&nbsp; <strong>" Volume Shadow Copy Service ",</strong> the double click on it to open it,</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Make
 sure the&nbsp;&nbsp; "<strong>Startup Type" says "Automatic</strong>" and&nbsp; <strong>started</strong>. If it doesn't, use the drop down menu to change it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 it already says: "Automatic", then click on the&nbsp; <strong>"Recovery"</strong> tab at the top, and change the "First Failure" line to "Restart the Service", then click on&nbsp; &nbsp;"<strong>apply", then OK.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>Run Check disk to fix any bad sectors on the hard drive.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on start and in the start search bar type cmd, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area and then click on run as administrator.<br />

<strong>chkdsk /r <br />
<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Note:</span></strong><span>CHKDSK would try to recover bad sectors on the hard disk,
 during this process there are chances of DATA loss from that particular sector.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span>Disable the security software and then start the backup; follow the
 steps mentioned in the link below<strong><br />

<h2>            User account I didn&#39;t create&#63;</h2>
                    Running 7 on an HP all-in-one desktop. Poking around in parental controls just for the fun of it and a user&nbsp;account showed up that I did not create, and&nbsp;is not visible on the log-on screen or in user accounts in the control panel. It only shows up when
 I go&nbsp;into parental controls.&nbsp;The name&nbsp;is "UpdatusUser" spelled just exactly that way, and is labeled as a standard user account that is password protected. I wonder if it could have been created when I received remote assistance from Norton? Does this sound
 familiar to anyone? I don't think it's a built-in because it's not labeled as an administrator account.&nbsp;I didn't&nbsp;attempt to change parental controls because I don't know if I should or even if I can if it is password protected and I don't know the password.&nbsp;In
 any case, I wonder if I can/should delete the account&nbsp;it and how to do that if it doesn't show up in user accounts.&nbsp;

    <title>Yellow Triangle Error on Wi-Fi &#47; No Internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> savannah2244  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yellow Triangle Error on Wi-Fi &#47; No Internet</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am having a similar issue to many people but yet have different details concerning it. At different times throughout using my computer I will get a yellow triangle error on my Wi-Fi symbol in the start bar. &nbsp;Usually it is that chrome will stop working
 and I have to repeatedly click on the screen until it will let me close the window. No matter what I do I have to completely restart my computer to log back onto Wi-Fi, because it still is available but kicks me off for some reason. Often it will say no connections
 available or connections available but has a blank screen as I click on options to connect. Many other people who have had the same pop-up still can get on the Internet however mine shuts me off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Some of the things I have tried to get it to work is to disconnect and then reconnect to the current Wi-Fi service. I have also tried connecting to another service but then it will not remain on it for long before it will cut me off as well. I have also
 tried to turn on and off the airplane mode to try to get the Wi-Fi to do better but nothing seems to work. &nbsp;As far as I know I haven't done any massive things to my computer to make it stop working. I have had different malware and virus detectors that will
 delete unnecessary or dangerous files but as far as I know that shouldn't affect the Wi-Fi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the other pages discussing the same thing mention to reset the drivers, however, I do not seem to find it on my computer. Devmgmt.mcn does not exsist, computer wants to search Bing for it while the computer has no internet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I would really appreciate some advice to get this worked out. It used to only happen once in a while, but now it will happen every 20 to 30 minutes especially if I'm watching Netflix or any other high performing video. It has also happened in the middle
 of me taking college quizzes or exams, so this is really screwing up my life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer with a Windows 10.</p>

            Thank you for being more specific on where to go to find the drivers. I could usually find the Device Manager but did not know where to go from there. All my network adapters reported to be&nbsp;working properly, but after updating drivers Intel Dual Band Wireless-
 AC 3165 and Realtek PCle GBE Family Controller I have not had any problem with the yellow triangle error. It's a godsend to get this resolved. Thank you for your time.

<p>

<p>Arthur I'm afraid the problem is not a network connection, and I have checked the article you mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a previous post, I gather that the proxy server setting will be determined if required by an application or website.... but I just don't understand why my is turning on, and preventing my Outlook emails from updating...</p>

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate the additional information that you provided. If the Settings was modified and the changes that were made are not being retained, damaged system files are the usual cause why this issue is occurring. For us to provide an accurate solution,
 we would need you to answer the following questions: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and edition of Windows 10 is installed on your computer?</li><li>Which version of Outlook application are you using?</li><li>What are the changes to your computer before this issue occurred?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. This tool will automatically repair the components of your Windows operating system and records the corruptions to the log file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the DISM tool, follow these steps:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Using Search, type Command Prompt.</li><li>Right-click on Command Prompt on the search results and then select Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password or click Yes.
</li><li>In the Command Prompt window, type <strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong>, and then hit Enter.&nbsp;
</li><li>Once the scan is finished, restart your computer. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: While running the DISM tool on your computer, if any bad sectors are found on the system, data loss might occur. We suggest that you backup your files before running DISM.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also recommended to run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker tool</a></strong>. This is a utility
 that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system and restore corrupted files. The link contains further information about how to run the System File Checker tool. Once done, check if your the same issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I did run the DISM and System File Checker tools and the results were normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'll skip the questions about the build and version numbers for Windows 10 and Outlook because I think I've found the problem: I suspected it was an application that was causing the proxy setting issue, and found I have a VPN called Lantern which has
 a setting which caused the proxy changes:&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I've unticked "Manage system proxy" and the problem appears to have gone away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is helpful to someone.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>Try re-registering Cortana. Perform these steps:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>1. Open Windows PowerShell as administrator.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>2. Then type following command and press Enter key:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.Windows.Cortana | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>Let the command complete.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>3. Close Windows PowerShell and see if the issue is resolved now.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps!</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to verify, when you say turn off the lock screen, do you mean to skip the sign in screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, the option to turn off the lock screen from the Windows Settings is not yet available. However, you can still turn off the option
<strong>Show lock screen background picture on the sign-in screen</strong>. </p>

    <title>Unable to switch to Microsoft account in windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephbarker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to switch to Microsoft account in windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 8 a few days ago.&nbsp; Initially I was able to sign in with my Microsoft account and download a few apps from the app store.&nbsp; However
 not long after (about 30 minutes after getting up and running) apps stopped downloading and I got the error “Your purchases could not be completed.” After doing some research on the net I decided to try switching to a local account then back to my Microsoft
 account.&nbsp; However I can’t switch back.</p>

<p>When trying to switch back from a local account to a Microsoft account, it accepts my email address, then after I enter my password it shows some info
 attached to my Microsoft account (my phone number and alternative email address) then it says You’ve almost finished changing your account. Next time you sign in to Windows, use your Microsoft account and password.’&nbsp;
Then I click on finish and id shows the working animation next to ‘Preparing your Microsoft account’, however then it says “Sorry, we can’t connect to Microsoft services at the moment. If this problem persists, search for “network
 problems” on the Start screen.” My only option then is to click on Close.&nbsp;</p>

<p>* I also can’t connect to Windows Update – again I just get the ‘working’ animation but it just does that indefinitely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>* If I click on the Store app and try to download any app, it asks me to sign in but returns the error: “We can’t sign you in because the network isn’t
 available.&nbsp; Make sure your computer is connected to the internet and try again.”</p>

<p>* I have tried running the Microsoft Accounts troubleshooter.&nbsp; After running, it says in the Problems Found box:&nbsp;
Problem with Microsoft account policy – Not fixed.</p>

<p>* I am not running any antivirus software</p>

<p>* In my LAN settings (in the connections tab of Internet options) I have Automatically detect settings checked, and Use a proxy server unchecked (I
 am just using my internet connection from home – so no proxy)</p>

<p>&nbsp;I have tried resyncing the time but that didn’t help.&nbsp; If reset my router to factory settings
 in case I had something happening in there but that hasn’t helped.&nbsp; I’m at a loss and pretty much can’t use any of the Windows 8 features.&nbsp;
Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks - Joe</p>

            <p>Well I've sorted this out, though the solution was a last resort.&nbsp; After trying everything, I did a system refresh (do a search for Refrsh from the search charm) and now it works perfectly.&nbsp; It has even fixed a problem that I have had since Windows 7 where
 I was not able to sign into Games for Windows live - which I had completely given up on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just make sure you back up EVERYTHING before doing the refresh.&nbsp; Luckily for me most of my data was on a different hard drive to my Windows install, but I still lost a number of 3rd party programs that I needed to redownload and install.&nbsp; However, I'm just
 happy its working now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, since the refresh my whole system has been noticable more stable.</p>

    <title>Public vs. Private Squads - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pcunrecognized cosmic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Public vs. Private Squads</h2>
                    
<p>Since now you can see who is in Squads with who's on your team, and&nbsp;if you really want your Team to Win, set your not full 2 or 3 person squad to Public, even if you expect friends to join later you can always change to a new Squad.</p>
<p>I've noticed that losing teams usually are not squad up and you try to get in to one of the 2 or 3 person squads and you can’t because they never set their squad for public.</p>
<p>There really is no need to be in a private squad on a rush or conquest match if you want your team to&nbsp;win.</p>
<p>don't you want to make it more possible to bring more players on your team to you and your squad when your in a battle?&nbsp;</p>
<p>team killing in hardcore is another topic... those teams that kill team mates are usually losing too. I kind of feel that this happens because players what the vehicles to use so more abilities on them can unlock, did not see that as much in BC2 but more
 so in BF3 since there is a lot more items to unlock now.</p>
<p>I think this squad issue is going to be fixed in the upcoming patch.</p>

<p>I hate it when we have randoms in our squad. They always spawn on us and give away our position by doing something stupid. Or they spawn in the gunner seat of the tank and shoot at nothing, letting the enemy know we are coming and taking the spot away from
 a useful friend.</p>

<p>I play random more then half the time since all my friends are on Skyrim more than BF3. But everytime I join a server, I always check the squads. There should never be more than 3 squads, yet most of the time there are 5. I always leave my squad that I'm
 automatically put in and join a 3 person squad to make it full or join a squad that has 2+ squad specs unlocked (for the advantage).</p>

<p>my point is if you are on a team that is squaded up then you are more than likely to win, were as if you have a team were 2, 4 or more players are not in a Squad, this is very true on a RUSH game.</p>
<p>There are a few bad Blue Berry Randoms at time, but then sometimes you do get your self a great team player when you play with Randoms. And when there is a new game out and your friends are playing that and not BF3 you have to suck it up and play as a random.
 It used to be easy to switch teams like in BC2 now you have to play or take that chance to go to the other side if you can.</p>

<h2>            Windows Device Recovery Tool and Phone Backups</h2>
                    <p>Back along, there was a big caution that the backup regime for Windows Mobile had changed, and that if you restored the phone via Device Recovery Tool, you couldn't use the backup to restore the phone.&nbsp; IS that still the case?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also DRT, when I connect my 735 is showing 9651.15148, when do we expect this to be updated to a version compatible with the new back up?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that&nbsp;the Backup will be based on the Microsoft account that you use on your Phone. You may go to
<strong>Settings&lt;System&lt;Backup</strong> and initiate a Backup Now process. This will sync the backup settings into OneDrive. Once you recover OS using WDRT, you will have to enter the Microsoft account details which will ask you to restore data and settings
 through backups sorted by date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the firmware, please refer to the Windows blog for further information.</p>

            <p>You are missing the point.&nbsp; The following issue was released with version 14371 in June...</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We are changing the backup format for Windows 10 Mobile devices to reduce the size of the backup stored in OneDrive. As a result, if you do a backup on a device running the latest Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview builds and move back to the released version
 of Windows 10 Mobile (Build 10586) and restore from your backup – your Start screen layout won’t restore and remain the default Start layout. Your previous backup also gets overwritten. If you need to go back to Build 10586 temporarily, once you are on Build
 10586 you should disable backup so it doesn’t overwrite the good backup from Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview builds. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like at some stage to do a WDRT restore of my phone, in order to get it to a clean install - I've been with the Insider programme for a long while - I don't want to have to deal with a full reconfig of the phone from scratch, I'd like to go with
 a restore from Backup...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please comment on a) whether this is possible as of now, and b) if answer to a) is no, when is it likely to be possible?</p>

    <title>Make a double click on a jpg open it instead of previewing it. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesgangnc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Make a double click on a jpg open it instead of previewing it.</h2>
                    <p>When I have a folder of jpg's and double click on one of them, it opens in Windows Photo Viewer. &nbsp;If I right click the first option in bold is "Preview". &nbsp;Choosing preview again opens in Windows Photo Viewer. &nbsp;The next option from a right click is Open and
 it is not bold, if I click on the open, the image is opened in Photoscape. &nbsp;I have set Photoscape as the default program associated with the file types for jpg's. &nbsp;Also I get a very short list of options when I right click on jpg's, I don't get the larger
 set of choices that I normally see when right clicking on other file types. &nbsp;I'd really like to have that back as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a double click on a jpg to OPEN, not preview. &nbsp;I've been to program associations and I don't see a place to tell it to open instead of preview. &nbsp;How do I do this?</p>

            <p>I see now I wasn't really paying attention. &nbsp;My problem is with folders on devices like cameras, phones, kindles, etc. &nbsp;The right click menu is abbreviated and a double click always previews. &nbsp;Even though a double click on the same file type on a hard drive
 opens instead of previewing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems my problem is the different explorer behavior on devices. &nbsp;Not sure why it does that or why I can't change it. &nbsp;May it can't be changed.</p>

            <p>No, the right click options are a lot shorter and don't have all the options you normally see. &nbsp;I'd give you a screen shot but the right click popup disappears when I press any keys to try to capture the screen. &nbsp;You could duplicate by connecting any smart
 phone or android device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a bit more exploring and all my devices are running android/linux using MTP and PTP to share files with Windows. &nbsp;I don't think there is a technical reason why Windows can't have the same options since I can right click and choose Open instead
 of the default Preview. &nbsp;But it does seem to be impossible to make it do an Open as a default on double click in this situation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The other utility I mentioned is called <a href="http://1drv.ms/1Dr4dRu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Types</a> and it's a tool that should let you choose the program associated with each entry on the right-click menu, or even add new entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here you see me editing what the "open" command does on the Excel file type:</p>

            <p>That's a good thing to check but turns out my Windows Photo Viewer has "0 out of 11" defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think my settings for default program are the issue. &nbsp;I think it's something to do with how Windows chooses to deal with MTP and PTP sources. &nbsp;Did you try hooking a newer android device to your computer to see what your results are?</p>
