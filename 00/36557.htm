<h2>            how to restore security to WindowsApps Folder</h2>
                    I already set the WindowsApps Folder to&nbsp;NT Service\TrustedInstaller as owner but it's not like it was before were I can't see or access it how do I get it back to default settings were I could not access it? (Im running windows 10 64 bit version 1803)
 I originaly changed it to try to get My Logitech G19s keyboard Mail pop3 program to access the Mail.exe file to lunch from the keyboard controls but it did not work the way I thought it would so it was all for nothing now I'm left with this problem. (Also
 seems this web page does not like waterfox browser as it gave me this error message&nbsp; Only Category drop down box shows up not windows version or window topic's drop down box's but that is another unrelated issue error below I'm more interested in the WindowsApp
 folder issue)

            Bah Nm Ima just reformat again...my poor...ssd...but I guess this question still needs a answer for someone else as while looking for a answer I found tons of people asking some people helped but there directions never got the security back to were it
 was so was unhelpful to that degree...and also the compatibility with the waterfox browser needs to be addressed as waterfox won't let you post to here at all (here being this forum page) had to switch to Edge Browser, and remembered all I typed because it
 did not remember what I typed.

            This might be caused by a defective paper sensor. You need to get the printer serviced.

<h2>            Need to disconnect&#47;remove a Xbox Account from a Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p><p>A few years back, I created a personal email account (hotmail).&nbsp;Due to the Microsoft changes this became a Microsoft account. As a result, I unknowingly created an Xbox account that is linked to the email&nbsp;account. However, I already have a Xbox account which I use (this one). I should also add that the Xbox account I use,&nbsp;is connected to my parent's email because, I guess, they wanted to supervise what I was on when I was younger (part of the reason I wish to swap Microsoft accounts, and also so I don't have to manage both Microsoft accounts).</p><p>So I wish to be able to remove the Xbox account (I don't use) that is associated with my email account (Microsoft account). And then add the Xbox account I use to the email account. Is this possible, and how do I do it?</p><p>Cheers in advanced</p>

I’m able to play the game but I can’t connect to Xbox live. I have spent over 4 hours trying to fix this but it still won’t work. I’m able to log in fine&nbsp;on Xbox.com and I have even made another account to ensure it wasn’t just the account. My account isn’t a child account either. I would really like this to be fixed because is spent £6.99 on the app. The whole point I got it was to play with my friends. Hopefully someone will be able to be able to help.&nbsp;The photo attached is what it says everytime.&nbsp;</p>

            HI TaiyeBalogun,<br />
<br />
You may just once want to Contact your Hardware Manufacturer and ask them to Check if there is a Latest Version of the BIOS and Chipset.<br />
<br />
If there is one Available then Please Install the same and check after that if the Issue is resolved.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also Please contact the Hardware manufacture as Many Hardware Manufacture have a List of Laptop Model which may or May not be Compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please Cross verify with them as well on this.

<h2>            Unable to connect to SMTP outgoing server.</h2>
                    I have two computers that I send and receive my email.&nbsp; Both computer email settings are identical and have never been changed or tampered with.&nbsp; Recently my office computer now will not send email.&nbsp; It receives email just fine.&nbsp; I have full internet access
 and have no other issues with the operation of any software or hardware on this computer.&nbsp; Yet, it will not connect to the smtp servier to send outgoing emails.&nbsp; I have checked and rechecked all settings and setup configurations as dictated by MSN for email.&nbsp;
 All settings are identical on both computers.&nbsp; Both computers use Windows XP.&nbsp; Both computers connect to the internet via LAN connection.&nbsp; Since all settings are identical on both computers and my office computer is the only one that will not send, what in
 the world could be the problem and how do I resolve this issue?&nbsp; Microsoft does not appear to be of any help at this point.

            Brimik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to verify that I am understanding the setup correctly.&nbsp; You have two computers that you check your email on.&nbsp; One is at your office and it is not sending email any more.&nbsp; If this is correct then it sounds as if the port for your outgoing email
 server is being blocked at your office.&nbsp; If you are able to check with your IT department they should be able to tell you if anything might be blocking the outgoing port 995.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or if you have installed a firewall program it could be blocking that as well.&nbsp; If you have you will need to make sure you allow the email program access within the firewall program.<br />
<br />
If you need further assistance then let us know what email client you are using and what error message(s) you are getting.

<h2>            Skype Number not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have activated an skype number but for some reason one someone attempts to call me, the line answers with a message saying "the phone number you have dialed is not in service".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried after this to activate the forwarding service to a local number and now it says that "the subscriber is not available".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the support site and it is impossible to get to chat with an agent. When I click "contact support" it just shows a page with "check skype service" and "ask the community". What a disappointment with this service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone on the other side can read this and help out.</p>

            Hi Nensi.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Try restarting your modem, router and PC in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I'd also check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates if there were WIndows Updates installed before this problem started.  You can uninstall them from the link there to see if the problem goes away.  If so you can hide the Updates using the same tool above.  
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            windows 7 update kills my audio states windows audio services are not running yet when checked they are started. reinstalling audio drivers direct from manufacturer does not help</h2>
                    <p>hello. I'm seriously going mad with this issue. I've reinstalled the windows 7 operating system on this machine three times now because of it and frankly i've become rather upset with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what happens: I reinstall the operating system and everything is working great, the drivers for my wifi card are even installed and it configures admirably, giving me my wifi networks icon in the systray and my sound works perfectly. I go to windows
 update, which gives me hundreds of updates to install, and so i download them and install them. the system reboots, i have to wait for the configuration. it reboots again, wait then i can then log in. When i log in my wifi networks icon is no longer available
 in the systray (it's a damn good thing i have it set up already to automatically connect because i do not know how i otherwise be able to configure it with it now GONE...) and i no longer have any sound. I have literally racked my brain up around all of the
 tech site discussions that give advice on this issue which none of their suggestions have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've investigated the windows update history log and have discovered several updates that failed to install, which are listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>kb2703157</p>
<p>kb2598845</p>
<p>kb2834140</p>
<p>kb2834140 (again)</p>
<p>kb2742595</p>
<p>kb2729449</p>
<p>kb2737019</p>
<p>kb2600217</p>
<p>
</p><p>I havent any idea on what is going on with the update process but i do know that somehow this update issue has destroyed my system functionality now for the third time with the same issues all of them coming from windows update. I will attempt to reinstall
 the failed updates but i really don't think they are the issue. I noticed in device manager this message:&nbsp;Location 2 (Internal High Definition Audio Bus) under sound video and game controllers. interestingly.... that is also the only device shown there, where
 did all of my other controllers go.... yet again, why is it labeled location 2? are there now two audio controller devices, with my original being ghosted by this new location and thus killing any resources to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the system devices tab high definition audio contoler still shows microsoft as being the controlling driver... when i try to update it realtek is nowhere to be found in the install options list. upon a subsequent look into the INF files within my INF
 directory both&nbsp;hdaudbus.inf as well as&nbsp;hdaudio.inf showed a modification date of 6/27/2014... gee, exactly when this issue occurred!. Guess I'll go look for the back ups of those original INF files and reinsert them back into the INF directory... and my hardware
 will work again once I reinstall the originals.... wow, i guess I can thank myself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANK YOU MICROSOFT FOR MAKING ME TALK TO YOU!~&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. When I wrote this request I couldnt find the original HD drivers so I went ahead and reinstalled the OS... everything went great, I started reinstalling all of my applications. I had your automatic update service completely disabled
 in my services console however somehow some way, your service decided to install updates under the hood of my OS and those same updates have now for a fifth time DESTROYED MY SYSTEMS FUNCTIONALITY. I DON'T EVEN HAVE SERVICE PACK ONE OR THE HUNDREDS OF UPDATES
 I'VE PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED FOR WINDOWS 7 on this brand new installation because I couldn't pinpoint which updates were the ones that originally was hosing my system. I have them now, and am including them in this report. My question is, how in the **** did
 your automatic updater update me when I had it shut down and disabled completely? Yes, the installation previous to this had close to 17 GB of freaking updates installed on it.... including service pack 1. This installation that once again just got hosed in
 the same manner isnt even two days old!! I had to completely reinstall my system AGAIN for a fourth time because your update service is installing updates that destroy my systems functionality, notably my wifi adapter icon disappears - even though the preset
 still boots and allows me to go online I no longer have access to the wifi management application that usually sits in the system tray but is now no longer there. But worse than that, your updates also completely DESTROY my sound capabilities in that the error
 messages I get keep telling me that the windows audio service isn't running but in the services console it shows it active. diagnostics will not turn the service back on and a reinstallation of the drivers does not help at all. Another item I noticed that
 your update did was completely destroy all of my system restore points in the system restore application to where the only restore point left available is the one from when your update service secretly updated my machine. I say secretly because there was no
 prompt to install any updates, no message telling me id beeen updated as well as even when the updates were installed I was not informed that my machine was updated and needed to be rebooted KB2621440 - https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms12-020
 KB979309 - https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms10-019 Windows update also shows these other three updates that were installed on 7/1: Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.177.1320.0) Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.256
 - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104 Intel Corporation - Display - Intel (R) 82945G Express Chipset Family I ACTUALLY SAVED MY ORIGINAL HD DRIVERS THIS TIME FROM THE REINSTALL AND AM GOING TO REINSERT THEM INTO MY WINDOWS DIRECTORY, INSTALL THE INF FILE,
 AND THEN OVERWRITE THE NEW dll WITH THE ORIGINAL. I HOPE IT WORKS. If it doesn't I'm going to review the info you supplied. My ~BIGGEST~ concern here is how in the **** did windows update update me without my knowledge, while it was also disabled in the services
 console... ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with my audio keeps telling me that the windows audio service is disabled in the services console, which it shows it is not but instead is set to automatic, yet these services refuse to start because they state certain dependencie wont start, which
 upon reviewing them they are started yet the system cannot get the windows audio or the windows audio end point builder to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what would prevent my audio service from starting while set to automatically start yet shut itself off and refuse to allow it to manually turn it back on? here is the services and thier derpendencies, and thier status:</p>
<p>windows audio - automatic - stopped - error 1068: the dependency service or group failed to start<br />
-dependency: Multimedia Class Scheduler - automatic - stopped - started successfully<br />
-dependency: DCOM Server Process Launcher - hidden - automatic - started<br />
-dependency: RPC Endpoint Mapper - hidden - automatic - started<br />
windows audio end point builder - automatic - stopped - error 1722: the RPC server is unavailable<br />
-dependency: plug and Play - hidden - automatic - started<br />
<br />
upon restarting the one dependency that even though it was set to automatic was stopped the audio harware wizard was still unable to turn on the services it says were not running even though in the services console they were turned on. my audio icon in the
 systray is still Xed out. even when I install the drivers direct from the manufacturer, the problem isn't fixed.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT TO ADD: I've had to restore the system back to the remaining restore point. It worked. I've made a note of the updates from windows update that affected my computer and have unchecked them and hidden them and will continue updating this new installation
 in incriments... each incriment being backed by an established restore point</p>

            ok. Ive installed most of the updates in groups but suddenly... the .net updates as well as the service pack 1 fail to install. I've tried four times now. Im downloading the kb947821 tool but it requires service pack one installed so I doubt it will function.
 It's a rather odd developement in that I've never had the service pack fail to install on the other three installations, all on this same machine and using the same disk, which is activated with the windows genuine software logo providing authenticity in my
 action controle panel. I'm at a loss at this point.

            <p>THIS IS HAPPENING with great frequency, too much, and ms knows it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's happened with me inside my brand new fairly high-end computer I bought after a prior ms update that installed without my knowledge and hence consent, occured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm seeing all the nonsense ms is creating, all the havoc it recklessly inflicts on so many people, and have decided to commence class-action civil action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should anyone wish to join, send your information to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, this data is held in confidence, my being an attorney.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I psent $99 for support on the other computer and they put me through a wringer of breaking in their help; making me scale their ladder of competence level from looseleaf binder reader to curbside offhand comment dropper, till I finally gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This, after ms had me purchase all sort of computer parts and aid at a local computer store (Staples) and in hindsight it seems incredible, but by the time they ran me through their gauntlet, I through away $650 in parts and labor and taxis over 6 weeks.
 &nbsp;They even destroyed my backed-up documents, some of which were vital to a new career I had began after retirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The prior trouble was they wiped out XP access for my computer, even though it had previously been certified genuine. &nbsp;This time they blocked me with a new program called Activation, which wouldn't allow same without verifying genuine advantage and wouldn't
 permit that without accessing my XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A classic example of a Catch-2 predicament, which they were long aware of, but ignored customer's grief cause in their thirst to bleed every last drop of life out of us, including killing xp in customer's property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation is another kill switch. &nbsp;This one murders XP systems to force people to buy their crappy XP successors and line their pockets, in this man's opinion, illicitly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't waste your time getting petted by ms. &nbsp;The only thing they obviously care about is not making an honest dollar. &nbsp;Better to get another computer, rather than work out their problems for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't be using windows products ever again.</p>

            <p>My 2 cents worth :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get your computer to a working state and install some decent malware protection.</p>
<p>1. Avast antivirus (free version)</p>
<p>2. Malwarebytes pro (paid version)</p>
<p>3. WinPatrol free or pro (system, home page and reg. guard)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All play together nicely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not upgrade any drivers that work correctly ("don't fix what isn't broken") as they will NOT improve performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, do not use IE (any version), but do use PaleMoon, SeaMonkey or Firefox browser (PaleMoon is the safest) and then ...
<strong>TURN OFF AUTO-UPDATES</strong> and realize 99% of all updates are for IE (or Office) security holes.</p>
<p>Do download [only] "critical updates" using custom downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not use registry cleaners or system optimizers or other snake-oil programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like my computer to work. I do not like having to mess around with endless updates to a smoothly working computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

</p><p>THIS "reply" from a mvp ms'er!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>the corporation is impressed, i'm sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but not this consumer, i'm certain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>that may make you feel good, but it offers no advice whatsoever about what to do short of purchasing another computer to get an audio system working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>because ms knocked my brand new computer soundless. on an update i thought i'd blocked due to the minute fact that ms updates destroyed my previously good working order computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i paid extra for the Realtek hd config and now i don't even get system beeps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i won't buy any more hardware with ms aboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this has cost me enough and all i get out of ms is insults?</p>
<p>
</p><p>some big help. i saw a msg in my email alert from the ms mvp!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i THOUGHT that meant this was a hopefilled development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>silly me. &nbsp;what i got i won't spell out clearly in mixed company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SAD. &nbsp;it's taken only a short time for this avenue masqarauding as a help site turns out to reveal itself to be a thinly disguised Public Relations Jr. department saving the reputation of ms instead of offering real help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ms is a gd money sucker trying to sell unnecessary products offering the same things only moved around and dressed in different graphics to appear of value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when the public got wise to it, sales plunged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now the're generating sales increases by attacking xp and 7 owners who retreated from 8 and 8.1 and now 8.2 because the products stink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>by comparison 7 looks good, and xp great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so they knock those legitimate on the record genuine advantage product owners out with activation and other updates that destroy their own product! &nbsp;(we only are licensees.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>why do you think ms i blocked your creepy updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>because they burned me once before. &nbsp;cost me 700 dollars until i cried uncle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>te new computer i would eventually buy anyhow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i just -- obviously -- would not have thrown good money after bad if i fully understood what ms was all about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>lots and lots of things making a buck in a less than reputable manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>that is, in my opinion, "horse <strong>manure.</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the one word response to my plea for help speaks so eloquently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>more persusaively then my last 200 words even remotely approached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and i'm a lawyer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>don't stand for this mistreatment. &nbsp;join up and let's strike back at this monstrous example of what corporations can get away with if their big enough. &nbsp;in my opinion, they've become too big for their britches.</p>

            <p>thanks. &nbsp;compared to ms's shill, you have been actually, helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i apologize for this seeming backhanded compliment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i didn't install of uninstall or do anything you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>just speent wasted a weekend learning or trying to see what i could do without excerbating the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i checked lots of things, as advised around the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but didn't change or adjust or fine-tune</p>
<p>
</p><p>maybe somebody can help. &nbsp;do i dare get hopes up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>after the update, a red circle cross leaped out from the taslbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i thought somehow i muted the sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i clicked on it and the troubleshooter ran to my rescue and advised nothing could be done and that my recourse was get this,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"ask a friend."</p>
<p>
</p><p>that's premium top dollar advice, alright.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after 2 days on the web, i went to a prior restore point, one that revealed the missing installed at factory audio system was last operating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on a reboot, the speaker icon thing showed the small red circle. &nbsp;again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it could not restore my Realtek audio to working order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>that's where i sit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any, ANY thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i don't want to permanently precluse a possible repair at some unknown time in the future whne someone finds a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanking you in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>don't forget to sue ms, if only in your local small claims court.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you have more than enough evidence in the way of constructive notice against ms to make your case, based solely on internet recorded pleas for help, notes, and advice since 2006. &nbsp;thye've known about this for a long time, yet continue to infiltrate people's
 computers and by implication their homes, without first obtaining permission and consent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any waivers to the contrary are unconscionable. &nbsp;licensees have the right to shut off updates. many do and have done just that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ms don't like that much, so they advise you to not do that, while ommiting addressing that ugly fact of their illegal intrusions despite being given the perfect opportunity to do so -- in the course of a reply to a plea for help, no less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a plea for help based on ms's transgressions ignores that well known fact and instead of denying it, attacks the good advice concerning what to do about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sue it. take the corp to court and publicize the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you might find some interested reporter eager to conduct a piece of investigative journalism.</p>

<h2>            Console coming out of country&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After a long battle with my xbox not working, I sent it to mesquite, texas for the last time. Microsoft told me I was getting a different console. The guy on the phone thinks it will be new, support here said refurbished. I tend to believe the latter, but
 now when I am watching my UPS tracking number it was updating funny. When I called in they said it is coming up like that because my package is coming from out of country?! Where is it coming from and why is it out of country? Not sure if it makes a difference
 but I have the new slim 250GB console.</p>

<h2>            Fortnite STW Suspension</h2>
                    Hey gamers,<br />
I contacted the support of Epic Games to know more about the suspension of the Save the World service but I have just been redirected to the post on Twitter where they are told that they are working on the Storage and Frostnite mode, I think it is a matter
 of time and will be fixed , tomorrow I assume it will be all working if not already in the next 7-8 hours,<br />
Thanks Gamers,<br />
Have a nice day.<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro does not turn on without being plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Hi,</p>
<p>My surface pro has been experiencing some problems regarding charging/battery. So basically, it doesnt turn on without being plugged in, always appears to be at 80% - not charging mode, doesnt recognize the type cover and sometimes turn off spontaneously.
 I tried update and hold the power+volume up buttons but they dont work.</p>
<p>Will appreciate some helps!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

                    <p><em>Original Title: </em>Wireless controller not working on Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a <a href="http://www.geniusnet.com/Genius/wSite/ct?xItem=16785&amp;ctNode=163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Genius Wireless Grandias 12V</a> gamepad, working with my laptop, running Windows 7, without problem, using the automatic driver. I decided to give it a try on my desktop, running Windows 8.1.</p>
<ul>
<li>I plugged it in, the OS automatically installed the driver, but it was not working.</li><li>Then I downloaded the proper driver from the manufacturer website, installed it -&gt; nothing</li><li>I realised, that the LED on the receiver is not working, only in BIOS, after the OS boots, it stops, so I found out, it was a "USB-port-not-powered-8.1" problem, found
<a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2900614/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the solution</a>, did it, but it didn't help.</li><li>I managed to plug it into a USB hub, so it is now powered, as the LED lights up -&gt; still nothing</li><li>Found <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/usb-30-and-usb-20-devices-not-working-after/62e9a98c-7604-4142-b897-fda2bed1d024">
this question</a>, it was quite similar, so I did the steps from the solution post, but cannot make the controller work.</li><li>I had a chance to try it on an other computer with 8.1, the same problem occurs.</li></ul>
<p>Now it looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can see the controller in the Devices and Printers, but it shows an error (Status: Driver error)</li><li>In the Device Manager it shows up as an USB input device with an error, in the properties it says:<br />
This device cannot start. (Code 10) {Operation Failed} The requested operation was unsuccessful.</li></ul>
<p>I had a long email conversation with the Genius support team and since my problem wasn't solved, they said I should write to Microsoft, as it has to be a problem with the OS.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my Windows and hardware drivers are up-to-date.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Code 10 error is generated when Device Manager can't start the hardware device, a situation usually caused by outdated or corrupted drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also refer to the following link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my research I have found that Genius Wireless Grandias 12V is not compatible with windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>You can refer to the following windows compatibility center link.</p>

<p>I don't know why do you say, that it is incompatible with windows 8.1, as I cannot find it in the compatibility center, just the wired one, without info. Also the Genius support said, they had no problem making it work on 8.1.</p>

<p>Just to inform, I am using Windows 10 Enterprise, I am facing similar problem. I can use this Genius controller with older version of windows, but not with windows 10. No matter how much I try to install original driver, it says, "Better software is already
 installed" like something. <br />

<h2>            PROBLEMS WITH FILE EXPLORER ON WINDOWS 8.1</h2>
                    I purchased a new laptop with Windows 8.1 and now my File Explorer does not work properly. &nbsp;It worked ok at first, but now it does not. &nbsp;When I click on the icon nothing happens. &nbsp;If I right click then it does show previous files I looked at. &nbsp;Never had
 this problem with Windows 7.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could occur due to some corrupt shortcut files or system files. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Check if you are able to access File Explorer from the search feature. Press Windows key + F, set the search filter to ‘Everywhere’. Now type ‘File Explorer’ and press enter. If you are able to access File Explorer, then it means that
 that shortcut for File Explorer in Task bar is broken. In this case, right click on the File Explorer icon in the task bar and select ‘Unpin this program from Task bar’. Once the shortcut is removed, search for File Explorer as explained above. In the search
 results, right click on ‘File Explorer’ icon and select ‘Pin to task bar’.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are unable to open File Explorer as explained above, then most probably some system files are corrupt. I would suggest you top run a System file check. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system
 files that could be causing this issue. Refer to this article:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to check other user accounts to see if the same behavior occurs. If yes, then create a new user profile and check if the issue persists. This step I suggested to check if the issue is caused
 by user profile related settings. If you need a quick guide, you can refer to this article to create a new user account:</span></p>

    <title>XB1 Chatpad keys are swapped - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> membraind  say:</h3>
<h2>            XB1 Chatpad keys are swapped</h2>
                    
<p>Today I plugged my new Xbox&nbsp;One&nbsp;chatpad into my Master Chief controller for the initial setup and firmware updates.&nbsp; The controller and chatpad updated correctly, but when I tested it I found that some of the keys were mixed up, and the following keys were
 swapped:</p>
<ul>
<li>the&nbsp;comma and "M" keys </li><li>The "Q" and "A" keys </li><li>The "W" and "X" keys </li></ul>
<p>As a result, trying to search for something like "Metal Gear" looks like ",eql Geqr"&nbsp; Has anyone else seen this issue?&nbsp; If you have, do I just need to re-run the firmware update?&nbsp; Or do I need to exchange my chatpad for one that works?&nbsp; I updated to NXOE
 10 days ago, and the issue also occurs with my other controller.&nbsp; Strangely, that controller did not get a firmware update when I plugged in the chatpad, but the chatpad&nbsp; could still type with the keys still swapped.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Make sure your console region matches the region you're in. The reason why the different keys show up is because your keyboard has changed from Qwerty to Azerty or vice versa due to it not matching with the on screen keyboard.<br />
<br />
Your Chatpad serial number ends with the letter B, E, F, G, or S to indicate which language it supports—British-English, US-English, French, German, or Spanish.</p>
<p>To check your settings, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scroll left on the <b>Home</b> screen to open the guide. </li><li>Select <b>Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>All Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>System</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Language &amp; location</b> to confirm or update your location and language to match your Chatpad.
</li></ol>
<p>If the wrong characters still appear, try the next solution.</p>
<p><b>Solution 2: Check to see if you are in Special Character key mode</b></p>
<p>You may be entering Special Character key mode if you are pressing one of the <b>
^, ~, ¨, ` </b>or<b> .</b> keys followed by a, e, I, o, u, or y. See the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/xbox-one-chatpad-info#special" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Special Character key mode</a> section to understand this functionality.</p>
<p>If the wrong characters still appear, try the next solution.</p>
<p><b>Solution 3: Check the Chatpad mode</b></p>
<p>Check to make sure you are not in or entering one of the special modes described earlier on this page (such as Orange mode). If you see the orange, green, or CAPS key lit, you are in the corresponding mode. Exit the mode by pressing that lit key.</p>
<p><b>Solution 4: Update your controller </b></p>
<ol>
<li>Plug your Chatpad into the controller. </li><li>Scroll left on the <b>Home</b> screen to open the guide </li><li>Select <b>Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>All Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Kinect &amp; devices</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Devices &amp; accessories</b>. </li><li>Select your controller. </li><li>Under <b>DEVICE OPTIONS</b>, select <b>Update</b>. </li><li>Following the instructions to complete the update. </li></ol>

<p>Thanks again for the help FearedNightmare! &nbsp;It appears that the chatpad is from the wrong locale after all, so it doesn't match the on-screen keyboard. &nbsp;I suspect that the same box is used for the Chatpad in all regions? &nbsp;Either way I'll get it exchanged
 later this week.</p>

            <p>Hello Jodie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>I truly appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. </p>
<ol>
<li>Were you able to connect your laptop to the internet&nbsp;ever before? If yes, did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Do you get any error message when you connect your laptop with the internet? If yes, what is the
<strong><em>exact </em></strong>error message?</li></ol>
<p>As your post states that you are unable to connect your one specific laptop to the internet connection irrespective of wired or wireless connectivity, it can be concluded that one of the prominent causes of the issue could be&nbsp;that the network drivers installed
 in your system fit incompatible with the operating system or system requirements. So,&nbsp;I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run the Network troubleshooter and check if you get any error message.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows&nbsp;7</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to completely uninstall and reinstall the Network adapters from the Device Manager.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>,<br />
clicking <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under <strong>System</strong>, clicking
<strong>Device<br />
Manager</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,<br />
type the password or provide confirmation.</span></li><li><span>In the list of hardware categories, find and expand the <strong>Network Adapters</strong> and right-click the device driver that you want to uninstall, and click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Now, go to the system manufacturer's website provided below and select the
</span>appropriate <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thank your for your reply. &nbsp;To answer your questions, yes the laptop used to connect to internet wireless without issue. It wasn't used for a couple of weeks, and just stopped working, no hardware or software changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to connect via IE get error 'you're not connected to a network' chrome I get 'this web page is not available' and firefox I get 'server not found'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to run the troublesooter, and get a message 'The Diagnostic Policy Service in not running' but the wizard is unable to restart it, I have tried to manually restart within services, but get an error 'Windows could not start the Diagnostic Policy
 Service service on Local Computer. Error 5: Access is denied.' I am logged on as a local administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already uninstalled and reinstalled drivers. The wireless icon in bottom right hand corner shows connected and full signal, but says limited access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Jodie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the updated information on the issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you download and install the drivers from the link provided for Dell Inspiron 1545 in my previous post? If yes, please mention which drivers did you install for both wireless and LAN network connection? Also,&nbsp;please try&nbsp;installing a back dated driver
 and check if you are able to connect to the network as it very necessary to ensure that there is no issue with the wired and wireless network adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, the "Access is Denied" error is displayed when you do not have complete administrative privileges to start the service. So, I would recommend you to try the following steps and then try restarting the Diagnostic Policy Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try the following steps to start the Diagnostic Policy Service.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong> and open <strong>Accessories</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Right click on
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the Program list and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>OK</strong>, or else click <strong>Yes</strong>.</span></li><li><span>I</span><span>n the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</span><br />
<strong>net&nbsp;start DPS</strong></li></ol>
<p>If you are still unable to start the service and get the "Access is Denied" error, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may need to provide permissions to the service in registry editor and check if you are able to start the service.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;C<span>lick on
<strong>Start</strong>; in the start search type <strong>regedit.exe</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong></span>.</p>
<p>b. <span>
Browse to the following registry keys location.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\DPS</strong></span></p>
<p><span>c. Right click on the folder
<strong>DPS</strong>&nbsp;and click on <strong>Permissions</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click on
<strong>Add</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Type "everyone" (without quotes) in the space provided for writing names.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click
<strong>Check Names </strong>and click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Check mark on
<strong>Full Control</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>h. Exit Registry editor.</span></p>
<p><span>i. Reboot the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try starting the Diagnostic Policy Service&nbsp;from the list of services and check if you get the error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base:</p>

</p><p>Yes, I downloaded the drivers from your link - although I changed the operating system to Windows 7. These looked to be the same drivers I installed previously, they don't work. They are old drivers, and therefore I haven't found older drivers, as these
 are the drivers that have worked previously. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Dell Wireless 1397 WLAN Mini-Card #2 (Driver Date 01/10/2008, Driver Version 4.176.75.21) and Marvell Yukon 88E8040 PCI-Ethernet controller #2 (Driver Date 20/05/2009, Driver Version 11.10.5.3). The internet just simply stopped connecting...
 I made no changes to the drivers, prior to have problems, and the laptop will see the network, and shows full signal strength, just no Internet connectivity, I have tried a different browser aslo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the command described in Method one, and got access denied, so I followed method 2 gave 'everyone' full access permissions in the registry, restarted the laptop - twice, but still get access denied when trying to start the Diagnostic Policy Service.</p>

    <title>Two unnamed folders appeared on Windows 7 desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mommadillo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two unnamed folders appeared on Windows 7 desktop</h2>
                    <p>I had two unnamed folders appear on my Windows 7 desktop this morning. (Windows 7 Enterprise x64)&nbsp; The folders don't show any names beneath the folder icon.&nbsp; Double-clicking on either of them does nothing - no windows open when the folders are double-clicked.&nbsp;
 I can move them around on the desktop by clicking and dragging, but that's all I can do with them.&nbsp; Right-clicking on either icon gives a pop-up menu with only three entries - Cut, Create Shortcut, or Delete.&nbsp; Selecting Create Shortcut does nothing - if any
 shortcuts are being created, they're not showing up on the desktop.&nbsp; Selecting Cut causes the icon to appear faded, but when I try to paste it into a different folder, I get an error message.&nbsp; (see attached screenshot) Selecting Delete brings up a prompt asking
 if I'm sure I want to delete the icons from my desktop and saying "To restore them later, go to Control Panel" which would indicate a system folder of some sort.&nbsp; Trying to drag and drop either icon into a different folder gives me a prompt saying I'm creating
 a link, not actually moving anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody got any ideas?&nbsp; I'm thinking it's something Group Policy-related, since our SysAdmin guy has been working on policies that do things like adding links to the IE favorites menu and putting icons on the desktop.&nbsp; He says it's nothing he's doing, but
 it wouldn't be the first time he's been wrong.</p>

<h2>            Unidentified Icon has Appeared in Alt-Tab</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsnt146.mail.live.com%2fatt%2fGetAttachment.aspx%3ftnail%3d0%26amp%3bmessageId%3dde9b8ee1-9094-11e4-9373-00237de49bb6%26amp%3bAux%3d114%257c0%257c8D1F2B8C9852100%257c%257c0%257c0%257c0%257c0%257c%257c%257c10%257ceric.zinter%2540hotmail.com%26amp%3bcid%3d9ce8e79eedcc1d59%26amp%3bmaxwidth%3d220%26amp%3bmaxheight%3d160%26amp%3bsize%3dAtt%26amp%3bblob%3dMHwyMDE0LTEyLTMwIDIxLjI5LjA1LmpwZ3xpbWFnZS9qcGVn" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Referring to picture above, the red/yellow/blue box icon has appeared in my "Alt-Tab" listing. &nbsp;Unlike any other icon in the list, this one has no description when selected and has no obvious purpose. &nbsp;Selecting it does nothing. &nbsp;Whatever it is related to
 does not show up on task manager. &nbsp;I have no idea why it appeared or what it may be related to. &nbsp;So I'm concerned. &nbsp;Can anyone provide some insight?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>That generic icon is usually an off-screen window (which the operating system and programs make frequent use of, at any given time you normally have hundreds of these out of view, performing tasks and running the system).&nbsp; So the first thing I would do is
 just reboot and see if it comes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does come back, you can identify it by opening MSCONFIG program and reseraching the "Startup" tab to find the program that represents it.</p>
