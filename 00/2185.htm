<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. You're paying for Website Tonight, right? Check for a support link, FAQ, forums, etc.</p>
<p>2. While displaying the page, hit Ctrl+F5 to bypass cached versions of the page. Does that change things?</p>
<p>3. Hit F12 to open Developer Tools and validate the HTML. See if validation identifies the problem code.</p>
<p>4. If the site is publicly accessible, post the URL. Someone may spot the problem.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to set all headers and footers in Word to a default font, say Franklin Gothic Book</h2>
                    I've been asked to set all our company PC's to use Franklin Gothic as the default font in Word and&nbsp;Excel, which was easy enough to do, however I've also been requested to set it so that all headers and footers also use Franklin Gothic Book as the default
 font, so any that are already available and any that are created by users automatically use Franklin Gothic Book as the default.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would any care to give me directions on how to set this please.</div>

<p>However, unless the font in those Styles has previously been modified, it should be sufficient to just modify the font in the Normal Style as those Styles are based on the Normal Style.</p>

            Hi Doug,
<div><br />
<div>as you correctly assumed I changed the Font in Normal&nbsp;style&nbsp;to Franklin Gothic Book and then set it as default, however it still appears that for some reason a number of the Header/Footer Templates from the drop down menu are still when selected choosing
 a different font i.e. Cambria.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've got about 50-60 PC's throughout the company and don't fancy having to go round every single one modifying the font in each of the templates for the Header and Footers :(&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If as you say modifying the font in the normal style should do this&nbsp;automatically, I might try resetting all the fonts to Word Default again and then resetting to Franklin Gothic Book again and see if it works this time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks&nbsp;</div>

            <p>The built in Header Footer Templates appear to have had direct format applied to them which takes the place of the default font.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have thought that in a corporate environment, you would be using document templates that already contained the required headers and footers so that individual users would not be&nbsp;making use of the built in&nbsp;Header Footer templates.</p>

    <title>N97 Touch Screen Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rick2804  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 Touch Screen Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my N97 for a year now, and I have another 6 months to go on my contract with T-Mobile before I can upgrade. It can't come soon enough, as far as I'm concerned. It's been a big disappointment and frustration for all the reasons other users have listed
 on here, particularly the slide switch falling off despite my having taken great care of the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the touchscreen seems to be failing. This may or may not have something to do with the ignorant cow who dropped a whole pint of lager on it in a pub beer garden the other week, simply handing me my soaked phone with no word of an apology and walking
 off. I dried it thoroughly right away, and there didn't seem to be any damage. It continued working normally. The next day, though, the touchscreen kept intermittently coming to life (in the way it normally would when you press the menu button), accompanied
 by random vibrations. The menu button wasn't responding when I pressed it. Flipping the keyboard out and back again seemed to return things to normal and the menu key worked again, but it's been doing it intermittently ever since. Some days it behaves itself,
 other days it keeps flashing on, then off again, then back on a few moments later. It's doing it right now as I type this. Very annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, does anyone have any ideas as to how I can stop it doing this that don't involve either smashing it to pieces in frustration or spending a small fortune on getting it repaired? I'm worried that if I go into a Nokia shop and demand a replacement (probably
 wise to leave out the bit about the silly **** dropping the pint on it), they'll simply fob me off with some guff about warranties and expect me to pay an exorbitant repair fee. What are the chances of me going to a Nokia shp, requesting a replacement phone
 and them actually giving me one? Probably not great, but it's worth asking.</p>

<p>Cheers. I installed v.21 (which, it assured me, was the latest upgrade when clearly it isn't) last week through the Nokia Support site, as my phone was still operating on the original firmware. I hoped it might solve the issue, what with the phone being
 effectively wiped before it's updated, but no such luck. Once I'd restored it from my backup, I couldn't find my prefered colour scheme though! The same screen problem persists...</p>

            Your issue is probably liquid damage on the board itself. Basically, the board costs as much as a new phone almost. So no amount of software fixes will do anything. Also, warranties do not cover liquid damage and if so proven that it IS liquid damage,
 you will not get any replacement or free repair.

<p>If helps, the firmware v21 was bad for my N97 too. If it's not a liquid damage you can try to install v.22 and see if it works. Do a hard reset and format the mass storage before install and do another hard reset after install. And do not restore anything
 except your contacts. Then you manually adjust the settings. Don't install any app on phone memory and try no to install lots of apps neither on mass storage (be careful with the memory resident ones). And use a light theme, if you want to change the default
 one. This is the way i finally get an usable phone. I hope you work it out!</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone: Nokia Lumia 830 </p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Mobile </p>
<p>Used to transfer songs: Explorer</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I add songs in my music folder (where every other song is) it does not appear in Groove application.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem didn't occurred in WP 8 {Removable Storage Devices\Kedova lumia v2\Phone\Music}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am kinda regreting upgrading my lumia to WP10, because I have lost voice commands, photo app is crashing and now this.</p>
<p>

<p>Well I can accept not having a voice command and random crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the being unable to add songs is a deal breaker for me. I would rather have WP10 since the support for W8 apps is horrible or non-existent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I would rather resolve the issue with finding added songs in Groove music. <br />

            <p>I would not expect an upgrade installation to find that arrangement for a system reserved partition to be acceptable. When the computer is running whatever is on the other drive, that's one system ... when running the preview build that's on this drive,

            <p>You say you have to keep doing clean installs.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Is this because where you are installing has&nbsp; limited space?</p>
<p>You are dual booting.&nbsp; What do your partitions look like?&nbsp; Having done dual booting in the past I have learned that you need bigger than normal partitions as when you put additional programs or apps on the computer it takes more free space when you update
 as there is a duplication of the programs when Windows.old is created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Early on in this testing I was told that my asking of 20+GB of free space was too much as it only took 10-12GB to install Windows 10.&nbsp; This was if you did a clean install and had no program or apps installed.&nbsp; To do an update now requires 30+GB</p>
<p>One of my test laptops is now at 31.3GB on the System drive (C:\).&nbsp; I also have 70.4GB free space.</p>

<p>I would not expect an upgrade installation to find that arrangement for a system reserved partition to be acceptable. When the computer is running whatever is on the other drive, that's one system ... when running the preview build that's on this drive,
 it's a different system, and I would expect an upgrade install to only look in this drive for the needed system reserved partition and boot information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I'm not a dual boot fan, so I'll defer to those who are to answer further on this.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your input.computer boots fine with this set-up.....</p>
<p>all previous builds loaded fine......been in the insider program since</p>
<p>oct 1st 2014. never experienced something like this before.....have to keep doing clean installs</p>
<p>to get builds loaded. keep hoping the next build will install,but 3 failed now....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Booting was not the issue you said you were concerned about ... you said you wanted to find out why your attempted&nbsp; upgrades were failing. I suggested that you do a clean install again of build 14332 in a manner that would allow the installer to set up a
 normal system reserved partition, which, I believe would allow the next upgrade install to complete. Computers don't run on hope, so that isn't accomplishing anything toward correcting your problem. However, if you are happy to keep doing clean installs for
 every build, then, I'm happy, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my lab, we would definitely pursue the issue to correction, and I thought you were saying that's what you wanted to do.</p>

            <p>Windows Phone supports live streaming (apps like Netflix have no problem with it!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is that WP doesn't support whatever streaming method(s) MLB is currently using for their Android and iOS apps, and doesn't want to expend the effort into their WP app until the userbase is large enough make the investment worthwhile to MLB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, it's the old chicken/egg problem.&nbsp; MLB has no incentive investing resources into&nbsp;improving their&nbsp;WP app until enough of us pony up our $15 (or whatever it costs this year) but users don't want to buy an app with a fraction of the features other platforms
 offer for the same price.</p>

            This is a Message bank or voice mail setting not a phone specific setting.<br />
<br />
But anyway. Go to tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Phone-&gt;Call Divert-&gt;Voice Calls<br />
<br />
In here you can check the status of the Call divert. For example, Scroll down to "If Not Answered", then select Options-&gt;Check Status<br />
<br />
It should say "Active for: Voice Calls" if you hit details it should give a number (of your voicemail or network number) and a delay in seconds, in my case 15s<br />
<br />
This means that my phone is set up to Divert all calls if they are not answered within 15 seconds to my voice mail.<br />
<br />
To change the setting, just select Options_&gt;activate then select To voicemail, and then select the time, Select a LONGER time than you currently have.<br />
<br />
All these settings are normally network settings and the operator can change them they are not residing in the phone.

                    I've created a excel workbook on my excel for PC.&nbsp; Everything works fine.&nbsp; But when my co-workers open it up in Excel for Mac they get a spinning wheel every time they maneuver to a different tab or enter data.&nbsp; We are all on Office 365 and have the latest
 updates.&nbsp; I do not use macros and I do not have any volatile functions in my workbook.&nbsp; I'm at a lost as to why this would be happening.

<h3> jeepeenl  say:</h3>
<h2>            The &#34;Due in&#34; time in a reminder displays the wrong time</h2>
                    
<p>The reminder popup in my Outlook 2007 always displays the wrong due time. For example, when I create a task with a due time of 10:00 am, then the reminder pops up at the correct time, however, the reminder displays that the task is due in 6 hours. This is
 a 6 hour difference!</p>
<p>This seems to be related to my second time zone setting in Outlook 2007 under options » calendar options » time zone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows time zone is set to UTC+1 (Amsterdam) </li><li>Additional time UTC -5 (EST) </li></ul>
<p>So here you have the 6 hours difference.</p>
<p>There is no change when I disable the second time zone (and restart Outlook). However, when I change the second time zone to be the same as the windows time zone (UTC+1), the reminder displays due in 12 hours!</p>
<p>I have found several posts on the internet about the same issue but non of them provide a resolution and non of them are posted on a Microsoft site (at least I did not find them).</p>
<p>How can I resolve this?</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

            It's not a bug and if you are looking for a way to go back to the old way, there is no "resolution" - its the new way the reminder works. Tasks are due at the end of the business day - the reminder is just a reminder, not a 'due now' alert. If you want
 to use it as a 'due now' alert, do the tasks as soon as the reminder fires then dismiss it. Otherwise, ignore the 'due in' time.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.outlook-tips.net/archives/2009/20090623.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.outlook-tips.net/archives/2009/20090623.htm</a>)

    <title>Duplex printing of pages smaller than A4 but on A4 paper - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickdunc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplex printing of pages smaller than A4 but on A4 paper</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of pages that I am replacing in a book, using scans.</p>
<p>The page sizes are approx 13cm by 9cm.</p>
<p>In order to get my printer to feed reliably I feel I ought to use A4 paper. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This leaves me with a problem &nbsp;and a challenge:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem</p>
<p>i) setting up a document in which the two sides are aligned on both sides but I have potentially 4 sides on each side of A4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge.</p>
<p>i) In an ideal world I would create a layout that enables groups of 4 double sided printouts to be &nbsp;nested to make a section of the book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can visualise this: the central gap in the middle would be a gutter &nbsp;with two double pages (top and bottom) on each side.</p>
<p>There is no need for page numbering, it is simply a matter of managing images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any advice.</p>

            <p>Dear Elemental,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to clarify.</p>
<p>If you can imagine a duplex printed A5 page as it would be printed for inclusion in a booklet, the nominal layout is side 1: LHS p4 RHS p1 side 2: LHS p2 RHS p3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The intention is that the page may be folded and cropped to put in the book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The additional &nbsp;question is whether it is possible to have this layout duplicated on the larger format paper so instead of side one and two (and subsequent) being divided into 2 cells with a central gutter, it is divided into four.</p>
<p>This will make it easier to print and ensure alignment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is a bit clearer.</p>
<p>Best&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nick</p>

<h2>            Does Word for Mac support Thai language formatting&#63;</h2>
                    I often create document in Thai but I found it is very disturbing when I have to finish the document. Word seems not recognise Thai sentences so every sentence break after space between phrases but there's more space left in that line.&nbsp;

            <p>No. &nbsp;Check again when the next version of Word for Mac is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you will find that Office 365 (the online version) supports all the languages that PC Word supports, albeit with lower capability. &nbsp;The desktop version of Office 365 on the Mac is currently Office 2011, so no Thai there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unrealistic to expect more languages to be added to Office 2011. &nbsp;A "language" is a major piece of work, and will not be added outside of a version upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, we have no idea what is in Office Next for Mac. &nbsp;Those who know are not allowed to tell us. &nbsp;Those who tell us, don't know.</p>

 the sender's address are copied to a particular folder and then deleted.&nbsp; I have set it to "this machine only" because I also read my emails on my iphone.&nbsp; Any suggestions as to why it won't work?&nbsp; Many thanks.

            Thank you for hanging in there with me ... :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; I changed it, removed "this machine only" ... made no difference.&nbsp; I then removed the subfolders from the eBay folder in case that was causing the problem, but still it wouldn't work!&nbsp; Finally I removed
 the alternatives, ie with "eBay" or "PayPal" or "Auctiva" in the sender's address and put just "eBay"&nbsp;... bingo! It worked.&nbsp; In the past, on my previous laptops, I bunched them together as above, with complete success, but it doesn't seem to like it any more.&nbsp;
 Perhaps I will just have to do separate rules, which is a pain, but it is a fix for me at least.&nbsp; I really appreciate everyone's time and effort on this and would still welcome a suggestion as to why it would not accept all three alternatives - presumably
 the way I have entered it ...?&nbsp; Thanks again.&nbsp; Trish

<p>My Sprint HTC Touch runs Mobile 6.1 and will not send emails from any of my POP accounts. I have installed the Microsoft Hotfix (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=d9d71b2e-d2dd-44f2-86e5-1e53aad7fb7a&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=d9d71b2e-d2dd-44f2-86e5-1e53aad7fb7a&amp;displaylang=en</a>)
 and it still doesn't work. Microsoft has a major problem here and so far, has not been able to resolve this issue!</p>
<p>Am I the only one who still has this problem? Does anyone have a real solution?</p>

There is a known issue with POP email and the hotfix put out by Microsoft has no effect at all, I haven't been able to send an email from my phone since November.<br />

    <title>Data Validation error - dependent drop down list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Data Validation error - dependent drop down list</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to create a dependent drop down list that uses a formula to extract data from a table in a separate document. The list I'm attempting to create is based on an initial drop down list with source data (company names) that have been hard-entered
 into the source box of the data validation tool. The second list attempts to return a list of contacts for the company selected in the first drop down list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula I'm using is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=OFFSET(Customer_Database_Test.xlsx!Table1[[#Headers],[Contact]],MATCH($C$1,Customer_Database_Test.xlsx!Nickname,0),0,COUNTIF(Customer_Database_Test.xlsx!Nickname,$C$1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press F9 inside this formula, it returns data exactly as expected, providing this response for "ABC" (in this example, "ABC" is the customer selected in the first drop down list):</p>
<p>
</p><p>={"Jane D";"John D";"Bill D";"Paula D"}</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs when I past the formula into the source box of the data validation tool. I receive this message: "There's a problem with this formula...."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's more detail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using two separate Excel documents. The first is a table that serves as a customer database and lists multiple customer contacts.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/051f0bd6-fdea-4656-be07-0e6376d75ea0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/051f0bd6-fdea-4656-be07-0e6376d75ea0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The second document is attempting to create a drop down list of contacts depending on the customer selected in the first drop down list.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c82a309-4cc6-493e-8756-d478da103d84?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c82a309-4cc6-493e-8756-d478da103d84?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>For the second drop down list, I'm attempting to use the formula that I confirmed is returning the proper data as described in my initial post.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18f344dd-8880-40ec-a044-ccd26f04a35b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18f344dd-8880-40ec-a044-ccd26f04a35b?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>I'm not sure what other method I could use to return the values that I need. Ultimately, my goal is to use this database to feed other worksheets, too, in a similar way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I can fix this problem?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, Jason. I don't think that method will work for my particular situation. Maybe a bit more explanation is required.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The second document is attempting to create a drop down list of contacts depending on the customer selected in the first drop down list.</p>
<p>

<p>I had the same issue, with the same error.</p>
<p>Turns out that the Data Validation window doesn't like it when you use named tables - I converted all my "Format as Table" tables back to ranges (using Convert to Range), and the error disappeared. Who knew!</p>
<p>

            Thanks, Daniel, for the thought. When I make that switch, I now get this error message: "This type of reference cannot be used in a Data Validation formula." I don't believe that's true, but I can't seem to make it work. Crazy.<br />

FWIW none of that site's Cookies showed up in the TIF viewer (Alt-T,O,Alt-T,S,V). &nbsp;In order to see the Cookies that were presented when I visited it I had to&nbsp; Run...&nbsp; shell:Cookies&nbsp; and then navigate to its subdirectory,&nbsp; Low.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then 3 Google cookies could
 be&nbsp;seen in View Details and sorting by Date Accessed (which BTW may not be a default column).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
More satisfyingly IMO I can see the same ones&nbsp;by capturing that path from the Explorer window's Address bar (Alt-d,Ctrl-c), switching to a cmd window and switching to that directory (type cd /d then right-click, Paste and Enter); then finally entering&nbsp; dir/ta/od
 *googl*.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those can be compared with&nbsp;what is listed when&nbsp; dir/tw/od *googl*&nbsp; is entered instead.&nbsp; Sometimes the source of your problem symptom is the fact that the date&nbsp;written for a cookie is less than the date accessed.&nbsp; E.g. that could mean that you were
 presenting incompatible cookie information to the site which would account for the problem symptom.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately&nbsp;neither of those diagnostics&nbsp;show you the URL that the Cookie&nbsp;is associated with.&nbsp; You would have to use the index.dat to discover that exactly; however, you may also be able to get a clue about them using the Privacy Report (Alt-V,v)<br />

            Hi KristenCook,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Sign in to the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services</a> page with the Microsoft account associated with your Office 365 subscription
<br />
<br />2. Look for the Cancel link or Expires on date.

<h2>            Best way to create a site</h2>
                    
<p><span>We are a construction company and have just began the transition to using Office 365 and Sharepoint.&nbsp; Am new with this environment and have found there is a lot to learn to
 make it work efficiently and effectively.&nbsp; We have 20 clients split between four departments in the office and then several working foremen who have remot access.&nbsp; A workflow would begin at estimating a job.&nbsp; If successful, a project manager is appointed and
 the task of submittals begins.&nbsp; Once the job is manned and working, the manager gathers daily reports, processes change orders etc and the accounting department does billing and payroll.&nbsp; After completion, the job goes through a close-out stage.</span></p>
<p><span>Currently all of our projects are stored in a folder structure for each job on an AD server.&nbsp; In Sharepoint, I have begun with a landing page and 4 sub-sites to correspond with
 the above mentioned major tasks.&nbsp; We wish for some form of list / task??? in each job to display current progression of the submittal process, change order process and job completion for the project managers.&nbsp; Each of the jobs would then report back to a central
 management site for the big bosses to review.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Would it be best to keep all the related files in a job folder structure in a Sharepoint library or can it be accomplished with the same results by storing them in Onedrive
 for Business?&nbsp; I have a couple of books which explain the functionality of the different items in Sharepoint such as lists, tasks, libraries etc., but no real direction to follow in the best method for creating our site.&nbsp; I have also visited a few of the youtube
 presentations and both are helpful but still lacking some general direction.&nbsp; Any ideas, texts, advice would be most helpful.<br />
</span></p>

<p>Hi Jon,<br />
<br />
Firstly, I'd like to introduce OneDrive for Business. It's personal site in the Office portal, users can upload files to the library in this personal sites and share the files to others. We can use the OneDrive for Business sync client to sync these cloud files
 to our local drive. After syncing, the files in the cloud and synced folder are connected, all the changes will synced to each side. OneDrive for Business personal site can be used to save the files for a user himself.<br />
<br />
Team site library is normally used for the organization. Members in the tenant who have permission in this library can work together with the files in it. In addition the cloud files in team site library can also be synced to local drive with OneDrive for Business
 sync client. &nbsp;<br />
Note: Permission is very important in SharePoint Online and SharePoint Online team site. To learn more, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Understanding-permission-levels-87ecbb0e-6550-491a-8826-c075e4859848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Understanding permission levels</a>.<br />
<br />
For your requirement, you can create a workflow for a list with SharePoint Designer 2013. Every step, you can assign task to specific user and the status for the workflow will display in the list (the task can be approval, review and so on). Here is an article
 for your reference: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj554671.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Creating a workflow by using SharePoint Designer 2013 and the SharePoint 2013 Workflow platform</a>.<br />
<br />
Moreover, to get more support for workflow customization, you can post threads with your detailed requirement in our
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=sharepoint&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint MSDN forum</a>. It's a specific channel that handles SharePoint workflow customization related questions.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>Thanks Tim, appreciate the input. &nbsp;This is pretty much our first foray into Sharepoint. &nbsp;I am familiar with database programming, but haven't done much with this sort of thing... just not enough time in the day. &nbsp;Installed Designer and have started taking
 a look at how it works but am still familiarizing myself with the ins &amp; outs of Sharepoint.</p>
