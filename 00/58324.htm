<p>Lots of people still played this game last time I checked, I would definitely recommend it and the DLC, Undead Nightmare pack is (at the very least) in the top 5 best DLC's ever.</p>

<p>Yes, many people still play the game but there is a huge skill curve. One end is the new people who only play online for a week or two and their gone. The other end is the hardcore players who been playing this game since release and can headshot like nobody's
 business. Then there are a few casual players who doesn't play so hardcore. So it'll be good to get in with the hardcore/casual players so you can have a better experience.
</p>
<p>If you only want to play multiplayer with all of the add-on then you should but the Retail disk of Undead Nightmare. It has everything except the original single player.

<p>the campaign is one of the best ever!! it will keep you busy for a long long time if you do all the missions. it starts a little slow but once you get going there is so much to do. this won game of the year mostly on the single play campaign. the multiplay
 is very good too. its just different than most shooters. this game gives you more bang for your buck than most any other game out there.</p>

<p>I've borrowed this off a friend. And I think it's brilliant. At the mo, I can only play it in small doses as I'm not quite fully "into it" yet...(and I now have Fallout: NV, which I also recommend!) but when I have played it I've really enjoyed it. The above
 poster is right about it being slow to start but I'm confident when I get passed that I will completely embrace the game and it may prove to be one of my favorites!</p>

<p>The game is great, and Im sure you will not be disappointed in it. The Undead Nightmare DLC is a must, but I recommend getting the pack for a little more MS points but comes with Liars &amp; Cheats, and another one that I cant recall off the top of my head.
 The Undead Overrun in multi-player is mega cool, lots of fun</p>

<p>This really is a fabulous game. &nbsp;I finished the single player campaign in February and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. &nbsp;In my opinion, a much more enjoyable game than GTAIV which I found a little dull to be honest.</p>
<p>I completed the Undead Nightmare DLC earlier this week. &nbsp;A different experience than the main campaign, this isn't as deep, and more repetitive, although as this is DLC, I think this is as you would expect.</p>
<p>I've not really bothered with the multiplayer side, so can't comment.</p>
<p>As you can pick the game up pretty cheaply now, and the DLC is just 800MSP, you wouldn't be disappointed.</p>

<p>It's worth playin just for story mode but I'm not to impressed with online mode any more. There not as many people on as it as use to be but all the dlc are out so it's pretty much ran it's course for the old players but is well worth getting, I think xbox

<p>I have an Xbox One X hooked up to my LG 55 C7. Picture looks great, HDR looks great, everything is amazing..... however, randomly the screen will go black, start to flash a really ugly static screen for a split second in-and-out for about 10 seconds, until the screen goes black for good and the screen says it doesn't detect any input. I have to unplug and replug the HDMI in order to recover video. There is no sound either when this happens if that is important to know. I spoke to Xbox One support, they didn't have any idea. I have an open conversation with LG support, no luck yet. I have tried multiple HDMI cables with no luck (cables are fully supported of most recent HDMI 2.0b tech). Tried multiple input ports with no luck. I've made sure both devices are fully updated, didn't help. Tried adjusting every 4K related setting I can find within the Xbox system and LG system, no luck. Tried running with HDR Deep Color off, didn't help. I thought there might be something with HDR compatibility since (based on 

<p>Sorry, I don't have any videos or pictures, the issue is so random it's hard to capture the issue in action.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Can anyone provide any insight? This is driving me crazy and it's making the one device that can fully use the OLEDs capabilities darn near unplayable. Thanks for any help!</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Finally made the switch and upgraded to xbox one x. I have a regular xbox one and a pc with a 1080ti. Had no issues with any and no issues PC @4k. Also a PS4 slim, not pro, but still pops that HDR logo....</p>
<p>No matter what i do now i have to turn on xbox, the menu loads no issue, launch a game. Wait for the splash screen to go away then input signal loss. At that time i go to TV settings turn off UHD deep color then turn it back on again. Once done the game
 screen input returns and is fine and plays fine without crashing. If i load the home screen its fine, but if i swap or load any other games i have to switch off and back on again the UHD setting. Didnt have this issue with my PC at 4k and didnt have it when
 RDR2 popped the HDR logo with my PS4 slim????</p>
<p>I see your issue is similar and how old so im not holding my breath with all ive read. This seems to be an issue between both the lg OS ans xbox via HDMI. Broken handshake of sorts...anyone have more info post here!?!!!</p>
<p>With these tvs ive always taken notice to content that makes that HDR logo pop. Its never happened with my xbox one x. Somehow the PS4 slim, not pro, even does it with RDR2 and Spiderman???</p>
<p>I didnt have the UHD setting turned on with the input i was using for the regular xbox. At this point now i have to mess with the UHD switch every time i load games 4K or 1080!?&nbsp;</p>

 which may not be the greatest), the C7 OLED is native Dolby Vision and back compatible with HDR10. The Xbox One X only supports HDR10 and I know there have been some documented issues with the LG OLEDs and HDR compatibility. I have seen some threads here and
 there about input loss with the OLED when switching from HDR to SDR, but this happens randomly, even when not switching display modes.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about that issue, a friend of mine has the issue too a while ago, its solved by putting manual settings in the TV details not using any automatic settings for resolution or any details put the real value. Also be sure to be connected on the ARC hdmi
 tv port.</p>

<p>
<span>If you've forgotten your Windows password and you're on a domain, you should contact your system administrator to reset your password. If you're on a workgroup (most home users are on a workgroup),
 you can reset your password by using a password reset disk or by using an administrator account.</span></p>

    <title>Choosing between built-in speakers and plugged 3.5mm headphones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lovrosipovac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Choosing between built-in speakers and plugged 3.5mm headphones</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the latest official version of Win10, build 1903, but as far as I remember, this problem exists for a long time.<br />
<br />
So, Whenever I plug in my headphones in 3.5mm jack, it automatically switches to them without any possibility of selecting my laptop built-in speakers instead. The only option to get sound from speakers again is to un-plug the headphones.<br />
<br />
The problem is that for the system, the difference is practically undistinguishable. Both when using speakers or headphones the audio device is identical, which is: Speakers (Realtek HD Audio), and there is no visual marking that the sound is outputed through
 3.5mm jack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to have my headphones plugged in all the time with the possibility to select speakers or headphones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do that?</p>

            Hi LOVROSIPOVAC<br /><br />I am an independent advisor here to help<br /><br />Likely, they are both labeled as realtek audio because the internal speakers and the 3.5 mm Jack are both handled through the same internal sound card.<br /><br />When you are looking at your sound options in the Windows settings do you see 2 different listings for the realtek audio? if you do it may just be a matter of trying one and disabling it and seeing which one of the two becomes disabled until you figure out which is which unfortunately

            Hi James,<br />
<br />
That's my problem in a nutshell! There's only one listing for realtek audio! No matter if I have headphones plugged or not! Sure, if I had external speakers on SPDIF for example it would be easy just changing device, but not when they both use the same!

            Thanks, but no. I wrote that they're using the same output, and it's not distingishable, it's still on speakers technically when 3.5mm plugged in

            I understand<br /><br />I have been trying since my first response to locate a relaible source for the Realtek HD Audio manager application. It used to allow for distinguishing between the two audio sources as you are looking to do.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though I cannot yet seem to find a source for this application for you. Perhaps it has been deprecated by it's developer, I am not sure.

Yeah, it sucks big time, that Windows/Realtek can't implement so extremely trivial and obvious.<br />
<br />
I'll just wait for the official answer then, maybe they'll have some solution

            hi Lovro.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Download Realtek HD Audio Mgr. here:
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/download-reinstall-realtek-hd-audio-manager-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/download-reinsta...</a>
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for headset problems so at least something will work.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by here to help:
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/fix-headphones-not-working-windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.maketecheasier.com/fix-headphones-n...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sounds Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected and Connected for both Playback and Recording Default Devices.
<br />
<br />If not again right click Volume icon in System Tray to choose Troubleshoot sound problems.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:   
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>. 
<br />
<br />To chck over the integrity of your install go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Cant install nvidia drivers and open nvidia geforce experience anymore &#33;</h2>
                    Hello , yesterday i was notified by geforce experience about a new driver , and i decided to install it , it failed many times , and after a restart on my pc , i was not even able to open nvidia gefroce experience&nbsp; , even with admin rights , it gave me
 an error like this&nbsp; -&nbsp;something went wrong try restarting nvidia geforce experience - , i restarted the laptop many times , but still got that error , and i cant even open it . I think this is happening because windows update installs drivers automatically
 , and these drivers may be corrupt , because microsoft , and also i have a bug with my intel drivers , which reverts the brightness from 100% to 50% after each restart . What can i do to solve this issue and block windows update from installing corrupt drivers
 ? I can used Device driver uninnstaller , probably , please help me guys !

            Hi Marinel, 
<br />
<br />Let’s try the easiest thing first:
<br />
<br />Click on Start - and type "control panel" and click on it
<br />
<br />Once open, search "recovery" and hit enter. When it comes up, click on recovery. 
<br />
<br />On the next page, open "open system restore" 
<br />
<br />They'll be a box that says "click for more restore points" that I would click. Choose a restore point (before this happened), and follow the prompts. 
<br />
<br />Give this a shot and see if you can get into your nvidia GeForce experience. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            Before I give steps, I would request you to provide following information -
<br />
<br />Which browser will you be using? This extension doesn't go very well with Edge / IE. Best browsers are Chrome and Firefox to work with rapport.
<br />
<br />Does this help page serve the purpose?

<p>I suggest you manually backup your personal files and do a custom clean install of Windows 7 Professional. The reason you can't upgrade is because they are not logical upgrade paths.</p>
<p>Upgrade paths:<br />
When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. In your case, you can upgrade to Windows 7 depending on edition and architecture of Windows Vista
 you have installed. If you are running a 32 bit version of Vista and want to upgrade to a 64 bit version (edition of Windows 7), you will have to a do clean install, this applies vice-versa.<br />
<br />
If you are running consumer editions of Windows Vista such as Home Basic or Premium, you can only upgrade to either Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. Also, you cannot do downgrades, which means, if you are running Windows Vista Ultimate now, you cannot downgrade
 to Windows 7 Home Premium. You must do logical upgrades:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista Home Basic &gt; Windows 7 Home Basic, Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Business &gt; Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Enterprise &gt; Windows 7 Enterprise<br />
Windows Vista Ultimate &gt; Windows 7 Ultimate</p>

<h2>            When I boot my computer, desktop icons on the wrong monitor.</h2>
                    <p>After losing power and internet during hurricane Irma for a couple of days, now when I boot my computer, desktop icons on the wrong monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 2 monitor setup, of course for no apparent reason the wrong one is always monitor 1, even though I added it after setting up windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my main monitor set as "Primary"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been working properly for months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ONE and ONLY one user account and it is my MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have moved my icons back to my primary desktop several times and at EVERY reboot they go back to the wrong monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System specs in signature.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: </strong>How do I get my icons back to their proper place and get them to STAY there??</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;Hey Desiree, thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I actually solved my issue last night by downloading an app called DesktopOk_x64, I set it to auto save icon locations and save on the "By Windows Shutdown" setting, and now it's working again.&nbsp; Found this on a Bing search.&nbsp; Apparently some anti virus programs
 can cause this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I did not try booting into safe mode, I didn't think about that I'll try that next time if it happens again, nor did I change any display settings, I did check them to make sure nothing changed during the power outage. But everything looked ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It's very strange, both of my monitors are the exact same resolution but they are clearly different monitors and the monitor arrangement didn't change. It could be that a program was running at the time of the power loss. I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll report back if it happens again, thanks again for your time.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That is normal. Unless you are specifically uploading files (sending to some where) the received<br />
will always be greater than the sent.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<h2>            Quick fix for random game drops and lag</h2>
                    
<p><span>you can defrag by holding both the left bumper and right bumper down at same time and press the Y button. (Do this only while at the news screen)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is a miner fix of lag and sponing into battle late. The other quik fix is game client (sometimes doing update after update the client can get corrupted) this can cause a wide range of problems. To fix go to SETTINGS then
 SYSTEM then STORAGE then HARD DRIVE then GAMES highlight WOT press Y choose DELETE. &nbsp;You want to delete the WOT game and all other WOT files.(don't worry about loosing any of your tanks or progress or gold because its all saved with WG) Now re-download the
 game in your download history located in SETTINGS then ACCOUNT INFORMATION click on Download History find WOT360 re-download (don't forget to turn off your Xbox and on again before you launch the game) and your ready to roll out. See you on the battlefield.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Wilyums, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the many reasons that you get the error message are missing or corrupted system files. So we suggest to run the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files:
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1. Type cmd in the search box &gt; select Command Prompt.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2. Type sfc /scannow.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3. Restart your computer and try to install the Update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, you can download the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thanks for the try...</p>
<p>No luck so far with this suite of suggestions.</p>
<p>Have also tried: Rebooting in Safe Mode, with the same lack of success.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is somehow related, but sometimes, when starting Google Chrome from the Shortcut, the system hangs up for a few minutes while it is "Processing Request". &nbsp;This doesn't happen EVERY time, but often. &nbsp;A few minutes is a LONG time as I have
 an i7 processor, 16g and SSD hard-drive</p>
<p>And, I've had the occasional "explorer.exe" error while shutting down.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>Hello ive had this issue with the anniversary update.</p>
<p>Ive now fixed my issue, it has taken me weeks as my system was fine before the update , but wouldnt accept the update correctly.</p>
<p>I changed my settings in the bios to make my ide and sata controller to ide / rather than the ahci it was set to , the update then went ahead without any issues and didnt take very long to do either :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>this may or may not be your issue too</p>
<p>i too have an ssd drive as main boot , trouble is i cannot go back to ahci , but who cares it works lol</p>

            <p>Hi UKHatcher, </p>
<p>Thanks for that idea. &nbsp;I've not tried it as I have been successful (so far as it appears now) in another strategy:</p>
<p>I downloaded the "Media Creation Tool" for Windows, selected the "Upgrade your PC" option and it reinstalled a fresh version of Windows 10 (all without losing apps, programs, or files). &nbsp;This was the last-resort strategy that I'd applied to my wife's computer
 earlier this year when she was having Windows freeze-up issues. &nbsp;In that case a Sysnative rep had helped me through a rigorous process of system repairs before we had to resort to the fresh install. &nbsp;I used much of the same strategy in restoring my PC.</p>
<p>So, the Media Creation Tool has worked on different issues twice now - and flawlessly it would seem...</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

            <p>Hi Always trying to learn so I can pass it on. I think you are saying you used the first option"Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10"</p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong! Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi garybear89,</p>
<p>Yes, as odd as it seems, after clicking on "Download Tool Now" and launching it, the system update tool will install a new Windows 10 in your system without disrupting the files, apps and programs already in place. &nbsp;I'm not sure why that caveat isn't more
 clearly stated in the description, as it has saved TWO of my family computers a boatload of time fruitlessly trying to fix errors that had rendered ineffective the capacity of the PC to update Windows.</p>
<p>Having said that, I would NOT have pushed that download button if I hadn't received the advice to do so from a third party (the folks at Sysnative). &nbsp;I have a couple of older programs on the PC (MS Money Plus being one of them) that aren't supported by Windows
 10 and were difficult to get to install when I first made the switch. &nbsp;I didn't want that hassle of reinstalling. &nbsp;So "Upgrade your PC" was a bit of a hope-and-see at first. &nbsp;But, once you download and launch, you have the option of saving all files, programs
 and apps. &nbsp;This has been successful - twice now.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I DID back up my files before trying this - just in case. &nbsp;It wasn't needed)</p>

            <p>Hi! Thanks for your very helpful reply. It will help others. Having done this with success and knowing what to expect, you need to join me on threads where the OP is having problems installing updates. Getting the updates to install is the biggest problem
 W10 is having. You will always be welcome on threads where I'm helping with update problems.</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. You just made this old country boys day. You are appreciated!</p>
<p>I always like to preach about creating a back up image with a 3rd party image program like Macrium Reflect. You will be fearless knowing you have a image that will take you back just like the day you created the image. The media creation tool is good, but
 the back up image is better IMHO!</p>
<p>Gary!</p>
<p>PS I'll see you on the next thread where a member needs help with updates! Team work is a good thing and makes the job easier.</p>

<h2>            RISE OF NATIONS - DOESN&#39;T WORK ON WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello to all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been annoyed lately at the tendency for old games, old gamers who like old games, to be written out of history and conversation simply due to compatibility issues.&nbsp; Not sure how modern computers can't be smart enough to withstand older applications,
 to figure out their code with barely any effort.&nbsp; Guess we haven't quite made it to Star Trek universe, huh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a legit physical copy of Rise of Nations (2006) and it's having trouble working with Windows 10.&nbsp; The menu comes up with the music, click play and the game oscifies.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Can the really smart folks at Microsoft or within the community help
 at least guide me in the right direction with regards to which files to alter?&nbsp; Is it a resolution problem?&nbsp; Everytime people write about this game and related problems it is a downloaded version through Steam.&nbsp; Has anyone had any success with this game via
 physical CD on Windows 10?&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Static sounds from headphone jack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> money_rooney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Static sounds from headphone jack</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using HP Omni 10 with Windows 8.1 update 1 installed. My problem is whenever i plug in my earphones (regardless model and make) i heard static sounds frequently whether i am typing using touch keyboard or playing music or watching video etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to add to this. These static sounds are sometimes so high pitched that it can make someone deaf or give a big headache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My audio drivers are all latest and updated. Below are the tech specs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel SST Audio Device (WDM)</p>
<p>Realtek I2S Audio Codec</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any good help is greatly appreciated. Please do not offer some roll back changes or uninstallations which are found on every tech questions. If it really solves the problem i would be happy to follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus i dont think that this is a device problem but i can be wrong here. Do let me know ASAP.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you get very loud static sound on your earphones while typing or playing music or watching video.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Killed My Tablet Batter - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Killed My Tablet Batter</h2>
                    <p>Hey all. I really really really hope someone can help me because I am not rich and cannot afford to lose my tablet thought I would do anything for a Surface Pro 3,&nbsp;it is just a bad dream, even a Surface 3 I would take to use for school but, just a dream.
 I need my tablet back really bad. I've supporting and have spent so much on MSFT products, myself and entire family are all MSFT, and I probably promote and sell more MSFT products than their actual store MSFT page. I probably sell and push more than the employees
 of the entire MSFT store combined, not even joking it actually makes my family sick sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I installed build 9926 of the W10TP when it launched and I knew MSFT did expect people to use tablets because the TP had a tablet mode. After installing, wow my battery was just gone. I would charge it overnight only to have like 22% the next morning,
 I'd use it for LESS than 10 minutes and no joke the thing would be dead. I had windows 8.1 on the system right before and used this tablet daily for school and work and it would last the entire day give or take without a charge... We're talking 10 minutes
 here which is just really really bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I figured that this was expected and still gave the TP a 5 out of 5 star rating because for one it was a TP, for two it was rather beautiful and awesome and it fixed the windows 8.1 memory eating problem where I would install nothing and go from 12GB
 to practically 0 somehow and with W10TP I did get to keep ALL GB and actually use them, and three because a new build would be coming any time now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well fast forward to now where we are at like 10130 or something and has the battery issue been fixed? Nope! I've even freshed installed with the ISO instead of doing upgrades. I have the - Dell Venue 8 Pro - and I did check dell for any firmware or hardware
 updates and I did do as many as possible with no success. I would LOVE to be able to roll back to 8.1 even though I'd have to deal with the memory issue which makes the tablet useless for downloading apps after 12 hours of a fresh format which would leave
 me stuck with what I was able to download in the time period, but I can still use browsing and all office features if downloaded in time for school and work. BUT. And this is a HUGE disappointing but. All of a sudden, the 8.1 install wizard that I would use
 from my purchased copy from the MSFT store was now saying that I have no internet connection, it says this while I'm surfing the web looking for a solution so clearly it is not a connection issue and even more is that this wizard now says this on EVERY PC
 and laptop that I have... Work, home, tablet, doesn't matter I can no longer install windows 8.1 which is a huge bummer after being such a supporter and promoter of MSFT. I have to hide this from everyone or they will laugh at me with how highly I speak of
 MSFT and their products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I was able to get MSFT finally to send my the discs for free but I had to pay the $150 first and tie up the money for a couple weeks before getting it refunded which really sucked because I can barely feed myself right now, I feed stray and starving
 cats before myself as well because I can understand and they cannot... And MSFT can use Surface Pro 3's to wipe their bootey and then throw&nbsp; them away after each use like they are nothing so idk that kind of rubbed me the wrong way and was pretty upset about
 that because it was hard yet I needed a copy of 8.1 that I had already bought and earned. Problem is that I cannot install 8.1 from discs onto a tablet so my problem still persists and it is a really hard hit...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do can anyone help please? :'(</p>

            <p>It's not easy to discern what your issue is because you've loaded your post with a great deal of irrelevant information.&nbsp; First, you should not have installed the Insider preview if you were not prepared to deal with the unpredictability of a beta operating
 system.&nbsp; You proceeded despite explicit warnings to not use the preview on your everyday PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should especially not have installed it on a tablet for which drivers might be an issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are now, I take it, trying to install 8.1 from discs provided by Microsoft.&nbsp; What you should do, imo, is get installation media from Dell so that the tablet can be restored to its original state.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for your attempt to help but you are not being helpful at all. I'm not sure why you are concerned with irrelevant information which isn't even information but more small talk instead. This is a support and discussion forum. Any person can understand
 the issue clearly from just a few of the sentences. I did clearly state that I rated the build 5 out of 5 stars because I understood that it was a technical preview. I also did state that with there being a tablet mode, I never expected a battery issue and
 especially one to follow through for 5 builds or however. I also did clearly state that just because I may not be as fortunate as everyone else to have a device fo each different day of the week and I did want to participate and give feedback with everyone
 else who can, as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first paragraph sheds light on who I am as am extreme Microsoft fan and why the desire would be strong enough to participate. The fact that I have and promote all aspects of Microsoft products shows reason to why I should want to support and give feedback
 on their next huge product which will turn three platforms into one. I also used the TP on desktops to gauge the stability for trial with a tablet before jumping the gun, there's no way to foresee a mobile battery issue when laptops are fine in that aspect
 when off the charger and mobile, perhaps more irrelevant information would have been relevant to you to have made it easier to discern or understand this? I usually suggest reading twice helps. Also you must consider that feedback on this issue would be necessary’s
 that’s the whole point of Microsoft doing this. I also feel that you overlooked a key understanding of the memory issue in 8.1 on a 32gb tablet to also have been considered in the TP trial when all desktop and laptop trials showed stable enough builds and
 I did clearly state how the memory issue was no longer an issue with Microsofts following operating system… Before you get onto me about the 8.1 memory issue, I have not given enough relevant information on it as that was already discussed long ago for months
 with Microsoft’s development teams and myself with no solution being found except that they know how to avoid it the next time. Because the memory issue is not an issue in windows 10, that does make it quite relevant information or feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on the subject of dell… They will give purchased installation media but you do realize tablets can only use files, no discs or media, which makes your solution irrelevant. Now, I bought a copy of Microsoft’s latest operating system in which they provide
 a wizard and downloading of the files to install. With that being their main way aside from installation media, i.e. discs, the failure of that wizard is a pretty big deal when Microsoft has no solution to fix it except using discs although an file, i.e. ISO,
 would actually be a pretty good solution to that issue instead of wasting materials on manufacturing discs, W10TP has good success with using an ISO over media or a wizard. I can wait for windows 10 to be launched and automatically upgraded as Microsoft is
 doing this without installation media, but the wizard failing is a pretty relevant issue Microsoft should have an easy way of handling than having a customer pay twice and refunding down the road, resources must be used on representatives to troubleshoot,
 call back, follow up, send discs and the cost of it, when a few clicks can mass produce ISO’s.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Again, I appreciate your attempt to help though a little offensive but I feel that if you may have connected some dots and used some of that “irrelevant” information, you would have had an easier time discerning how rich the post was of feedback while overlooking
 a person’s desire to have a surface and to not have to be charged for an issue that isn’t his own when Microsoft can easily afford it. If you do want to help then great but I need to argue with some fancy insults, please help elsewhere when you can.</p>

            Daniel, you have now posted over 2000 words (combined) and still the essence of your problem isn't clear.&nbsp; Many of us here try to help as many people as we can, and it becomes a very daunting task when faced with a huge block of text, most of which has
 no bearing on the problem.&nbsp; If you could be just a tad more succinct in explaining what you need help with, you will assuredly get the help you need.&nbsp;

            <p>Daniel/Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only briefly skimmed Daniel's post and I understood the problem right away. Maybe that's because he included the essence of it in his subject line, typo aside. Win 10 killed his battery! I do not doubt him because I have an HP Spectre 360, a month old
 tops, that lasted 10 hours yesterday. I installed Win 10 at 7 am this morning and I've had to charge it to 100% TWICE now. What's more, I charged it this afternoon, after being completely baffled that the battery died, only for it to die 50 MINUTES later!
 I am positive because I intentionally made sure I charged it, and then unplugged it, in an effort to test my assumption. As soon as I unplugged the power, I recorded the time.&nbsp;Indeed, it died swiftly. I googled the issue and Microsoft and Intel have acknowledge
 it, although they say the issue only causes some computers to discharge 10% faster. I know for a fact that either I am extremely unlucky, or they are not admitting to the extend of the bug. But a bug it is indeed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel, they are working on a fix, to be released very soon. Do not worry so much. Keep on top of updates and if there isn't a fix in a couple days, I'd start tweeting Microsoft. That's what I plan to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            The old format for the short date was dd/mm/yy.&nbsp; All that is offered is dd-mm-yy.&nbsp; Can you replace the - with a / and if there is only 1 digit in either the day or month it should be preceded by a zero

<h2>            Skype Account hacked</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An old Skype account of mine was recently hacked. Albeit I haven't used it in a few months, I am now unable to gain access.</p>
<p>Obviously, I am keen to gain access, where it is mine and not someone else's. It did contain a lot of my social contacts as well as a few business related affiliates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone logged into it and has removed my details associated with it (Email Address/Mobile number), it seems to now be registered to a convoluted email address constructed out of random letters and numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I know the details associated with the account (before it was changed), Microsoft's account recovery form has deemed it that I have not answered enough of the questions sufficiently to verify my identity.</p>
<p>Though it seems that the form wishes me to answer questions about the newly associated email address (hackers) and not my Skype account which originally had my email address.</p>
<p>Even though I am able to provide my original Skype username which was also sent to me in one of the messages Microsoft have sent me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received text messages and emails telling me that the details had been removed and replaced, then go to various Microsoft account security links (verified the links) to tell Microsoft that it wasn't me.</p>
<p>Even though this was only a couple of hours in between receiving the messages and being able to do something about it. It turns out I was too late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally I have changed all of my passwords associated with my active accounts for security reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any method known to aid me in retrieving my account?</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e825d682-ac07-4f5f-bcd8-2df3b2a52729" title="MartinCheverton">
<p>
</p><p>I apologize to know about your experience, here are some tips that might help improve your chances of successfully using the Account Recovery form to regain access to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.
</li><li>Also it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</li><li>Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.</li><li>You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that you know apply to your account. Note: While most responses will come within a few minutes, it can take up to 24 hours for a response to be received.</li></ul>
