            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />

            Thanks!<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <b>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>A kernel-mode driver or process attempted to access a protected memory location it does not have permission for, or a kernel interrupt request level (IRQL) attempted to access a memory address that is too high.
</i><br />
<br />
This bugcheck usually occurs when a driver uses an incorrect memory address. Other possible causes of this error include: bug in a device driver, system service, the BIOS, an old Anti-virus program or backup tool, or possibly memory issues.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Probably caused by : fwpkclnt.sys ( fwpkclnt!FwpsInjectTransportSendAsync0+277 )</b></i><br />
<br />
^^ This is the FWP/IPsec Kernel-Mode API system driver. <br />

<br />
<b>2.</b><br />
<br />
If after the above you're still crashing, enable Driver Verifier to look for further device driver corruption and or conflicts:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7)<br />
- Concurrentcy Stress Test (Windows 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

            Patrick thanks for your help -I have uninstalled the avast program and I even tried turning on the driver debugger but I kept receiving a blue screen with that so I turned that back off. I hope uninstalling avast did the trick. David said that there was
 a suspicious program file running so I took a screenshot of it so that you can see if its legit or not - I have no clue if it is or not.<br />

If you were blue screening with verifier enabled, that's actually what we want to happen. Please attach the latest DMP files that verifier created here.<br />

            Hi Patrick, after enabling the verifier I had to restart my computer and I didn't even get to login, right before I would get to the login screen after I had rebooted I got a blue screen and the message said something about a driver trying to corrupt files
 so it shut down again. This was after I had uninstalled Avast completely with your utility so I figured it was the last thing I had done which was enable the driver verifier, so I booted into safe mode and I did a system restore to the restore point you had
 instructed me to create earlier. Should I turn this back on and see what happens again?<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 apps&#47;computer not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long post but i'm trying to explain everything i've tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a similar problem to what a lot of other seem to be having. My windows apps load for a brief second and then no more. This includes all the default apps such as PC Settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started a couple of weeks ago when, after normal use and closing the lid, upon system resume the bios ran a disk recovery. When the system finally came back on pretty much everything had gone apart from the basic windows apps. All the 'default'
 apps such as games, finance, weather etc had gone and so too had all my personally installed programs such as chrome, spotify etc. There was no obvious cause for this. My only guess is that it was updating in the background without me realising.<br />
<br />
The desktop still worked though and since 95% of what I do is in there anyway I just reinstalled my programs and worked from there. Anyway,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What I've tried</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updating</li></ul>
<p>One of the important updates worked, the other failed (tried twice, once before the other update and once after) and upon system resume I get the message "Failed to update, undoing changes". Apps still not working</p>
<ul>
<li>apps diagnostics</li></ul>
<p>This told me something along the lines of windows store cache/config may be damaged. I ran the automatic fix and now the store will open, but the other apps still do not work.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>guest account</li></ul>
<p>I tried logging in to a guest account and the APPS ALL STILL WORK. Leading me to believe it is an issue with my user account. I tried to make my main account a local account as people suggested however, this requires the PC Settings app...<br />
I can't make another account because, you guessed it - PC Settings app...<br />
I can't do a system refresh because people at Microsoft cleverly put that into the PC Settings app too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't made a system restore point myself so unless there is an automatic one then I wont have one. Further to this issue I cant make one because my computer wont recognise USB devices. They show up in disk and device manager but not in explorer - I've
 tried numerous problem solving to try and get them to work but to no avail. <br />
<br />
What can I do?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Matt,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do you get any error message when you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are accessing Windows Store or apps?</span></li><li><span>Have you set any proxy to connect to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any recent hardware or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; software changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You might be facing this issue due to several reasons like corrupted Windows Store app, if the Store Cache is not cleared,. third party software conflicts&nbsp;and if there is any proxy
 connection set. I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You need at least 1024 X 768 screen resolution for Metro apps to work. The Windows apps will not work in screen resolution less than 1024 X 768. To snap apps, you need a screen
 resolution of at least 1366 x 768.&nbsp; Make sure that the screen resolution meets these requirements. You can check this by:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the mouse from the desktop interface and select “Screen Resolution” from the menu.<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the screen resolution shown there. It should be at least 1024 X 768.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, make sure the User Account Control (UAC) is enabled in the computer. To enable the User Account Control on the computer follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>a. Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys on the keyboard, type “Account Control” in the search bar and press “Enter”.<br />
b. In the “User Account Control Settings” window, move the slider to the default settings and click “OK”.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 1: Run the Apps Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let’s first run the Apps Troubleshooter and check if that helps. The Apps Troubleshooter is an automated tool which we have developed to address a number of known issues that can
 prevent the Apps from running properly. This troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues, including suboptimal screen resolution, incorrect security or account settings etc. You can click on this link to download and run the Apps troubleshooter.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the troubleshooter was not able to find and fix the issue, then let’s check if you are using a proxy Internet Connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2: Disable the Proxy Settings.</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you are connected to the Internet using the proxy settings, then the Windows 8 Apps cannot connect to the Internet and thus they do not work properly as expected. So, we need
 to check and disable the proxy settings in the computer. Follow these steps to disable the proxy settings and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows Logo” + “R”, type “inetcpl.cpl” and press “Enter”.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the “Connections” tab, and then click “LAN settings”.<br />

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Nope, no error messages. It just minimises as soon as you open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) No, don't use a proxy. Still went through method 2 and the 'use a proxy server...' setting wass already unchecked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) not that I can remember. Maybe some automatic updates? but nothing major that I know of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Ran the troubleshooter. It said that the windows stor cache may be corrupt and reset it (same as before) and the store app still works.&nbsp;<br />
It also says that 'unknown device doesn't have a driver' and also that 'hardware changes might not have been detected'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>
<p>No change <br />
<br />
Method 3:<br />
Not useful</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 4.1:</p>
<p>Windows 8 came with the laptop (it's only a few months old) and was already activated. It was working perfectly fine prior to the problem.<br />
<br />
4.2:</p>
<p>The system file checker got to 39% verification and then failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.3:</p>
<p>requires use of PC settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.4:<br />
Came back clear - no spyware or malware&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried all the methods and still no luck.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi Matte,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists even after trying those steps, then I would suggest you to run the DISM tool and check. Refer to these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press&nbsp;Windows key + X, select ‘Command prompt (Admin)’.</li><li>In the&nbsp;Command prompt window, type the following commands and press enter after &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each command:</li></ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Close&nbsp;the command prompt and check.</li></ul>
<p>Try these steps and let us know the results for further assistance.</p>

    <title>My Windows 7 professional background won&#39;t change. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> homer52  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows 7 professional background won&#39;t change.</h2>
                    I have a Windows 7 Professional 32 bit computer, and the background won't change. &nbsp;It was stuck on a single picture before, no matter what I did. &nbsp;Now it is stuck on a single color, I can change the color, but not to any actual picture. &nbsp;I have a theme
 that has a slideshow, but when I choose the theme, it says my background is the pictures for the slideshow, but when I look its still a solid color. &nbsp;If I right click it does not give me the option to "Change to next background". &nbsp;There is an unsaved theme
 that has the background set to one color, but its not selected, and even if I do select it and change the background it reverts back. &nbsp;I cannot even change the background when I right click on a picture and click set as background. &nbsp;If I save the theme, it
 saves with the background I wanted, then creates a new unsaved theme with the solid color as the background and uses that. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;

<p>Hi, I found some new information that may be helpful. &nbsp;It's in another thread but I can't find it immediately, but here's the important part:</p>
<p>1 - Go to this folder: &nbsp;<strong>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (copy and paste that into the Start/search or Run box).</p>
<p>2 - Delete the TranscodedWallpaper.jpg file.</p>
<p>3 - Try to set your wallpaper again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry I can't find the link, but it was a confirmed issue from a Microsoft TechNet team blog. &nbsp;Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I started this thread in hopes of mustering some support for the 10 share feature we are losing with the elimination of the DMR and 24hrs checkup</p>
<p>also the convenience and ease use of a digital library of games and cloud services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm with you David. &nbsp;Unfortunately, we're going to be a part of a tiny minority. &nbsp;Thanks to a mass mob of sniveling whiners who are too short sighted to see that optical media will soon be a thing of the past, we're going to get Xbox 360.5 and PS3.5. &nbsp;I
 was so excited about the family sharing plan. &nbsp;I have a lot of family members who live over 1000 miles from me and I would love to share my game library with them. &nbsp;As an avid gamer, I love trying lots of different types of games. &nbsp;My family members who are
 less apt to try different games could have had an opportunity to share those experiences with me. &nbsp;What's really funny is those who want to keep buying used games to save money could have potentially got games for free via family sharing (if they knew someone
 with games they like and were willing to share)! &nbsp;Xbox will not abandon its plan and eventually its vision of the future of gaming will be realized - digital distribution and ownership of all media (music, movies, games, etc.) IS the future.</p>

<p>Hey, look up how Family sharing was never going to work. Not having a go at you guys, just saying before someone does. Also, not really cool saying people are snivelling when really you're just trying to save $. I don't think MS or sony was ever going to
 cater for people with relatives 1000 miles away, nor do I think any developer was going to ever accept 10 people playing the same game. Like I said, check out the real deal</p>

<p>The family share thing was only going to be a 60 minute demo. It has been confirmed by a lot of sites. Google it if you do not believe me. Did you guys honestly think that they would allow you to share a game with up to 10 people without any restrictions.
 You know how badly that would hurt the publishers financiall? </p>

<p>And don't blame the people that made a fuss (rightly so) that they took Family Share away. MS took it away and they can still do it with digital copies. Be mad at them or happy that they finally came to their senses.</p>

<p>The game publishers should have come forward and offered real benefits customers could see. A digital copy can't be sold or shared yet its the same price as disc version. A digital copy saves the publisher money, but its not passed on to customer.I use a
 kindle but the books are quite a lot cheaper than my local bookshop. So it benefits me to buy a digital copy of a book.</p>

<p>I am going to try and explain in the most respectful way i can my point of view to those complaining about the 10 share.
</p>
<p>First lets start by stating that an anonymous source on pastebin is not reliable and in no way official MS representative, in the forums (ordinary people like you and me) of the different pages it is treated as true but the articles (people who have the
 obligation to answer to what they publish) treated it as a rumor. Then lets consider the feasibility of the program itself, approach it from a different stand point, pretend you are MS and understand that you are designing a product for the legitimate user
 (you don't use pirate games and don't mod your console) and you want to limit the use of your product so that only that segment is able to make use of it. Here is were DRM enters the picture, it will put in place more strict and limiting mechanisms to ensure
 that all users fall in line, so naturally consoles sales will be down. </p>
<p>Now consider an approach that hedge funds use to minimize loses: lets say you are a bean producer but you know that a bad season for beans will diminish your gain, so you invest in a corn producer because you know it will go up because it will cover the
 demand that beans can't. What you are doing is protecting yourself against the dive the bean is going to take. Similarly if MS is closing one avenue of sales, consoles (although no one not even MS thought the magnitude of the response would be this big) but
 it has to offer an incentive to the legitimate user to buy games and buy gold memberships.
</p>
<p>Here comes 10 share, a service almost all thought too good to be true, it isn't that far out if you consider it cold minded. To elaborate on this, consider my experience i have a group of 4 close friends (most gamers won't use the 10 slots of the program)
 that i can trust to go into my house and borrow my games. Of these close friends i can tell you that they have used some of my games, finished them and not even bought it, with exceptions like Dark Souls one of the games considered truly great (and i can tell
 you that the ones that bought Dark Souls did it in support to the developers) and games that require four licenses like the multiplayer online games. So in reality it is a more convenient way to share games. In a household scenario MS isn't actually giving
 anything away because any game bought and shared goes to the tally of games purchased on that household, example: you are a parent and have halo 5 on your bed room and your son wants to play it with his friends on the living room with his friends, it is the
 exact same thing if you personally walk downstairs and give the disc to him or he load the game from the digital library. Now on the scenario of friends that are not relate and don't share address. As i previously stated, the people that you lend games to
 tend to be close friends that you trust so you will form a small community of friends, and you wont buy all the games in the community. Consider one of the the basic notions of game theory, you wont enter a game if you don't have something to gain. In this
 scenario the expenditure will tend to be divided among the players but the games are still being purchased so MS isn't giving anything away, you are just lending games. We also need to consider that most of the best selling franchises are characterized by
 a strong multiplayer online that is their selling point (Halo, Gears of War, Call of Duty, Battlefield). Talking about multiplayer online games MS and the Publishers don't care because even if you play with your 10 share friends, the license for those games
 makes so that at least half your list have to buy the game for everyone to play it, if anything it just fomented 4 additional purchases. And if you are so worried about the second hand market and rentals, you could manage to build a healthy 10 share community
 to alleviate the need to purchase used games. In the end the more happy gamers you have the more gold accounts you sell.</p>
<p>Consider again the beans and corn example, if you are MS and for every 10 legitimate games sold, 20 pirate games are sold, 5 are second hand sales, and you implement the DRM policy at which point you loose 4 of your legitimate users but have the possibility
 of gaining the 3 second hand users and 2 pirate users through the incentive of cloud lending and 10 share communities that share the expenditure (you buy 1 you get 2, 3, or even 10 but it is not MS, is your friend that gave you that game).</p>
<p>If you buy 1 game and you get another because you friend has it, if you ask me is an incentive to consume more because if i buy 3 i get 6 and so on, it beats any rebate any day of the week. And so i ask you. Is it really that far out the concept of 10 share?
 Ms isn't actually giving you anything, your friends in 10 share are.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community. I would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to add on to Andre's post above regarding this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the methods listed above don't workout as expected, you may also consider doing a Reset of your PC. But keep in mind that this will wipe your computer out completely and reinstall windows. As always, it is suggested that you backup your personal files
 and other important things before doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset your computer, follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&gt; Go to Start &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Update and recovery &gt;&gt; Recovery &gt;&gt; Under Reset this PC, choose the "Get started option". &nbsp;Afterwards, please go ahead and select "Remove everything". &nbsp;If you have done an in-place upgrade to Windows 10 recently, I would strongly
 recommend selecting "Remove files and Clean the drive". This option fully cleans your hard disk drive and then reinstalls Windows, which can also iron out any conflicting issues from the underlying OS. Even if you didn't do an in-place upgrade, its still the
 best resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in case you might get an error while trying to reset your PC, which is very unlikely you can also keep this link for reference: &nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>**Moving forward, after you have followed the instructions listed above, please also consider using a Wired (or Ethernet connection) for a better quality speed when setting up your computer for the first time after the re-installation. **</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further questions or concerns, please do reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

    <title>Cannot Map Drive using Windows Explorer after Windows 10 Upgrade from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kl_7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Map Drive using Windows Explorer after Windows 10 Upgrade from Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>This is occurring on 2 out of 3 upgrades that I have performed in the last week. The only one that works correctly is a VM where I upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two that are failing are Lenovo Laptops that were upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot map a network drive using Windows Explorer. The resource that I am mapping to is through a VPN connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to map the drive, I do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Establish the VPN connection</p>
<p>2 - Open Windows Explorer</p>
<p>3 - Right Click on "This PC" and choose "Map Network Drive"</p>
<p>4 - Choose a Drive Letter (have tried multiple letters)</p>
<p>5 - Enter the network path and share name</p>
<p>6 - "Reconnect at Sign-In" is already checked</p>
<p>7 - I also check "Connect using different credentials"</p>
<p>8 - I then click finish</p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking finish, I do not receive a dialog box that would allow me to submit my credentials. Instead, a dialog box appears stating that it is attempting to connect to &lt;my network path&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Explorer then <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">crashes</span> and
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">restarts</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried different drive letters.</p>
<p>I have cleared any previous mapped drives</p>
<p>I have tried checking and unchecking all options on the map drive screen</p>
<p>I can ping the resource</p>
<p>I have tried creating an entry in the HOSTS file instead of using an IP Address in the mapping</p>
<p>I have done a repair/reinstall Windows 10 from an ISO file (not a clean install)</p>
<p>I have cleared all saved credentials (web and windows) in Control Panel</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The really odd thing is that I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>CAN</strong></span> execute a NET USE command at a command prompt and that will map the drive for me and I am then able to use the mapped drive (even from Windows Explorer) without
 issue except that the mapped connection is not persistent even though I am supplying the persistence parameter in my NET USE command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            How can I run Write.exe in Windows 7 like I did in Windows Vista&#63;</h2>
                    I loved using Write.exe (it was included with Windows 3.1) It is light, creates small files, and most importantly for me, allowed use of&nbsp;decimal tabs. It worked with all versions including Vista, but will not run with Windows 7 (64bit). Help! I'll go back
 to Vista if I have to. I can open with Word pad, but loose the tab alignment. I have years worth of Write documents

<h2>            Problem with the clarity of pictures in &#34;Photos&#34; app in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a little problem with the "Photos" app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I view a photo, the photo looks a little blurred. But when I zoom it in, it again gets cleared.</p>
<p>When I view the same photo with another app like "Windows Photo Viewer" or "Photo Gallery", both show clear photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be thankful if someone solves this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and have a nice day!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have had several issues when installing an HP multifunction printer in Win 8.8.1 and Win 10 preview. What I discovered was that these versions of Windows are used to having the driver for that piece of equipment, not the software!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remedy this I removed all traces of it that were accessible with out removing any registry entries. I detached it from the pc. I then went to HP and downloaded the file(s) that were needed for 32 or 64 bit install. HP is aware that from Win 7 / Win 8-8.1
 the drivers are installed during the OS install so that all you have to do is connect the hardware. Whether you use the installed driver or the ones from HP the HP software that you maybe used to seeing and or using is no longer installed during setup. HP
 and Microsoft are expecting you to use the default software that Microsoft has provided inside of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you decide to use the file you downloaded from HP you can and it will behave just like it used to. It will tell you not to connect the printer until asked and will at that point continue as before but unless and not in every case it will install the
 driver unless the one inside of Windows in newer then it will ask you which one you want to use. Then depending on the model of the AIO printer it may install the software for the FAX. If it installs the FAX software you will have to fill in the blanks with
 your area code and number and whether it is a dedicated line or shared. If it is also a phone line you will have to select how many rings before it switches over and answers for the FAX element.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helped!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Always get your drivers&nbsp;from the&nbsp;OEM maker's sites. Automatic driver utilities<br />
will eventually fail and&nbsp;when they do the results can be spectacular (bad).<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and <br />
drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Try the HP Print and Scan Doctor for Windows<br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c03286146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c03286146</span></a><br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<h2>            Skype account</h2>
                    URGENT/ How do I check my Skype account and find out all payments during 2018? VERY URGENT QUESTION. Your current software does not show to do this. I should be able to click on a link and see my account and account history. It's ridiculous. I need to
 know URGENTLY for tax purposes to meet today's deadline.

<h2>            Upgrade from Vista to 7 hung up on &#8220;Searching for installation updates...&#8221;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>When I try to upgrade from Windows Vista 64 Home Premium to Windows 7 64 Home Premium using the option to automatically get updates, the “Searching for installation updates...” window appears and remains there for hours without sign of progress.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Will the process eventually complete if I leave it alone?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Or, will it just sit there indefinitely because something is wrong?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suspect something is wrong. But I can’t be sure.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suspect the problem is that Microsoft will not send updates to Vista computers anymore, since Vista is no longer supported, and that the upgrade program still identifies the computer to Microsoft as a Vista computer, even if the upgrade is
 designed to convert the computer to Windows 7.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>And if my suspicion is correct, what can I do to bypass this problem?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I tried to upgrade without getting the updates, but the upgrade process eventually failed, reporting something like “Required driver not found. Upgrade process terminated”.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Microsoft’s upgrade advisor indicated that the computer is fully compatible. So did the upgrade assistant from Dell.</span></span></p>

<p>The upgrade disk has a option to install Windows 7 as an additional operating system along side Windows Vista. So I made a partition for it on the hard drive and put Windows 7 there.</p>

<h3> stephen_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icon label drop shadows. For over 4 years and throughout 5 major upgrades of Windows 10 Microsoft has failed to address this problem</h2>
                    <p>I have just updated to 1803 and Microsoft is STILL ignoring the desktop icon label drop shadow problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a thread <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/desktop-icon-labels-have-drop-shadows/024c601c-3247-4c36-803e-9626ea38ae98?auth=1" title="Cannot remove icon label drop shadows. Win 10 keeps putting back on!">
here</a>&nbsp;but MS locked it because they don't want people to keep whingeing about something they refuse to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a setting of a light background with dark text, Windows will keep resetting to white text and ugly drop shadows on the icon labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many "solutions" out there because it is covered on hundreds of forum threads. Despite doing all the settings suggested, making changes in the registry as some suggest, it still keeps reverting. It is possible to make it stick as long as you don't
 use "Task View".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as you use "Task View" the ugly drop shadows are back, the only option is to restart Windows Explorer in Task Manager and try to remember&nbsp;NEVER to use Task View again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to be certain it's not just a particular configuration or video card that's the problem I have set up light backgrounds of several different machines with several different users and they&nbsp;all do exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reporting it to MS and have been offered the same "solutions" as above but of course it is unfixable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect Microsoft doesn't&nbsp;even want to know. This must be some sort of wicked problem for their developers.</p>

<h2>            changing resolution - How can I change back to the optimum setting of 1400 x 900</h2>
                    <p>I have a 19" wide screen monitor, with my Gateway and running with Vista. My resolution enlarged and I went into display settings to chane it back to the optimum setting of 1400 x 900, but I can not ajust the 900.&nbsp; It jumps from 1240 x1024 to 1400 X 1050.&nbsp;
 Is there another area I can go into to refine the resolution to 1400 x 900 besides the display settings page?</p>

            <p>Hey Wayne1955rjf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find out who&nbsp;provided your video card by going into the Device Manage. Follow these steps below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong></li><li>Right click <strong>Computer</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Manage</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Device Manager</strong> in the left column</li><li>Expand <strong>Display adapters</strong></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you will see the name of the video card you are using. Once you have that you should be able to find their official website by using your favorite search engine, which should provide a section for driver downloads.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are having trouble finding the website to download the latest driver, let us know what is displayed under Display adapters and we'll try to find the appropriate link for you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Missing Module</h2>
                    I recently updated to windows 10 from windows 7 on my personal computer i put together myself. I've been getting a pop up that says "there was a problem starting C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\System\SysMenu.dll the specified module could not be found." and my games
 have a habit of crashing on launch the first and second time i try to launch them. (mostly League, and AdVenture Capitalist) my computer has also crashed while playing said games. I am 99% sure it is not a hardware thing.&nbsp;

Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
The issue seems to be due to some .dll file corrupted. I would suggest you to run SFC scan.<strong><br />
<br />

b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>‘Command Prompt (Admin)’</strong> to bring up an elevated command prompt.
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Click <strong>‘Yes’</strong> if it prompts for permission.<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <strong>command prompt</strong> type in the following command and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>

Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

                    <p>My Xbox was recently stolen, I contacted the&nbsp;authorities and they asked if I knew my Serial number. I don't, but is there another way I can find out what my serial number is? Also is there a way I can close down my account? I changed the password, but I want to make sure they can't connect online with the Xbox.</p>

It either disconnects and reconnects a few seconds later or the last inputs I did get stuck, like I run and spin in circles. I just got a new headset that plugs into the controller about the same time it started happening, but the issue still occurs when I don't use it.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have tried doing everything to fix it.

            Whatever is corrupting this application, it is not worth it to me to re-install Windows Vista Business.&nbsp; I only have the recovery CDs that came with my laptop.&nbsp; These do not include a CD that allows me to do a "repair install."<br />
<br />
So, I am abandoning Windows Computer Backup.&nbsp; I have backed up my system with another program, and deleted the last Windows System Image.<br />

The new backup runs just fine.
