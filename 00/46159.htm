    <title>Windows 10 on Dell desktop won&#39;t wake-up from sleep -- shuts-off - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 on Dell desktop won&#39;t wake-up from sleep -- shuts-off or BSOD</h2>
                    <p>This is an old problem, on an old desktop, since upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, several years ago:&nbsp; When trying to wake the PC from sleep, the screen remains black and the computer shuts off and restarts. (It is possible the restart itself happens
 because the PC is set in the BIOS to start upon sensing power.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problem using Sleep Mode under Windows 7: The same desktop, same hardware and software (with minor changes over time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A year ago and earlier, under prior versions of Windows 10, I used to get a BSOD in this wake-up from sleep situation. Nowadays, I get a shut-off/reboot. (Yes, it is possible the BSOD occurrences were the result of other issues, like drivers.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other computer problems of any kind: When Sleep Mode is set to Never, everything works perfectly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that having an older Dell desktop (Dec. 2010, Dell Studio XPS 9100, i7-980X Extreme; Intel X58, Tylersburg platform) combined with a current version of Windows 10 might be the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is fully updated: Windows 10, BIOS, drivers, and software. When running Dell Support detection, it returns the following: "No driver updates found. Your system has the most recent updates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I manually checked for driver updates (via Control Panel) and everything was reported as up to date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I read the following (and similar) support article: Fix: Windows 10 Shuts Down Instead of Sleep ( https://appuals.com/fix-windows-10-shuts-down-instead-of-sleep/ ), pointing to a possible problem with the version of the Intel Management Engine drivers
 which might cause the shut-off problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon review, I found out that my system doesn't have the Intel Management Engine Interface shown under the Device Manager... Also, I found no outside information confirming that the Intel Tylersburg platform used the Management Engine software or, if it
 did, what version. When trying to install several versions, each attempt resulted in an error: Incompatible platform. Therefore, I do not know whether this is the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over these years, I have tried dozens of proposed solutions mentioned here and elsewhere, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in an area where electricity is expensive and I'd like to minimize power consumption. I use the computer intermittently throughout the day, but often there are long gaps between uses. I know that using hibernation is an alternative but I believe that
 bringing the PC back from hibernation takes far longer than sleep mode: this is not a good solution for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For over 25 years, I used Sleep Mode successfully. I can't imagine that I'm the only PC user who is deeply disappointed by MS seeming inability to make this basic feature work reliably under Windows 10 -- not even several years after it has been out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be delighted to receive expert attention to this nagging problem, in the hope of fixing it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>JF</p>

<p>One possibility is a failing device.&nbsp; Are you seeing any messages in the Event Viewer about an devices or msinfo32.exe in the section on problem devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen systems restart if some setting in the Bios needed to be changed or refreshed, so any Bios updates might help there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having house power situations, in sleep mode the memory remains powered.&nbsp; If power is being removed, it would certainly effect your situation.</p>

<p>Thanks for replying, Saltgrass!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the Event log, I see the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No critical errors (with exception of when the PC shut-off and rebooted -- Error 41)</p>
<p>No Hardware events</p>
<p>Misc errors, today, such as: DistributedCOM (ID#10016); Kernel-event tracing(28); ATIeRecord (16396); Service Control Manager, Print Spooler (7031) possibly because the printer was off.</p>
<p>Event 822:&nbsp; RMSTemplateIDForEDP), Area: (DataProtection), Result:(0x80070002) The system cannot find the file specified: repeated many times, a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing under Hardware Events, and nothing more than the above for System, under Windows Logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No errors under device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS are up to date...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power service is excellent, no interruption of any kind, and the PC is on its own circuit-breaker and an APC surge protector (that's not tripped). No IPS used or needed, ever: the computer never failed/rebooted due to power interruption or irregular service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your help, and I hope you or others would come up with other suggestions.</p>

<p>The result of the analysis shows nothing helpful.&nbsp; It originally names the HAL or hardware abstraction layer which is a kernel driver and will not be the actual cause.&nbsp; No other drivers are identified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try turning off Fast Startup, for testing.&nbsp; It has been involved in some types of situations in the past.&nbsp; Remove all devices you can from the system, especially external ones.<br />

<p>Thanks again, Saltgrass!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tweaked the power settings and as a result when trying to wake-up from Sleep Mode the PC freezes rather than reboots. (A bit worse than before because I now need to shut it off before restarting.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tested turning off Fast Startup: It makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will test removal of printer, webcam, and external drive next and will report back.</p>

<p>UPDATE (11/20/2018):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested starting the PC with all non-MS services off. I was unable to turn off 5 Bitdefender services, although I temporarily disabled Bitdefender operation from within the program. No difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what else can be tried...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Focusing on hardware (following the WhoCrashed report), maybe removing PCIe cards, especially USB 3.00 cards, (but not graphic-card) and deleting their drivers is worth the effort?</p>

<p>It is hard to say if such things would help.&nbsp; When my Nvidia GPU was causing a problem, I would see references to it disappearing in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try booting into Safe Mode which is almost what you have already done but you would know only basic drivers were running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try checking your system files with a System File Check (sfc /scannow).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do have an option of doing an inplace upgrade which is just installing the current build version over your current install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or wait for the latest build to be released at almost anytime, assuming the holiday does not effect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could just start shutting the system down, at least for a while, instead of sleeping.&nbsp; Can you put the system in hibernation?</p>

<p>Hey Saltgrass,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The physical disconnection of a couple of cards is not difficult; if necessary, I could do this later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had done SFC a while ago... Of course, that's not to say there might not be a new problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, I don't believe this is caused by a specific Windows version: it started with Windows 10 and remained a problem after each update. Of course, it is possible the next version would resolve it, but I wouldn't hold my breath...</p>
<p>
</p><p>On shutting off or hibernation: I need to have the system readily accessible. So, for now, I'm not going to go in these directions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the following might be the light at the end of the tunnel...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did re. booting in Safe Mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Safe Mode "minimal" -- it seems the power/sleep module is inactive in that mode: not even the screen went off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Safe Mode "minimal" with all the check-boxes checked (No GUI, Boot Log, Base Video, OS Boot information): The screen went off, followed by Sleep Mode as set (2, 3 minutes, for testing purposes). When I jogged the mouse, PC woke, did not freeze or shut-off,
 and a Safe-Mode login screen came on with a Resume statement; I was asked to login -- once I did, it continued like normal safe-mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO, it seems to work under this test scenario. Now, how to I isolate the services/drivers that are included in this version of Safe-Mode so I can then identify the other services/drivers (excluded in the test) one of which is probably the cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>JF&nbsp; </p>

<p>I assume you are using msconfig.exe? &nbsp; With that utility you use the General tab and Selective startup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Services tab, you can then hide all the Microsoft services and uncheck all the others.&nbsp; From there you can enable services in groups to try isolating the problematic service...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the sleep settings are based in the video driver, you can always try reinstalling that.</p>

<p>Thanks again, Saltgrass!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I've been using msconfig.exe and I updated the video drivers several times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I also tested this with a new GPU, the GeForce GTX 1050, which is Windows 10 compatible (unlike the old ADM 5870 I have).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing. All the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO, I decided to stop worrying about this and move on.</p>

                    <p>The Dell XPS 15 9550 and Dell XPS 13 9530 use a Microsoft precision touchpad, it has come to light that it does not support middle click, this is something I use all the time with the software I use for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this thread here but the Microsoft representative was not competent enough to understand the question that was being asked, let alone provide a solution. Does anyone know a workaround
 to get middle click working on a precision touchpad? I would be most grateful for any advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Do you get any error message?<br />
2.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending updates?<br />
3.&nbsp;Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check the setting of the precision touchpad.<br />
1.&nbsp;Type setting in search.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select devices and tap on mouse and devices.<br />
3.&nbsp;Check the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also update the touchpad drivers from Device manager to check if that helps</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press “Windows + X” and select &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device manger.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Pavan, to answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - No error messages</p>
<p>2 - Windows, BIOS and all drivers are up to date</p>
<p>3 - No changes, this behaviour has existed since I bought the laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The touchpad settings don't offer any options for middle click, I have searched high and low!</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The Display Adaptor drivers are the latest available.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Hardware and devices Troubleshooter does not detect anything wrong with any of my hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manufacturers site (Dell) does not offer drivers for the touchpad as the Microsoft Precision Touchpad drivers are built into Windows. Link to driver downloads page:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Could you please advise of a way to allow the Microsoft drivers to allow middle click with the Precision Touchpad?</p>

            <p>Pavan, and Arun</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you actually read and research these kinds of questions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like you just cut and paste a boilerplate response to tech support questions. It's as if all questions can be resolved by reinstalling drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's obvious from the original question that there are no error messages. Why ask if there is an error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before any of the rest of your suggestions could be meaningful, you would first have to establish that there is a way to get a middle mouse click to work on a&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Dell XPS 15 9550 and Dell XPS 13 9530.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If it is possible (on a working system), describe how. If not, then reinstalling the driver won't help anyway.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't waste people's time with completely useless boilerplate support.</p>

    <title>COD Black Ops Achievement Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sinist3r thi3f  say:</h3>
<h2>            COD Black Ops Achievement Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone I have a problem with one of my achievements in&nbsp; COD Black Ops and can not seem to resolve it (Achievement is called &nbsp;"Closer Analysis") The achievement requires you to collect all the hidden intel throughout the game, but when I look at the
 stats I have all the intel and it does not show up during the story because I accidently unlocked it using th stupid code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When you load up the game and are in the chair in the main menu you can break out of it by pressing right trigger and left trigger, upon doing so you get an achievement and then you can walk over to a computer and put in codes to unlock other achievements.
 I put in a code that disabled one achievement "Closer Analysis" achievement and did not receive a notification that the achievement would not unlock if I used this code (if it did it must have been in fine print and I did not see it). Because of this code
 I can no longer complete Black Ops and have tried clearing my hard drive as well as getting another Xbox and recovering my profile into other Xbox 360's and still can not get the achievement. Any ideas of what I should do? I have contacted Xbox support and
 they helped me get in contact with Activision but they were no help. I know I am not alone on this and any help would be great. Thanks.</p>

<p>I don't think this can be fixed if you messed up the achievement it is probably permanently messed up, try deleting your single player data by going to system settings select memory find black ops delete the single player data, and try playing it over again
 and collect the intel and if that doesn't fix it I am sorry</p>

Hello there, sorry to hear about this unfortunate turn of events, let's see if I can offer some assistance.
Unfortunately when an achievement is locked out due to cheat codes it's usually unobtainable on the save that it was locked out on. You can try deleting your single player data as stated above, but that will require you to replay the entire campaign to
 obtain all the intel pieces.
Once cheat codes like that are entered they cannot be reversed to remove the lock. As for it not saying that the achievement was blocked, I'm not sure if Black Ops did that. I know in GTA IV every time you enter certain cheats it says XXXXXXXX Achievements
 blocked.
Where did you learn that code from? I know everywhere I saw a list of console commands for that terminal in Black Ops, the one that disabled that cheat had a star next to &nbsp;it and usually text in parentheses stating that it blocked out that achievement.
Only way I know to get that achievement is to replay the campaign again on a brand new save, an

<p><span>Unfortunately when an achievement is blocked due to the use of cheat codes you will not be able to unlock the achievement. I think the only thing that you can do is to delete your save game and then start
 a new one.</span></p>
<p><span>You probably found out about the cheat code from a website. Normally, websites that post such things are aware that some of their cheat codes might block some achievements.</span></p>
<p><span>So, next time you should be more careful before entering your cheat codes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I do not know how to reply to the people who posted so I am just posting here saying thanks to all who have and those who might come. I have tried all of the above and more and still no luck. I got the code that disabled my achievement from youtube video
 and it turns out the person who said to use the code was actually trying to sabotage peoples achievements and was lieing saying it would get you the zombie maps and achievements and I was foolish enough to fall for it. Becareful where you get codes and always
 check to see if they disable achievements. </p>

Since it's game sharing, this means that the person who owns the game will be the only one who can saved his data where he left off. Because in game sharing process, saved games and saved data cannot carry over. I believe this is the reason why your brother can't recover the level where he left off. I hope you understand, Marcus.</p><p><br /></p><p>This cant be right?<br /></p>

<p>Hey there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us on the Forums. It looks like you are trying to simply delete a large number of friends from your Xbox friends list and you want to know if it is possible to delete multiple friends at a time instead of doing this individually?
</p>
<p>In this case you would not be able to delete multiple friends at a time, you would simply need to go through the individual accounts and remove them as friends.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

<p>Hi there RodneySon</p>

</p><p>The way I know of to do it fast is group message and going through profiles that way is the quickest way of removing a large amount of people from friends lists. Sorry that you have to do it that way, Please take care and happy gaming&nbsp;</p>

            you can't do it from the console or the Xbox App on windows 10... you CAN go to xbox.com, sign in, then go to your friends tab and select the profiles. it is still an individual process, but at least its a tad bit faster.&nbsp;

<h2>            Network and Sharing Center</h2>
                    <p>Both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 have lost configuration options in Network and Sharing Center. Those options, included in Windows 7, for example, would give the user the capability to manage saved Networks and its properties. Unfortunatelly, it can't be done
 in Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>So, I suggest Microsoft to give those options back to its users.</p>

<p>Both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 have lost configuration options in Network and Sharing Center. Those options, included in Windows 7, for example, would give the user the capability to manage saved Networks and its properties. Unfortunately, it can't be done
 in Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>So, I suggest Microsoft to give those options back to its users.</p>

<p>What does the Community think about that?</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Gabe,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a mood today! Let's all&nbsp;Starbuck this one. I finally believe Windows 8.1 Pro enables functionality. 'There' does not appear to be consistently documented for the public anywhere yet either. So I'll give it my best shot here. After reading and implementing
 the following, interacting with any remote and local resource interaction is identical. Don't step on&nbsp;some Servers' toes and blame me.&nbsp; 2014, week of June two here,&nbsp;Microsoft finally Virtualized for the public. Stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry, it's secure, eh. Much less virus and hacker interference here than ever before. Probably because&nbsp;OSX and Windows&nbsp;are finally watching their environment. Yeah, they still have to crack open public file format sharing across applications.&nbsp;Almost
 there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway,&nbsp;first link is the old functionality, still works, but steps toward new functionality. Second link underscores the "What's Next!" shock that seems to have jumbled everyone's consistency in terms of spelling it all out</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found the&nbsp;Microsoft resource yet for the next step. That turns remote and local&nbsp;access into the same click-save-new-delete-copy-move-etc. Functionality. Making the old Windows 7 Network Map&nbsp;somewhat completely, totally redundant? Guess not.&nbsp;But
 hey, what's next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, this is how we effect Network access from start-to-finish for today. The rest is up to your imagination, "Mister Nunes!"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>STEP ONE... WHERE AM I (gems)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You need some basic connectivity leverage. Gems, Search PC Settings, right click cog,&nbsp;add to Taskbar. Open PC Settings/Network/Connections//(Ethernet) Network Connected. Assuming you're not&nbsp;a&nbsp;domain user bondage-terminal. Simply turn
<em>Find devices and content</em> <strong>On</strong>. Net numbers for mind numbing things we don't need (supposedly interesting navel perks). Interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>STEP TWO... HERE I AM (files)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows File Explorer, This PC. Right click&nbsp;on right panel emptiness... in the general Network locations&nbsp;area.
<em>Add a network location</em>. Fill in your vital statistics. Wave. Or whatever. Now you have a named network location (halfway to your CCE degree). Identified.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>STEP THREE... LET'S DO IT (panels)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This step seems to be undocumented. In other words, refer to first link above, wonder wtf. It's not rocket science. The button is there, Use it. Control panel/Network and sharing center/Change advanced sharing settings/All networks/<em>Turn off password
 protected sharing</em>. Some Microsoft capitalization omitted.&nbsp;Karma.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish I had more to share with you, that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, almost. But not our sweat. Read the fine line under <strong>Password protected sharing</strong> in your panels. Did we just throw an open house for the folks who manage Region 3 Node 2 (and all their teen fans in Beijing)? Don't ask me... Oh, File
 explorer/ Network///Map network drive. Cool?</p>

    <title>moving files on HDD using WLPG in date taken &#40;by month&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bj0612  say:</h3>
<h2>            moving files on HDD using WLPG in date taken &#40;by month&#41;</h2>
                    Can I use windows live photo gallery to move files into folders representing date taken (by month), not just to 'view' in WLPG, but to actually move the files themselves on the HDD.&nbsp; Is this possible?&nbsp; or do I use another program to do this, then use WLPG
 to view what I have done.<br />
I know WLPG will sort by month taken, but this just 'collects' the meta data from the original files (scattered) on the HDD.&nbsp; I want to move all my pic files (77000 of them) into date taken by month.&nbsp; Currently they are in '1 folder = nightmare'.&nbsp; So whenever
 I use a program, such as powerdirector, it needs to sort through all those pics to get the one I want.&nbsp; It would be quicker if they were broken up a litle (by month taken).<br />
...If WLPG cannot do this task, can anyone suggest a program that will do this sorting automatically?<br />

            <p>It's actually allot easier to do in your win-7 library system, using windows explorer,</p>
<p>Because you can click the first file to select it and scroll to the last file and hold the shift key and click on the Last file to select All of the files between the clicks, you can not do that in wlpg.</p>
<p>Which you can sort in the same way, plus you can actually add (More) options to both the Group by and Sort by options that are shown, by by clicking on the More listing where there are three hundred different listing you can choose from to add to the quick
 list,</p>
<p>I would probably start by making Yearly folders and make monthly sub-folders inside of the yearly ones, then sort or group is irrelevant because the folders structure will replace the grouping issue.</p>
<p>Then it just a matter of selecting the files in those categories and using (Alt + E) and click on (Move to folder), and Navigate to the folders you made prior.</p>
<p>With 70k in files it will take a while to accomplish,</p>
<p>But at least you can group and sort and have a easy way to select those files and have a way to Move the files,</p>
<p>None of this was incorporated in wlpg,</p>
<p>But once you accomplish it wlpg will show the same Navigation Pane as windows explorer does.</p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of years ago I logged in and changed my email address. Then a few weeks ago I did it again. I tried again to do it and while on the interface it says my current email address, Skype still contacts me on my old email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating but I'm really busy as I'm trying to use Skype to have a job interview - but I think I'll need to use something else instead. I don't have the time to keep chasing this up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep looking but I don't have much time to fix the problems with Skype's interface.</p>

            Hi Daniel, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />If you're having trouble with the narrator playing two voices, there could be a number of causes. Here are some steps you can try to narrow down the issue:
<br />
<br />Reinstall or update your audio drivers:
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your audio device in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Run the System File Checker:
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />Try the audio troubleshooter:
<br />- Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Playing audio, and run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!

    <title>My peripherals randomly freeze for around 5 seconds. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dimdom94  say:</h3>
<h2>            My peripherals randomly freeze for around 5 seconds.</h2>
                    <p>Here's what happens. Everything connected to my computer pauses or glitches for about 5 seconds. My mouse stops working. The RGB effect on my keyboard freezes. Audio stops working or starts glitching. Video freezes, or sometimes will continue working. I
 can usually hear one of my hard drives whine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried a completely fresh reinstall of Windows. I think either one of my devices is failing or maybe I have a faulty driver. I'm just not sure the best way to diagnose the issue, as it only happens every 30 to 2 hours, and it happens unpredictably.
 I looked at the S.M.A.R.T. results for my hard drives and they all seem to be good (I can provide this info if you want).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a list of my components and some the devices connected to my PC:</p>
<br />
<p>ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-E</p>
<p>Intel i7 8700k</p>
<p>G.SKILL TridentZ 16GB (2 x 8GB)</p>
<p>NVIDIA GTX 1070</p>

            Hi DD&gt;  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />4) Test the RAM overnight to stress it with the best bootable test memtest86, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: 
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br /><a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />6) Compare the install you did with this gold standard  Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The reason I ask you to do this is because no one of millions who have followed the install in that link have ever come back to report problems that I have seen.   It is also a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and have applied it with your own hands. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

    <title>Windows 7 appears to be constantly writing to hard disk, space - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 appears to be constantly writing to hard disk, space disappearing</h2>
                    I saw similar questions, but none of the results seemed to fit my situation. I recently upgraded my system's graphics card, and following a smooth installation of both the hardware and the drivers, I began to notice I was hearing the hard drive spin up
 and churn far more often. I then began to notice that disk space was disappearing. I saw that C:\ had 84 GB of free space, I played a game, and by the time I was done it showed 82 GB of space free. Slightly freaked out I refrained from using my system much,
 only web browsing for several hours and saw only .2 GB disappear. Later I watched a video and saw a slightly larger amount of space disappear.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did a full virus scan and no threats were detected. Following the virus scan my hard drive was more active than ever, I opened up Resource Monitor and saw that "system" was writing something around 300,000 bytes (or K, can't remember) per second. I lost
 about 1 GB of space during this.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've grown to quite like free space on my hard drive so I was wondering if anyone knew what was causing this? I imagine it has something to do with the new graphics card driver, but I've uninstalled and reinstalled that so I'm at a bit of a loss. Any help
 would be very much appreciated.</div>

            I downloaded and ran a full scan with Malwarebytes. It found something called "Backdoor.MSIL.Pgen", in &nbsp;C:\Users\Austin\C#\hello.exe. After the scan had finished it told me to restart to get rid of this. I left for a few hours and now my hard drive space
 seems to be back at 84 GB of free space. Does this mean it is gone, or is there something else I should do? I haven't noticed anymore missing drive space but it usually only happens when I'm using my computer rather than leaving it alone, so I'm not sure if
 the problem is entirely solved or not.

            I followed these steps but it appears to be happening again, although it took several hours for it to start again. Should I try scanning with Malwarebytes again and should I try that HitmanPro program as well?

            It wouldn't hurt to try multiple programs just to make sure, but one important thing to remember is to only run anti-virus program at a time as they can sometimes conflict with each other.<br />

            So I ran another Malwarebytes scan which turned up nothing. I then followed up with a Hitmanpro Scan. HitmanPro listed a bunch of cookies from Firefox and then three more .exe files it listed as trojans, all found in directories made by my install of Microsoft
 Visual Studios. I installed that nearly half a year ago though, and it was a legal copy. I'm very confused by what's going on here. Also, Hitmanpro chose to quarantine two of the trojans instead of delete them. Is that okay?
<div><br />
<div>I also seem unable to connect to the internet now. I will follow the guide posted earlier to try and fix this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: Was able to reconnect to internet after restarting my computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm also thinking some background information could help a bit more. I've been thinking what could have given me this virus and I think it may have been from a program called "Core Temps", I wanted a way to monitor the temps on my new graphics card and
 that was the first result on Google. It asked if I wanted to install a lot of useless bloatware alongside it but I'm used to installers asking me that. I unchecked all the options... but it seemed to install all these things anyway. Most annoying and visible
 was a Yahoo! toolbar installed to Firefox which I could not actually get rid of, only hide. It prevented me from checking my addons as well. I uninstalled core temps and had to, unfortunately, uninstall Firefox as well. I assumed that would have been the end
 of it, but it might be possible that it installed something else.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Final edit just so all information is out there, I've noticed that yesterday, it only took up space while I was watching a YouTube stream. It started once that happened and once I stopped it ended. Could be pure coincidence but I assumed there's no harm
 in mentioning it.</div>

            Simpler question. I'm restoring my computer from a system image created before the download. Will that get rid of it, or should I have reformatted as well?

<h2>            Bluetooth Tray Application showing up in Task Manager but not in the tray.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a USB Bluetooth Adapter with Broadcom BCM20702 Chipset (https://goo.gl/DHJHXs) and installed the WIDCOMM Bluetooth software that came with it and the BTTRAY.exe is running in Task Manager but is not showing up in the tray as it used to
 back on my old Windows Vista machine that had Broadcom Bluetooth 2.0 built in.</p>
<p>I have tried everything in this post: goo.gl/JPRupq and still it isn't showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help, Matthew.</p>

<p>In Windows 10 you can pull out the action center (notification list) and use the Connect option there in place of the bluetooth tray icon.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 screen freeze</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a similar screen freeze problem, but not on the start screen as some people are reporting. I can use my Firefox browser, but my screen freezes multiple times daily. It will "unfreeze" if I close and re-open the browser, but any tabs I have open
 will not be saved. I've attempted to uninstall then reinstall 8.1 (didn't work). I've tried all the fixes listed here, including a system restore to before the update to 8.1 happened, but the freezes keep happening, sometimes only minutes apart. This update
 has effectively made my laptop an expensive doorstop.<br />
<br />
I'm baffled as to how people can report this for a full 2 weeks but no patch has been issued.<br />

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It would be much appreciated if you could provide us the following information.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is your computer freezes only while using Firefox browser
</span><span>or</span><span> it freezes randomly?</span></li><li><span>How did you install Windows 8.1? Is that through Windows update from Store or standalone installation through disk?</span></li><li><span>Are you getting any error message/code when your screen freezes?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If your computer freezes while using
<strong><span>Firefox</span></strong>, I would request you to use
<strong><span>Internet Explorer </span></strong>and then check the status.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your computer freezes randomly you may try the below mentioned methods and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span>
</strong><span>Boot the computer in
<strong><span>safe mode.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try to boot the computer in safe mode and see are you able to login in safe mode or not. You can refer to the below mentioned article for booting the
 computer in safe mode.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform
<strong><span>clean boot</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a <strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"
 to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If issue still persists move to method 2 and see if it works for you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>When your computer hangs, or freezes, it's disruptive and can slow you down. There are a few reasons your computer might hang, freeze or crash. Try the following common
 methods as your first step to fix the problem provided in the following article.</span></p>
