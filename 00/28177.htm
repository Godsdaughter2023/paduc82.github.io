<h2>            Rules not working for shared mailbox in Outlook after Migration to Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an issue on a shared mailbox where after the migration to Office 365 the rules no longer work. Specifically autoforwarding emails that have the text 'DSR' in the subject. I have tried removing and recreating the profile, that didnt work. I tried removing
 the rules and recreating them, that didnt work. The rules dont work if when the mailbox is open or when it is closed. The auto forwarding is to internal emails so we have no transport rules prohibiting that so I am at a loss as to where to go from here. Any
 help would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>So I was able to figure out this issue. It turns out that when forwarding from a rule in a mailbox, the email can only be forwarded to up to 9 people. If you put more than that in it wont forward to anyone unless you run the rule manually from the mailbox.
 Hope this helps someone!</p>

    <title>PC Suite v.7 missing Nokia Multimedia Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikbed  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Suite v.7 missing Nokia Multimedia Player</h2>
                    I've upgraded from PC Suite v.6.86.9.3 til 7.0.7.0, based upon a message from PC Suite that an upgrade was available. It's on a Vista machine (Ultimate, fully updated), and the phone model is 6300.<br />
<br />
No problems connecting (via USB) - but where is my 'Nokia Multimedia Player', so that I can play back my voice recordings (in the amr-format)?<br />
<br />
I've read in a previous User Manual, that that application (plus Image Store, and Nokia Music Manager) are not included in "Nokia PC Suite Starter Edition". But how did I (possibly - I can't see that this is the fact anywhere) get to download this 'Starter'
 edition? I followed normal download procedures (for the English version).<br />
<br />
Yes, it seems I can download 'Nokia Multimedia Player' separately (I've found it on the Net, though not on Nokia.com). Or I can play the recordings through 'Media Player Classic', but I'd like to play the recordings directly when connected, rather than having
 to transfer the files first.<br />
<br />
Possibly I've overlooked an option in one of the now existing applications within PC Suite. So would someone please let me know if they've come up with a solution to playing amr-files within PC Suite v.7.<br />
<br />
Thanks..

            Ok, seems I'm not all alone with this problem - I had stopped monitoring this thread...<br />
<br />
Does any Nokia support personnel monitor this board, and could you possibly try to help with an answer to our problems?<br />
<br />
PS - upgrading to version 7.0.8.2 did not help..

            Seems that Nokia Multimedia Player was comletely removed from PC Suite install package :( Is it a mistake or not - who knows? And, BTW, I can't find a download link for separate Nokia MMP on Nokia's site... What's going on?!<br />
P.S. Going back to Nokia PC Suite v6.82.21<br />

            There is no more Multimedia Player in PC Suite 7.x<br />
To play your .AMR files you can use the Quicktime player, which you can find at <a href="http://www.quicktime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Copy and paste does work. I've used it several times. And just now I tried it again for you, just in case anything had changed. I opened an existing email, selected a couple of paragraphs of text and then opened a new email and pasted into the body of the
 new email. I then did the same with some text and images. It worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why doesn't it work for you? You may need to clear your browser cache. Doing this seems to fix a number of "funny" issues. The link below has details on how to clear the cache in many different browsers. Also, make sure you are using the latest version
 of your browser.</p>

<h2>            Whu does Microsoft Edge not support add-ons&#63;</h2>
                    Dear Microsoft: Why would you release Edge if you knew that it doesn't support add-ons? I like every thing else about Edge until I tried to print coupons, which I do a lot. I tried using another browser, just for this reason and now my printer is totally
 confused.&nbsp;There are other add-ons that I like to use, and&nbsp;am not able to.&nbsp;I cannot find a way to delete the Edge from my computer. If you have any suggestions, feel free to post because I am very aggravated over this!

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extensions/add-ons have historically been the cause of many problems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>security vulnerabilities.</li><li>IE crashes, instability and slow performance.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Quote from here: </p>
<p><a href="http://dev.modern.ie/platform/faq/extensions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Microsoft Edge Dev - FAQs</span></a> ,</p>

<p><strong>Does Microsoft Edge support plug-ins or extensions?</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Microsoft Edge supports viewing PDFs and Adobe Flash as built-in features, but does not support any third-party installable plug-ins. This allows us to build a more secure and more reliable browser to make the Web a safer experience for everyone. We’re working
 on a new, modern extensibility model for Microsoft Edge in a future update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does Microsoft Edge support ActiveX </strong><strong>controls </strong>
<strong>or BHOs like Silverlight or Java</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>No, ActiveX controls and BHOs such as Silverlight or Java are not supported in Microsoft Edge. The need for ActiveX controls has been significantly reduced by modern web standards, which are more interoperable across browsers. We are working on plans for
 an extension model based on the modern web platform in Microsoft Edge. We look forward to sharing more details on these plans soon. Not supporting legacy controls in Microsoft Edge has a number of benefits: better interoperability with other modern browsers,
 increased performance, security &amp; reliability, and reduced code complexity, just to name a few."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>IE11 was included with Windows 10 alongside Edge to allow&nbsp;web pages that don't work with Edge (e.g. because of no add-ons) to still be used. You can even use IE11 all the time and ignore Edge, so you are no worse off because of Edge being there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be interesting to see how Edge, extensions and the web transforms in coming months/years.</p>

</p><p>Any update on this issue? Any chance to get the clear reply here. I am now on Insiders Preview Build 10512, bitlocker turned ON, device encryption ON but cannot see any option to encrypt the SD card. That's probably the issue why my company Exchange server

            <p>I've been a BlackBerry user for over 10 (!) years and now, given that BB10 may die slowly, and that I hate Android and iOS, I'm seriously looking at WP10, especially if the Surface Phone is released.</p>
<p>Being a BB user, I'm used to lots of security features such as an ecrypted SD card and a removable battery.</p>
<p>I really hope this features comes on soon, because the SD card is exactly where I store some key information, and if the card was stolen, well....</p>

            <p>Wondering if there are any updates on this.&nbsp; its now March 2016, still no update on how we can encrypt SD card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>its truly annoying I cannot get my exchange &amp; MDM e-mails onto my phone because InfoSec disables my SD card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have Lumia 950 - Flagship MS product&nbsp; with a 128Gb SDcard&nbsp; and as soon as I enrol to&nbsp;&nbsp;MDM at work it blocked my SD card, so&nbsp;I can only use Internal phone memory, all photo's and 50% of my apps are greyed out unusable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our InfoSec team refuse to make exceptions - they said just buy a Android phone which has this automatically or get Microsoft to Encrypt your SD card.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Common Microsoft, please get this update in the next W10mobile release ASAP. </p>

</p><p>Are you actually able to be provisioned? Or does your organization allow non-provisionable devices? I'm using a WP8 and I can't even get the device connected to the Exchange server. Pain as it would be to have half my junk unusable, it'd be an improvement
 over my "built for business" phone unable to be provisioned on my organization's "built by the SAME COMPANY" Exchange server.

</p><p>But hey, if I ever find myself in a situation where I've got a monitor and keyboard but no computer, I can pay an extra 100 bucks for a dongle and&nbsp;work on&nbsp;my phone. 'Cause that's happened before. Oh yeah, that is&nbsp;unless I need to send an email.&nbsp;</p>

            I've been provisioning Windows Phone devices with no problem on Exchange 2010 and above. It depends on your core policies and if Microsoft decides to continue to support your device. RIP Lumia Icon...

            <p>true, it does depend on the core policies; specifically, my device can't be provisioned because it fails "Require Encryption on Storage Card". The only other option is for my very large organization to allow non-provisionable devices (snowball's chance in
 Phoenix that ever happens) or remove that parameter from the policy (see previous parenthetical comment).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yeah--my device won't be supported either, so I'll eventually be looking for a new one. I've enjoyed windows phone... but this is kind of a joke, and not a very good one at that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything, even in the earliest stages of development, (something written on a bar napkin, whatever) being done to address this?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Creator&#39;s Update - lost my Office 2016 activation&#33;</h2>
                    <p>What a disastrous update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to use Excel last night after the creator's update finished, and got a message that my Office 2016 was not activated, and was not linked to my MS account!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the "what to do if you're having trouble" link on the error page from Excel, entered my product key and then instead of it reactivating, it downloaded the entire Office 16 package again. I also made sure it was linked to my MS account. But
 I don't know now if it overwrote my existing Office or it's a new install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I fire up Word, and I get the exact same error that I got in Excel - I need to activate! Obviously this is annoying, and I'm pretty lucky I don't have a deadline this week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update has also messed up my Snagit 12 install. My profiles and shortcuts are gone and I can't use most of the capture modes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to know how we can restore the&nbsp;Archive Button for Outlook 2016(O365) located when you navigate thru File Tab --&gt;Tools --&gt; and there should be 3 option there but mine is 2 only which is mailbox clean up and empty deleted items folder.&nbsp; Please
 see below picture that shows 3 options but mine Archive is not present. Please advise. Thanks!</p>

<p>Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is an Office 365 Exchange Online account you should use Online Archive,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/enable-archive-mailboxes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/enable-archive-mailboxes</a>.&nbsp;
 Its a better solution for most cases because it keeps all of the backed up items in the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have Online Archive already enabled for this account?&nbsp; If so that is probably why Auto Archive is not showing.&nbsp; This MVP topic explains the situation,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.msoutlook.info/question/603</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cross-referencing needs improvement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholashamilton1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cross-referencing needs improvement</h2>
                    <p>Sorry Microsoft, I prefer LaTeX, by about a billion percent. It is superior to MSWord in almost every way. The only time I use MSWord is when collaborating with people that refuse to use LaTeX, and, I have one enormous pet peeve about its functionality in
 the context of academic / report writing. As you can tell from the title, it has to do with cross-referencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, whoever designed and programmed its functionality has never written any kind of significant document, otherwise, certain things would have been done differently. They should be put out to pasture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default setting within MSWord's annoying cross referencing dialog box is to reference the "Entire Caption". This is insane, totally insane. there is literally not a single user case where one would want to cross reference and include the entire caption.
 I literally cannot imagine even needing this functionality, let alone making it the default. By a massive margin, the primary cross reference option of any use is to cross reference the "Label and Number" (ie Figure XYZ, Table XYZ), followed by perhaps "Page
 Number" (ie to facilitate "Figure ABC on page XYZ"). There SHOULD be an option to cross reference the number only (ie so you can do say "Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5" with ease) - at the moment this is only possible by putting in multiple "Figure and Number" cross
 references, and altering the field code for each, which is easy enough, but very very very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any, and I mean ANY academic that uses MSWord uses cross-references ALL THE TIME. Every time, having to manually select "Label and Number", when this should be the default by anyones imagination is an enormous waste of time, and makes cross-referencing totally
 painful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not the only one that feels this way, for example see here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/officeversion_other-word/changing-the-cross-referencing-default-to-label/18390a17-4edd-46ed-b6f5-851466df6c18?page=2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft, fix this and make things more user friendly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I'm sorry macropod, but the form for 'starting a discussion' says the following (screenshot attached):</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>"Don’t have a question, but would like to share an opinion? Have tips or advice to share? Select this option to start a discussion with the community."</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a50910d1-2d51-42ae-bb57-8640008fbf6a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a50910d1-2d51-42ae-bb57-8640008fbf6a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Clearly from this, posting an "<strong>opinion"</strong> constitutes a 'discussion', and that is exactly what I have done.<br />
<br />
Could it be that you do not want honest feedback from your users presented in the public domain?</p>

<p><br />
That site has a favicon.&nbsp; Can you get to it?</p>
<p><a href="http://media.intherooms.com/images/icons/favicon.ico" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://media.intherooms.com/images/icons/favicon.ico</a></p>
<p>Press Ctrl-F5 in case you first open it only from the cache.</p>
<p>FWIW I can even get something by backing up (e.g. Alt-d, Ctrl-Backspace) to that host's root.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hoping that it might redirect to your host.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>Nevertheless it might help get you closer to the host that you want, e.g. in terms of setting up intermediate downstream DNS caches.</p>
<p>Using the favicon.ico idea as a connectivity test could still help too so try</p>
<p><a href="http://www.intherooms.com/favicon.ico" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intherooms.com/favicon.ico</a></p>
<p>and verify that you receive an HTTP 404 response from that host.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then back up to the root.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise I can't see why you would be having a problem with that site.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is its own name (e.g. not an alias) and there are no redirects involved in getting its HTML page.</p>
<p>After that you would need access to the host where the favicon is and to Google Analytics but problems with those would not cause your symptom.</p>
<p>Note that your&nbsp; tracert&nbsp; does not involve&nbsp; HTTP&nbsp; so the only thing you are testing that would be relevant is addressability.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that your diagnostic proves that&nbsp;there is addressability, just not HTTP connectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the View Detailed Information
 link in the troubleshooter to find an .etl file to see what is really happening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is that the host was down temporarily and you now won't have any problems.</p>
<p>If not, try using the IE9 Developer Tools, Network Capture tool to see what is going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can start it while you are in another page, including the error message page, and then navigate to or refresh the problem page--provided you have unchecked the
 Clear entries on navigate options in the Developer Tools, Tools menu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good time to learn. Try it and see how far you get. Then ask, if you have specific questions.</p>
<p><br />
Unfortunately, since it is looking like a connectivity problem, the capture tool may not be that useful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you look at the troubleshooter's details yet?&nbsp;&nbsp; Another potential diagnostic would be in your firewall.&nbsp; E.g. activate its logging and see what it
 says about the request.&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Firewall has logging, don't know about any others.</p>

<div>Here's a report. And another one just like the other one. Both from the same Troubleshooting Diagnostic. &nbsp;I wonder what they mean...</div>

<div>I uninstalled my router, unplugged it (from pc and electrical outlet)and reinstalled it. Running as a wired connection (was wireless when I first reported problem). The report below is the outcome of that effort - If anybody can get any use out of it,
 you're welcome to it. &nbsp;Feel free to contact me with any insights &nbsp;as it is completely meaningless to me.</div>

See if you can open that&nbsp; .etl&nbsp; file and get more clues from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still can't really tell if this is a problem with addressability or connectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I'm not sure if the troubleshooter bothers trying to use HTTP or just tries to use&nbsp; ICMP&nbsp; (e.g. ping)&nbsp;
 to check connectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is the latter the test would be useless because a tracert shows that one of the servers in the path blocks ICMP.</p>
<p>I was assuming that your "not responding" symptom meant that&nbsp;IE had done a lookup successfully and naturally would be using HTTP for its request.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you treated this as an addressability problem even if it is not, it is possible that you could change the
 timing and then have a better chance of getting past whatever this is.</p>
<p>Therefore, before trying to open anything for that host using IE, use a cmd window to enter:</p>
<p>ipconfig&nbsp; /flushdns</p>
<p>then </p>
<p>ping&nbsp; -n 1&nbsp; -w 1&nbsp; -4 &nbsp; media.intherooms.com&nbsp; </p>
<p>and finally</p>
<p>ipconfig&nbsp; /displaydns</p>
<p><br />
Then if you see that there is a lookup ready for IE to use, go and try to open the favicon file.</p>
<p><br />
However, you should also get the same effect as the ping, e.g. the loading of the dnscache with that entry, using both the first attempt by IE and the troubleshooter.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is even an automatic Refresh done after you close the troubleshooter but as I mentioned
 in the case of the favicon it would be best to use Ctrl-F5 to ensure that you were requesting it from the host and not a cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that if you do not have an addressability problem, e.g. only connectivity,&nbsp;you really would get a better clue about what is going on by using the Developer Tools, Network Capture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cutover migration failing following initial migration</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having successfully migrated a domain to Office 365 and Exchange, from an on premise Exchange 2003 server using a cutover migration, I am trying to do a final run of the migration sync to bring through any emails which were delivered to the old exchange
 server while the changes to the domain (MX record etc) propagated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to do this, all mailboxes are failing with the following error (masking domains etc for security):</p>
<p>
Connected to target mailbox 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Primary)', database 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', Mailbox server 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM' Version 15.1 (Build 761.0).<br />
05/12/2016 12:29:58 [LOXP123MB0024] Transient error MapiExceptionLogonFailed has occurred. The system will retry (317/760).
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer any suggestions?<br />

            <p>It turns out that the mailboxes had become dismounted on the on premise server....</p>

            I have 6 W10 PCs and I estimate I spend 30% of my time figuring out why updates won't apply, waiting 3 hours for Windows to try to apply updates then rolling the system back and restoring to previous state, only for it to try the same thing the next day.
 I have had to stop using 3 PCs because it's just too time consuming to figure out why Windows update is so rubbish. I am a Windows fan but it is unusable due to constant update issues. All my PCs bar one has different update type issues making them unusable

            There are so many better free spyware options out there besides MS built in ****, so dont know why you continue to fight it. I havent used Windows Defender since it came out, and only got warned about it now because one of the latest W10 updates removed
 Spybot and several other programs from her laptop. So I re-installed Spybot and no longer get the warnings.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you may lost old notes in Outlook. I'd like to collect the following to identify whether it is a data loss issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did you do anything special when you found this issue? Like updating Outlook/Windows system, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did you check the <strong>Deleted Items </strong>folder in Outlook? If yes, you can recover those notes there. See&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recover-deleted-items-in-Outlook-for-Windows-49e81f3c-c8f4-4426-a0b9-c0fd751d48ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recover
 deleted items in Outlook for Windows</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Those notes may locate in another Notes folder.&nbsp;To see the Notes folder all the time, click&nbsp;
<strong>Navigation Options button on the Navigation Bar &gt; Navigation Options</strong>. Then change the number in the
<strong>Maximum number of visible items </strong>box to 5, or click <strong>Notes</strong> in the
<strong>Display in this order </strong>box and click <strong>Move Up</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Check if you can see those notes <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-can-t-start-Microsoft-Outlook-2016-2013-or-2010-or-receive-the-error-Cannot-start-Microsoft-Office-Outlook-Cannot-open-the-Outlook-Window-d1f69da6-b333-4650-97bf-4d77bd7abb85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">in
 safe mode</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp;You can also try to troubleshoot this issue via repairing Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost). for more detailed information, please refer to the article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>6. The detailed&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c#bkmk_32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook 2016 client version</a>.</strong>&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Nokia Suite 3.2.100 and Messages Export&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just updated to Nokia Suite 3.2.100 and chose the software language to be English. Then I exported all messages to .csv knowing that I have my messages both in English and Arabic and so&nbsp;when I opened the csv file using Excel, the English messages were
 fine and readable but the Arabic messages were in strange letters and couldn't be read. Therefore, I would like to know if the Arabic messages will return to their original&nbsp;format and be readable once&nbsp;I import them back into&nbsp;Nokia Suite or not?&nbsp;&nbsp;and If not,
 then, is there a way I can export them in their readable format knowing that I have already tried to change the language software to Arabic but didn't find the option?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would very much appreciate your help.</p>

            if Nokia Suite can read the Arabic language, i suppose when you import them back they will be fine.<br />
<br />
as long as you didn't edit or alter the file.

<h2>            Run-time error 94 Invalid use of Null</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to start by saying that I am not a programmer who is trying to figure out a programming issue. I am trying to print a report and I am able to preview all but the last record. That is when the Run-time error 94 message appears and prompts me to the
 debug screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5496906e-baca-4718-ac73-7206c1d6caff" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when I close the debug screen I receive a message saying "A custom macro in this report has failed to run, and is preventing the report from rendering." How do I resolve this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            The last record in your recordset does not have a ZIP code entered so it is a null value. You cannot assign a null value to your string variable.

<p>Hi Joaquin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you include a screenshot of the crash/error you see?&nbsp; My first guess is that your browser is hanging due to a system resource issue, but I can't be sure until I investigate it deeper.</p>

<h2>            Highlight emails with tasks pending</h2>
                    <p>I am not sure if it can be done. In that case, it could be a suggestion for the next generation of Office.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way to highlight emails in the inbox? When I have an email with tasks pending to do, I "categorize" it with a color. However, when I work with Word or Excel, I am able to highlight all the text of the task pending to be done.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could highlight the emails with important information or incomplete tasks so as to see how late will you stay at work with a glance of the inbox, simply based on how "colored" your inbox is?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            Various problems with latest Windows 10 for mobile build</h2>
                    <p>Battery usage with Edge and screen needs immediately sorting out. Nokia 1520 used for less than an hour and totally drained battery. Feedback section in menu does not have a direct link for feedback like previous, background apps option does not work, you
 click on it and it goes back to home screen. Favourites button in Edge needs to be more apparent, currently hard to find. Hard to pull down menu from top while on web pages. Cannot seem to remove the flashing quiet hours setting even though off in Cortana.
 still lights up and half moon flashes in drop down.</p>
<p>Facebook app will not remove a comment on live tile after you have read the comment, stays on.
</p>
<p>Cannot set sounds for mail app or any other sounds you may want, no area to add sounds etc to Notification area.</p>
<p>Often get little flag up saying notification and nothing there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Live tiles do not show unread email count as 8.1 and neither does Messaging. Twitter app will not load, 0x8103010F not a single thing on microsoft area quoting that error number</p>

</p><p>Same issue with the Twitter app.&nbsp; It seems to show a 22 MB download starting - then revises that to a 4 MB download which takes a LONG time and doesn't complete (even on WiFi or LTE).&nbsp; Then I see the error code.</p>

            I agree with battery drain from Edge and screen. Even on my Lumia 928, WP8.1 went almost an entire day before needing to recharge and I'm a relatively, heavy user - constantly checking emails, browsing web, using social media, pretty much all day because
 I work from home and don't feel like sitting in front of my desktop all day in between jobs coming in. Now, with Windows 10 Mobile preview, I can barely go 2 to&nbsp;3 hours of use (again, relatively heavy use) without needing a recharge! After checking background
 apps, the major culprit was Edge. I turned it off to prevent it from running in the background and that seemed to help... a bit.

    <title>Team Travel Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennisarmstrong3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Team Travel Calendar</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm attempting to build a calendar for my team that will auto-populate with their appointments, meetings and trips without me having to manually enter them.&nbsp; I'd like for it to be a separate calendar from my own calendar that when I'm invited to the event
 it populates to my calendar, I'd like a separate calendar that the entire team can use that will show everyone's travel schedule at a glance.&nbsp; It will be a separate team calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I need to create a separate and new alias to create this calendar?&nbsp; I'm having trouble getting this done and would like some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hi Dennis,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to your description, I did some test and research about creating a separate calendar in Teams which was used to auto-populate Teams members meetings and appointments. As far as I know, the separate calendar for
 recording teams members meetings and appointments is not available in Teams. When we try to schedule a team meeting, the meeting event will auto-populate to our default calendar, and there is no other calendars can be choose to save the meeting event in Teams.
 My test result you can see as below:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As this feature is not available in Teams, it is recommended that please give your feedback to
