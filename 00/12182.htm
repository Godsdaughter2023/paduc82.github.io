<h2>            Cannot Sync Gmail with new Lumia 900</h2>
                    I purchased a lumia 900 today and have been trying in vain for hours to get it to sync with my gmail account. All I get is an error saying that m.google,cin us currently unavailable and the error code is 85010017.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've trying decreasing the number of days to sync (as was suggested for this error code and older windows mobile phones) to no avail. Checked and double checked my password and sign-in information. It does the same thing if connected to wifi or the data
 network.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help would be appreciated... I'm not excited about going back to the microsoft store tomorrow for a fix or to return the phone.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <div>Just got the Lumia 900 yesterday. &nbsp;Love the phone so far, but I use Google for contacts, calendars, etc. &nbsp;The automatic setup for Google accounts (email, contacts, calendar, etc.) does not work. &nbsp;I get "Google Error m.google.com is currently unavailable.
 &nbsp;Try again later. &nbsp;Last tried 2 minutes ago. &nbsp;Error code: &nbsp;85010017" &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've tried deleting and redoing the setup several time, but got the same error. &nbsp;The only way I got it to work was to do a manually setup:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. &nbsp;Settings --&gt; Email + Accounts</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Add an Account --&gt; Advanced Setup. &nbsp;Enter your email address &amp; password. &nbsp;Select Exchange ActiveSync.</div>
<div>3. &nbsp;Settings:&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Username: &nbsp;full @gmail.com email address</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Password: &nbsp;regular gmail.com password</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Server: &nbsp; &nbsp;m.google.com</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; SSL Connection: &nbsp;checkmark yes</div>
<div><br />
<div>It didn't work at first and gave the same error. &nbsp;I left it for 30 minutes and checked again and it was working? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Glad I got it working, I was about to take it back.</div>

                    <p><span>I use MS Outlook 2007 as my email program and would like to 'enable animations' as the default, rather than have to click on "Actions", then
 "Other Actions", then "View in Browser", to get the animated emoticons and animated clipart to animate. Is there a setting, checkbox, or toggle switch that would make this the default? It is a nuisance to go through this tedious procedure every time I want
 to animate an incoming emoticon or clipart.</span></p>

<h2>            Word Dropdown</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a drop down with 2 options, the problem I'm running into is that what I'm trying to put in as options exceed the limit of how many characters are allowed in the text box (before anyone asks, no, I can't shorten what I have as options).
 So I'm wondering if there's an alternative to this, or if there's a way to break said limit. I'm working with&nbsp;Word 2013 and&nbsp;I'm not as savvy with word as I am with excel and adobe, so this is new territory for me. So if&nbsp;anyone can, please break it down step
 by step, thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You can't do this with the legacy dropdown control. You can do it with an ActiveX combo box, and if your choices are 256 characters or less you can do it with a dropdown content control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can stay within the 256-character limit, and if users all have Word 2007 or later (currently Windows only, not Word for Mac), then the content control is the preferable solution because it will display the entire choice in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's not possible, the ActiveX combo box *may* work for you. First, I'm not sure ActiveX is supported in Word for Mac; someone else will have to weigh in on that. Second, the combo box requires macro code to operate, so it will run into security issues
 on some computers. Third, the combo box itself will display only one line for each choice (it has to scroll sideways to read the whole thing), and the code will have to transfer the complete text of the choice to some location in the document outside the combo
 box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code will look something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Private Sub ComboBox1_Change()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.Range.InsertAfter ComboBox1.Value &amp; vbCr<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Private Sub Document_New()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Combo_Initialize<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Private Sub Document_Open()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Combo_Initialize<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Private Sub Combo_Initialize()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With ComboBox1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .AddItem "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth " &amp; _<br />

<p>On Mac Word, the situation is as follows</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. The only control type available in the developer tab are the legacy forms controls</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. ActiveX controls do not work, as you suspected. AIUI they will never be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. in Word 2016 (at least the 365 version), a number of the content controls do now "function". At least some types will communicate withe the XML data store. However, there are many limitations</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - there are no UI features for inserting them or setting their properties</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - the object model does not yet contain the APIs for content control or xml custom part objects or collections. If you want to access content controls programmatically when Word is running, you have to use the new JavaScript APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't looked at a much more detailed level than that so for example I do not know whether the same 256-character limit exists on Mac.</p>

<p>Thanks, Peter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the dropdown content control is one of the ones that "function" on the Mac, that may be an acceptable choice -- subject to confirming that it accepts as long an entry as in Windows. If the purpose in this case is just to display one or the other of two
 choices, the lack of programmatic access won't be important. If the document is created in Windows, the lack of UI on the Mac to insert and configure the control also won't be a problem; it just has to display and be enabled when opened on a Mac.</p>

</p><p>1. If your users will have access to your template then you might be able to create building blocks of the two options and then using a building block content control filtered to show only those two building blocks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If you could uses shorter options to trigger and display the full text then you could possibly use a dropdown CC and its Exit event.&nbsp; For example, this code is used with a DDCC titled "Test" with three options "X, Y and Z"<br />
<br />
Private Sub Document_ContentControlOnExit(ByVal ContentControl As ContentControl, Cancel As Boolean)<br />
Dim Content<br />
&nbsp; Select Case ContentControl.Title<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "Test"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ContentControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Type = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Case .Range.Text<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Is = "X": Content = String(500, "X")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Is = "Y": Content = String(500, "Y")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Is = "Z": Content = String(500, "Z")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Range.Text = Content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Type = 4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp; End Select<br />
lbl_Exti:<br />
&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Otherwise I suppose you could use a userform.</p>

<h3> hafengr  say:</h3>
<h2>            My copy of Windows 10 Pro from Insider program will not boot.</h2>
                    <p>I have participated in the windows insider program and on July 29th I was updated to what I would call the final Issue from the Insider program. Somewhere between March 3 through the 5th of 2016 something happened and my Windows 10 Pro will not boot. I have
 tried to fix it with a USB and DVD copy of Windows 10 ISO but nether fixed the problem. In-fact&nbsp;when making the DVD it failed at the end of verification 10 times.&nbsp;I then tried the software imbedded in windows to fix itself and that did not work.
<br />
</p>
<p>Is there a way I can get this system back through wiping down my drive and starting over by installing a fresh copy of my Windows 7 and updating to the Issues of Pro that I had through the insider program&nbsp;or is there some other way I can get my windows 7&nbsp;
 back to Windows 10 at least. If I were to stop being involved in the Insider Program would I be able to upgrade my Windows 7 to 10&nbsp; for a the free copy that people can get until July 29th of 2016? I&nbsp; am stuck in the water here for the&nbsp;Image&nbsp;copy I made of
 my drive in on the drive with the problems and that I can not access at all no matter what I have tried. I dual boot and I tried to look at the drive load that has the Win10Pro but access is denied. I really hope I did not lose this permanently for Win10Pro
 is just fantastic and I was enjoying it very much. Can someone who knows what I can do please let me know.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone from Microsoft will answer this post and help me out here. I really don't want to stop in the Insider program but If I must to get Win10 at least I will just have to do that. HELP!!! LOL. Thanks! As a comedian I heard once said, Talk to
 me like a three year old during this please. I built my system but the language sometimes trips me up. In addition I am not a professional at working with the insides of windows.</p>

            <p>Same as I posted on your other posting you need to do a clean install as I outlined, as your problem of not being able to make a good DVD, suggestion see if one of your friends can make one as I don't think MS will be able to fix this without seeing your
 system, as your problems of not being able to make a ISO is &nbsp;very rare, as I'm out of tips to help as I have helped others with clean install with no troubles with the info posted.

            <p>Yes Joe, I had made absolutely no changes to the bios at all prior to the trouble I am having. System was in perfect condition until around the fourth or fifth of this month. As suggested by&nbsp; some other the only thing I changed recently is the fast boot
 setting. I disabled it for now. Anyway I am thankful for all your input, it has helped.

            Max, Thank you for drawing it all out step by step. Very helpful indeed. I have been trying to find this information for a week now. Somehow I just could not find any link that I had seen to take me there. Thank you again. Tomorrow I will get to work on
 this since I am off work finally and will have the time it would take to get it done finally. I'll keep you guys posted on my progress!

<h3> spotty999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password recovery</h2>
                    I recently opened a second email address in Outlook in addition to the one I currently use.&nbsp; I set it up with a password but now the password does not seem to work.&nbsp; I then go to a password recovery page that requires information to verify who I am so
 that I can get my password resent to me via my original email account.&nbsp; This verification page asks for credit card info.&nbsp; I know that is not necessary since I am only trying to recover a password for my new, second email account.&nbsp; The information they are
 asking for sounds similar to some type of account my son has with his XBox.&nbsp; I know that requires monthly payments.&nbsp; How can I recover my password for my new email account? I would like Microsoft to send my password for my new email account to my old email
 account which I can access.

    <title>Switching Office subscription E3 from GoDaddy to Microsoft, WITHOUT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjlaugle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Switching Office subscription E3 from GoDaddy to Microsoft, WITHOUT moving the domain from GoDaddy.</h2>
                    <p>My original business setup is through GoDaddy.&nbsp; This includes the domain services and my MS Office subscription.&nbsp; Other posts describe moving from GoDaddy to Microsoft and that generally sounds straight forward, but they were doing what sounded like a complete
 business move.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What is not clear is whether or not I can just move my MS Office / Office 365 subscription away from GoDaddy, yet keep my domain services with GoDaddy?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Are the services GoDaddy provides for Office separable from their domain services?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If I move my MS Office subscription do I also need to move my domain support?&nbsp;
</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jeff,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, I understand that you want to move your Office 365 subscription bought from GoDaddy to Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that it is not feasible to directly moving the data from a subscription from one tenant to another. And also directly moving an Office 365 tenant in GoDaddy to Microsoft is not feasible. It is required that manually remove
 the custom domain from the existing tenant in GoDaddy and cancel the Office 365 subscription in GoDaddy. Then purchase an Office 365 subscription in Microsoft and add the domain into this Office 365 subscription. Here are the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Remove your custom domain from the existing tenant bought from GoDaddy.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Cancel your Office 365 plan in GoDaddy.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: As you purchase the plan from GoDaddy which is a Syndicate Partner of Microsoft, the interface or steps might be different from the ones bought from Microsoft directly, you may need to consult GoDaddy support for the detailed steps
 to do the above actions.</span></p>
<p><span>3. <a href="https://products.office.com/en/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Purchase an Office 365 plan from Microsoft directly</a>.</span></p>

Add and verify your domain in Office 365</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: To back up data before performing the steps above, you can check out this

article</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the information above, here are the answers to your questions:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Q: <em>What is not clear is whether or not I can just move my MS Office / Office 365 subscription away from GoDaddy, yet keep my domain services with GoDaddy?</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The answer is yes, you can keep your domain service with GoDaddy. However, as what mentioned above, you need to Remove your custom domain from the existing tenant bought from GoDaddy and then add and verify it in the new tenant purchased
 from Microsoft directly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Q: <em>Are the services GoDaddy provides for Office separable from their domain services?</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please contact the GoDaddy support to identify it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Q: <em>If I move my MS Office subscription do I also need to move my domain support?</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You don’t need to change the domain support, you need to remove and re-add the domain.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>

    <title>email not working any more on nokia E52 since august 2015 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> talpira  say:</h3>
<h2>            email not working any more on nokia E52 since august 2015</h2>
                    <p>My Gmail stopped working this august on the phone (E51). Can send mails, but can't download mails in the inbox. Previuosly (I have my phone since 2012) everything worked perfectly. I am wondering if a path has changed somewhere (since mobiles are now supported
 by Microsoft and not Nokia), as I can access Internet with the phone, but not the nokia links. However I have found no guidance on how to fix this. I've read several posts on not working e-mails and already tried the following and did not work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset the gmail mailbox- tried POP and IMAP settings, changing my Gmail settings accordingly-</p>
<p>Tried with exchange mailbox instead.</p>
<p>Reloaded nokia suite on my pc, did a backup of the phone and a second backup only of contacts, pictures and messages.</p>
<p>Did a hard reset of the phone and from the backup I only retrieved contacts and messages.</p>
<p>I tried a software re-install, but this time my pc crashes giving "kernel security check failure". Tried again with only nokia suite running. Same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 8.1 on the pc and my nokia software version is 091.003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Thanks</p>

            thank you for your answer. I tried, but my pc crashes again, even with nokia suite not running, with the same message "kernel security check failure". This happens after the download, when the install phase on the phone begins.

            <p>Talpira, your issue about Gmail is normal and expected behaviour since July 2015. You face the same issue as every Nokia E72 user does. Using the Recovery Tool is of no help, in your case. For details, please,&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/76b26242-017e-421e-bb16-5d1d5905d94b?threadId=a883dc92-571a-481c-a295-58c51c7677ed">continue
 there …</a></p>
<p>

<p>thank you for your answer. &nbsp;I actually had an expired certificate and could replace it, but it did not solve my problem. I have an E52 phone. Is this the same as E51 or as E72?</p>

            The Nokia E52 is the same as the Nokia E72. You should go for all steps. In case of GMail, you
<em>have to</em> go for step 3 (installing the Networking Improvements.sis). Did that help?

<h2>            Nokia 6500 Classic - Charging problem after battery is empty - serial batch problem</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have recently received a Nokia 6500 classic which worked quite ok apart from the following problem:<br />
<br />
As long as there is still some energy in the battery - the phone will charge well.<br />
<br />
However - if the battery runs completely out until the phone shuts off - the phone will not charge again. Connecting the charger does not charge the phone and the charger emits a high frequency continuos "beeeeeeeeep" tone.<br />
<br />
The USB cable will also not work.<br />
<br />
I have replaced the phone within 48 hours and received a completely new 6500 Classic with exactly the same problem which leads me to suspect that this is a batch problem.<br />
<br />
The phone battery does not last for long which means that many times you will find yourself stretching the battery all the way till its flat.<br />
<br />
Any solution to the problem?

            this particular unit takes upto 15 minutes before charging indication is shown if the battery is completely flat and this is because the phone has another option as usb charging.and the phone gives first priority to battery then the display indication
 as compared to other phones.best is to use charger like ac-6.USB is not recommended.cheers.:)

            Are you sure? where did you get this information?<br />
<br />
I actually used an AC-6 - which emitted very strange high frequency noise when the battery was flat.<br />
<br />
Also, I did let it charge for about 30 minutes and nothing was display nor did the phone turn on with or without the charger in the phone. What do you think?

That's a pretty patronising reply and it's also completely unhelpful. I bought a classic in November and liked it enough at first to buy my husband one as well for Christmas. Mine charges exactly as described taking a while to show the battery charging screen,
 but the newer phone was tricky to charge from the outset and this weekend refused to charge completely leaving my husband stuck in the West Country starting out on a round of client visiting with no phone. It is completely dead - you can leave it charging
 on its proper mains charger as long as you like and nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Furthermore this model has problems with its software. If you get a missed call then every so often the phone crashes and you have to take the battery out, put it in again, then turn the phone on and sometimes you even have to enter the time and date again.
 Last time it happened I was meant to be meeting my young children at the park and they couldn't contact me because my phone had packed up.<br />
<br />
All in all, a beautiful phone but it doesn't work too well. And the sound quality is really bad (I'm told because it's so thin) and the battery is short-lived (same reason) unless you turn off bluetooth etc. Not the best money I ever spent.<br />
<br />
And I don't think it's a batch problem either as you can find lots of people posting on this discussion site with the same problem right from when the phone launched.

            I just discovered this post after looking for "6500 charging problem" after I fully depleted my battery today... I connected it and noticed a high frequency sound coming out of the charger which I didn't hear before... also I tried to switch my phone on,
 because I thought, since it's connected to the charger it should immediatly run... well it didn't switch on and the strange sound persisted... usb didn't seem to work too... after reading this thread I just let it "charge" on the charger minutes and voila,
 after like 10-15 minutes the screen switched on and it showed the charging symbol...<br />
<br />
phew ;-)<br />
<br />
So this seems just to be the normal, even if strange, behaviour.

            I am also experiencing difficulty (in general, but more with recharging and holding any power) with my 6500 classic.<br />
<br />
And this is the second one I have had. About 3 days ago, after the battery ran flat yet again, I charged it on the full power AC charger for a few hours (2 or 3) only to find the battery had only increased to 1/3 power. I figured it was yet another software
 fault, so switched it off, removed the battery, placed the battery back in and switched it on, all to no avail.<br />
<br />
Since then I have tried to download newer firmware, I had the latest version, which incidentally triplicated my contacts), have restored the unit to factory settings and have had to resort to having it plugged in constantly, as after one phone call, I get the
 low battery warning.<br />
<br />
I don’t use it to play music, I don’t use the camera, I use it as a phone. I have the screen saver turned off, the power saver turned on and only have Bluetooth active when I’m in my car, to connect to the hands free kit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this battery or phone problem? Am I likely to get assistance from Nokia or my phone company? Should I cut my losses and get something that actually works?<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, this is a horrible phone in my opinion. Whilst I will admit it was naive of me to believe that I could get "5.5 hours of talk time and 16 days of standby" from such a slim phone, I barley got 2 hours of talk time from this. The phone is less
 than 8 months old (or seven, or 6 as it's the second phone) and I'd consider never using another Nokia, even though I have been a convert (I never used to like them) for the last 4 years.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I apologise for the rant I am just frustrated.

            It just cut out whilst I was on a call.<br />
<br />
And it was plugged in "Charging" (that's what the screen said).

<p>I need help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had my 6500c for a couple of years and I love it. However my battery is a nightmare.</p>
<p>I have bought a new one, and also bought a charger adapter so I can charge it from my AC-3X nokia charger, as the 6500 charger made a funny hum so I threw it away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However now it only randomly accepts a charge, and last night I charged it all night and it showed fulkl in monring, and as soon as i unplugged charger it showed low battery, then ran out totally and switched off 2 hours later (with no calls made)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP!</p>

<p>I had the same problems as well and it was really annoying but still i loved that mobile. The solution to my problem was just to change the battery. It helped a lot as the battery lasts longer than the original one. As for the charger i haven't changed it
 so i am still having the same problem with it.</p>

<h2>            Junk Email Filter Not Available Online</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I get an error that says&nbsp;<span>The Junk E-mail Filter is not available for your Microsoft Exchange Server e-mail account because you are working online. To
 enable the Junk E-mail Filter for this account, switch to Cached Exchange Mode.</span>&nbsp;when I click "Block Sender" on an email. I went into my account settings and Cached Exchange Mode was already checked, so I unchecked it, restarted Outlook, checked it again,
 and restarted Outlook. I still get the same error. Is there anyway to fix this?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting the question in Microsoft Community. As I understand you are facing issues with junk email filter in Outlook 2010. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to troubleshoot the issue you may try the step below:</p>
<p>Create new profile and configure the email account and check if the issue persists:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the new profile does not fix the issue, since it is an Exchange type account configured in Outlook for better suggestions you may also post your question in the below forum for better suggestions:</p>

            Has it been just over 2 months?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
One potential cause is installing, and activating Office on a computer that also has a trial installed. The trial interferes with the activation of the purchased copy.<br />
<br />
Go into programs and features and check to see if you have more than one copy of Office installed. Look specifically for "Microsoft Office 2010 Single Image".<br />

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
If you find a trial, uninstall it AND repair the purchased copy to fix any registry entries that were pointing to the trial.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, updates can also cause this type of problem. No, I have not heard of any that have specifically been identified.
<br />
<br />
Another possible fix is to close all of your Office apps, the right click on the icon for one of them and select "run as administrator".

<span>Win 7 5 ways to Run As Admin</span>

</i></span></p>
<p><span>FYI: for this situation, you can consider Vista and Win7 to be essentially interchangeable with only minor differences between the user interface in the 2 versions.</span></p>
<p>In Windows 7, even when you are logged in as administrator, UAC no longer gives you “Full” administrator rights. To get all of the access you now also have “run as administrator”
</p>
<p>It appears there is an error where your userid is not being allowed to update the activation information in the registry.</p>
<p>The general process is :</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Close all of the office apps</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start one of the Office apps using any one of the following “run as admin” techniques</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Activate office</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Close the app</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start it normally, confirm the message has “gone away”</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If the message is gone, reboot the computer</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start the office app again to confirm that the message really is gone for good (was saved in the registry)</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>What you need to do is "runas admin":</b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to the start menu and find the program icon you want to start</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;Shift&gt; &lt;Right Click&gt; on it</li><li>Select “Run as …”</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>If that doesn’t work try this: </b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the start menu, right click on the shortcut for any Office app, select “RunAs Admin”<br />
If runas does not appear, right click and drag the shortcut to the desktop </p>
<ul>
<li>create a shortcut on the desktop. </li><li>Right click on the desktop shortcut,</li><li>&nbsp;runas admin should be there.</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    Hi, sorry if this sounds stupid but is there any way to find conversation history from a person who is no longer on your contact list? The old versions of Skype used to leave the old conversations until you deleted them yourself but now, it seems that
 when you remove a contact it deletes all trace of them. Any help please?&nbsp;

            Correct, the search results stopped working in recent builds. As far as I know, this was intentional - the Outlook Social Connector/ People pane feature is deprecated and will be removed from a future version.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have several excel files stored on a shared server in my workplace.&nbsp; I use these files from the same computer daily.</p>
<p>When I &nbsp;tried to open one such file today in Excel 2007. It gave me the following error:<br />
<br />
"Excel cannot open the file '(filename)'.xlsx' because the file&nbsp;format or file extension is not valid. Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file extension matches the format of the file."</p>
<p>I tried ctrl shift I and got the code 101590</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<p>Opening in 2003 - the same prob,</p>
<p>I have changed the file names to .xls - still doesnt work<br />
<br />
I've tried the "Open and Repair" option of Excel, but to no avail.</p>
<p>I tried copying it with no luck.</p>
<p>I tried 3 different computers...nothing!</p>
<p>I AM BASICALLY LEFT WITH A BLANK SPREADSHEET - ALL THAT HAPPENS IS THE TAB NAME IS CHANGED TO THE FILE NAME THE REST IS BLANK!</p>
<p>Can someone please help me out, these are really important work files. Any effective solution will be&nbsp;really appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi, try this</p>
<p>Go to your desktop and click on my computer, then go to Tools, folder options,File types and check if you have xlsx extension there if not click on New and add it. I had the same issue some time ago and I solved in that way</p>

I can find xlsx extention in the path specified. So this is not the reason for whatever has happened to my file.</p>

I am able to open all the files locally as well as in Domain. This particular one is off. I had tried the solution provided in the link but no, it did not help.</p>

<p>The fact is the size of my file is 0 bytes and I am just having a blank workbook. How to recover the contents last saved?</p>

            <p>In trying to resolve your problem, one of things you may need to do is to determine whether you are actually dealing with Excel 2007 files or Excel 2003 files.</p>
<p>I believe that Excel 2007/2010 files of the format XLSX, XLSM or XLAM are, in effect, cabinet or ZIP files.&nbsp; I have used this property in the past to determine if a file was really an Office 2007/2010 file, or if it was from an earlier version of Office,
 but with the extension modified to look like an Office 2007/2010 file.</p>
<p>To determine if the file is a valid XLSX, XLSM, XLAM&nbsp;file (Excel 2007/2010):</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; MOST IMPORTANT!!&nbsp; Take a copy of the file.&nbsp; The next steps should be done on your copy, NOT the original.</p>
<p>2. Change the file extension to ZIP, e.g.&nbsp; copy BOOK1.XLSX to BOOK1_a.ZIP.</p>
<p>3. Double-click on the file in&nbsp;Windows Explorer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the file is a valid XLSX, XLSM or XLAM file, you should see an 'explorer' window open with three folders displayed:
</p>
<p>a) _rels</p>
<p>b) docProps</p>
<p>c) xl</p>
<p>There will also be a file called [Content_Types].xml.</p>
<p>If those are not present, then I'd suggest that it is not a valid Excel 2007/2010 file.</p>

 any sound. Any ideas what's going wrong?

<p><span>Hi Carina,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To move forward, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. About the issue, I’d like you to upload a video showing the symptom of the issue you are experiencing. You can upload the video in the shared folder mentioned in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Check if the issue happens in a specific PowerPoint file.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the PowerPoint 2016 for Mac application you are using. You can access the page via PowerPoint&gt;About PowerPoint.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Check if the issue happens in a specific narration.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Did the issue happen before? When did the issue happen? What did you do before the issue happened?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, I suggest you restart your Mac and then do a test to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

                    I create an excel worksheet then, I create a document. I copy the worksheet content and did an special paste into Word to paste as Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object.
<br />
<br />
Close the document, and in the next day, I open the document again and the excel sheet was transformed into image.
<br />
<br />
Why this happen?<br />
It is possible to revert? <br />

            Thanks for reply.<br />
<br />
It's occur in many documents, but not all word files. The double click doesn't work because the embedded excel is now an image. I can not double click. When I click the table, the toolbar change to Picture Tools toolbar.<br />
<br />
The other thread is refering a different problem .. <br />

Thanks a lot. <br />

<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-HA010354315.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-HA010354315.aspx</a>

<p>Once the embedded object is changed to image, it cannot be converted back to its original form. Try creating a new document with Excel embedded and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issuer persists, then delete the Word Data and Options registry key and verify the results. For more information on how to do that, refer to the section “Manual steps to
 troubleshoot problems that occur when you start or use Word” in the article:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore,
 make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up refer:

            Thanks for reply.<br />
<br />
I disabled all Add-Ins. Try opening a recent saved document, and the embedded excel table is still an excel table.
<br />
<br />
I'm going to try more and let you know if the problem is not repeating again ....<br />

            Well MS employees do not look into these forums, to contact MS directly, its better if you call them.<br />
That said, if it with a few files only, then you have to look for reasons why it is doing that.<br />
I can only think of a similar issue which was caused by a few specific key presses.<br />
I am not sure of the key combinations though.<br />

            <p>It took me forever to fix this problem, and I tried several things.&nbsp; I think it was a combination of these that fixed my problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In Excel 2010 - Click File.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click Options.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Click Add-Ins.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Deactivate any COM Add-in items that you see in the list under Type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; I discovered that my Word document was originally a Microsoft Word 97-2003 Document (.doc) that I had opened and resaved as a 2010 Document (.docx).</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; So, I opened a NEW blank document, went back to my MS Word 97-2003 Document, did Ctrl A, Ctrl C - (which copied all of that document), and then I pasted (Ctrl V) the document into the new blank document.&nbsp; When it asked if I wanted to save my new document,
 I saved it as a 2010 (.docx) document.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; Then I deleted the MS Word 97-2003 Document so I wouldn't accidentally use it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I did all of the above, my document has not changed any of my embedded worksheets into an Image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this works for you!</p>

            What I get from your description is that the underlying problem was either one of your COM Add-ins or a problem with legacy issues with the underlying Word template.
<div><br />
<div>I have the same problem, and have just now realized that it only seems to happen in my memo template - something I have brought with me through multiple versions of Word. &nbsp;I will try creating an entirely clean docx template and see if that helps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope so, because I can't work without certain add-ins that connect my work to my document management system.</div>

<h2>            Exchange 2010 and Outlook 2016 Double Emails &#40;SMTP&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We're having trouble to locate a difficult and quite annoying problem, which could be with the settings in the computer, the exchange or the outlook itself (which probably has to do something with the computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trouble itself is that users sends double emails (Intermittent) of the same email.</p>
<p>We think that its has nothing to do with syncronization, more of how the user handle the computer.</p>
<p>We've noticed that the user normally sends 1 email, then shuts down the display (its a laptop) and take the computer with them home and then boots it up. When the machine boots up (wake from sleepmode or just open the display) the second email is sent, with
 the same content and same tag etc, so exactly the same email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're using Windows 10 pro 1607 -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchange 2010 14.03.0352.000 (windows server 2012 r2)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office pro plus 2016 16.0.4266.1001</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>

<p>That is often caused by having a virus scanner installed which integrates itself with Outlook.<br />
It is highly recommended to always disable this type of integration;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Disable virus scanner integration?</a></p>

<p>Hello Roady and thanks for a Quick answer.</p>
<p>Im sorry to say that your answer have only added more questions for me.</p>
<p>Please bear with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're using windows Defender and it doesnt scan mails right?</p>
<p>If it does, i cant find a way to disable it through GPO.</p>
<p>We dont want to disable all functions from Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The side note you've mentioned that we have an old version of Outlook scares me.
</p>
<p>We are using WSUS and a office 2016 pro MSI installer, but i cant get it to function through GPO to update the office, maybe you could show the way to where i can get the info?</p>
<p>

                    MSE tells me it found "<span style="font-weight: bold">SettingsModifier:Win32/PossibleHostsFileHijack</span>".&nbsp; Naturally, I assumed it was in my hosts file, so I went to see what had been removed.<br />
<br />
127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; www.google-analytics.com, and<br />
127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a248.e.akamai.net<br />
<br />
Ummm...<br />
<br />
Now while I was comparing my spare copy with the working copy, MSE went and "disinfected" my spare copy.&nbsp; Strike two!<br />
<br />
But my real problem is that while (this time) MSE had done nothing constructive, it doesn't actually tell me what it had removed in the first place.&nbsp; I should not have to compare copies of a file to find what mutilation has occurred.&nbsp; In the History tab, if
 a HIPS event has been detected, then enough detail should be supplied to allow me an INFORMED decision whether or not to "allow" the offence.<br />
<br />
When dealing with a suspected HIPS, MSE must give the IP address associated with the subject.&nbsp; In my case, I absolutely NEED to know the address is not 127.0.0.1 (ie: not in the house).&nbsp; Anything with 127.0.0.1 is at worst an annoyance since it ain't going
 noplace anytime soon, and at all other times it is a GOOD THING, 'cos it ain't going noplace anytime atall.<br />
<br />
So, now I have a less than secure system because in order to protect a valuable resource I have had to tell MSE to LEAVE IT ALONE.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">MICROSOFT PLEASE LISSEN UP:</span></span>&nbsp; I like the concept of a simple, lightweight AV.&nbsp; I am glad that MS is competing in this market.&nbsp; But you need an "Advanced" tab for people like

            <p>You have posted in the virus and malware forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your question is about Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registrty Editor is a component of Windows that is use to edit the registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you are technically knowledgeable about the registry, I advise against using the Registry Editor.&nbsp; Improper editing could render your PC useless.</p>

    <title>SharePoint Calendar Shows Start Date 1 day ahead of the Date Captured - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SharePoint Calendar Shows Start Date 1 day ahead of the Date Captured via Forms and Flow</h2>
                    <p>I am using Microsoft Forms, SharePoint, and Flow to capture Time Off requests for employees and have noticed that the SharePoint Event Start Time field and End Time field are changing the dates, moving them one day sooner than what is requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that the data in Forms is captured correctly and that the data in Flow is captured correctly. Despite that, SharePoint is changing the date data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how I might be able to accurately represent this information in SharePoint?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, an employee indicates that they'd like to take 10-29-2018 to 11-01-2018 off. These dates are captured correctly and appear correctly in Forms and Flow but not in SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot of the data being captured in Flow from Forms (see response details for dates)</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the issue, we would like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is your time zone same as the <span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
person who entered the data</span>? </li><li>If the responder adds an event directly in SharePoint calendar, will the date appear correctly on your end?
</li><li>From the screenshot it appears you are using classic SharePoint online site and you’ve added Calendar app, correct?
</li><li>Please provide detail steps on how you created Microsoft Forms and how did you link to calendar.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neha</p>
        </p>
