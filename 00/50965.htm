            <p>This doesn't work, because there is no second account in the 'user accounts' menu. I have this exact problem, and i have it on all my devices now (all windows 10), my laptop, tablet and now my PC after putting it to sleep one time.</p>

                    <p>My ACER PC is getting an error message "E-Data security software was not loaded properly. Re-install the software"...I dont have the software , it came pre-loaded. Also, my PC is "dragging"...it lags a little when I click and enter. You can hear the motor
 runnnnnnning in the tower, like it is loading. I mostly play scrabble on this thing, and sometimes I have to wait 10 seconds to play a letter ..it just won't let me do anything--and then it does. I am frustrated because I just spent 400 dollars to get it cleaned
 up..help.</p>

            If the E-Data security software is complaining, you probably don't have an XP problem - you probably have an Acer E-Data security software problem.<br />
<br />
Have you checked the <a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Acer WWW site</a> to see if you can perhaps download the E-Data software and reinstall it?&nbsp; I would check it out for you but we don't know anything about your system model except it is a tower ACER PC (they make more than one kind).&nbsp; We also don't know anything
 about your XP version, Service Pack, AV software, etc.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Maybe someday the XP forums "Ask a question" dialog will ask these questions automatically when a new thread is started so I do not have to ask them every single time.&nbsp; It might even be possible to resolve an issue in a single reply when enough information
 is provided.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
When you did a Google search for <span style="font-style: italic">WMI Performance Adapter</span>, what did you find out about it?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These 126 events - over what time period?&nbsp; A week, a day, an hour?&nbsp; Does the Service appear to be constantly starting and stopping?<br />
<br />
I don't think you need the WMI Performance Adapter Service to be running at all (the default it for it to start manually), but somebody else cn perhaps clarify that.<br />
<br />
If you need more help, then do this:<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your 7035 and 7026 events, those are normal - especially when the system reboots - you may see a few of them as the system starts and stops XP Services.&nbsp; If you double click one of the events, it will open and you can see what Service is being sent start/stop
 controls and when/if they enter the running state.<br />
<br />
You can look up events here:<br />
<a href="http://www.eventid.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.eventid.net/</a><br />
<br />
If you see events you wonder about, post them here for some analysis.&nbsp; Here is how to do that:<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a method to post the specific information about individual events.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc <br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
The most interesting logs are usually the Application and System logs.<br />
<br />
Some logs such as Security and Internet Explorer may be completely empty or have only a few items.&nbsp; The default settings for XP is not to log all that activity unless you need to troubleshoot some issue in those areas.&nbsp; If you enable the logging for them the
 logs fill up quickly and could negatively effect your system performance with all the extra (usually unnecessary) activity.<br />
<br />
If you have Microsoft Office installed, it has its own logs and they may be empty or occasional boring activity or very little activity if there is no problem with your Office applications.&nbsp; This is normal.<br />
<br />
Not every event is a problem, some are informational messages that things are working okay and some are warnings.<br />
<br />
However, no event should defy reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
Each event is sorted by Date and Time.&nbsp; Errors will have red Xs, Warnings will have yellow !s.
<br />
Information messages have white is.&nbsp; Not every Error or Warning event means there is a serious issue.
<br />
<br />
Some are excusable at startup time when Windows is booting.&nbsp; Try to find just the events at the date and time around your problem.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event
 details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button under the up and down arrows to copy the details and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste or CTRL-V) the detail text back here for analysis.&nbsp;
 Remove any personal information from your information after pasting if you are compelled to do so.<br />
<br />
If you paste an Event, it will look something like this boring system startup event:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7035<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7/14/2010<br />
Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5:54:18 PM<br />
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose<br />
Computer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
The Remote Access Connection Manager service was successfully sent a start control.<br />
<br />
<br />
To get a fresh start on any Event Viewer log, you can choose to clear the log (backing up the log is offered), then reproduce your issue, then look at just the events around the time of your issue and troubleshoot the events that are happening when you have
 your issue.<br />
<br />
You can look up events on the following World Wide Web site and get some ideas.&nbsp; This is where folks have events they see and then post up their questions, ideas and solutions:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.eventid.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eventid.net/</a><br />
<br />
If you find your event in the discussion, the first idea or discussion does not necessarily mean it is the "answer" for your situation, so read through all of the ideas to find the one that sounds most like your situation.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Over the past few weeks my system loading screens have slowed to a crawl. With over 220K results in looking at answers.microsoft I thought it best to reapply the question on the current condition/date especially since I can find no way to sort that number

            Sorry for the delay but I wanted to spend more time looking at the problem before I answered. And I'm still not ready because I'm confused by the question "Is there any third party installed on your computer?" Third party what?<br />

            <p>Okay - When I first started this process (and after I wrote the original question) I deleted several programs I'd added over the past couple of months which helped with the original problem but on a couple of programs the disk usage would easily get max'd
 out on the loading screens. It would show single digit transfer speeds (like 4.1M/s) and 100% disk usage. Once they loaded it would back down and the transfer speeds would rise. During those times several other programs would use minimal amounts of transfers
 but nothing speed wise that would indicate it hogging the disk. (I'm not talking about the space on the disk - I've got 500gigs of space).&nbsp; Running the System File Checker today has really sped the operations up by 150% or more, where the speeds have tripled
 from my example above and the usage is below 100% (though being in the 90% range is not unusual). At this point I'm not unhappy about the outcome of our efforts here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a bit confused as to how my transfer speed can be so low and yet the usage is so high and when the usage starts to drop the transfer speed and zoom up toward 150 m/s. Especially when these other system programs are not particularly doing much operations
 using the disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess i should mention that the programs in question do have a connection to the internet which is needed to run them (lets say, Blizzard's World of Warcraft as an example). That is one aspect that needs to mentioned and added to the mix if one is going
 to be able to explain why the preceding paragraph happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So until someone has something germane to add I'm signing off...</p>
<p>Regards &amp; thanks</p>

<p>Hi Kate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're having an issue on the Windows 10 product key, there is a method on which you can activate Windows 10 without a product key as long as you have a digital license.
<span>During reinstallation, if you’re asked to enter a product key, you can <em>
skip this step</em>. Windows&nbsp;10 will automatically activate online after the installation is complete.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We suggest that you refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12440/windows-10-activation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for a walkthrough. Look for the section that says <strong>Activating after reinstalling Windows 10
</strong>and follow the steps given.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>You will need to contact refurbisher about getting reinstall media, but if Windows 10 Pro was already installed and activated, you don't have to enter a key to activate again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be
 stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through
 the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>you
 already own&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>

                    <p>I would like help changing the email address for my PC login. When I first got my PC I was still in college. At the time I used my school email address as the main administration email address. But now that I am out of school, my school email address no
 longer exists. And because of that, I can no longer properly sign on to microsoft using that email address, which also affects my OneDrive. Is there a way to change the email address to a different one or removed my old school address from being the main administrator
 address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Well you're gonna love this. I did some more research and found the answer.&nbsp; My view thing was set to thumbnails instead of icons.&nbsp; I changed it to icons and it's fine now.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; I don't even know how it got set to thumbnails in the first place, but.....&nbsp;&nbsp;
 No more green bar! Whew!&nbsp; </p>

            Do you have a Toshiba? If yes, then that file may belong to the TrueSuite Access Manager fingerprint recognition software. If you don't use this program, you can uninstall it (Control Panel&gt;Programs &amp; Features) or simply disable it from running at Startup:<br />
<br />
<span>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: msconfig and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue. Then see what is on the Startup tab.&nbsp;You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used the Utility.
 Usually in Vista this will be blocked by Windows Defender and you'll need to allow it so you can then tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
Important - Do not use the System Configuration Utility to stop processes. Instead, use Services.<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: services and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run As Administrator". Confirm elevation as needed.<br />
<br />
The free Autoruns program is very useful for managing your Startup - http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx<br />
<br />
Or you may wish to contact Toshiba tech support.</span>

            Yes. The computer came with Windows 10.&nbsp; Then I down loaded Office 2016. Ever since then Outlook may take a day to download mail. How do I shut off Windows 10 Mail? Or vice versa?

    <title>How to use Task Scheduler to send an email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlie cooper  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to use Task Scheduler to send an email</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows Live Mail + Windows 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want my computer to send an email to someone on it's own. I opened task scheduler and created a new task using Task Scheduler to 'send and email'. The problem is that the program only asks me who it's to, who the email is from and what smtp server to use...
 it doesn't ask for my mail server log-in and username so in theory it would fail... and when it comes to send the message, currently it doesn't do anything without any error message.</p>
<p>I have 2 email accounts setup in Windows Live Mail but how do I tell the <em>Task Scheduler</em> program which email account to use and how to login to the account to send it?</p>
<p>best,</p>
<p>Charlie</p>

<p>That task seems to be only usable in limited circumstances where a local Windows based SMTP server is available and security credentials are already established.&nbsp; There's some interesting discussion on this in<br />

 would likely be a problem.</p>
<p>It looks like using a 3rd party utility to contact the external mail server might be the best bet.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, but I'm looking to make use of the 'Send An Email' task that's included in the Task Scheduler... it's something thats been there for a while and I never understood how it would work.. I open Task Scheduler, create a 'basic task' and
 click on 'send email' but I doesn't even ask me for my username or password? only the smtp server and email I want to use!</p>

                    <p>My mother is the kind of PC user that likes to call me late, very late at night and read aloud to me what her computer is telling her to do..</p>
<p>If I am not available, the thing is left there with messages like&nbsp; restart your computer to finish installing updates and so on..</p>
<p>So, I had set the thing to not update automatically by itself, since she often forgets to charge it and it dies during update, or she just doesn't know what to do and hits the wrong button and ends up panicking..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I find&nbsp;the update settings are gone - its no longer possible to change the update settings? No more&nbsp;&nbsp; download but ask me&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't download but alert me to updates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so on.. No settings period. Updates are mandatory?&nbsp; Stumped.</p>

            <p>Hi Dax,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. Let me assist you with your concern regarding Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 RT?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot turn off or disable Automatic update on Windows 8.1 RT device. To make&nbsp;Windows RT more secure, microsoft have setup all updates to download and install automatically through Windows Update when it is connect to internet. So the Windows Update,
 Windows Defender, and Windows Firewall are all up-to–date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On Windows 8/8.1 if you don't want updates to be installed automatically, you can choose to be notified when updates apply to your computer instead. Then, you can download and install them yourself, or you can set Windows to automatically download updates,
 and then notify you so you can install them yourself. Here's how to change how Windows installs or notifies you about updates:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open Windows Update by, typing <span>Update</span>, on Start&nbsp;screen&nbsp;and then, in the list of results, click
<span>Windows Update</span>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>In the left pane, click <span>Change settings</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <span>Important updates</span>, click one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Install updates automatically (recommended)</strong></span> </p>
</li><li>
<p><span><strong>Download updates but let me choose whether to install them</strong></span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span><strong>Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them</strong></span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span><strong>Never check for updates (not recommended)</strong></span> </p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>To schedule your automatic updates, next to <span>Install new updates</span>, select the day and time you want updates to occur.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>To get recommended updates for your computer, under <span>Recommended updates</span>, select the

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, I was referring to my mother's Surface tablet.. This is a major letdown for me. Not being able to postpone the update process until my visit means from now on what was a simple device has in her eyes turned against her, like it did this week. I've
 not been able to drive over yet, and when suddenly confronted with this update she managed to try and press anything to make it go away and its not even letting her enter her pin or password- I have a hard time understanding what the issues are over the phone
 when she tries to render things happening on her tablet lol..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the update policies are ammended in the future..</p>
<p />

    <title>Missing Fallout 3 Achievements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> major boognish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Fallout 3 Achievements </h2>
                    
<p>I've been playing Fallout 3 (Xbox 360 Game) on my Xbox One console over the last few weeks and I have noticed that I am not getting credit for any of the achievements I have recently acquired. I phoned in to Xbox Customer support and the person I spoke with
 said this was a known issue, and to post my achievements here to have them manually unlocked on my account. Here is my troubleshooting ticket which should still be open:<span>SRX1349213356ID.&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;I can't tell you the exact times&nbsp;these were unlocked,
 all I can say is it was over the course of the last few weeks. All prerequisites for the&nbsp;achievements&nbsp;were met, and the&nbsp;achievement&nbsp;notification&nbsp;did pop up on my console when I earned it. However, when I go into my&nbsp;achievements&nbsp;none of them are there. The
 only ones that are showing up&nbsp;are&nbsp;three that I earned a few years ago. All basic troubleshooting steps were done including reloading profile, hard resetting console and&nbsp;verifying&nbsp;console has&nbsp;internet connection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I phoned in today and talked to a different analyst who was very helpful. We spent just over 2 hours troubleshooting the issue. we've exhausted all troubleshooting steps including a factory reset on the console and transferring my saved game to my xbox 360
 console to see if it would pop up there but it didn't. We verified my achievements through the trueachievements website and I definitely met the prerequisites to the achievements. They are not showing up on trueachievements either. Some of the achievements
 are obtained by completing certain quests for example. The quests are showing completed in game, but the achievement (although it did pop up when I completed the quest) is not showing up in my achievements

<p>Just an update, I just tried to get the "Psychotic Prankster" achievement on my Xbox 360, which I previously did on the Xbox One, and it did indeed give me the achievement again, this time it stuck and showed up under my completed achievements. So this seems
 to be a backwards compatibility issue with achievements for Xbox 360 games played on the Xbox One and not sticking. &nbsp;As you can see there are loads I have obtained, please don't tell me I have to do these over!

<p>I thought it would be worth mentioning that I started playing this game using the Fallout 3 disk(no DLCs) and decided since I liked it, I bought the "Game of the Year" edition which includes all DLCs. I checked the sticky in the Backwards Compatibility thread
 and there does not seem to be any known issues with either version of the game. </p>

            &nbsp;<span>Hey <span><strong>scarpenter45</strong></span><span><strong>,</strong><br />
</span></span><br />
<span><span><strong>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!<br />
<br />
</strong>The issue might occur if the Windows files are corrupted or missing. There might be change in the windows settings.<br />
<br />
</span></span><br />
<strong>Try restoring the system to an earlier point when your computer was working fine</strong>.<br />
<br />
<span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start, type
<strong>System Restore</strong> in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the
<strong>Programs </strong>list. <br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>sfc /scannow</span></p>

<p>I have done so and it still has to roll back the delta update. The situation is the same as Stephen described.</p>
<p>It then looked more into it and was suspicious that after trying to install the update manually, the Windows Update troubleshooter detected a potential update database error. I then followed the guide
<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/potential-windows-update-database-error-detected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;and basically did:</p>
<p>1. Run the system file checker: Open cmd as Admin:</p>
<pre>sfc /scannow</pre>
<p>2. Reboot</p>
<p>3. Run the dism command to restore (run the following again as an Admin in the command prompt)</p>
<pre>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</pre>
<p>4. Reboot and then install the Windows update.</p>
<p>5. Then the reboot after the update was fine and the update installed correctly</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Home Edition Device Encrytion</h2>
                    I have a Dell 7000 13, as soon as I booted this new laptop it offered to upgrade to windows 10 which I did. I understand that Windows 10 home does not have bitlocker, however I would like to enable device encryption. I cannot see any control panel options
 for this, only Settings&gt;System&gt;About&gt;Related seetings shows an option showing bitlocker settings, but this is not clickable. My Microsoft account does not have any bitlocker keys uploaded either. How can I enable this?

            <p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>BitLocker is available for Windows 10 pro and Enterprise editions only. If you want to use BitLocker, you will have to install the Windows 10 Pro pack. You can refer to this Wiki by Andre Da costa for more information:</p>

            With respect I think the Microsoft answer has missed the point here. The user was asking about Windows 10 Home "device encryption", which is supposed to be included in the Home edition. There are no instructions on how to enable it, or to check if it is
 enabled. It is obvious on the forums that many people are affected and confused by this problem.

            <p>Since I could not find reliable instructions for device encryption without using BitLocker we had to purchase 3 Windows 10 Pro packs upgrades at $99.99 each.&nbsp; We could not determine how to get multiple Pro pack upgrades from any reseller or via Microsoft
 800 call.&nbsp;Subsequently we found that the Windows (commercial) Store app. only allows 10 devices per account.&nbsp; Microsoft did not have the Business store ready for the release of Windows 10.&nbsp; Now we IT Pros are trying to play catch up and manage IT assets using
 a tangled mess of Azure AD mixed with local authentication.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Encryption in Windows 10 is only available with TPM 2.0 and InstantGo. You can check your TPM version in Device Manager--&gt; Security Devices. You have to first Enable TPM in BIOS before you can see it in Device Manager.</p>
<p>More info about requirements:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications#reqs</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to also login with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>When you system meet all those requirements go to your Start menu and type: device encription</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards!</p>

            <p>Windows 10 <strong>Home</strong> enables BitLocker if the computer has a TPM chip.&nbsp; The Surface 3 comes with Windows 10 Home, and not only is BitLocker enabled, but the C: comes BitLocker-encrypted out of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had a Dell 3050 (w/ no TPM) with Windows 10 Home installed, and I tried various antics to try to use BitLocker.&nbsp; The underlying command line tool,
<strong>manage-bde.exe</strong>, is there, but refuses to do anything without a TPM chip, saying that I needed to upgrade Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a day of trying, I finally gave up and upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, and then BitLocker-encrypted my C: drive without a TPM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With almost all Apple devices encrypted by default, and Google/Android quickly moving in that direction,
<strong>I firmly predict</strong> that Microsoft will at some point in the future, enable BitLocker without a TPM in Windows Home.</p>
<p>

            The Surface 3 does have a TPM 2 module&nbsp;and Encryption is on by default.&nbsp; I am not sure it is actually using BitLocker.&nbsp; The search for BitLocker takes you to the About Device dialog where it does not give you the same options to backup the encryption key
 as the BitLocker app does.
