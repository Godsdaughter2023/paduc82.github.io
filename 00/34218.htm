<h2>            Can I make Windows Photo Gallery refresh automatically during slideshow&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to use Windows Photo Gallery to show a slideshow that runs continuously during an event. I have an eye-fi card that works wirelessly to send the photos to my computer and they show up in the folder where the slideshow is running from, but they
 don't show up in the slideshow until I close the slideshow and restart it. Eye Fi says it should work with Windows Photo Gallery (http://support.eye.fi/support-resources/tips-tricks/accounts-multiple-cards/can-i-create-a-slide-show-that-automatically-updates-as-i-upload-photos/)
 so I'm wondering if it's a Windows 7 thing?</p>

<h2>            Skype for Linux Beta 5.3 fails when making a call - &#39;Failed to set up send codec state&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the forthcoming kill switch about to be flicked for v4.3, I finally 'upgraded' to the 5.3 version, hoping that all the show-stopping bugs would've been removed at this stage. Sadly this does not appear to be the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the old version of skype from my Ubuntu 14.04 desktop and cleared the config files. Then I downloaded the 64 bit deb from the website, and installed using `sudo dpkg -i skypeforlinux-64.deb`. So far, so good.<br />
<br />
The app starts up and allow me to login to see my contacts. Great! It correctly shows online status of those contacts, and instant messaging works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when attempting to place a call, the it fails, claiming the other party is 'Busy'. Looking at the log in $HOME/.config/skypeforlinux/logs/skype-startup.log reveals the following entry:<br />
<br />
[3628:0629/095123.021489:ERROR:audio_send_stream.cc(90)] Failed to set up send codec state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I get clarity on the current state of the 'Beta'? Is Ubuntu 14.04 not a supported platform? How can a technical person troubleshoot this problem and get it working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The log error seems to be revealing an issue in chromium webrtc, which Microsoft must be using in this Skype client. Line 90 of&nbsp;audio_send_stream.cc (as indicated from the log) indicates that it is failing when calling a method ConfigureStream (source code
 link:&nbsp;https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/webrtc/trunk/webrtc/+/refs/heads/master/audio/audio_send_stream.cc)<br />
<br />
The source code indicates that the error in the log is written out with&nbsp;<span>LS_ERROR</span>&nbsp;verbosity. Does anyone know if there is a configuration
 setting in the Skype settings.json (or elsewhere) that can increase this verbosity level?<br />
<br />
A comment from a Microsoft representative would be appreciated.</p>
<p />

            Microsoft seem of the opinion that this skeleton version 5.3 can replace the stable version 4.3 retiring this weekend, so pretty sure that there are many Linux users without Skype from this weekend as skeleton version 5.3 is so shoddy. &nbsp;I have managed
 to make the occasional call on Ubuntu 14.04 so theoretically 14.04 is supported, however a tiny fraction of the calls can make with the stable version 4.3

<p>I am uncertain what codecs the new Skype for Linux Beta (pre-alpha?) requires, but maybe you are missing a key element. Take a look at this web page and install the Ubuntu-Restricted-Extras, if you don't have that.</p>

<p>Hi Peter and thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
My elderly parents use Skype for Linux daily in order to keep in touch with their family who are spread around the world. The switching off of 4.3 will have a huge impact on them. They have used Linux for years now and found the experience very good, and I
 have peace of mind that they cannot be affected by the rampant virus outbreaks and ransomware that is so ever-present these days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you provide a little more detail about your 14.04 install please? The hardware you are running it on, any 'customisations' you may have made or is it very standard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi JSV and thankyou for your reply.<br />
<br />
I have checked the ubuntu-restricted-extras and it is already installed:<br />

Reading package lists... Done<br />
Building dependency tree<br />
Reading state information... Done<br />
ubuntu-restricted-extras is already the newest version<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running pretty standard 14.04 here with Gnome Flashback in preference to the resource hog unity interface, on Lenovo X201 with only 4GB RAM, added a few apps like VLC, browsers &amp; clocks, ohh, &amp; Skype... &nbsp;Suspect moving from Unity to Gnome Flashback freed
 up quite a bit of resource for Ubuntu to run smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Linux is perfect for the use you describe, safe, and found with Gnome Flashback so easy to use, and runs on budget laptops :). I fear that there are many in this situation that will find themselves in a difficult situation, especially as auto answer and
 a restricted contact group makes keeping in touch so much easier, and safer in that you can still call if they have had a problem and need you to organise assistance, can take a call without rushing to the computer, or are just asleep &amp; you do not want to
 wake them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that these issues may not be resolved for some time based on Microsoft's performance here. &nbsp;So the other option would be to go Apple Mac, the security risk levels are not quite as good as with Linux, you do get the benefit of a full version of
 Linux, Macs also can automatically restart and return to where they were after a power cut, Macs don't like temperatures over 35C and high humidity (condensing on walls levels) and they do have a higher initial cost new &amp; used. &nbsp;IBM, based on 440 000 employees,
 &amp; 90 000 Macs reckon each employee that uses a Mac in preference to Windows saves the company between $275 &amp; $530, so it is only the initial cost issue, guess Linux would be somewhere in the middle of Macs &amp; Windows here? &nbsp;Previously used Macs are a much better
 buy than used Windows computers as Apple MacOS has nothing like the DLL and similar problems, would suggest not older than about 2011 to use the latest version of the OS (but with extra RAM).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have helped quite a few 'seniors' to get online, those who went for Windows usually gave up as the hassle of running a Windows computer exceeded the benefit of being online, the Linux users stuck with it, &amp; the Mac users enjoyed their computing</p>

<p>I quickly looked this up and both electron and chromium have experienced this issue. There does not seem to be sufficient data to pin a root cause down, but if I were to guess, I would say a newer version of chromium attempted to connect to an older version,
 and WebRTC failed due to incompatibilities (not backwards compatible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that to say, is the other person using the latest Skype? It maybe that you are calling an older version, and the underlying technology is incompatible. This seems to not have been an issue with Skype For Linux 4.3, but then again, it was not web-based,
 and did not use chromium nor electron.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to connect with another person and see if this is an intermittent issue. If it is, then it is poor fault-tolerance on Skype, whereby you can only connect to the latest versions. Based on the current state of the "Beta", this would not surprise me.</p>

<p>Hi JSV and thankyou again for your insightful reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various permutations of versions and managed to discover that the problem centres around connectivity between Skype for Linux 5.3 attempting to either place or receive a call from Skype for Linux 4.3. When using 5.3 to call versions of Skype
 on Windows machines, the call mostly negotiates and connects successfully after some delay. Call quality leaves something to be desired, but it at least _works_ generally.<br />
<br />
Whilst this is a far from ideal situation, what it does mean is that 4.3 is the problematic version, and since it is officially obsolete as of this coming weekend that will cease to be a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou for taking the time to assist me with your research into the problem and forwarding your ideas on, they were very helpful indeed and I think I can make this work moving forward, albeit with a little frustration.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Steve</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are fortunate that can make this work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not the case here, skeleton version, as Skype for web, is a very basic video call app which is great for competing with the target group that the very different Google Hangouts is pursuing, as have said elsewhere, comparing the skeleton version with the
 desktop version is like comparing a bike with a car, sure they both offer transport, however the bike is not much use for that urgent business meeting 100 miles away today!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My communications are based around the connectivity and feature set of the desktop version unique to Skype, have often tried the skeleton version, but it fails to offer more than a tiny fraction of the communication with desktop 4.3 Skype. &nbsp;Done the feedback
 bit as well but that seems to be ignored. &nbsp;Not in a position here either to get a Mac laptop that would offer the same communication as desktop Skype for Linux, though not in as elegant fashion as Linux Skype. &nbsp;Skype / Microsoft shafted Mac version of Skype
 6 years ago when they started the 5.xx series for Skype for Mac, replacing the elegant and vastly more space efficient v 2.8 leading to so many new Mac forum members complaining about the poor design (up to about a thousand posts per thread by new posters!)
 that the forum was shut down about the time Microsoft bought Skype.</p>

<p>Hi Peter and thankyou for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly migrating to a Mac is not really a tractable option in this case. It is hard to justify the purchase of additional hardware in order to maintain Skype connectivity - if that were the case I would probably buy them a 2nd hand XBox and get it to work
 through their TV.<br />
<br />
Through some experimentation I have managed to get 5.3 to connect to other Skype versions from a very vanilla install of 14.04 64bit with Gnome Flashback (I see you have good taste!), with the exception of *Skype for Linux 4.3*. This probably gets me far enough
 forward for now to make it a workable option, and hope that Microsoft iterates quite heavily on this Beta version that is in desperate need of some attention.<br />
<br />
All the best<br />

<p>Well done Steve, hope that continues to work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is that with elderly relatives the auto answer function would be useful, have you found a way to get that working? &nbsp;The other issues such as screen share are way outside the pay grade of Skype for Web &amp; skeleton Skype for &nbsp;Linux, so have to hope
 that Microsoft entertain the so often repeated requests and bring it in, however, I think the design basics of the Electron version probably prevents that working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do keep the post informed of any work arounds you find</p>

<span>Hi izacharo,</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned<span>&nbsp;</span>below to install Microsoft Loopback adapter from the Command prompt and check if the issue gets fixed.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>a. Click the Start menu.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. Search for “cmd".</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>c. Right-click on “cmd” and select “Run as Administrator”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>d. Enter “hdwwiz.exe”</span></p>
<p>
<span>From that point on it's the same approach as under Vista, i.e.:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>e. In the "Welcome to the Add Hardware Wizard", click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>f. Select "Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)" and click<span>&nbsp;</span>Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>g. Scroll down and select "Network adapters" and click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>h. Select under Manufacturer "Microsoft" and then under Network Adapter "Microsoft Loopback Adapter" and click Next.</span></p>

                    I have a Toshiba (model A665 S6050) laptop that I have repaired. It had a broken screen and the hard drive was dead. I tried to install Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit from a disk that came with a different computer, and using the Product key on the bottom
 of the laptop. It didn't work. Is there a proper way to do a fresh install on this laptop, and do I need a specific installation DVD? Where do I get that, and what is the procedure to re-install Windows 7, and activate it?

<p>
</p><p>The only legal Windows 7 download available&nbsp;is now from Microsoft, as Microsoft has stopped DigitalRiver Windows 7 ISO downloads.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But Microsoft only provides these downloads for Windows 7 Retail Product Keys, not OEM preinstalled Product Keys (Dell, HP, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;you have a preinstalled OEM License (Toshiba), contact your Computer Manufacturer to order Recovery Media which they should supply for a small cost,
<p>
</p><p>Or you can also borrow the exact same <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Retail</strong></span> Windows 7 Edition&nbsp;DVD and use your Product Key to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The COA sticker with the Product Key&nbsp;is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>With a Desktop it is either on the side, rear or top of the Computer Case.</p>

            <p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the systems connected through a <em><strong>domain </strong></em>network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you concern. If you have any non-essential devices connected to your computer, disconnect them, they might be interfering with setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation might stop if the system cannot copy files. Here are some possible causes and solutions for this problem:</p>
<p>Your Windows installation disc is scratched, smudged, or dirty. Clean the disc with a soft cloth, insert it in the CD or DVD drive, and then begin the Windows installation again. If your installation disc is damaged, you might need to replace it. For more
 information, go to How to replace lost, broken, or missing Microsoft software or hardware on the Microsoft website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer to the information provided in the following MSDN article and check if the issue persists.</p>

<p><b>I would suggest attempting to take the ownership of the folder or file and then use the steps to grant permission to all users on the computer:</b></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the file or folder on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on file or folder and select&nbsp;<b>“Properties”</b>&nbsp;from Context Menu</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on&nbsp;<b>Security tab</b></span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on&nbsp;<b>“Advance”</b></span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click on&nbsp;<b>Owner tab in Advance Security Settings</b>&nbsp;for User windows</span></p>
<p><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on&nbsp;<b>Edit Button and select user</b>&nbsp;from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list then, click on other users or groups. Enter name of user/group and click ok. You can even click on administrator here, if you
 are logged in as an administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select User/group and click apply and ok. (Check “Replace owner on sub containers and objects” if you have files and folder within selected folder)</span></p>
<p><span>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed</span></p>
<p><span>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Owner name must have changed</span></p>
<p><span>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click&nbsp;<b>Ok to exist from Properties</b>&nbsp;windows</span></p>
<p><span>k.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have&nbsp;<b>taken the ownership of file or folder</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Grant Permissions to everyone (or your user account) -<br />
a. Go to C: and then click&nbsp;<b>right click</b>&nbsp;on folder and choose&nbsp;<b>properties<br />
</b>b. Then go to&nbsp;<b>security</b>&nbsp;tab and click&nbsp;<b>Edit</b>&nbsp;then click&nbsp;<b>Add</b>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;<b>Advanced<br />
</b>c. If you click on advanced now click on&nbsp;<b>Find Now</b>&nbsp;and choose&nbsp;<b>everyone</b>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<b>Ok<br />
</b>d.<b>&nbsp;</b>Then again click&nbsp;<b>Ok&nbsp;</b>and now click on&nbsp;<b>Allow</b>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;<b>Full control</b>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;<b>Ok</b></span></p>

            I think you're misinterpreting the problem. Your canned "pop up problem" support isn't going to help in this case. There aren't pop-ups in the browser session. The Bing Desktop app for Windows 7 (http://www.bing.com/explore/desktop) will appear on its
 own sporadically with the trending news or images pulled down - as if the "top contents" button had been clicked. This automatic appearance will overlay (or pop up over) any other program you have running. It's quite annoying. I have the same problem and so
 does another commenter here (check bodacious brad's comment):&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2012/12/13/the-next-version-of-bing-desktop-now-available-expands-language-availability-and-support-for-all-versions-of-windows-xp-and-higher.aspx</div>
<div><br />
<div>The application did not show this behavior prior to the 1.1 update which looks to have been released on December 13, 2012.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>My computer is doing the same thing, everytime you leave it idle, the new Bing Desktop pops open on the desktop and displays the contents button, as though you clicked on it.&nbsp; It's obviously a bug in the app, hopefully this is being looked into, I think
 it's happening when ever the app checks in for an update, I don't know at what intervals it does this, but it seems whenever you leave your computer idle to long, or leave it overnight, you can bet you'll come back to the Bing App staring at you.&nbsp; The old
 version 1.0.45.0 did not do this.&nbsp; Please fix, thank you.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the above responder does not understand the question, as this response is utterly useless, although we do appreciate getting a response, don't get me wrong, it just helps to read and&nbsp;understand
 the question first.</p>

            many people have the same problem as discussed in this thread, and your suggested methods are ****. Please address the problem, and prove there are humans working at microsoft instead of giving out what seems like an automated response from a computer. I will not recommend Bing Desktop to anyone until this problem is fixed, and I am strongly considering uninstalling it altogether myself.

<p>You don't have to use your Kinect. However, it does have to be plugged in at all times for the console to work. I'd say you don't have enough room to use it anyway, but you don't have to use it, just have to plug it in.</p>
<p>For your 136 Xbox games, I'd probably keep the few you'll probably play later on and just sell the rest towards a PS4 (which is what I plan on getting) or a Xbox One.

<p>Thank you. My main concern was the Kinect question. </p>
<p>My question about the games was that, XOne uses cloud. Now what happens a few year fron now when i have many games.
</p>
<p>I would never sell my wonderful games. Lol im a collector as well as a gamer. I have a large collection of games for almost all consoles as well as almost every console all the way back to the original nes. So i will most likey get both ps4 and Xone.</p>

<p>Will Kinect recognize other languages outside of English? what if I say "Xbox quiero jugar Halo?" or "Xbox chiama al mio fratello" will that work?

<p>Yes i agree. The kinect was a bad idea. Especialy for gamers who do all their gaming in a personal room. It was a bad idea for them to expect that gaming would be done in the main room, as well as that the best tv would be in the main room as well.if i wanted
 a family console i go by a Nintendo product. </p>

<p>I keep mine in the bedroom because it is quiet and nobody will bother me while I am playing a game in the bedroom I can shut the door and turn the game up loud and I don't want the kinect chat in there while I am asleep or I might roll over on the controler
 and start video chat or something at bad times I just don't like it at all.</p>
<p>I tried this with my old sega activator I got at a discount once it was a disaster,</p>

<p>Idont fully understand the 24hr check concept. All i can collct from it is that i need internet to play games. But what if imoffline for a few weeks, i sometimes dont go on for 3-5 weeks. Do they delete my account, do i lose my games?</p>

            Good morning.&nbsp; As far as the VPN's are concerned they are NOT running.&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as a proxy I am not running under one.&nbsp; This all occurred a few days ago after I did an update from Windows update.&nbsp; Like I said in my earlier messages my Vuze is working properly
 and when I did a ping it also worked as well. But none of my three browsers are now working and they all come up with the same error message.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also the Windows update doesn't work as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't changed any of my settings in any of the browsers at all.&nbsp;
 I tried to see about going back to a day or two before the update but the system wouldn't allow it.&nbsp; Please help.

            The application is Adobe Acrobat 9 Standard which is most definitely supported in Windows 7. I had it installed previously. I don't believe the problem is with the application. I believe the problem is with Windows.<br />

            Hi TobyVanderbeek,<br />
quick question, have you tried a system restore? I would restore back before the attempted Adobe install, clean boot and try a reinstall.
<br />
Failing that, it may take a reinstall of Windows. I found some MSDN articles, but unless you are into programming, I would not recommend that route.<br />
here is a quick link:<br />

hope this helps,<br />

<h2>            How to Disable Windows 7 tooltips popups on mouseover - Causing Eyestrain While using the computer</h2>
                    Every time I'm mousing while using the computer (moving the mouse around on the screen)&nbsp;you get nothing but annoying popups showing the content behind the mouse pointer. I have a brand new computer and had windows xp before and didnt have these annoying
 mouseover information popups. after about 2 weeks im noticing eyestrain and headaches. Like I don't know where my mouse pointer is!!! and since the eyes naturally follow the mouse - the mouseover information pops up over your vision - slamming you with a useless
 pop up window, blocking your vision of what you're wanting to look at on the screen. I'm&nbsp;getting disappointed in this operating system if i cant get this to go away im going to return my computer and NEVER recommend windows 7 until they get this fixed. Of
 course i just shelled out 500 bucks for this computer and when you enter the id with windows you still do no get technical support from microsft for free - they refer you to the maker of the computer - what that has to

    <title>USB to ATA&#47;ATAPI Bridge Instalation Fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> onny_kitty  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB to ATA&#47;ATAPI Bridge Instalation Fail</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>Recently I got a new PC with Windows 7 64x. I have an external HDD that Windows 7 recognized it until today. I had some issues with the HDD, but managed to work around them:</p>
<p>At first when I started my computer it wouldn't get passed the initial screen (the one with the logo and press F2 for BIOS, F12 for Boot Setup). If i would unplug my HDD it would unfreeze. So I figured that maybe the computer was looking for a boot from
 the external HDD and so I change the primary boot to the CD. And it all worked great for a couple of days.</p>
<p>Then it started again with the freezing at the initial screen, So I would have to unplug the HDD. And then even though the HDD was plugged back it wasn't listed in My Computer. So normally I would go and uninstall USB Mass Storage from Device Manager and
 to a restart with the HDD plugged in. And that used to work.</p>
<p>But today, faced with the same problem, I tried everything I could think of and nothing worked. I uninstalled USB Mass Storage from Device Manager and also USB Drive from Disk Drives, unplugged it and plugged it back. Most of the time it would say that the
 driver installation failed, but even when it would install still I couldn't see it on My Computer. I did multiple restarts. I noticed that if I uninstall both the USB and USB Drive and then restart, at the restart I get a different message when installing
 the driver: "USB to ATA/ATAPI Bridge", but it ends up with a failed error.</p>
<p>What should I do to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Bela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your issue regarding after the update in Windows 10. Basically after you update to Windows 10, you also need to check your driver. You need to make sure that all of your drivers are updated since you mentioned that even your mouse is not working. Also,
 you can try to disable the AV for the meantime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the Photos App (or SkyDrive App), you can share your photos to SkyDrive using "Copy"/"Cut" &amp; "Paste" commands.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Select the photo or folder you want to share</p>
<p>2. Bring up the app bar to select "Copy" or "Cut"</p>
<p>3. Use the drop down on the top left to navigate to your desired SkyDrive folder</p>
<p>4. Bring up the app bar to select"Paste"</p>
<p><br />

            That would be something you would want to reach out to the developers/publishers to let them know you want it to be compatible. There is no longer a way to vote for games to become compatible.

<p>Hey Armored,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We currently don't have a voting system in place to vote for backwards compatible games. It is up to the developers to make it happen but threads such as this one tend to get the ball rolling. If you are interested, the Spyro triology was recently remastered

<h3> mm555mm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to get all my settings to carry over if I change the username on my built-in administrator account&#63;</h2>
                    I installed XP 3 years ago and the only account I have (and use daily)&nbsp;is the built-in administrator account!&nbsp; I don't remember how I did this but I did!&nbsp; At the time, I didn't know to not do it that way!&nbsp; (I now have a 2nd admin account but don't use
 it).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Anyway, I have full access to&nbsp;the built-in&nbsp;account&nbsp;and would like to change the username from Administrator to Administrator1.&nbsp; However, when I do this everything seems to be fine but there are a few things (that I've noticed so far) that do not carry over.&nbsp;
 For example, all the stored profiles for the many wireless sites I visit are not available to me while the username is Administrator1.&nbsp; When I change it back to Administrator all is well.<br />
<br />
Another reason&nbsp;for wanting to change the username on the built-in admin account is because&nbsp;my partition of the&nbsp;NAS drive on our network will not permit me to have access granted to only "my" Windows login and password because it is "Administrator" and that
 is the only username it will not allow!&nbsp; As a result, I can't set up a drive that is only available to me.&nbsp; Everyone else on the network have their own private drive (mainly used for backup) because their username/pw is not administrator.<br />
<br />
Can you halp me with this transition please?&nbsp; <br />
Thank you.<br />

            Don't bother changing the built-in Administrator's name. Make yourself a new user account and copy the settings from Administrator to it.<br />
<br />
<span>Create a New User Profile in Windows XP Professional<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Log on as the Administrator or as a user with administrator credentials.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click User Accounts.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Advanced tab, and then click Advanced.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. In the left pane, click the Users folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. On the Action menu, click New User.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Enter the appropriate user information, and then click Create.<br />
<br />
You'll need to have three users on the system so create an extra one called "Tech" or "Extra' or the like (which you can delete later if you like) and the user account you're going to work from daily. Log into your new daily user account once so the profile
 files/folders are created and then log back out into "Tech". From there:<br />
<br />
</span><span>Copy Files to the New User Profile<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Log on as a user other than the user whose profile you are copying files to or from.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In Windows Explorer, click Tools, click Folder Options, click the View tab, click Show hidden files and folders, click to clear the Hide protected operating system files check box, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Locate the C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Press and hold down the CTRL key while you click each file and subfolder in this folder,
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">except</span> </em>the following files:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ntuser.dat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ntuser.dat.log<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ntuser.ini<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. On the Edit menu, click Copy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Locate the C:\Documents and Settings\New_Username folder, where New_Username is the name of your new daily user account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. On the Edit menu, click Paste.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Log off the computer, and then log on as the new user.<br />
<br />
Note: You must import your e-mail messages and addresses to the new user profile before you delete the old profile. For additional information see 313055 OLEXP: Mail Folders, Address Book, and E-mail Messages Are Missing After You Upgrade to Microsoft Windows
 XP</span> .<br />
<br />
There will be a few things that are different such as your wallpaper, but all your stuff should be there.

<p>Malkeleah,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your suggestion.&nbsp; It looks like your procedure will work just great!&nbsp; However, I have a big problem with ANY new account that I create!&nbsp; I've been working on this for the better part of two days now and it's driving me crazy!<br />
<br />
The main account that I log into everyday is the (builtin)&nbsp;Administrator account.&nbsp; While in there, I can create new users,&nbsp;with or without&nbsp;admin rights&nbsp;(doesn't matter). &nbsp;Then I can go into either of those newly created user accounts and in&nbsp;all cases, when
 I right click on a file or folder in My Computer then Windows Explorer crashes!!&nbsp; It crashes so hard that I have to go into task manager and kill it the rest of the way.&nbsp; After doing so, it automatically fires back up and all returns to normal.&nbsp; Further right
 clicking on just about ANY object cause Win Explorer to crash again.&nbsp; When I'm in my main account, there is no trouble with Win Explorer whatsoever!<br />
<br />
I have followed about every thread on here as to how to resolve this problem but absolutely nothing has worked.&nbsp; I've even disabled literally every entry in the ShellMenuView but still&nbsp;right clicking on almost all objects causes Win Explorer to crash!&nbsp; Once
 again, there is NO PROBLEM on my main admin account.<br />
<br />
Do you have any suggestions for this?&nbsp; Thanks very much.</p>

            No, I would have suggested ShellExView. How long has this been going on? What is the answer to The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
And The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />

            Thank you for your feedback.&nbsp; It's all resolved!!<br />
<br />
I took your suggestion and used ShellExView, located the offending context menu item (Copy to CD shell extension), and my problem with Win Explorer crashing was instantly solved!&nbsp; This permitted me to apply your procedure of copying the administrator settings
 over to a new admin account.<br />
<br />
All is well and I thank you!<br />

            I'm very glad to hear it. I thought you'd already used ShellExView. In any case, I'm happy things are sorted now. Thanks for taking the time to let me know.

            No.&nbsp; I had used ShellMenuView by mistake thinking I was getting ShellExView?&nbsp; They were both from the same site but very different in what they showed.&nbsp; For example, when using ShellMenuView I didn't see any lines associated with "context menu" stuff.&nbsp;
 Then, taking your suggestion (which I thought you were directly saying no don't use MenuView use ExView instead), I was then able to see all the context menu entries and resolve my problem!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<h2>            Installing printer drivers</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Im trying to install my&nbsp;HP LaserJet Pro M125a in my computers. It has a USB connection. Everytime I try to install it on my Windows 7 I get an error when the "printing" driver tries to install. Scanning
 works just fine, HP Print and scan doctor can make the printer print a internal self-diagnostic page too.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I was able to install the printer on Windows 10 using "HP LaserJet Mono PCLmS Class Driver" as a printing driver instead of the one provided on the HP support page. Its working just fine.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I think that both Windows 7 and Windows 10 are blocking the installation of Type 3 (kernel-mode) drivers. Because "<span>HP LaserJet Mono PCLmS Class Driver" is a Type 4 (user-mode) driver, it works fine
 but I cant find it on Windows 7, I think its a Windows 10 native driver.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Windows 7 isnt even able to connect to the printer over the network, it gets the same driver error.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The error also says that a policy in my machine is blocking the installation of Kernel-mode drivers. I found that policy on gpedit and changed it. Had no effect, both versions of Windows ignored what
 I setup in the policy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to do to solve my problem is to export the&nbsp;<span>"HP LaserJet Mono PCLmS Class Driver" from my Windows 10 machine and use it on my Windows 7 machine, but Im having problems to find out how.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to export it? I tried using the "export-windowsdriver" command on Windows 10 powershell, it worked like a charm but&nbsp;<span>"HP LaserJet Mono PCLmS Class Driver" didnt come along. I found that command only exports third party drivers, so Im
 assuming&nbsp;</span><span>"HP LaserJet Mono PCLmS Class Driver" is a Microsoft driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I have a similar thread on HP Support forum to try to get some help from them, so far no success...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPS: I printed a test page on Windows 10 and it reports that the additional files from the following folders are being used:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\prnhpcl1.inf_amd64_c6040b9adc0369af\amd64\</p>
<p><span>C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\ntprint.inf_amd64_8c30031d8d0a5589\Amd64</span><span>\</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to copy those folders, the INF files "</span><span>prnhpcl1.inf" and "</span><span>ntprint.inf" and the files from the spool\drivers folder from one computer to the other. I keep getting a error saying that some files
 are missing, but I could see&nbsp;</span><span>"HP LaserJet Mono PCLmS Class Driver" in the printer driver list.</span></p>

<p>You're way overthinking this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're also a bit confused.&nbsp; The printer drivers used in Windows 7 are user mode drivers.&nbsp; The drivers are also "version 3" drivers (although Windows 7 labels them "type 3").&nbsp; Version 4 drivers were introduced in Windows 8.&nbsp; These are also user mode drivers.&nbsp;
 See, e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.thinprint.com/the-new-microsoft-v4-printer-driver-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blog.thinprint.com/the-new-microsoft-v4-printer-driver-model/</a>&nbsp; (which shows that Win 8 also uses "Type" rather than "Version").</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFAIK, Windows 7 does not support version 4 "class" drivers.&nbsp; You can't do what you are attempting to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kernel mode printer drivers are obsolete.&nbsp; See </p>
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2007/09/14/kernel-mode-print-drivers-gone-the-way-of-the-dinosaur/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2007/09/14/kernel-mode-print-drivers-gone-the-way-of-the-dinosaur/</a>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you restore the policy blocking installation of kernel-mode drivers.&nbsp; It's there for your protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please start at the beginning.&nbsp; Because you mentioned gpedit, I assume that you have Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; 32-bit or 64-bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; What is the complete text of the error you get?&nbsp; Is this the same error that you initially saw when attempting to install the printer the first time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; How (step-by-step) did you attempt to install the product on your Windows 7 computer?&nbsp; What driver did you use -- (a) from CD packaged with product, (b) from HP download, (c) from Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Do you have any other printers installed on the Windows 7 computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; At the beginning of your post, you mentioned that your printer has a USB connection; later on, you said that you can't connect to the printer over the network.&nbsp; How do you want/intend to use this printer from your Windows 7 computer?&nbsp; When the HP P&amp;S
 Doctor printed a test page, how was the device connected to your Windows 7 computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Do any icons for the LaserJet Pro M125a appear in Devices and Printers?&nbsp; If so, do they have warning icons?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Open Device Manager (Start, type Device Manager in the Search box, press Enter).&nbsp; If any items show warning icons, please (1) provide the name of the item, then (2) double-click on it and report its "Device Status"</p>

<strong>2.&nbsp; How (step-by-step) did you attempt to install the product on your Windows 7 computer?&nbsp; What driver did you use -- (a) from CD packaged with product, (b) from HP download, (c) from Windows?</strong></p>

Windows could not find a driver from Windows Update when I plugged the printer thru USB, so I went to HP Support page and downloaded the "HP LaserJet Pro MFP M125/126 Series Full Software and Drivers" (https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-pro-mfp-m125-series/5396664/model/5303400).<br />
Followed step by step, but when the installer asks me to plug the printer again, I get the error on the first screenshot.</p>

Yes, I have a&nbsp;HP LaserJet Pro 100 color MFP M175a that Works like a charm because it uses the HP Universal Printer Driver PCL6. The M125 Im trying to install needs its own driver because it uses PCLmS.</p>

<strong>4.&nbsp; At the beginning of your post, you mentioned that your printer has a USB connection; later on, you said that you can't connect to the printer over the network.&nbsp; How do you want/intend to use this printer from your Windows 7 computer?&nbsp; When the HP<br />
P&amp;S Doctor printed a test page, how was the device connected to your Windows 7 computer?</strong></p>

I have two computers, one with Windows 10 and another with Windows 7. The one with Windows 10 just needs to print, not scan, so a network share from the Windows 7 computer would suffice. I tried to plug the printer on the Windows 7 computer but it didnt work,<br />
so I tried plugging it on the Windows 10 machine and network share it, but Windows 7 couldnt access the printer when I tried, it got the same driver error I got when I plugged the printer directly thru USB. Windows 7 just wont install the driver, doesnt matter<br />
if the printer is connected thru USB or thru a network share. When I tried to use the HP P&amp;S Doctor, it could communicate with the printer, but couldnt send over a test page, so it asked if I wanted to ask the printer to print a INTERNAL test page, and it<br />
worked. Im assuming the HP P&amp;S Doctor was trying to find out if it was a printer mechanical error or a driver error, because after that it asked me to reinstall all the HP software. Didnt work.</p>

Yes, I can see both the scanner device and the printer device. The scanner is working well, but the printer device has a ? icon because it cant find a driver.</p>

<p>btw, I disabled that policy because HP Support told me to try that. They say a Microsoft Update started to block some of their **** (IMHO) drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this small theory that someone, somewhere inside HP, has the sole job of taking Driver code and screwing them over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only HP printer I have that Works fine is my home Deskjet printer, because its a network printer that uses Microsoft default drivers. First time I installed a HP driver "to see what changes", I kept losing connection every 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Thanks for the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit confused about what you did.&nbsp; Your second screenshot, which shows the Add a printer Wizard, appears to be similar (but not identical) to the screen you get if you select "Have disk" and point the wizard to an *.inf file.&nbsp; On the other hand, you
 said that you had downloaded the "full software and driver" package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try two different methods:&nbsp; first ran the full package and got the error when the s/w told you to connect the printer and second, downloaded the "driver only" file (LJPro_MFP_M125-126_drv-only_15309.exe&nbsp;(<span>15.1 MB</span>) ) and
 tried using "Have disk"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also surprised that Windows Update couldn't find a driver.&nbsp; There is one there:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=LaserJet%20Pro%20M125" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=LaserJet%20Pro%20M125</a> (the first one is the 64-bit driver and the second is 32-bit).&nbsp; At a quick glance, it appears that these are identical to the "driver only" file mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked about other printers because there's a "last ditch" method that resets the Windows 7 printing subsystem to its default state, but this will remove all of your printers and you probably don't want to go there just yet.&nbsp; I'll give instructions for
 less intrusive methods first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Disconnect the printer from the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Open Devices and Printers, right-click on the icon for the M125 printer, and select "Remove device."</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Click on any icon in the "Printers and Faxes" section.&nbsp; Then click on the link for "Print server properties" that appears in the toolbar at the top of the window.&nbsp; Select the "Drivers" tab.&nbsp; If there is a driver listed for the M125, click the "Change
 driver settings" button (which may require a UAC response) and then "Remove" the driver.&nbsp; When asked, remove both the driver and driver package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; If you haven't already done so, download the "HP LaserJet Pro MFP M125/126 Series PCLm Driver Only (no Installer)" file.&nbsp; On the main download page, this is one of the "basic drivers" downloads.&nbsp; Run the downloaded file to extract the compressed files
 and make a note of the location of the extracted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Run the "Add a printer" wizard.&nbsp; Choose to add a local printer to an LPT1 port (you'll "remove" that printer after the installation, but the driver will remain installed).&nbsp; When you get to the list of printer manufacturers/models, click "Have disk" and
 point the wizard to the folder where you had extracted the driver files in step 4.&nbsp; Choose the hpcm125126.inf file and complete the wizard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Assuming that the install completed successfully, right-click and "Remove device" and then connect the printer's USB cable.&nbsp; It should install using the already-installed driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If those steps didn't work, here's the next part.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft used to have an automated "Fixit" utility that dealt with printer problems.&nbsp; This is described here:&nbsp;
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2793718/you-experience-print-spooler-error-messages-after-installing-or-upgrad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2793718/you-experience-print-spooler-error-messages-after-installing-or-upgrad</span></a><span>&nbsp;
 Note that there are two "modes."&nbsp; </span><span>I suspect that you'll need the "full" mode, but this uninstalls all printers from the computer and requires a reboot, so you may want to use the "light" mode first.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want to try the "light" mode first, use "light" rather than "full" in the command at step 6.&nbsp; You don't need the restart at step 7.&nbsp; I suggest that at step 8 you use the "basic driver with installer" package:
</span>LJPro_MFP_M125-126_basic_15309.exe (88.2 MB) because the scanner driver and other software will still be present.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you use the "full" mode, I suggest uninstalling everything first, including any packages listed at Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features as well as the scanner.&nbsp; Reboot before following the instructions below. Then at
 step 8 use the "full software and drivers" package.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In its zeal to move everyone to Windows 10, Microsoft "retired" the Fixit utility described above (as you'll discover if you click on one of the links in the Microsoft article describing the Fixit).&nbsp; Fortunately, the developers
 of the utility preserved the guts as a Powershell script that you can download and run.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Disconnect the printer from the computer if connected by USB</span></li><li><span>Go to </span><a href="https://github.com/jdickson289/Print-Reset-Tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://github.com/jdickson289/Print-Reset-Tool/</span></a><span> and download print-reset.ps1 and make a note

</span></li><li><span>Type the following command into the PowerShell window and press Enter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</span></li><li><span>In response to the "security risks" question, type Y and press Enter</span></li><li><span>Type the following command into the PowerShell window and press Enter.&nbsp; In typing the command, use the full path of the location where you saved the print-reset.ps1 file.&nbsp; In the example shown below, print-reset.ps1 was
 saved in C:\Temp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Temp\print-reset.ps1 -full<br />
Type R to run the script</span></li><li><span>After the script completes, restart the computer</span></li><li><span>Download a fresh copy of the driver package.&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Run the installation package and follow the on-screen connections to connect the printer</span></li><li><span>Go to Devices and Printers and confirm (a) that the printer is installed and set as the Default Printer and (b) right-click on the icon, select Printer properties, and click "Print Test Page"</span></li></ol>
<p><span>This is what the PowerShell window should look like as you proceed through steps 3 through 6 (I didn't enter R because I didn't want to reset my own printing system).&nbsp; Don't forget to use the actual location where you saved
 the print-reset.ps1 file rather than C:\Temp as shown below.</span></p>

<p>Hi LemP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got to step 5 on Your instructions, I got a error saying that I have a policy blocking installation of kernel mode drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got this error with both HP "drv-only" installer files and with the files I got from the Windows Update .cab files, so it seems my Windows 7 machine is refusing to install those drivers from HP or Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing the policy manually to Disable that obstacle, but Windows is ignoring the policy.</p>
<p>

<p>IMO, that's a misleading error message.&nbsp; Assuming that you downloaded the correct file for your version of Windows 7 (i.e., 32-bit vs 64-bit), the driver you're attempting to install is not a kernel-mode driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that was step 5 of the first set of instructions.&nbsp; Did you run the Powershell script?</p>

<p>Hi LemP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did, but I will try again, while I will also try some cleaning steps that HP sent me that will remove all HP drivers from the computer, that way I can be 100% sure that Windows is trying to install the correct drivers.</p>

<p>The Powershell script in "full" mode should have cleaned out all HP drivers as well as all other printer drivers, but do use whatever HP sent you.&nbsp; Perhaps once everything from HP is cleaned out, the driver will install properly.<br />
