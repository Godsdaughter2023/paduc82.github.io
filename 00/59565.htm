<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally if you are using the same Microsoft account in Windows 8.1 RT same as Windows 8 then the apps should be under paid apps.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may contact the Microsoft Store team for help with this issue.</p>

<h2>            Task manager or any system exe is not supported.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been facing this issue for a while, I cannot open task manager or run any application as an administrator. I tried searching a solution but it involved sfc scan on cmd as an administrator. Finally, I decided to reset my PC and start new. Just finished
 resetting my computer and the problem still persists. Not sure what is wrong. The error message I get is "The request is not support". Basically, I don't have administrator privileges at all. Thought resetting PC would fix it but it didn't. I was able to open
 task manager a while ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. But I found a video which involved making changes to Local Group Policy. Successfully got the administrator rights. But since I had windows 10 home, I wanted a pro version, So I was trying to install windows 7 on my laptop and found
 that none of my USB ports are 2.0. Then found a fix, changes were needed in boot file for USB 3.0 drivers. Setup started and I was under the impression that everything would go smoothly. Wiped the partition where windows 10 was installed. The partition was
 GPT and windows 7 cannot be installed on GPT, requires MBR. To convert GPT to MBR with diskpart it was only possible after cleaning the drive. And I don't want to lose my files since I don't have a backup. So I'm about to install windows 10 again. Ughh. So
 much pain. LOL. Thank for the help though. You can put some light in this new issue if there's anything I can do to fix this. Currently my laptop doesn't have OS :(&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>You're taking extreme risks with the way you're doing things. To put yourself back onto safe ground you should do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the command <em>RecoveryDrive.exe</em> on any Windows 10 PC in order to create a bootable flash disk.</li><li>Use this disk to boot the problem PC into Windows Repair Mode.</li><li>Open a Command Prompt.</li><li>Connect an external USB hard disk.</li><li>Use console commands (xcopy.exe or robocopy.exe) to copy your data files to the external USB disk.</li><li>Connect the external USB disk to a different PC and run some spot checks to ensure that you can open your files.</li></ol>

Since you currently do not have an operating system, getting an external disk would be by far the simplest solution. Finding and installing network adapter drivers that run in Windows Repair Mode, can be a pretty hard thing to do.

<br />
<br />1b. When did you purchase the Canon Pixma MP280 Photo All-in-One Printer?
<br />
<br />1c. Does the Printer function work?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

            Hi Cordell -   I'm Greg, a volunteer and eight year Windows MVP who will try to help you.
<br />
<br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Right click Start button in Windows 8/10  to open Apps and Features  (or in Windows 7 type it in Start Search) to Uninstall all the printer software. Restart.  
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the basic driver.  If a wireless printer you will need the full software package to get it set up fully.   If you want to be able to scan from the printer top to the PC then you'll also need the full package.   
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.       
        </p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Keyboard specific keys stop working randomly on Type Cover</h2>
                    <p>Randomly, I open my Surface Pro to begin working, and for whatever reason my Left Shift Key and Enter Key stop working. I have absolutely no idea why and its frustrating that this sometimes even happens when I've successfully unlocked it and have a bunch
 of windows open. Yes, I get you can shut down and do the volume up thing. I don't want to do this every bloody time. There is no way to get in contact with anyone at Microsoft which is absolutely absurd so I'm resorting to this thread. If anyone knows any
 solutions that would help a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I've already tried detaching and retaching<br />
-I've already tried updating, uninstalling and reinstalling the driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I GET YOU CAN RESTART THE SURFACE, IS THERE ANYWAY TO PREVENT THIS FROM BEING THE ONLY OPTION TO FIX THIS???&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If anyone knows how to contact Microsoft for assistance TO THEIR OWN PRODUCT without having to pay, I would appreciate it. Even an email. Thank you all</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 &#38; EMAIL</h2>
                    Hi, I' having one heck of a time with this new Windows 10. I haven't been able to receive emails for going on 4 days now so that means I have to pay my computer tech to uninstall Windows 10&nbsp;and reinstall Vista 7 which I'm already aware that it is old but
 at least it works which is more than I can say about 10!!!! I don't remember when I have been so disappointed and frustrated. What I'm really praying fro and hoping for is someone doesn't come along and say I absolutely have to have W10! I guess I'll have
 to stop using the computer because once I uninstall 10 I will never go back to it again! If Microsoft is going to throw this out there and free to boot they should at least have all the kinks worked out or better yet they should offer free tech help and not&nbsp;the
 kind you get disconnected from while you're talking to them. That's what happened to me. I hate Windows 10! My opinion, it's the worst. So I go to get Vista 7 back and guess what I'm unable to do that also. I went to s

            Hi Sean
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try performing a direct clean install instead:
<br />
<br />download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />		Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Its just that the Reset (which is also a clean install - which you did), does not product the best clean install result. I always prefer to reinstall from removable media.

            <p>Hi Rudi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I appreciate your interest in windows 10. I understand the inconvenience you faced.</p>
<p>I will help you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you see the black screen, follow the below steps to fix the issue.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
<br />
o&nbsp;To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
<br />
o&nbsp;To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video. <br />
1.&nbsp;Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video <br />
2.&nbsp;Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters <br />
&nbsp;If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
<br />
&nbsp;If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
<br />
Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer’s site for an updated driver. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. <br />
Let us know the status of the issue so that we can assist you better.<br />

Thanks.</p>

    <title>Artifacting, Crypto library internal error, and critical process died - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> binkodyl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Artifacting, Crypto library internal error, and critical process died error in Windows 10</h2>
                    I had gotten a virus, and reflashed windows due to not being able to remove it. When I reflashed windows, I experience audio, and visual artifacting on both my integrated graphics (hd530), and with my 980ti. Programs dont work correctly and often close
 or restart, and I occasionally get bsod (critical process died, and crypto library internal error). I have reflashed windows multiple times, with different versions, and installation media, but the problem still persists. I have ran memtest86 with no resulting
 errors from all 4 passes, and Windows install fails every single time when I try to install on a different drive every time regardless of the installation media. I have also tried booting with a different ssd that already has windows 10 on it but I experience
 artifacting on that OS as well. What could be the problem?

            Hi Binkodyl, 
<br />
<br />Thanks for reporting the issue. I am Kenny, Independent Advisor. 
<br />Crypto Library Internal Errors usually point towards a hardware issue. I noted you have already run memtest and saw no issues - other causes of this error could be either CPU or power supply (unstable voltage) related.. 
<br />
<br />If you can still boot into Windows, please try running this diagnostic program:
<br />Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool: 
<br /><a href="https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/support/articles/000005567/processors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/suppo...</a>
<br />
<br />This should inform you whether there are any faults found in the CPU.
<br />
<br />If the machine is in warranty, consider sending it in to the service center for further diagnostics / CPU replacement as I noted you have already attempted reinstalling Windows.
<br />

            Hi Binkodyl 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

    <title>Windows RT - Xbox Music &#38; XBox Video Apps - They Just Do Not - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows RT - Xbox Music &#38; XBox Video Apps - They Just  Do Not Work&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I own a 64gig Surface with Windows RT on it. Despite all the criticisms of the device there really aren't many things wrong with it and the hardware is fine. I installed a 64 SDXC card and used mklink in CMD to create links to folders on that and now all
 my media syncs and updates. The "MUSIC Info" app is a great audio player and the MusicDJ app is good for making playlists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I miss the Zune Software I use on Windows 7 and even Windows Media Player 12...because they work and the Xbox Music and XBox Video apps are absolutely awful. Given that WMP isn't on Windows RT, we're forced to use the XBox apps but they are so broken it's
 untrue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XBox Music:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finds about 10% of my audio collection and alters the metadata on most of it, rendering it (my music collection) broken and useless. It should read the tags, but it's shouldn't overwrite them without asking me first so I can at least say "NO!". What is left
 is a mess of music with my genres and artist data screwed up. Quite why it cannot locate all my music is quite beyond me, given that it's all in either mp3 or mp4 format and the music it does find is in those formats. WMP and Zune do not have this problem:
 point them at your Windows Libraries and hey-presto...The XBox Music app won't even let you correct it's mistakes by editing your music, again unlike WMP and Zune. We have to ask: why didn't they just re-badge one of them and add the store functionality like
 it is in (gulp) iTunes. It's an unusable app and I uninstalled it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XBox Video:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some ways this is even worse as it teases you that it knows what it's doing and then deceives you. My videos are organised as cleanly as my music. Although it takes a while, XBox Video will find my video folders and import them without altering the metadata...however...even
 though I have used a metatag editor to ensure my videos are marked as "Movie" or "TV" or "Music", Xbox Video ignores the tags and lumps everything in together. As if that wasn't bad enough, it will inexplicably miss files from folders it has imported where
 there are episodes, meaning that a folder with 6 episodes in it will only show 5 of them in the app, and a folder with a dozen will only show 10-11 of them. How? Why? I have deleted and re-imported, I have re-indexed my HD and uninstalled/re-installed the
 XBox Video app, all to no avail. The "MyMeta" app in the store will happily edit metadata in all my videos but XBox Video just ignores it all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two faulty apps, replacing one that worked flawlessly (Zune)&nbsp;or one that is old but works (Windows Media Player). Given that I have a Windows 8 Phone too, you can imaging how frustrating it coming from Win Phone 7 and Zune/WMP for syncing EVERYTHING to Win
 Phone 8 and the beta desktop app and featureless Metro app. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's over 3 months since Windows 8 launched and we still don't have a program to do the job! I don't want to have to jump between OS's or multiple programs to play my media or sync to my devices; premuably, Microsoft, you have heard of iTunes? Zune was your
 iTunes killer...why on earth have you abandoned it and not replaced it? To launch 2 new OS's (Win 8 and Win RT) without a proper media player/media manager is ridiculous. XP had WMP, Vista, Win 7 too...but not Win RT? Win 8 has WMP at least but it's clunky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't imagine what people who have moved to Windows Phone must think if they've had iPhones/iPods...it's a mess and it's confusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 3 months and no fixes, no replacements...if it wasn't for the fact you just can't game on a Mac, I'd have adopted the Apple ecosystem by now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sort it out, or the Surface will fail, Win 8 Phone will die and you'll be in serious danger of falling so far behind the competition there will be no point in even trying...</p>

            I have also had some problems with the Windows RT Surface with audio/video. I have no problems when I am at home connecting my RT to my homegroup and streaming music to my Surface from my Windows 7 machine. The problem lies when I am away from home and
 cannot stream audio/video from my home machine to my Surface over the internet like several ways&nbsp;claim&nbsp;I should be able to via linked ID's. I do not have any problems doing this with another windows 7 machine over the internet. Is there any reason why this
 functionality appears to be not in Windows RT? or could i possibly be doing something&nbsp;incorrect&nbsp;that is not allowing this to work only on the Windows RT Surface?
<div>I have tried all the "Troubleshooting" options and still cannot get this to work. I am starting to wonder if this functionality is even available on the RT tablet?</div>
<div>I also have lots of problems connecting my Surface to my&nbsp;sound bar&nbsp;via Bluetooth, it will see it and just will not connect. It tries but fails every time. Every other tablet/phone/device I have tried will work but this one.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Finally, when I try and connect my Surface to my XBOX 360, it will work for a while then the Surface will lock up and spew errors, only way to regain&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;is to reboot the tablet. I have done this with my Xoom tablet and had 0 issues and have
 not had to reboot it in over a month. The Xoom will even connect to my Xbox via youtube w/o a single issue. it just works. I'm trying to like the integrated MS technology, but I'm with you, it just does not work... I hope they get their act together and resolve
 alot of these problems soon. No one gets it right on the first attempt but they have to get it right shortly after or they will loss the clients, if not already lost another.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hey mate, just writing to say I totally agree with you. Regardless of the issues you have been having, I still think we should be given the option to have WMP on the surface TAB. Isn't the beauty of windows about choice?. I knew before buying that you would
 not be able to install programs except through the Windows store, but there is no reason why Microsoft could not address this issue through software update. Come on excel, word, OneNote, PowerPoint, IE, but no WMP, what do Microsoft&nbsp;think most people use&nbsp;their
 PCs for?</p>
<p>Why treat Surface RT users as a lower class Windows users?</p>

            I have contributed fairly critically to this and other similar threads. I was deeply unhappy about XBox Music on the Surface 1.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Since I bought a Surface 2 and started using Windows 8.1, and thus the new version of XBox Music, I'm actually pretty happy with it. It's certainly not as good as the Zune Player software was, but other than not being able to manually change all the metadata
 (particularly genre), I don't really have much of a problem with it. It's now my default audio player where MediaMonkey had been.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's not as fully-featured as iTunes, Zune or even Windows Media Player, but this time around it works. I'm only really using it to play the music stored locally on the device, but it's doing the job, playlist-making is easy with touch and I really think
 people should give it a go on the Windows RT 8.1.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I may even consider an XBox Music Pass as Spotify still haven't pulled their finger out and made an app for Windows 8. Not keen on Deezer, personally, thus XBox Music is actually the best music player on Windows 8.1 RT.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for XBox Video, it's better...but integration with memory cards seems flaky still. Sure, it works as long as your memory card is included in your libraries, but up until a December update, each individual folder was given its own tile - now anything
 on a memory card is lumped together in one tile with a ridiculous 30-character name. It wasn't always like that. XBox video is still painfully slow to update when you add new files, where XBox Music picks them up immediately after you launch the app.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Happily, the Windows Phone App works okay, although again it's a poor cousin to Zune.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Improvements have been made...but think about iOS, Microsoft: It's all there, working, one touch away. That's the goal, right there, only better. I would not swap my Surface 2 for any other Tablet, but I still feel like a beta tester.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Surface feels arrogant...especially the Pro, a reflection of Microsoft under Ballmer, I guess. Rt is unfinished...the Surface is still not 'ready' and I think that's because Microsoft wrongly assumed developers would flock to them from Android and
 iOS because they're Microsoft. Apple may be sitting on their hands releasing minor updates year on year, but they have all the good vibes with the press and the tech media, while Microsoft are vilified for every little mistake...so they need to cut out the
 mistakes, finish projects they start and release great products to the world. WP8 is proof they can do it...it's a fantastic OS and the devices are great too...but they're still lacking some key apps that make iPhone indispensable to their users (Skyplus control
 from the local pub, for example, Cisco app for the iPad etc. etc.)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Go into the bigger Currys and you'll see an Apple area, full of devices. Where's the Microsoft stuff? Somewhere...you have to look for it though and people are not looking for Microsoft anymore, because the name is synonymous with "bugs" and "unfinished".
 I'm sure the XBox One is actually decent, but early adopters are paying a price for certain features not working and unreliability. These things test the patience of long-time users like me and our numbers are dwindling.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>WP8 works but the next generation need to be all-singing, all-dancing in terms of apps. I love the Lumia 1520 and want one...the 1020 is a market leader...and MS own Nokia. They could use some of that skill with the Surface line in terms of getting things
 right from day one and custom apps that are desirable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I still have faith...but if the next big update doesn't put things right i'll be jumping ship. I need my stuff to work.</div>

<h2>            Windows 7 will not load, hangs at &#39;loading operating system&#39;</h2>
                    My wife's computer crashed yesterday. She got a blue screen and then it rebooted. When it boots it will load the BIOS but then just hangs on a screen that says loading operating system. I tried using the win7 recovery disk, but it was unable to repair
 the startup issue. I am also unable to select which operating system to repair as it does not list any. I think her hard drive died, when I try to select the hard drive to load the OS from it just tells me the disk needs to be formatted. Are their any other
 recovery steps I should take? &nbsp;Is there any way to definitively tell whether the hard drive is dead?

<p>FR request sent to some of you, I'm quite keen on Powerstar Rivals now I've completed the career mode.</p>
Also I got most of my extreme items from the 15,000 packs after I received most of the elite items, probably save some money in the long run.

    <title>How to restore or reset folder option back to default after virus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wc000111  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to restore or reset folder option back to default after virus removal&#63;</h2>
                    I recently removed a nasty virus manually with 3rd party app and in the process the default folder permission/view were changed. Some folders that I don't normally see (\ProgramData) now show up along with others. I tried to manually hide them but it messed
 things up where programs won't show or run so I had to resort to system restore. However, the folders are still showing now so is there an easy way to reset restore back to the original Win7 folder option so the folders that are supposed to be hidden would
 stay hidden? I read some posts talk use anti-virus tools to reset the folders but it only works with XP. Help!?

<h2>            HDMI Monitor not connecting to Laptop &#42;No Signal&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two monitors connected to my laptop - one connected via HDMI and the other connected via VGA. Yesterday both worked 100% fine and have done for months. This morning, the HDMI monitor did not switch on while the VGA connected monitor worked fine. I
 have googled/youtube'd and tried everything I've come across:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Tried restarting with just the HDMI connected</p>
<p>- Tried updating/installing the latest graphic driver</p>
<p>- Tried installing the latest monitor drivers&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Tried plugging in/checking all cables</p>
<p>- Tried switching the HDMI for one I know is working&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Tried installing a Driver Update manager - ran the scan - all good with the drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>The VGA connects just fine but the HDMI always throws up the issue "No Signal".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I have noticed is that yesterday, I could right click the volume option and select which of the devices I wanted to use but today that option has disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Not able to sign in with new microsoft account</h2>
                    I have a Windows&nbsp; laptop&nbsp;and use to access Skype via Facebook. It seems this not possible anymore, so I have formed a new Microsoft account, went through all the stages (verified my account, checked password etc)&nbsp;but I still cannot get Skype to recognise
 this as a valid account? I am a little exasperated that something that was once so easy to use has now become so difficult.

 many solutions, such as making sure 'Show Disabled Devices' it checked, and using 3rd-party drivers, such as Realtek Audio drivers, however it still doesn't work.</p>

    <title>Why does system restore fail due to ACCESS DENIED error before and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> howardway  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does system restore fail due to ACCESS DENIED error before and after a recovery to factory state&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP dv7 laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. After months of instability and registry errors (that started when I extracted a system folder that had ended up in my documents folder after a crash), my system crashed again,
 and I had to recover to factory state. All seemed well, but a check of the Event Viewer revealed that 2 errors were occurring with every boot:<span>&nbsp;
</span>WMI (10) and Kernel-Event Tracing FROM THE DAY OF RECCOVERY ON. These errors were among the errors that were showing up at every boot before the Recovery. Also, before the Recovery I could not do a System Restore (with AVG and Malwarebytes on or off).
 I always got the ACCESS DENIED error. <span>&nbsp;</span>THE SAME IS TRUE NOW.</p>
<p>Possibly relevant:<span>&nbsp; </span>Before the Recovery, AVG found the Luhe.Packed.AP trojan virus in my MovieMaker 6 program which I had downloaded from the Internet from a guy who had extracted it from Vista (many months after
 I installed it). AVG did not find it when I installed it. After the Recovery, I restored my desktop where I had stored the MM6 files. When I tried to install MM6, AVG found the same virus and deleted the install file. Thinking that it could have been infected
 on my desktop (?), I downloaded the files from the same source, but when I tried to install MM6, the same thing happened:<span>&nbsp;
</span>virus found, file deleted.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you getting any error code/message while updating Windows 8?</li><li>Are you getting any error code/message when you try to reset or refresh Windows 8?</li></ol>
<p>As you mentioned that you are getting warning message "The average disk queue length is 3", this means, the performance or capacity of an entire system is limited by a single or small number of components or resources which may include "Hard Drive" or "Ram"
 etc. I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Microsoft Safety Scanner;</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-in/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-in/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Once finished with <strong>Method 1</strong>, proceed with
<strong>Method 2</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: How to perform a clean boot in Windows;</strong></p>
<p>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8. Refer the link below.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: Refer to the section <strong>"</strong><span>How to perform a clean boo</span>t<strong>"
</strong>and generate a system health report, to check if you are getting same warning message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Once finished, refer to the section "<span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshootin</span>g".</p>

<p>If its an intel-based pc,try intel.com/support/drivers/software</p>
<p>locate the update utility,it'll scan any intel-based pc for hardware updates.</p>
<p>If other brand,go to the pc home page,check for downloads</p>
<p>Also,event viewer,in administrative tools,would have data on the problem(s)</p>
<p>Also,chk this microsoft link for that.</p>

    <title>Downloding Windows update process is looping. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Downloding Windows update process is looping.</h2>
                    <p><span>OT:</span>Looping Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have Windows 8 installed on my HP Desktop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the last few weeks I have noticed a constant downloading of files slowing my PC and consuming my bandwith etc.. After many checks for malware etc. I decided to do a full recovery and reinstalled Windows 8 from the recovery partition of the drive
 hoping this would fix the problem. After the rebuild I installed McAfee rather than Avast which is what I was using before&nbsp;just in case it had missed something. I then checked for updates both from HP and MS and installed them so my PC was up to date.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately this did not solve the problem. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With a bit of investigation I discovered that it was the BITS service&nbsp;constantly downloading files from MS which I assume was being driven by some update process, so I did the following.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Ran the Fixit for Windows Update solution from MS which found some issues and fixed them. Still no success.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. I viewed the BITS log showing the files Windows was trying to download (there were 2) and decided to let it complete hoping all would then be OK. This completed as when&nbsp;I re-checked the BITS log it was empty and the 2 files were in the downloaded
 folders and were the correct size etc. as per the previous BITS log.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. A few hours after it completed this download it then downloaded several others most seemed to relate to updating MS Office files, OneNote etc. This was without any request from me as I had turned Windows Update off at this point.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. I ran the Windows Update manually through the Action Centre option and that also seemed to download different&nbsp;files, again mostly related to MS Office. I installed all updates through this option and my PC is now apparently up to date as there are
 no more updates available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Now when I check the BITS log the same 2 files (as in&nbsp;item&nbsp;2)&nbsp;are queued for download and are downloading again.&nbsp;The names of the files as per the BITS log are below. Both of these were&nbsp;successfully downloaded before when I completed the process
 in item&nbsp;2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WindowsStoreSetupBox.exe</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9600.17053.winblue_refresh.140923-1144_x64fre_client_Core_en-gb-IR4_CCRA_X64FRER_EN-GB_ESD.esd</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. To stop any further downloads I have stopped the BITS service and all seems to be OK but obviously the BITS service really needs to be running.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7. This is what the Fixit program from MS found when it ran before. I am reluctant to rerun it in case that is causing everything to reset.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Questions</span></p>
<p><span>1. Does anyone have any idea why this download process is looping.</span></p>
<p><span>2. How do download requests get added to the BITS log to be downloaded if the Windows Update process is turned off.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Any suggestions of how this can be fixed permanently.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am not a techie so please keep it simple.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - I have just checked the BITS log again and there are an additional 2 entries for the same files to be downloaded. The original ones are still in the log and awaiting to be downloaded as the download is not complete. The Remote Name (which I assume is
 the file location on the MS server) is very slightly different but the file sizes and destination file and path are identical so it must be the same files again. No doubt in another day the same 2 files will be added to the log to be downloaded so that will
 make 3 of each file in the queue.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the scenario, this can happen when the update&nbsp;sometimes fails to install or if the Windows software distribution folder is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I would suggest you&nbsp;to follow the steps below and check the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rename the software distribution folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + X and click <strong>Command</strong>
<strong>Prompt</strong> <strong>(Admin)</strong>.&nbsp;In the Command Prompt&nbsp;box, enter the following strings of text, one at a time, and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>net stop <span>wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>net stop bits</strong></p>
<p>Now browse to the<strong> C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution </strong>folder and delete all the files and folders inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the files are in use, you may not be able to delete files/folders. Hence, restart your device. After restarting, run the commands above again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to delete the files from the mentioned <strong>Software Distribution
</strong>folder after restarting the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in the Command Prompt windows, type the following commands one at a time, and hit Enter:</p>
<p><span><strong>net start <span>wuauserv</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>net start bits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;Remove pending.xml&nbsp;by running below&nbsp;commands in Command Prompt&nbsp;as Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TAKEOWN /F c:\windows\winsxs (file:///c:/windows/winsxs)</strong><br />
<strong>ICACLS c:\windows\winsxs (file:///c:/windows/winsxs) /grant administrators:F</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. I have completed Step1 but I get an error when trying the first part of Step2 as the command apparently has an invalid argument as per the attached screen shot. The second step produces an invalid parameter error as you would expect
 as it uses the same path.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7310643b-42d3-4ccb-bab8-bc0275ee429f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked and whilst there is a Winsxs folder but there is no Winsxs file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as part of Step2 you mention removing pending.xml. Could you please clarify which of the two commands Takeown or Icacls will do this or do I need to delete this file separately once I have ownership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to update you, even after deleting the files and folders in the Software Distribution folder the download of the 2 files as per item 5 in my original email has started again. I assume this is because not all of the steps have been completed. Oddly the
 creation date of the file that becomes the WindowsStoreSetupBox.exe is the original date of the old file (30 Oct 14) but the other file has a creation date of today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, I hope you will be able to help in resolving this problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>These commands are to take the ownership of the folder. In order to delete the pending.xml file, you need&nbsp;to manually delete it by navigating to the specific Winsxs folder (check if there are multiple pending.xml files and if yes delete all).</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I assumed that was the purpose so I managed to get ownership of the folder and renamed all versions of the pending.xml file which seemed to cure the constant download issue together with another use of the Fixit Windows Update program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However as I was experiencing major&nbsp;issues with the speed of IE10 despite "removing" and reinstalling it in the Turn Off&nbsp;Windows Features options I have since completed a Windows reinstall and have checked that the pending.xml has not returned. I was surprised
 to find that doing a Windows reinstall actually seemed to be more thorough in removing programs than a full system recovery, which is what I did at the beginning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rechecked the BITS log and initially&nbsp;there was only one instance for each of the 2 files that were originally stuck in the loop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have two!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I do not think your diagnosis is correct as I am back exactly where I started from having done a full reinstall to the original "as manufactured" condition and then done a full reinstall of Windows 8. Either one of those I would have expected to fix the
 issue as surely the result would restore my PC back to its original state. I have also done as you suggested , deleting the Software Distribution folder etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount of data already downloaded for the second file (9600.17....) is different in each instance so I can only conclude there are 2 downloads of this file in progress.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know what these 2 files are and what process MS have put in place to prompt their inclusion into the BITS log and download process as clearly there is something wrong with at least part of that process otherwise it would not be stuck in this
 loop. Also I have not requested the download of these files and according to the Windows Update process my PC is up to date so what has prompted their download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present I do not have a pending.xml file in the Winsxs folder. </p>

<p>
</p><p>As per the discussion here, You are using Windows 8 and there are updates downloaded for specific feature, it seems your PC might be downloading files for installing Windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The files-WindowsStoreSetupBox.exe/9600.17053.winblue_refresh.140923-1144_x64fre_client_Core_en-gb-IR4_CCRA_X64FRER_EN-GB_ESD.esd might be pointers to download of Win 8.1</p>
<p>As of now, Windows 8.1 will be installed on PC's which are yet to be upgraded to the higher version of the Windows build.</p>
<p>This will happen if the automatic feature of installing updates is set to On. It's recommended too to install the latest as and when available.
</p>
<p>So here you have few things to perform.</p>
<p>-Check the Windows Update history to verify if the KB2871389 is installed or in the queue to be installed</p>
<p>The following article provides information on this:<br />
Update is available that prepares Windows 8 and Windows RT-based computers for the update to Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 RT
<br />
<a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2871389/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2871389/en-us</a>
</p>
<p>Either you may go ahead with downloading and installing Windows 8.1 from the store to upgrade to Win 8.1 or stay with Win 8 by hiding the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be helpful to work on the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you know why I would have 2 instances of this download (both partially complete) in the BITS file waiting to be downloaded. Previously&nbsp;I have allowed the download to complete before I did the system restore etc. but even after all the data had downloaded
 another download of the same files was started again. Therefore it seems the downloading of these files is stuck in a loop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB2871389 has downloaded and installed successfully and Updates are set to Automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also do you know where the schedule is that controls the BITS service as I understand it should begin downloading at off peak times and it would be good if it were possible to set these times then I could leave my PC on overnight to start the download process
 if that is what is needed to prevent this problem. Although as I have said before, I have already completed the download of these 2 files only to find the download process has just started again for these 2 files.</p>

                    Windows 7 does not detect bd/dvd/cd. This is a reinstall of windows 7 after hard drive died. Was able to use bd/dvd/cd for 1st week no problem. I have tried the disable dvd in device manager fix and can watch the dvd drive disappear out of windows explorer
 on restart. Bought a new dvd/cd drive thinking the original might have&nbsp;gone bad. Same old thing. Is there a fix for this?

After the above :<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />

<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays
<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

            Hi AnandGhosh,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano a Microsoft Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />Both the phone number are correct for India phone support center, so you can call one of the two as you wish. There is also a third number (80 4010 3000).
<br />
<br />If you have other doubts, please tell me.

<p>
</p><p>I have had Windows PC's and laptops since 2004. &nbsp;Recently, I converted a Windows 7 laptop to windows 10. &nbsp;I now have 4 Windows 10 machines. &nbsp;I have always used my Hotmail account to sign into my other XP, Vista, W7 and W10 machines. &nbsp;Now, this latest machine
 is asking for a &nbsp;"Windows Account" password in addition to my Hotmail account. &nbsp;I don't even know what that is. &nbsp;I've never had such a thing. &nbsp;Why do I need ANOTHER password to sign in? &nbsp;Why am I not able to sign in like I always have?</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. &nbsp;Here is the info you requested:</p>
<ol>
<li>The only change was converted Windows 7 to Windows 10 on the machine.</li><li>It happened about a week later. &nbsp;I was attempting to sign into the Windows Feedback app.</li><li>I have no problem signing into all three of my Hotmail accounts or using Outlook-365.</li><li>No, I am prompted immediately after signing in with my primary Hotmail account.</li></ol>
<p>I have attached a screenshot of the second password dialog. &nbsp;It also mentions a PIN number, but again, I have no idea what they're talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has not happened, so far, on my two machines where Windows 10 is the native OS (not a conversion). &nbsp;I have a second converted W7 machine, but I have not attempted a sign-in on that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1095ff44-978f-479c-bc93-9919ad5000a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1095ff44-978f-479c-bc93-9919ad5000a9" /></a></p>
