<h2>            Windows 10 Error&#58; Problem with Wireless Adapter or Access Point</h2>
                    <p>
</p><blockquote>
<div>
<p>I recently received a new computer for my job that came with Windows 10 pre-installed. For the past week, I have been having several different issues with the wireless connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, the wireless connection would be listed as limited after using the computer for 4 hours. This was annoying, but I was looking into the fix on the website. Today a new issue popped up. The computer is saying "Can't connect to network" in reference
 to the network I am trying to connect to. When I run the fix connection troubleshooter, the error "Problem with Wireless Adapter or Access Point" comes on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I tried rebooting the router - several times. It didn't work. Then, I checked to make sure it was not an issue with the internet in general. It's not. The computer is able to connect to the internet through an Ethernet connection. I called the ISP
 provider to double-check and make sure it was not a modem/internet issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I called our VOIP provider. We had gone into the router settings and added new rules on Friday because we were having trouble with dropping phone calls. We deleted the rules that had been added, restored the router to the factory settings. It still
 was not working. They were no longer able to help, and they directed me to the Router's manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted the router's manufacturer. I was on the phone with them for over an hour. We tried rebooting the router (again); we went into the router's settings and tried using different settings. We also went to the computer's device manager and installed
 any drivers/updates for the device, but nothing worked. They then asked me to attempt connecting to the internet through another operating system. I tried connecting to the WiFi from my android phone (in airplane mode) and it worked! The manufacturer then
 told me that the issue is with the PC's OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried downloading the new updates for Windows 10, but they will not download. After an hour, the download progress bar remained at 0%. In addition, the updates failed to install on Friday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other information: My computer is <em>not </em>in flight mode, and it does have the wifi on (as in it recognizes that there are available wifi networks).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking at the different posts on this site, I have tried a few different things as well hoping that one of them would work:</p>
<p>(1) Run the System File Checker tool - It did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>(2) Run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter - It came back with the subject error.</p>
<p>(3) Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter - It said all issues were resolved.<br />
</p>
<p>(4) Perform a Clean Boot - Still could not connect to the wireless network.</p>
<p>(5) Run the Internet Connection Troubleshooter (As Administrator) - It came back with the subject error.</p>
<p>(6) Reset the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Settings (in the Administrator Command Prompt) - I used the netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt &nbsp;It said:</p>
<p>Resetting Interface, OK!</p>
<p>Resetting Neighbor, OK!</p>
<p>Resetting Path, OK!</p>
<p>Resetting&nbsp; , failed.</p>
<p>Access is denied.</p>
<p>Resetting, OK!</p>
<p>- After restarting, the wifi still did not work. So I retried but used netch int ip reset. It said:</p>
<p>Resetting, failed.</p>
<p>Access is denied. </p>
<p>There's no user specified settings to be reset.</p>
<p>- That one didn't work.</p>
<p>(7) Reset Winsock and flush DNS - After restarting the computer, I still could not connect to the wifi.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at everything, it might be two separate problems: windows&nbsp;updates that are not installing and wifi connection. Besides getting the Windows updates (which I am now looking at other posts to try to fix why they are not downloading), is there anything
 else I can do to get the wifi connection?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience and at the same time we appreciate the time and effort you have put in to resolve the issue. Let me assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed any further, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the PC you are using?</li><li>What is the edition of Windows 10 installed in your PC? Is it connected to any Domain?</li><li>Are you referring to any Windows troubleshooter when you say 'connection troubleshooter'?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to adjust Power Management settings for&nbsp;the USB&nbsp;device and check if it helps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Type <span>device manager</span> to open the Search bar, and then select <span>
Device Manager</span> from the results list.</li><li>Expand the <strong>Network Adapter</strong>, right click on the&nbsp;network device&nbsp;and select
<span>Properties</span>.</li><li>Under the Power Management tab, uncheck <span>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</span>, and then click
<span>OK</span>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Next, check that the security and encryption protocols for the&nbsp;PC match the router's by checking the settings on the working PCs. To do so, right-click on the Wi fi access point name and select "Properties" to view and change the protocols.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still does not help, follow the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party application/software to be causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A <strong><span>clean boot</span></strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

 startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also,&nbsp;verify that you have disabled any other&nbsp;third party real-time antimalware products that were installed on your PC, to check if any how incoming/outgoing connections to the PC are affected by the firewall.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Follow&nbsp;any of the below&nbsp;alternates&nbsp;to remove the network&nbsp;profile. This will fix any issues related to the Wireless network profile (if any).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Alternative 1</span></p>
<p>Open the list of available networks. Locate the network name on the list and right-click or press and hold on it. Click or tap
<em>“Forget this network"</em> to delete the profile from your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Alternative 2</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong>, select
<strong><span>Command prompt (Admin)</span></strong> to bring up elevated Command prompt.</span></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In Command prompt type the following&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh wlan delete profile name="<strong>WirelessProfileName</strong>"</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WirelessProfileName </strong>is the name of the network you want to delete.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: After you delete the profile, reconnect&nbsp;and reconfigure&nbsp;the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Additionally, you may also refer to the below Microsoft link for more information on</span></p>

    <title>Problem Syncing with iCloud - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreadanes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem Syncing with iCloud</h2>
                    <p>On June 15, 2017 an Apple update related to two factor authentication was rolled out.&nbsp; From that point forward, my email, calendar, and contacts would no longer sync on my Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; The error message said "iCloud settings are out of date".&nbsp; I tried
 everything, including a service call to Microsoft (big deal since they charge $29!) and nothing worked.&nbsp; They suggested I call Apple.&nbsp; I did (much much much better customer service, by the way!) and here is the skinny:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Apple migrated to two factor authentication. It no longer seems to be optional.</p>
<p>- I had to update my iCloud settings to turn it on, then from a web browser on the iCloud settings page, generate an "app password".&nbsp; It is a one time code that is used in place of my regular password in a non-Apple device/app to "bypass" the need for the
 secondary ID.</p>
<p>- I opened the iCloud account on my Surface Pro 4, pasted the previously copied app password, and PRESTO! all my data is now syncing again quite nicely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given my more than an hour with two tech support teams, and the loss of productivity and frustration it caused me, I decided to post this one (and maybe only!) time on a forum, just in case I can save someone else the grief of trying to figure this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a techie, so may not be able to answer additional questions, but hope this helps those of you who choose to leverage multiple suppliers for your technology needs!</p>

<p>Well, great you found the solution and "YES", Apple has a stupid double security system (but seems to work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However; iCloud, iTunes, and QuickTime are all Apple and you have to go to the Apple Forums for solutions. &nbsp;Microsoft has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Apple tends to not update their Windows versions of software as well as they do with their Apple versions. &nbsp;Do not have great expectations with anything "Apple" on a Windows PC.</p>

<p><strong>Are all device bans permanent?</strong></p>
<p>All Xbox Live device bans are permanent. However, some Code of Conduct violations that don’t rise to the level of a device ban can instead result in the temporary loss of specific Xbox One or Xbox on Windows device privileges. When this occurs, the device can still connect to Xbox Live, but certain functionality (such as communications or online multiplayer) will be restricted for a particular duration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Mic only works with speakers plugged in</h2>
                    <p>
Hello,</p>
<p>
So today i bought a Logitech headset and when i got home and plugged it in the mic part wont work but the headphones part works fine.</p>
<p>
So i tried to find out what the problem is.</p>
<p>
Apparently if i want the mic part of the headset to work i have to plug in my speakers.</p>
<p>
Only problem with that is i would like to use this headset for both a mic and headphones.</p>
<p>
Why is this happening?</p>

<p>So today i bought a Logitech headset and when i got home and plugged it in the mic part wont work but the headphones part works fine. Apparently if i want the mic part of the headset to work i have to plug in my speakers. Only problem with that is i would
 like to use this headset for both a mic and headphones.</p>

<p>Deepak's steps are good but I'd like to add a couple of things. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check the default settings easily by right clicking the speaker icon in the lower left Taskbar If you are using Windows Vista, 7 or 8. Then select Playback devices and then Recording devices to set the Logitech as the Default device. You don't say
 which model Logitech? Is it USB? If so and you are using front USB ports on a Desktop Computer, try the rear USB port. Also, when in Recording devices and you highlight the Logitech (USB maybe) as Default, click Properties and then Levels to make sure the
 Levels slider is at 50% or greater.</p>

            <p>Hi Bionicmarvel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to follow steps listed in the article and check if that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Error Message: The System Has Recovered from a Serious Problem</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316424</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer the below mentioned article for more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You receive a "System Has Recovered from a Serious Error" message after every restart</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317277</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious
 software.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with
 your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the
 Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Let us know if this helps.</p>

            I would not expect to hear anything back from Microsoft when you submit your information.&nbsp; It makes you "feel good" to think that you will get some magical solution, but I would not count on it.<br />
<br />
The advice from the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" to use KB316424 is really misleading (I will stop short of calling it ridiculous) especially advice from the article that says:<br />
<br />
<i>All Windows XP drivers should be version 5.1.2600 or later.</i><br />
<br />
That makes no sense at all as you are going to have <i>puh-lenty</i> of drivers in Device Manager that are not going to be that version.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were to install MS drivers for those devices, chances are astronomically high that your system would become more
 afflicted.<br />
<br />
If your IE8 is broken, are you able to get on the Internet at all?&nbsp; Surely the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" can help you get their own Microsoft products to behave.&nbsp; If you can't get on the Internet, you will not be downloading the Microsoft
 Safety Scanner, right?<br />
<br />
It sounds like your system is crashing for some reason so first you need to configure your system so it will save a crash dump file for you and then provide more information about your system and then maybe the Support Engineer "expert" will be better able
 to assist you.<br />
<br />
First tell us more about your system:<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Do you have the problematic Windows Desktop Search installed?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, configure your system to create crash dump files:<br />
<br />
Right click My Computer, Properties, Advanced, Startup and Recovery Settings.<br />
<br />
In the System failure section:<br />
<br />
Put a check mark in the "Write an event to the system log" box<br />
Put a check mark in the "Send an administrative alert" box<br />
Uncheck the "Automatically restart" box<br />
<br />
In the Write debugging information section, choose:<br />
<br />
Small memory dump (64 KB)<br />
<br />
Set the Small dump directory to:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Click OK, OK to save the settings.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and then wait for the next restart/crash.<br />
<br />
If your system crashes later with a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what it says:<br />
<br />
Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.<br />
<br />
Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you.&nbsp; We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.<br />

    <title>Getting message saying my laptop battery has a problem and might shut - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niki87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting message saying my laptop battery has a problem and might shut down. But it&#39;s only 6mo old&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Original Title: Problem with battery</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I bought a laptop HP 620<span>&nbsp; </span>with windows 7 about four months ago, and recently a warning came up saying "There is a problem with your battery so your computer might shut down suddenly." The computer isn't that old. However, it's a Lithium
 ion battery, which aren't supposed to have this problem. This all happens even if the computer is plugged in, and even if I remove the battery altogether. The strangest thing is that this message comes up sometimes and even the computer is unplugged, it doesn’t
 shut down so quickly, contrariwise, the battery lasts the same time as when I bought the computer and when there is no message "There is a problem with your battery so your computer might shut down suddenly.” I've searched and found topics over this saying
 that it's a problem with Windows 7. Can you help me with this issue?</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since the computer is still under warranty be sure to check with HP and their forums (known issues).<br />
The battery could have a defect or there could be a hardware issue affecting it. <br />
<br />
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Check with System maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and their forums<br />
(if any) for known issues. Some maker's have issued BIOS and other updates to help with battery<br />
problems.<br />

Other information that might help :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Power Options - Power Plans - Change plan Settings - check the Advanced<br />
Settings for drain and usage settings (this is how much to be used and not how much or how<br />
long to charge).</p>
<p>Actually what causes a lot of wear on a battery is draining it too low repeatedly. With today's<br />
systems over-charging is not an issue.<br />
<br />
Here are some tips to help and troubleshoot battery related issues.</p>
<p>Old battery? Unplug power to computer - remove battery and clean the contacts with a pencil<br />
eraser (do not use this if your battery has thin slots -&nbsp;just clean the knife edges that fit into<br />
them and be careful). Batteries do wear out if old, or it could be a problem with the computer.<br />
Check with the support of the system maker and many of them&nbsp;have on-line forums.<br />
<br />
Newer type Litium-Ion batteries usually last longer if you do not discharge them below 30%<br />
however on a laptop that will not extend their life that much. Best is to use A/C adapter<br />
whenever possible.<br />
<br />
I use the free version of BatteryBar to monitor my battery. Click the Green button on the<br />
Yellow box on right side of page to download latest stable version.<br />

<h3> tmoosesr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Explorer File Details Pane</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to get the File Details Pane to be on the bottom of the File Explorer Window in windows 10.&nbsp; It used to work like that on Windows 7.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work with a large number of folders each containing hundreds of images so I have several file explorer windows open at once (on a secondary monitor.)&nbsp; It was nice to have the thumbnail of the image selected to be displayed at the bottom of the window.&nbsp;
 The new explorer simply requires too much space (width) on my desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please give me back what used to work.&nbsp; I can't see any logical reason to take that option away.&nbsp;

            <p>I am looking to have the file details pane on the bottom of the file explorer window and not to the right of the files list.&nbsp; For me it is useless to have it off to the right as it requires my file explorer window to be too wide.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My workflow requires me to have up to 8 separate file explorer windows open at the same time.&nbsp; I reduce the width of each so I can have them side by side on a second monitor.&nbsp; In windows 7, I was able to have the file details at the bottom of this window
 which would give me a thumbnail of the image selected.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems silly that Microsoft took that away and "Submitting if for an improvement" sounds stupid when it used to work and now it doesn't. &nbsp; Sounds like a case of two steps forward and three steps back.&nbsp; Thanks Microsoft...

 people for their daily use.&nbsp; </span></strong>I personally have done what you said and given feedback to development for this very problem, and so have many others, but it is NOT being changed, and people are leaving Windows 10 and going back to Windows 7 because
 of it.</p>
<p>Only seeing "one or the other" is useless for many people. Especially when it comes to images. There are images that look very similar and the details are needed to see difference in dimensions, pixel info, file size etc while scrolling through pictures.
 This is especially true when viewing images for embroidery files. The software that views these files uses the file explorer and shows the images in the preview, and the details with number of stitches and the size of height and width in the details. Many
 images look the same in the preview. They are the same design after all, but very different sizes and number of stitches. I<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">t is imperative to see the details pane at the same time as the preview so we can scroll through
 images and easily tell which image is the one we truly need!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 7 had preview and details pane available at the same time, and this is why so many people are complaining. This function was TAKEN AWAY.
</span>Very poor move by Microsoft and it kills productivity. I do not have time to switch between previews and details as I scroll through images and try to keep track of which image name was which.
</p>
<p><br />
We seriously need this Windows 7 functionality back for this reason. Many people have rolled back because they need both panes and the same time and cannot live without it. I'm ready to do it myself. We've been complaining about this ever since we switched
 to Windows 10, and since there is no change, people go back and ditch Windows 10 altogether.<br />

    <title>Problem with Beats Audio &#40;IDT&#41; in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> florastadler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Beats Audio &#40;IDT&#41; in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a specific problem with sound on my PC (HP Pavilion dv7), but only when I try to edit a video file (MP4)&nbsp;using the latest version of Windows Live Movie Maker. The sound on the videos are fine when I download and play them on my laptop, but once I
 import into Movie Maker, the sound is nothing but crackling static. This static is then the only sound that comes from my speakers,&nbsp;it's the noise that replaces all system sounds, music I try to play, etc. It's like this until I restart the computer. But whenever
 I try to edit a video, it happens all over again and I have to restart the system to stop it. The problem seems to go away when I uninstall Beats Audio (IDT) from my computer, but the quality of sound on my PC just isn't good without it, so that's not a permanent
 solution. I never had this issue with Windows 7, so maybe it's some kind of&nbsp;bug&nbsp;in Windows 10 and how it operates with IDT? I&nbsp;have to edit video for work, so I really need this resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Flora</p>

            <p>I have this problem as well. The 3.5mm microphone input is full of static at any resolution. IDT the company dont offer any drivers for Windows 10, HP dont offer anything for Win 10 either.Their installer checks to see what OS is installed therefore the
 8.1 drivers will not install! Microsoft state that IDT Audio is not compatible with Win 10 yet their PARTNER (HP) recommended my hardware was suitable to upgrade to Windows !0.&nbsp;<br />

Answers anyone?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I speak English and would like do video chat with someone who speaks Korean. Although it says that Korean is not available for Video Voice Translation it does say that Korean is a "Neural" language. Does this give me the ability to carry on a video chat,
 with translation and subtitles in Korean??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would someone please provide me with the protocol(s) to set up English voice to Korean voice and vice versa for video calls(??) Also, the instructions to send/text to my friend(s) in Korea on how they can set up a video voice conversation with me(from Korean
 to English)(with captions on screen for both)As well as, how to choose the translated voice, ie male or female voice.</p>
<p>?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Korean to English and vis versa is not available in Skype voice translation with captions, would someone please tell me when it might become available(??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much!!!</p>

<h2>            Ethernet doesn&#39;t have a valid IP configuration</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a brand new PC workstation.<br />
<br />
Everything was fine, until recently, when I turn on my PC, I don't get an immediate internet connection.&nbsp; This is happening nearly everytime now with some frequency.<br />
<br />
I reset the router/modem and everything is fine after that, so all is good.<br />
<br />
But it is still frustrating.&nbsp; I get, <u><b>"Ethernet doesn't have a valid IP configuration".<br />
</b></u><br />
I googled this and it appears I am certainly not alone.<br />
<br />
The following to assist you are screenshots of my 'ipconfig' and 'Network Connection Status'
<u><b>before</b></u> (unsuccessful) and <u><b>after</b></u> (successful) internet access:<br />
<br />

<br />
You will see from the above that there is certainly something different with the data...<br />
<br />
I'm sure it is something so simple.<br />
____________________________________________<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I did find a nice youtube 'tutorial' in relation to this subject title about manually configurating the settings:<br />
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXsKTAxYtk<br />
<br />
I haven't tried this yet and that is probably down to the fact that I can't find my
<u><b>alternate</b></u> DNS server setting (the very last box to fill in - watch the video and you will know what I mean) ???<br />
<br />
Many thanks for reading, please help me.<br />

            <p>What is your result of your ipconfig is it time out..........</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>if it is time out. make sure all the network are wired up properly especially the RJ45 had to be seated in the network connection port securely. set your ip to automatic meaning DHCP top automatic issue you with an IP (for people using internet router with
 network switch. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>key in the gateway IP for your router, internet explorer settings etc......always make sure that gateway IP is not down or else internet will not work.</p>

            What do you mean 'time out'?&nbsp; Sorry, I am a newbie when it comes to things such as this.&nbsp; Please use layman terms.<br />
<br />
All my Ipconfig information is contained in my detailed post ie the links I provided.&nbsp; Please take a look.<br />
<br />
What is the RJ45? - I don't know what this means.<br />
<br />
My ip is set to automatic, this is where the problem lies I think from googling.&nbsp; Did you read my post AngPoon?&nbsp; That youtube link shows the user manually setting his ipv4 etc and then getting an internet connection!!<br />
<br />
Please have a look at those ipconfig results.&nbsp; I can see a difference.&nbsp; The default gateway is missing when NOT connected to th internet.&nbsp; When I have a connection, the default gateway is there.<br />
<br />
You will also see a difference in the ipv4 number, they are different.<br />
<br />
Please take the time to read my post and links.&nbsp; Many thanks<br />
<br />

            <p>The key bit in your two states is the IPv4 Address.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you are not connected it begins with 169. , when you are connected it begins with 192. .</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your computer is configured to request an address (think of it like a postal code), this is quite normal and the service which provides it is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and the server for this is your router. There are other settings included
 but this is the key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When a PC cannot find a DHCP server there is a failover system called APIPA where all computers give
<u>themselves </u>an address which is the 169 address. With that 2 (or more) PCs on a network missing a DHCP server can talk to each other, but only each other they cannot exit the network (no internet).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In your 1st 2 pictures DHCP has failed so the failover has come to effect, in the 2nd set DHCP has worked. So whatever you have done between the 2 has fixed the problem. It could be the Ethernet port on the router itself (try a different port as it should
 have 4)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You indicate that what you have done is reset the router, this will have restarted the DHCP server service in the router and it then starts issuing addresses. Presumably after a period of time the DHCP server hangs and stops doing its job. It might just
 be possible to be the Ethernet port of the PC but seems unlikely.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the router is supplied by the ISP you need to see if you can get a replacement . If it is your own there are a couple of things to try. Reset the router back to factory default (the ISP may also ask you to do this before replacing it) although you will
 then need to reconfigure it. Alternative go to the manufacturers site and see if there is a firmware update. This will reflash the router and may clear out any suspect code even if the firmware version is the same.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Otherwise you will need to get another router. You were pretty close with the point on no default gateway, this is one of the other settings provided by the router and is the name for the way out of the network but the clue is the APIPA address.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As a workaround you could take the setting from when the connection is working and apply them to the network card. From your last picture click on the properties button and look for the IPv4 option. In their it will be set for Automatic... so change it to
 manual. Then enter these values:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>IP Address:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.1.<strong>127</strong></p>
<p>Subnet Mask&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 255.255.255.0</p>
<p>Default Gateway&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.1.254</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>DNS&nbsp;Server&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.8.8.8</p>
<p>Alternate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.8.4.4</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With those settings if the router is still working at a basic level you should be able to connect to the internet. If not reset the router and try again, if that does work it indicates the Ethernet side is failing altogether.</p>

            Hairyfool,&nbsp; thank you for your very detailed and thorough reply, I have saved and printed it to use in the future if/when I need it.&nbsp; No doubt I probably will.&nbsp; This evening, I turned on my PC and I got an internet connection which was good :)<br />
<br />
I do have a funny feeling that after having read, researched, googled everything on this subject, and in conjunction with your response and some others, that it is probably the ethernet port on my router as I have had it for a fair few years now.&nbsp; Thats my
 gut instinct, but I may of course be wrong.&nbsp; I will try what you said when it fails again for sure.<br />
<br />
Yes, all I did was simply press the reset button on the side of my router and it worked.&nbsp; I then cross referenced the two ipconfig pics for before and after and noticed the differences and did some research.&nbsp; I understood all of what you said, it made alot
 of sense.<br />
<br />
I will contact my ISP (BT Broadband) and ask for a new BT homehub etc, see what they say. My one is dated, I think it is 2, there are 4 and 5 out now. (It is not my own router so this will negate resetting factory settings so I guess I can ignore that part?)<br />
<br />
I have noted your new IPv4 settings and written them down for the future.&nbsp; Setting them manually does make sense and this was concurred by a user from BT community forums, with this link:&nbsp; http://forumhelp.dyndns.info/networking/staticip.html<br />
<br />
To summarise, at some point I will have to set them manually as you suggested.&nbsp; When I do, and if this still works and I get an internet connection, does this mean that the problem may lie with the ethernet cable and/or router, DSL filter etc? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
<br />

            <p>192.168.1.254 is the standard IP address for a BT router so that setting is correct. BT are normally fairly good at replacing the router but if only a Homehub 2 you must be out of contract with them as they haven't been issued for a long time. They may want
 to reset the router but I think they will say it is too old.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You will probably end up negotiating a new contract but if you are still on the original one you have probably been overpaying. The last time I did this for a customer the contract was for about £8 a month less over 12 months and they only had to pay postage
 for the router (£6.95) which should be a Home Hub 4 or&nbsp;5 which are much better.</p>

<br />
Thanks.&nbsp; Yes, I notice that BT offer all these nice deals for <u><b>new</b></u> customers to attract them but don't appear to 'care' for the existing ones.&nbsp; I think I pay about £20-25 per month for BT Unlimited (that includes the line rental of course).&nbsp; Should
 I contact them to arrange a new contract which will be cheaper and also get a new router?<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I tried yours and that youtube tutorial advice ie inputting IP manual configuration.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Because, I put my PC to 'sleep mode' then when I came back to 'wake' it up I had no internet connection.&nbsp; So, I tried manual configuration for the first time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I will post six screenshots in chronological order of what happened.&nbsp; So far, the result appears to be good.&nbsp; I have my internet connection.&nbsp; But, please look and comment on the stages if you can just to ensure it looks all okay.&nbsp; I do notice that DHCP is now
 disabled (is this a good or bad thing!?), that is the only difference I can see HairyFool.&nbsp; Apart from that, it all looks good so far.....<br />
<br />
I manually configured the IP settings, clicked on validate then ok.&nbsp; It came up with screenshot 1, so I just hit the reset button on the router.&nbsp; Screenshot 2 shows the next stage of troubleshooting - fixing the default gateway.&nbsp; Screenshot 3 just highlights
 the next stage (I did have internet access at this point but it did state 'unidentified network'). Screenshot 4 shows ipconfig after all of this for comparison. Look where it says "DHCP enabled = no"?&nbsp; Screenshot 5 I have highlighted my network connection
 setting again which shows internet access.&nbsp; Lastly and finally, screenshot 6 is the end result - "Network Internet Access" :)<br />
<br />
So, fingers crossed, this should be okay now?&nbsp; I'll post back tomorrow evening HairyFool to see if there are any issues.<br />

            Hi HairyFool,&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I am having the same problem as before.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Even though I have manually changed my IP settings to static and also incidentally updated my network adapter, I login from fresh and still there was no internet access.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I had to reset my router again.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I thought the manual configuration plus updating my network adapter would solve the issue but it hasn't.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Btw, I am hoping that when my new router (4.0) arrives in a few days that this will rectify the problem as my old one is a 2.0.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But in all honesty, I am not hopeful because I am not sure this is the problem?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Please advise, many thanks?<br />
<br />
PS - could it be this HF?<br />

            Hi  MohammedIsmile 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you acquire a Windows 10 Pro retail license, you can update the product key license and convert the OEM install to retail, which will let you have transfer rights and ability to make major modifications such as the motherboard.
<br />
<br />Whoever installed it, might have installed a volume license (organization key) on your computer.

            Hi Mohammed
<br />
<br />Rest assured, if you just want to switch licences, you just change the product key, that will not affect your data or your installed applications in any way, because you are not changing to a different Edition (Home, Education . . etc.) of Windows 10
<br />
<br />Get the full product code, then go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation and enter your new Product Key . ..

            Hi Mohammed.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Normally OEM license cannot change mother board however we recently learned that if all else is valid the Activation Troubleshooter will make a one-time exception to transfer OEM license to new hardware.  
<br />
<br />So sign in now with a MS Account to link it to your Digital License at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation.  
<br />
<br />After changing hardware see if the old install will start on the new hardware.  Windows 10 is remarkably adaptive to new hardware without needing adaptive restore.  If it will start it will swap out all drivers requiring several restarts.  
<br />
<br />Sign in with the MS Account and go back to Activation Settings to run the Troubleshooter to transfer the old hardware license to the new.  
<br />
<br />If any problems contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            You would need to have a full retail box or digital copy of Windows 10 Pro in order to have the ability to have transfer rights to a different motherboard; or computer. 
<br />
<br />Honestly, I would not know where in Myanmar or Asia you might be able to find this license, but you can check reputable computer repair stores in your region.

</p><p>Hi Eidann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the model no. of your Samsung computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the sound driver installed on the computer is corrupt.
<span>First of all, let’s find out if an application is using the audio card at the background. Follow the steps to do so:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows+R</strong> keys to open Run. Type “<strong>sndvol</strong>”. Hit
<strong>Enter</strong>. </span></li><li><span>This will open the interface that will show applications that are using the audio device. If there any application that is running, close the application using Task Manager.
</span></li><li><span>Type “task manager” on the Starts screen and click on <strong>Task manager</strong>. Under processes tab, locate the application and right click on it. Choose
<strong>End process</strong>. </span></li></ul>
<p><span>For further troubleshooting, follow the methods listed below:</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the link and follow the steps to troubleshoot audio issues:</p>
<p><span><em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">No sound in Windows</span></a></strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if the same issue occurs. If yes, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to enable the setting for the applications to take exclusive control of the device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right Click on speaker icon at the taskbar. Click on <strong>Playback devices</strong>.
</li><li>Right Click on the <strong>playback device</strong> within the list of devices and select Properties.
</li><li>Go to <strong>Advanced</strong> tab. Remove the check from the box next to <strong>
Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device.</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>For further reference:</strong></p>
<p><span>Download and install the latest audio driver for Windows&nbsp;7 from the manufacturer’s website of the computer. Make sure that you uninstall the current version of the driver and then install the latest one. Refer to the article to do so:</span></p>
<p><span><em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Update a driver for hardware

<p>Hi&nbsp;Bat<strong>to1,</strong><br />
<br />
This issue occurs if the disk driver in Windows 7 and Windows Vista is disabled. This driver must be enabled before you change the SATA/RAID mode of the boot drive.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, enable the AHCI driver in the registry before you change the SATA mode of the boot drive. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp; Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry
 if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756</a></p>
<p>1. Exit all Windows-based programs. <br />
2. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. <br />
3. If you receive the User Account Control dialog box, click Continue. <br />
4. Locate and then click one of the following registry subkeys: <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Msahci</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\IastorV</p>
<p>5. In the right pane, right-click Start in the Name column, and then click Modify.
<br />
6. In the Value data box, type 0, and then click OK. <br />
7. On the File menu, click Exit to close Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
<strong>Error message when you start a Windows 7 or Windows Vista-based computer after you change the SATA mode of the boot drive: "STOP 0x0000007B INACCESSABLE_BOOT_DEVICE"<br />

<h2>            Cant find games in COD.</h2>
                    
<p><span>I can never seem to find games on any cod. It will search a few times and will always say 0/50 good games found. and then it puts me in my own lobby for a minute then switches to searching again. I can get into games just fine if i join off someone.
 This seems to only happen on cod as i regularly find lobbies on reach. &nbsp;Keep in mind this just started happening recently. I have an open NAT, i have the mw2 mw3 and xbox live ports forwarded according to portforward.com My connection speed has been sufficient
 for all previous games.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp; There are some satalite isps that have a sat download but still upload over a landline. It almost seems to be about the type of connection you'd have, but I believe the ping would be a lot higher.</p>

<h2>            Quick Books Pro 2002 has errors on Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hello:</p>
<p>I am trying to install Quickbooks Pro 2002 onto my new Laptop that has Windows 7. I successfully installed the program but when I try to open it I get the following error message:</p>
<p>"Your user account for Windows was created with Restricted access to system resources, This will prevent Quickbooks from operating properly. Please contact your system Administrator and ask him or her to grant you standard user rights." I am then unable
 to access the program.</p>
<p>Can anyone help please..I am at a loss?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I have not made any changes to access rights and I am the Administrator.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Are
 you the administrator of the system?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As GTS-NJ has mentioned Quick books Pro 2002 is not compatible Windows 7. Check the link mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=Quickbooks%20Pro%202002%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=Quickbooks%20Pro%202002%20</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Apart from the suggestions given by GTS-NJ I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try running the program as an Administrator and check .</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on the Quick Books Pro 2002 file that is installed (not the shortcut).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on Run as Administrator and check whether you are able to open the program.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Install the program in compatibility mode and check. Follow the steps mentioned in the article given below.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Hi jimwalk,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you get a message that says that your computer is missing a codec, you are probably trying to play, burn, or sync a file that was compressed by
 using a codec that <span>Windows</span> or the Player does not include by default.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A codec is software that is used to compress or decompress a digital media file, such as a song or video.
<span>Windows</span> Media Player and other programs use codec to play and create digital media files.<br />
You may refer to the below link for further guidance on the issue-</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You may use the below provided link and check if you get the required codec to download as per the file type you are trying to play -<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also use your favorite search engine to download and install a codec as per the file type you need to use.<br />

<h2>            I can&#39;t delete a photo in the start screen photo app.</h2>
                    I can't delete&nbsp;some photos in the start screen photo app.&nbsp;They have been deleted from the desktop photo viewer already but&nbsp;are still in the photo app. I get an error saying another program might be using&nbsp;them or I don't have permission. I am the admin
 account and only user on the computer, and no other programs are running. The pics were uploaded from a camera into the desktop viewer, and then moved to the start screen photo app. I have since deleted the pics from the desktop viewer and now I can't delete
 them from the app. In case it matters, I emptied the recycle bin as well. I'm pretty computer illiterate and really appreciate any help.
