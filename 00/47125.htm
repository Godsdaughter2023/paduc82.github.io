<h2>            Groove music title bar no longer integrated with &#34;now playing&#34; screen&#63;</h2>
                    I love Groove music app, it really enhances the experience of listening music due to the beautiful UI but I noticed that the title bar is no longer integrated with the "now playing" screen, I know that this is just a little detail but I use to like the
 way it looked.

            Sorry for late answer, the issue just disappeared after updating the O.S, I guess it was just a little bug.

    <title>auto-search typing problem in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jd in fl  say:</h3>
<h2>            auto-search typing problem in Windows 7</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 7. I have a folder open with a few thousand Word files in it. In Windows XP I could type anywhere from 1 - 4 letters and it would go directly to the specific file I'm after at maximum speed. Now in Windows 7, when I type in several letters,
 the screen jumps around as it goes through each of the letters in sequence, and finally stops on a file with the LAST letter typed. ( NOT the file I'm seeking !! )<br />
I just want the auto-search / completion function to work like it did in XP. This is driving me nuts and wasting a lot of time. Help anybody !!!?

<h2>            Fuzzy output for the Mini DisplayPort to HDMI for Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>I've bought the MS approved MiniDisplay Port to HDMI cord and the quality is a little&nbsp;fuzzy at any resolution on any screen, this is particularly obvious when I read text -&nbsp;something&nbsp;I do exclusively at work as an analyst. Between the tiny Surface screen
 and my 22'' monitors with a fuzzy output I'm going to ruin my vision here. Any suggestions?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a sharper image as im on my laptop 8-12 hours a day and this will not do the job right now. I spend about half the time at my desk so a docking station (which I have ordered already) is really only solving half the problem.</p>

            <p><span>Had the same issue here's what fixed it. &nbsp;Issue is not hardware but instead Win* really crappy scaling. &nbsp;Disable
 it and all is sharp now.</span></p>
<p><span>I do not know if this is an issue with the beta Display Link drivers or with Windows 8.1 in general.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>Regardless, to fix it - disable the (broken) screen scaling by doing the following:</span><br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Display</li><li>Put a check on "Let me choose one scaling for all my displays"</li><li>Then set the "Change the size of all items" to "Smaller - 100%"</li><li>Click Apply</li></ol>
<p><br />
<span>(you may have to do it twice for it to work)</span></p>

<p>so after waiting a week for tech support to call me they have basically checked my router settings, seen that other devices can connect wirelessly and have decided that its a problem with my xbox. just to make sure i will test my new xbox on another friends
 wireless (different router) to be sure that it is indeed the netcomm router that is causing the problems.</p>

<p>Go to the store and purchase an optical drive. They are very inexpensive. No, you cannot use your laptop's optical drive. You could possibly create a bootable USB key with a Linux distro on it and copy the correct boot files to the hard drive. I say "possibly"
 because not all older computers can boot from a USB device. Look in your BIOS to see if your computer has that ability. If it can:</p>

<p>If you haven't backed up your data, then you are asking for trouble. While you are at the store also purchase an external hard drive. You can boot the computer with a Linux Live CD (in your new optical drive) and copy the files to the external hard drive.
 Then you can proceed to try and fix your computer.</p>

    <title>Internet bookmarks being shared by two profile users on same laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internet bookmarks being shared by two profile users on same laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two computers that are both shared by two users, each with their own User Profile and Login. Both Users have admin rights, and the computers run on Windows 10, with Norton Security. Both users tend to use Firefox and Chrome browsers.</p>
<p>I have found, quite recently, perhaps in the last 8 weeks, that internet bookmarks are being duplicated on each browser, so where I have a folder named finance, with several sub folders such as banking, savings, credit cards etc the whole Finance folder
 first appears a second time, then a third time and the list is growing. This is happening to several of my folders on both Browsers.&nbsp; Furthermore, my bookmarks are also appearing when the other user logs on and uses the browser. I do not believe this is browser
 related because it happens on both Chrome and Firefox. We do both have different sync accounts on these browsers.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this please?</p>
<p>I feel I have to at least manually delete all replications and then save my bookmarks. However I am a heavy user of bookmarks, and if I don't do this all in one sitting I will loose track of what is real and what is not. I find that not every sub folder
 does include all of the bookmarks from whichever is the original main folder.</p>
<p>This is naturally a genuine concern and a real pest.</p>

            Hi Tech.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This might happen if Favorites are being imported at the same time the user has signed into these browsers and sync'd other Favorites.  It's a clash between the legacy method and modern sign-in to instantly sync.
<br />
<br />With Firefox and Chrome you have totally reliable Favorites sync simply by signing into the browser wherever you are.  You don't even need to sign out if you're in your   your own PC.  There's no reason to have to import Favorites any other way and if you do it will duplicate.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately Edge Sync doesn't always work so this method (which they don't make easy since it's buried in other Sync Settings) isn't reliable. 
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>I appreciate your interest and the time you took to consider and reply. However I am not convinced by your suggestion. I don't use the Import option and have seen previously how that does duplicate rather than overwrite my bookmarks so would only import
 if I have deleted everything first, and then taken time before importing, just to prevent any duplication. I do use Favourites sync and it has always been very reliable. This is a more recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>I think this is something different to that.</p>

<p>You did not say that you use Favorites Sync so I would have had to guess. Now that you've told me, I suggest If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will
 not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />
If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. I will also track the issue for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also be aware that No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems often like this by having them uninstalled.<br />
<br />
I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.<br />

<h2>            Weird clicking noise coming from console</h2>
                    
<p>I just got Gears of War Triple Pack not even an hour ago, and put Gears of War 2 in. Once I've played the game after about 20 minutes, I go up to my console and hear a weird clicking noise. (like on a computer when it's processing stuff, that type of clicking
 noise) I looked at the disc thinking that there might be damage to it, but the disc is perfectly fine. I'm installing the game now to try to avoid this problem.</p>
<p>My fan was also running on a very high level (highest I've ever seen it except for Red Dead Redemption) and the noise was coming from that general area, near the hard drive.</p>
<p>Is this a major issue, or am I just fine? If the heat doesn't go away from my console, I'll put one of my cooling fans I got from the store onto it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The majority wind up in the C:\Windows folder, though they can be elsewhere. by default, .log files will open with notepad, they are just text files.

    <title>Could not resize photos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donebb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Could not resize photos</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I have questions about editing photos

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Photo Gallery are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2009 (14.0.8117.416)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows XP SP3</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I received about 100 photos from a friend of mine to add to our church's archive. He has a Canon D camera and the file sizes on these were huge, at least to me. They were JPG and were 14 - 16 MB each. I wanted to resize them to save some space and Windows Live
 Photo Gallery, which is my favorite photo program and I do use it all the time, kept giving me an error message that it was unable to read the file. I also tried it on a Windows 7 machine running the latest version of WLPG and received the same message. I
 also checked the properties and the files were not locked or anything.<br />
<br />
I also have a copy of Picasa, which I don't like as well as WLPG, and it was able to resize them just fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Could it have been the size of the files that were making it difficult for WLPG? That's about the only thing that I can think of. Thanks for any help you can offer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<b>New Folder&nbsp;</b>to insert a new folder in your SkyDrive&nbsp;files then name it.&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span>Once you've successfully created the folder select the target folder and click
<b>Add files </b>then a new window will appear&nbsp;and asking you to <b>Drop files here or Select&nbsp;them from your computer.</b></span><b>
</b></li><li><span>Once you've successfully dragged the file or locate it by selecting the file, you will see a new window that the file
 is being uploaded and it will automatically add to the selected folder. </span></li><li><span>Once the file is uploaded, click the
<b>Share Folder </b>link. It is located at the right side of the web page under sharing category.
</span></li><li><span>Then a new window will pop-up then click the
<b>Get a link&nbsp;</b>under&nbsp;<b>Post to&nbsp;</b>and click the <b>Get a link</b> button&nbsp;under
<b>Make it public!.</b></span><b> </b></li><li><span>Then copy the entire link and paste it in the private section provided below.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>To copy the link you can use these keys (hold
<b>CTRL </b>then press <b>C</b> to Copy or Highlight the entire link then press <b>
Right click </b>and<b> </b>select <b>Copy</b>) <br />
<br />
To paste the link you can use these keys (</span><span>hold

            Hi <span>DonEbb, <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Windows Live Global Escalations Team. As I was reviewing your concern, I would like to know whether the issue is persistent even if you used a different camera?&nbsp;We have been seeing some cases wherein its the file&nbsp;properties (pixel size)
 that is causing this issue. One work around for that is to edit the said properties (Height and width) with other applications you have handy (Microsoft Office Picture manager for example)&nbsp;and save these changes before editing them in Windows Live Photo Gallery.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Our product experts are currently looking at the issue and&nbsp;the results&nbsp;that you will have in terms of using a different camera would be of great help. This will determine whether the issue is isolated to&nbsp;specific brand/s of cameras or if it is the application's
 functionality that we need to improve. Do let us know of the outcome regarding the said test.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</span>

            This is the first time that I have run into this problem. These were taken with a friends camera. He has sent me pictures from this camera before and I have not had this problem, although they were never this large (14 - 16 MB) file size before. He has
 sent me other pictures since the problem, he had reduced the file size himself before sending them, not sure what program he used, although I do know that he uses a Mac.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope that helps you and thank you for looking into this. I recommend WLPG to everyone I know that is interested in photography.&nbsp;

            Hi <span>DonEbb</span>, <br />
<br />
<br />
We are currently looking at this issue since we have been receiving cases like these related to file sizes whose pixel properties are a bit large. We still have to determine whether this can be a codec issue related to the camera being used hence we'd like
 to get as much information as possible before proceeding with any release update related to the product in question. If you have another brand of camera please try and see if you'll have the same results or not. Please also check if the file size is relatively
 large when another camera is used before editing it in Windows Live Photo Gallery. Do provide the details of your findings regarding this test so that we could include this information to our product experts for further review.
<br />
<br />
<br />
As a workaround (if you still like to edit the photos that you received), you can edit the picture details to a smaller pixel size setting for this matter. You can use any photo editing software that you have available with you so long as it allows you to edit
 the pixel properties of the said photo. Currently, the sample photos you provided have these pixel settings:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Dimensions</strong>: 5184&nbsp;x 3456<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Width</strong>: 5184 pixels<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Height</strong>: 3456 pixels<br />
<br />
<br />
I used Microsoft Office Picture Manager 2010 (since this is the software available from my end) to edit the properties of the said photos and initially I did a Document - Large setting (1024 x 683 pixel) and saved these changes. I re-opened and edited it once
 more in Windows Live Photo Gallery and this time the changes can be saved without getting the error message. You can adjust the pixel size as desired and see if there is any degradation in picture quality from the original. We'd like to get your feedback regarding
 this step and process. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Hi John,<br />
<br />
These pictures came from a friend of mine, who has a Canon EOS 60D. I don't really have access to another camera that would shoot in that size.
<br />
<br />
I was able to do my own work around by using Google Picasa. That resized the pictures down to around 1 - 2 MB and they seem to retain the detail, at least as far as I can tell. I can do all the editing that I need on these re-sized photos.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope that helps. Thx.&nbsp;

                    I keep getting the message "C:/WINDOWS\system32rundll32.exe application not found" when I go to control panel, and then add and remove programs, system, or security center. I read something that said to run the installation disk to fix but I don't have
 one. I also read something that said to download a program that would fix the registry error but the computer won't let me download anything. I believe that I accidently deleted some programs trying to free up space on computer. I also have no free disk space
 at all so I can't even do a system restore. Please help me, I have been up all night trying to figure something out....

            If you have typed that error message exactly, without typos, then the "system32rundll32.exe" is not a legitimate Windows file. It is a malware file.
<span>Either you uninstalled the malware program or your antivirus/antispyware program did. In any case, a reference was left to the file in Startup. You can remove the reference by managing your Startup.<br />
<br />
However, because you had at least one piece of malware, the chances are also high that you had others and the computer may still be infected. Make sure the computer is completely virus/malware-free before going on to manage your Startup. If the computer isn't
 clean, running the malware removal tools may take care of the problem for you. Only after you are sure the machine is clean should you move on to the "Manage Startup" section.<br />

(for XP) Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />

This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />

            Hi,  Jwelch0010
<br />
<br />You follow the next step below:
<br />
<br />Go to Settings&gt; Applications&gt; Applications and features. From here you should look for the application in question. You will not be able to do anything unless you enter the advanced options. Here you will see an option called Reset and that, pressing it will solve the problem. Just sit down and wait for the system to do its job, then do the test to see if you have found the right solution.
<br />Another option is to reinstall the app. Yes, this can be done if you use the PowerShell (press the Windows key + S) and type the following command: get-appxpackage * Microsoft.Windows.Photos * | remove-appxpackage. Then you just have to find the app in the Store and install it again. Now that the Store is out, you can choose another of the free apps that are available to you and then use them as default apps if you do not like Photos as such.

            We are starting to see more of these cases today, so let's start by isolating any Updates that were installed that might have caused it.   If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can Reset Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options.  Your pictures will be safe in the User Pictures folder.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try reinstalling the Photos app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also unhide Windows Photo viewer which is still there but hidden in Windows 10:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14312-restore-windows-photo-viewer-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14312-resto...</a>
<br />
<br />Or install Irfanviewer which is good too:  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />This is widely reported and known issue at the moment. We're expecting a fix from Microsoft, in upcoming Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />As of now, you can use classic Windows Photo Viewer to view photos:
<br />

<br />
<br />To edit Photos, you can use MS Paint or third-party program such as Paint.net, IrfanView.
<br />
<br />Regards.

    <title>PXE E61 Media Test Failure, Check Cable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaroner  say:</h3>
<h2>            PXE E61 Media Test Failure, Check Cable</h2>
                    
<p>The hard drive on my desktop was malfunctioning, so I decided that I would refurbish the computer myself (since the computer was out of warranty). I purchased a brand new hard drive and installed it properly, then ordered some Microsoft Windows Vista Home
 Premium Install Discs so that I could install the OS on the new hard drive. However, when I attempt to boot from the CD Drive, I receive the "<span>PXE-E61:
 Media&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/other-hardware-support/377709-intel-server-not-booting-how-disable-network-boot.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">test</a>&nbsp;failure, check cable,&nbsp;PXE-M0F: Exiting&nbsp;NVIDIA Boot (or something similar)</span>."</p>
<p>I have already tried the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Specify boot order in BIOS. CD drive is primary in boot order. </li><li>Check cables. They are all inserted properly </li><li>Checked to see if BIOS can detect both the hard drive and the CD drive. It can do both.</li><li>Checked to see if the CDs run properly. They do. </li></ol>
<div>I'm somewhat at a loss, as purchasing a new hard drive and install discs didn't come cheap. Any suggestions would be welcome. However, I don't have the following materials: USB&nbsp;adapter&nbsp;for internal hard drive, flash drive larger than 2gb, so any procedures
 that would require my purchasing those would be more along the lines of a last resort. I am also very far from another desktop PC, and though I'm willing to make the trip, everything would be much easier if I could do diagnostics fort the problem from home.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<p>Hi Vladimir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several factors causing the video settings to be reset on your Forza Horizon 3 game. One of these is due to outdated or incorrect display drivers. For us to figure out the most appropriate resolution on your video settings issue, we'd like to verify
 the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is your computer's make and model?</li><li>How and when did the issue start?</li><li>Is the concern confined with one game?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes to your device prior to this happening?</li><li>Are you experiencing the same behavior using another profile?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know these details so we can move forward to rectifying your query.</p>
        </p>

<p>OK my specs are:<br />
i7 6700K 4.0Ghz, GTX 1060 6GB, 16GB 2400Mhz RAM, SSD (system), HDD (games).<br />
<br />
I tried 3 graphics drivers - newest, older, and system default from windows update - none of them seems to be causing the issue.<br />
<br />
Issue is since begin with this game ONLY (motorsport 6 Apex was runing fine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happen even after 2 system reinstalls, with default system settings. Before OS reinstal, i tried making privilages for myself to game and savegames location folder, tried to make them NOT READ ONLY, but i couldnt - option "read only" was reseting once
 i was closing properties of those folders. I also tried creating second account, disabling (even uninstalling) antivirus, after reinstall os i was using only defender.<br />
<br />
I've done almost everything that was possible. game was also not possible to move to other drive (from D -hdd to C -ssd)<br />
<br />
<br />
I got refound for this game, as topic on official forum of forza is quiet, and all topics like that are deleted.</p>

<p>Today i disabled UAC - i tough it may be the issue - there is no way to launch game as admin - but IT DIDNT WORKED. I just figured out i cant access UAC settings by the way - i click it in control panel and settings of UAC wont open. I need to disable/enable
 it by registry.<br />
<br />
Second tought is ONE DRIVE - i have it uninstalled. It looks like video settings are not saved anywhere so it may be goal. Is there any way i can change default saving location for game savegames? I changed Settings &gt; Memory ( or storage in english) all apps,
 documents, EVERYTHINGS to be saved on D (hdd) but still Forza horizon is not saving VIDEO settings.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>PS - i see people have exacly same issues on Official Forza forum, AND on Gears of War 4, so this must be something with miscrosoft store problem (apps). Please look at it.</p>

    <title>Kinect IR Blaster on One S Disabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foxy.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kinect IR Blaster on One S Disabled</h2>
                    
<p>Just wondering how many other people have noticed this...(and personally it's annoying the hell out of me..and the wife (which is even worse!).</p>
<p>I decided to upgrade my One to a One S, and ordered the free connector so I could keep using Kinect. I use Kinect ALOT - usually for play / pause / volume up etc. I'm pretty lazy and this saves me having to hunt for remotes etc. Anyway, plugged in the shiny
 new console and Kinect only to find out that the voice commands were being recognized, but no signal was being received by the intended device. I did a bit of digging and following Microsoft's recommendations (hold a cell phone camera up to Kinect and see
 three white dots. Issue a command and another flashes) I found out that the "flashing" white dot did not appear. That means Kinect is not sending the IR signal to devices. I moved the console out into the open and lo and behold it worked, and the devices were
 being controlled. So....what's happening is that the IR blaster on the One S is disabling / overriding the&nbsp;IR Blaster on Kinect.</p>
<p>I know Kinect is pretty much dead, but Microsoft advertising that I can still use Kinect should mean that I can still use Kinect how I used to. I really hope they introduce some kind of a toggle option. Can't be too difficult.,can it?</p>
<p>So as a warning to people who are thinking of upgrading to a One S...you might want to delay any "upgrades" if you use Kinect to control devices and you keep your Xbox hidden away.</p>

    <title>Disputed purchases - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sugaredharp17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disputed purchases</h2>
                    <p>My son used my PayPal account without permission to make purchases through Xbox live. When I&nbsp;saw charges from Microsoft I did not recognize I notified PayPal about unauthorized charges, and shortly thereafter received a refund.&nbsp; Several days later my sons Xbox Live account was suspended. He admitted using my paypal account. I&nbsp;have attempted to make payment so the suspension can be lifted, but have been unable to do so despite multiple conversations with customer support asking for contact information for billing. I&nbsp;have been told that since there is an enforcement action there is nothing they can do, and they are unable to give me contact information for billing department so I can arrange to&nbsp;make payment for the purchases. Meanwhile the Enforcement Team believes fraud&nbsp;has been committed because payment was not made for purchases and therefore will enforce the suspension. Is there any way out of this catch-22?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>because you didn't go thru the right proccess</p>
<p>Even PayPal tells you to be a parent and deal with the source of the issue which would be your child and your parental settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also should be noted according to the PayPal agreement and Xbox agreement you signed if there is a dispute you must take it up with the vendor first</p>
<p>Which you didn't and just arbitrarily refunded it without even consulting. Xbox</p>
<p>Too many refunds and PayPal does warn yku that there is consequences&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Since you didnf go thru the proper channels you were banned correctly because you got the content and didnt pay for it</p>

    <title>Recent Update Broke My Windows 10 PC Computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recent Update Broke My Windows 10 PC Computer</h2>
                    We just had an update and after this update, Microsoft Edge stopped working, I have to enter my pin twice, it changed my startup login photo and it made nothing better only worse. I can not use Edge now! It just sits there doing nothing and has gone totally
 white. I switched to Firefox and everything works fine. Whatever you all did, test it on your own comps and fix it before sending it out.&nbsp; I waited to do this update but I guess I did not wait long enough for you to work through the glitches. Security update
 for adobe flash and another. I'd copy and paste the exact update but this system will not allow me to do so or even keep the update history OPEN and up as I type &gt;:( !!&nbsp;

            Which version of Windows 10 is installed? To verify which version is installed, see:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a> 
<br />
<br />If its a regular Windows Update that was installed, you could try uninstalling it to see if it restores functionality:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update installed since you started experiencing this problem.
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Try uninstalling the update to see if it restores functionality.
<br />
<br />If the problem started happening since upgrading to Windows 10 1709, you can try rolling back:
<br />
<br />I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

            Last week I went ahead and installed this 1709 update.&nbsp; It totally broke 90% of all my apps including MS office apps as well.&nbsp; It also forced edge into being my default browser with no way to change it back to chrome which is my standard.&nbsp; It seems this
 version totally pushes MS apps for all file defaults so one has to redirect previous defaults back to original settings.&nbsp; This is totally wrong.&nbsp; Fortunately I was able to go back to my previous version which restored my PC to it's working state and I will
 now shut off mandatory updates until Microsoft gets out of the forced change business.&nbsp; I use windows 10.&nbsp; Leave it at that.&nbsp; Maybe the thousands of users will go to Ubuntu if this practice keeps up.&nbsp; NOTE TO Microsoft:&nbsp; My PC IS A DESKTOP; NOT A PHONE OR
 TABLET so stop trying to combine windows for all-one-device usage.&nbsp; fyi: Per my wife, who works as a teacher, Edge is also problematic in the school system network because many of the web

</p><p>Thank you so much, Scott, for your response. I feel for your wife also how horrible and to be going through this and trying to teach the children of the future too!&nbsp; Sad very sad! My PC is still not working correctly and I still have to enter my pin in twice
 just to get in!&nbsp; Someone tried to come in and fix it but they were not successful.&nbsp; This needs to be tested more before send out and infecting us all!&nbsp; And now Cortana started reading out loud and they forgot to give you the option to have Cortana stop reading
 out loud.&nbsp; If you right click on the screen you can have Cortana read aloud which I love but they forgot to include an off option.&nbsp; Then when you contact them to find out where the Cortana off option is for reading they just push you to remove it entirely.
