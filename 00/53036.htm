    <title>Backwards Compatibility Region Locked&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Backwards Compatibility Region Locked&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I would love to find out if the recently announced Xbox One backwards compatibility has any form of region locking? What I mean by this is the following.</p>

<p>I own an American Xbox One and a European Xbox 360. Will be able to use the 360 discs in the One and make use of this backwards compatibility?</p>

<p>I am currently in the process of moving to the USA within the next week and would love to know ASAP so that I can decide if I should pack my 360 games into my suitcase.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>WeaselofWar24,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Pretty sure no one can give you a 100% answer on this right now, due to the limited amount of games, and given how early this is. That said, some games are region locked some are not (this includes digital and physical). If i were to guess I would say that
 if the game was PAL, and it played in an NTSC Xbox 360, it will likely play in the One. Same with digital games. Some games that were purchased from other countries digitally will not work on consoles in the USA. If I were a betting man, I would say the same
 rules apply here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I do require a definitive reply on order to make up my mind one way or the other. Surely someone out there must have a PAL version of one of the Xbox 360 games currently playable on the Xbox One via the Preview Program.</p>
<p>Again thank you for the response.</p>

<h3> elijahdurbin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 fullscreen bug</h2>
                    So I play a game called ROBLOX and I like to play it in fullscreen. Problem is sometimes people skype me and so I alt+tab to read the message. So then I open ROBLOX again and the fullscreen doesn't work. I can't click or use WASD to move and a sidescroll
 bar appears at the bottom of the screen and that's all I can click.

            <p>Some games don't come back from alt/tab well.&nbsp; It may not be any better, but does the game minimise</p>
<p>if you use the Windows key ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there an option to play in Windowed mode that may be the better option, if it allows for</p>
<p>a full screen Window.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>eRecovery is the Acer reinstallation software.</p>
<p>Once deleted, it is deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any questions about the Acer eRecovery software, contact Acer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have to reinstall Vista read on:</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

All that appears to have happened is a folder being created on OneDrive called ‘Xbox game DVR’. This folder however, is empty. I have changed the permissions to allow sharing to One Drive but this has not fixed it.... please help!&nbsp;</p>

Also, does that happen if you test with a new clip you just recorded, or does it seem to be limited to existing clips? <br /><br />Also, do you see any difference if you try uploading a clip to OneDrive from the Xbox App on a Windows 10 device? </p>

<h2>            Multiple problems in windows 7 resulting in BSOD in Samsung NP300E5X.</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I bought a Samsung Notebook NP300E5X about a year ago. It worked fine until recently(actually until its warranty period). Unfortunately it developed some problems and I did the following.</p>
<p>** First, it was bought having a DOS only. Then I had to install 32 bit windows. I used it and no problem was reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>** Then I tried to install WIN-8- 64, which I was unable to boot and install. Following some tips from the internet, I disabled, UEFI MODE in the setup. Then I was able to install it and no problem came for some time. Then came the errors with the BSOD.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Now, my problem is that my computer is constantly restarting, and I am not able to use my PC. I have run a check for my hard drive, it seems there is no &nbsp;problem in it.</p>
<p>My dump files are uploaded on my <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=3A5442833D05ACD4!115&amp;authkey=!AFFgCOdxEUAh7a4&amp;ithint=file%2c.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
skydrive</a>. Kindly examine and tell me where is my problem.</p>
<p>Here is my link to the dump files. <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=3A5442833D05ACD4!115&amp;authkey=!AFFgCOdxEUAh7a4&amp;ithint=file%2c.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Samsung Support, their on-line documentation, and drivers. Check&nbsp;for updates<br />
to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and&nbsp;separate device drivers.<br />
<br />
Samsung - Support - click the "Laptops",&nbsp;"All in one", or other appropriate&nbsp;link <br />
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/main/supportMain.do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/us/support/main/supportMain.do</a><br />

<br />
There was no real help in the minidumps so the problem&nbsp;is likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hardware, possibly<br />
memory or others hardware.<br />
<br />
===========================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7 </strong>- has a section for if you can or can't start Windows.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7</a><br />
<br />
The Bug_Check were 0A, 1E, 34, 3b, 40 7F, and D1 with CAUSE either Windows components,<br />
memory_corruption, or hardware.<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> When you see that many different non-specific Bug_Check it usually indicates hardware.<br />
So you need the help of Samsung's Support or a real computer shop (one that does its own<br />
work in-shop on Samsung Laptops).<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check the memory and ensure you have the latest BIOS, chipset drivers, and the other<br />
major device drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>You can try running Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (however it might not help).<br />
<br />
============================================================&nbsp;
<p><br />
More troubleshooting :<br />
<br />
</p>
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver<br />
updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW
<br />
to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update
<br />
the BIOS and&nbsp;chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on
<br />
your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed:
<br />
load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that <br />
created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the<br />
make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - <br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this
<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard <br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) <br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get<br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System<br />
&nbsp;Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install<br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new<br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible <br />
even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed <br />
in system behind slower&nbsp; memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out <br />
to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            Skype to landline call disconnects as soon as landline picks up</h2>
                    <p>I have a subscription for more than 2 years covering skype to European landlines. Since a few weeks the same number (landline) disconnects as soon as the persons pick up the call from me (via skype). Have tried different land lines; they all got the same
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying to re-install skype on y smart phone (Apple) it still does not work; when i switched to my laptop (windows) it worked one time after that similar issue with this same number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a familiar problem? any solutions or recommendations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>

    <title>Surface Bluetooth issues including mouse lag and iPhone compatability - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucas z.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Bluetooth issues including mouse lag and iPhone compatability</h2>
                    <div>I hope someone at Microsoft sees this post and escalates. There needs to be a firmware and/or driver update for the Marvell Avastar chipset.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Intermittently, any bluetooth mouse I use with my Surface lags and jumps around the screen so bad it's useless. Drivers and firmware are all up to date. I tried everything imaginable. Microsoft Surface support was extremely misinformed on basic computing concepts
 and they had no escalation process. Because of this issue and a few other quirks (Type cover randomly stops working, tethering to iPhone for internet via bluetooth drops randomly), I got the Surface Pro replaced under warranty. Unfortunately, the new unit
 had the same bluetooth issues. Video of the mouse lag here:&nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsXsZNfv20U
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally figured out how to make it stop and steps to reproduce. My iPhone was paired with Windows on the Surface, but most of the time it wasn't actively connected. They were simply aware of each other. The iPhone was listed under devices, but not connected.
 What I discovered is that if I disabled bluetooth on my iPhone, the mouse would immediately act normal and smooth. So even though they weren't actively connected, the fact that it was on caused interference with the Surface Marvell Avastar chipset. It's possible
 that the same remedy would work for others having bluetooth issues with other types of devices causing interference. Disable bluetooth or turn off your other accessories even if they're not connected and see if the lag clears up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note that I have been tethering my iPhone with several laptops via bluetooth for a few years now to get internet access when no WiFi was available. I chose bluetooth tethering over WiFi to save battery. With the Surface, it pairs, but the connection gets
 really flaky and drops after a few seconds to a few minutes. It's the only system I've ever had this problem with.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UPDATE: I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and did all the Microsoft updates. Bluetooth driver is now&nbsp;14.69.24039.134. Same problems. I called Microsoft Store Sales and Support (1-877-696-7786) and pressed the option for getting a refund. After explaining the situation,
 the representative got it approved to get me a full refund on the Surface Pro and extended warranty. I later got an email saying that I wouldn't get a refund. I'm at a loss on what to do.</div>

                    System is running Windows XP Home SP3. I have tried everything in&nbsp;the above&nbsp;article and still can not get Windows to update. Microsoft Fix-it that starts up automatically when you accesss the article will not repair things either and it gives me the same

 There was Norton&nbsp;on this same computer that causing Internet Explorer not to allow internet access&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Norton Removal Tool&nbsp;was used to remove it. Imediately I could access the internet but still could not get Windows Update to download updates. I have
 tried turning off Windows firewall and still no help. I have installed AVG and it found several viruses on the computer, they were removed and still nothing with Windows Update. I h

            <p>You've only made me think of more questions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When (exact date, preferably) did you manually install SP3 on your friend's (or client's) computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When (approx. date) did your friend's Norton subscription expire?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. When (exact date, if possible) did your friend (I assume)&nbsp;install the "Comcast protections" (i.e., Norton Security Suite and/or Constant Guard Protection Suite)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did your friend (a) uninstall the expired Norton application AND THEN (b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE he installed Norton Security Suite and/or Constant Guard Protection Suite?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Note: Only one (1) anti-virus application/security suite should be installed &amp; loading at boot. That being said, was AVG Free and/or Microsoft Security Essentials installed
<em>while Norton Security Suite and/or Constant Guard Protection Suite was still installed?
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Is AVG Free or Microsoft Security Essentials or<em> </em>Norton Security Suite or Constant Guard Protection Suite currently installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Did you know that installing AVG Free or Microsoft Security Essentials automatically disables WIndows Defender?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Did MBAM detect &amp; remove anything?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when your friend&nbsp;bought it? (Doesn't matter if it was never used or Activated.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) KB2838727, KB2839229, KB2829361 &amp; KB280<u>7986</u>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) KB2797052, KB2780091 &amp; KB280<u>2968</u>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) KB2758857 &amp; KB2727528;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) KB2393802 <em>and especially <strong>Update for Windows XP (KB971029)</strong></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed, one (1) will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12a. <em>Assuming Java is installed =&gt;</em> Is <strong><em>Java Version 7 Update 25</em></strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12b. Is Adobe Flash Player <strong>v11.7.700.224</strong> installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. Are you or is your friend in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC
 Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner
<em>Registry Cleaner</em>)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14. Have you or has your friend ever had occasion to do a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Repair Install</font></a> or <em>a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Apparently Movie Maker has no option for recording just the video.&nbsp; This seems like an oversight so you might want to suggest it at
<a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">feedback.live.com</a>.&nbsp; A simple fix would be to have a "No audio" option under audio devices (and make that the default when there are no audio devices installed).</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 restore from System Image Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jorb_952  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 restore from System Image Issue</h2>
                    <div><span>Product Name: </span><span>HP ENVY 15 Notebook PC</span></div>
<div><span>Operating System: </span><span>Microsoft Windows 8.1 (64-bit)</span></div>
<div>
<div>
<p>I have the following issue:</p>
<p>Every time that I try to restore my laptop using a system image I already created using System Image Backup (Control Panel-Restore-File History-System Image Backup)&nbsp;&nbsp;I got the following message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"To restore this computer Windows needs to format the drive&nbsp;that the Windows Recovery environment is currently running on. To continue with the restore shut down this computer and boost it from a Windows installation disc&nbsp;or a system repair disc
 and then try the restore again"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps I followed were:</p>
<p>-Go to <strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong></p>
<p>-Go to<strong><em>Advance Options</em></strong></p>
<p>-Go to <em><strong>System Image Recovery</strong></em></p>
<p>-Choose Windows 8.1 (This is my only target since I purchase my laptop with Windows 8.1 preinstalled)</p>
<p>-On <strong><em>Re-image your computer</em> </strong>window, I selected Use the latest available system image (the only system image I created and saved in my external hard drive)</p>
<p>-Then I got the message I already mentioned</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already read other articles about this problem. For example in one, it says that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The error message clearly indicates Windows needs to format the drive&nbsp;that the Windows Recovery environment is currently running on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to use the Windows installation disc&nbsp;or a system repair disc, format the drive and then recover using System Image Recovery."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand the first paragraph but not the second paragraph. I know&nbsp; what it means by using a system repair disc which is my system image; Right? But after that what I am suppose to do. Format the drive? What drive? How can I format the drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please help me with this? This if it is possible in you answer include all steps to follow to solve this issue. Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hi nacienancon,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try to check for solutions to the Windows defender problems? If yes, what was the result?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue would occur if there is a conflict between windows defender and the security software installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Disable your security software (including spyware/malware programs)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Completely disable your security software and then check if problem reports and solutions alert you about the status of windows defender.</span></p>
<p><span>Note:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note:<em>Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security
 software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform a system file checker</span></strong></p>

                    <p>I've spent months finding solution how to fix my computer 100% disk usage problem. Today I found that criminal. His name is Pximouse. I don't know what it's for and I never downloaded it, but it constantly appear in my window even I tried to re-install my
 window several times. No anti malware app detect it as a threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open task manager app, you will see it (Pximouse) appear in the Startup tab. Disable it if you have it. Then turn to Processes tab, end the one name Pximouse (it is revealing itself using 0% disk usage, that's fake) and kill it. Your disk usage will
 instantly reduce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how I saved my computer after a year of stress, overload, and slow.</p>

    <title>The Walking Dead&#58; A Telltale Game - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The Walking Dead&#58; A Telltale Game</h2>
                    Hi all, I'm all too aware that this game was not released on the Xbox marketplace as episodes. I was also disappointed to learn that Australia has missed out on the retail disc release as well. It looks like they're determined to stop us from playing this
 game. All research I've done tells me the US disc will not work over here. I've read about some NTSC games working in PAL consoles and vice versa, but it appears they are enforcing the region lock on the NTSC copies of this game. So that rules that out. I
 also don't have a PS3 and only have a small netbook computer, so buying off steam is no good as it won't run properly. So what I'd like to know now is, does anyone know if the retail disc is being released in a region that will be compatible with Australian
 consoles? I really want to play this game but find I'm running out of options. Thanks for your help.

<p>Since Australia has some of the MOST restrictive laws and taxes against M rated games, most likely not.
</p>
<p>Its not always the publisher/developers fault for not being able to release games in certain regions. Sometimes it isnt either allowed due by laws, or the taxes are so much it wouldnt be worth it. It s a business after all</p>

<p>I do understand it isn't available to buy in Australian retail stores. I know that isn't an option. I'm just hoping to import it from another country and have it work here. I typically import the majority of my games from the UK. But none of the stores I
 usually buy from have it. My understanding is that it has not been released as a retail disc in the UK. Only on the XBL Marketplace. I've been reading conflicting reports about the NTSC retail disc. There are many people posting saying that most NTSC games
 will work on Australian PAL Xboxes as they're not actually region locked. But most of the eBay stores have on their listing for this game that it will NOT work on PAL consoles. But I'm yet to hear of anyone who has actually imported it and tried. Surely it's
 had a retail disc release somewhere in a region that is compatible with Australian PAL consoles?</p>

<p>Zavvi has it listed for pre-order with a Feb release date here in the UK though it's still TBC for a solid date.

<p>Cheers, Shiguriu. Unfortunately that one there is the Walking Dead game by Activision that is coming out next year. I believe it's a FPS where you play as Daryl. Though I haven't read much about it. Hopefully it will be an enjoyable game too (and one I will
 probably have to import from the UK). Thanks for your help though.</p>

<p>The reason we don't get it, in Australia, has nothing to do with our laws, or taxes.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>You can get it for the iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact you can get much of the XBox LIVE Arcade games on the iPhone for a fraction of the price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Walking Dead" is ok... but it's not like you're missing out on a "must play" game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Dark Souls: Prepare To Die" edition has a similar theme (undead) and will keep you occupied for longer.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit installed, getting Pro activation messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine went down at Christmas and I had to reinstall my full copy of Windows 7 Home Premium. I activated it, but just recently I've started receiving "activate your Windows Pro installation" messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my About this computer window and sure enough, it says that I have 7 Pro installed, but unactivated (https://www.dropbox.com/s/tgdrnurcre7uxbh/System_2016-03-11_19-22-38.png?dl=0).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a virtualbox virtual machine on this PC that I tried to install an OEM copy of 7 Pro on, but the main machine has always been Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? Any help would be greatly appreciated to avoid having to redo this machine *again*.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B</p>

            <p>You don't have the right edition installed. You need to reinstall Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download Windows 7 Home Premium, create a bootable then perform a new install:</p>
<p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

            <p>I have Home Premium installed, from its green box with the curved corner. I tried to install 7 Pro from a Dell OEM license purchased from eBay, on the virtual machine running inside the Home Premium machine.</p>

            <p>That would be your problem. You didn't say what computer brand you installed to but first, you are using an OEM meant for a DELL and I don't think you got the dual boot right, a hunch since I have never done that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure ALL partitions are cleared and do a complete reinstall of the dual boot, if that worked for you before. I
<strong><em>think</em></strong> your computer is recognizing the Pro as the main OS in BIOS/UEFI but can you please be more specific as to details about your computer?</p>

            <p>Sure. It's a machine I built myself (AMD motherboard and processor, NVidia gfx card, various hard drives and a Blu-Ray drive) with a retail Windows 7 Home Premium. I'm not running a dual boot, the OEM 7 Pro was installed on a virtual machine running inside
 my main machine (under Oracle's VirtualBox software). There should be no cross-talk between them since the VHD I set up for VirtualBox isn't even on the same drive (it's on E: - my boot runs from C:).</p>

            <p>Okay, I rethunk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drive E had the Pro OS. As long as you have it like that the new registry you created when reloading on C is not going to know that E was activated.&nbsp; If you do not have the Oracle VirtualBox installed then it will be seen as an actual OS (because it IS,
 it's not imaginary, the Oracle stuff operated it like it was but you installed an actual 7 PRO OS to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND YES...you are most definitely in a dual boot situation, and the BIOS sees an OS there so what was activated once lost it's activation because it's seen as a NEW OS by 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You no longer have an association. Since you have an OEM meant for a DELL and it's no longer being run as VIRTUAL, you are expected to use the activation key meant for that DELL computer it originally came with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SUMMARY: Don't buy an OEM disc expecting it to normally work for anything but that brand it was issued for.</p>

            <p>I don't think so. At Christmas the SSD I was using as a boot drive failed. I bought a fresh one and reinstalled *everything*. It was a new machine. The registry is new on a new drive. I had no system backup that wasn't old to use, so I did it like I was
 switching to a new machine, installing the software I use daily, adding bits each time I thought of something else I use. Took two weeks to get the machine back to a useable state and even yesterday I found something I hadn't thought of to install. I guess
 I'll need to do the same again, but in the time I have before the grace period runs out I'll make careful note of all my stuff so the reinstall won't be so painful - it will still definitely be painful, I'll just try to limit the agony... :)</p>

            <p>Now, hold on...what GRACE PERIOD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are posting to a thread in the <strong>WINDOWS 7 forums </strong>and you said Windows SEVEN Home Premium and Windows SEVEN Professional..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be a bit mixed up, methinks. 7 has no such thing as the month long trial, you just install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHERE is this PRO or Drive E at?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a Drive E separate from the SSD/C/whatever and it has&nbsp;anything WINDOWS it's going to register. You don't have that problem with a Linux installation on that drive but that wouldn't be seen by Windows at all&nbsp;and you'd have to reboot and choose
 the Linuz unless it was on the same drive...that's what I gather (from experience).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a version of 10 and a version of 7 you used as a virtual OS, or actually both are 7's then you have a live 7 OS sitting there unactivated. OEMs were made for the machine they came with. You can't normally use them for others although virtually
 you could.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you reinstall the VirtualBox? Then you can use the OEM again. You either need to find a regular version of Pro (and it doesn't make total sense as to why you are wanting both as the differences in features are so trivial) or get rid of the Pro
 by formatting the disc and associating it with Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're trying to do stuff that doesn't really work like you want it to. You had it right before.</p>
<p>I don't think so. At Christmas the SSD I was using as a boot drive failed. I bought a fresh one and reinstalled *everything*. It was a new machine. The registry is new on a new drive. I had no system backup that wasn't old to use, so I did
 it like I was switching to a new machine, installing the software I use daily, adding bits each time I thought of something else I use. Took two weeks to get the machine back to a useable state and even yesterday I found something I hadn't thought of to install.

            <p>I have 25 days left to activate Windows. VirtualBox had a virtual hard drive - not accessible from outside VirtualBox. That's where the Pro version is installed. The main machine has Windows 7 Home Premium installed, however somehow or other it has been
 "infected" by VirtualBox, because my main boot reckons it's now running Windows 7 Professional. Even if I had been drunk one night and decided to try and install that OEM W7 Pro over the top of my Home Premium it surely wouldn't have been able to keep all
 my software installed, etc.?<br />
</p>
<p>Opening System Restore only goes back to the start of the month, but shows no evidence of installing Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled VirtualBox and the virtual hard drive. I doubt it will make a difference. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>B</p>
<p>PS. I have worked in computers since the BBC Model B and while I'm no systems integrator I have built my own machines since about 98. I have never seen this behaviour and I'm sure it's something I did wrong...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPS. I downloaded an ISO of Win 7 Home Premium SP1 since my retail copy was bought when 7 was fresh and so would need to install loads of updates to be up-to-date. There'll only be slightly fewer by starting with SP1, but at least I won't need the service
 pack - every little helps. I got the 3GB ISO in three minutes of the MS site, very nice! 18MB/s...</p>

            <p>Do you remember activating Home Premium, and does it still show Activated Home Premium at Control Panel&gt;System?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not then you had to install Professional to the main System instead of the Virtual Drive.&nbsp; But you should have noticed your programs, files and settings were gone as this can only be a destructive install when changing versions like that without using
 Anytime Upgrade by inserting the Pro key.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way don't blame it on MS that you installed the wrong version from a disk not even meant for your PC.&nbsp;

    <title>BSOD when connecting to Wi-fi using Intel 4965AGN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psc239  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD when connecting to Wi-fi using Intel 4965AGN</h2>
                    My computer gives the Blue Screen every time I try to connect to the internet. I installed Windows 8 a few weeks ago, and reinstalled it about a week ago to try to fix it. I have tracked the problem to my Intel 4965AGN Wi-fi Adapter (I think), and tried
 installing multiple versions of this driver, to no avail. My computer is <b>completely useless
</b>now. I can't even connect long enough to post this question - have to use a different one.<br />
<br />
Multiple dump files are located here: http://sdrv.ms/11K6m4d <br />
<br />
Please help. This is extremely aggravating. <br />

    <title>Is the context menu getting bloated&#47;too long&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cake5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is the context menu getting bloated&#47;too long&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I right click a regular PNG image I get this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d29c230f-a421-443a-8519-15c68f658b47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d29c230f-a421-443a-8519-15c68f658b47" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Though some of these, such as Notepad++, are specific to what programs I have open it seems like perhaps there is a better way to streamline this? The old pre-Windows 7 start menu had similar issues if you had a lot installed with something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.betaarchive.com/imageupload/1249432746.or.3016.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic start menu - image</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ways to remove options from the context menu but they involve messing with the Registry which is risky if you are not an expert (I'm not).</p>
