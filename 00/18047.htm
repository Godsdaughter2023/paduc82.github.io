<h2>            How do I create multiple lists of figures &#40;and tables&#41; in a Word 2013 document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am working in a Word 2013 document.&nbsp; The document consists of a body and multiple appendices.&nbsp; Both the body and the appendices have both tables and figures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The table and figure numbers in the body begin with a chapter number (Heading 1).&nbsp; I had a hard time trying to figure out how to number the tables and figures in the appendices with an Appendix letter prefix (tables with captions at the top and figures with
 captions at the bottom). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to manually number the figures and tables in the appendices and created a Table Title style and a Figure Title style for those elements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm trying to create two lists of figures (and tables) one right after the other, one using the caption label for the figures (tables) in the body and the other based on the style that I set up for the appendices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first list of figures (tables) for those items in the body of the document is created without problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I try to insert a second list of figures (tables) based on style, I get a question asking me "Do you want to replace the selected table of figures?"&nbsp; The only options are "OK" or "Cancel".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding paragraphs after the first list of figures and even a section break, but I still get the question "Do you want to replace..." and only the "OK" and "Cancel" options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone advise me how to create two lists of figures one following the other?</p>

<h2>            Favorites on Menu bar very slow.  Favorites on tab list is Fast</h2>
                    
<p>Iniltially, picking from Favorites list on Menu bar was fast.&nbsp; Over time, it slows down. (now 2 -4 seconds to drop down list, and then slow to open sublists and icons for&nbsp;websites&nbsp;on sublist always start out blank (blue dot) and have to be populated.)</p>
<p>Favorites on Tabs bar is fast.&nbsp; I have cleaned out temp files, turned off add ins, and no difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>What you are seeing is an illusion... Once the list of Favorites has been loaded into the memory area of an IE Window, the list does not have to be read from the disk again.</p>
<p>What you see</p>
<p>1. Start IE</p>
<p>2. Click the Favorites button... the folder tree and Internet Link contents is read from the 'Favorites' folder(s) and stored in the 'memory' of IE.</p>
<p>3. Select the Favorites menu.... this time the list of folders and links is already in the 'memory' of IE. The menu appears to open very quickly.</p>
<p>4. If you when back and clicked the Favorites Cener button, the 'tree' will load a lot faster than the first time.</p>

office 365 portal</a>?</p>
<p>2. which account you used to sign in office applications? is it your office 365 for business account? could you provide a screenshot about “i cannot sign into the app”?</p>
<p>to upload screenshots, please click <b>use rich formatting</b> in this thread and select the
<b>insert/edit media</b> icon.</p>
<p>3. please also provide a screenshot about your office applcation version.</p>

<p>regarding “i cannot log into the microsoft store”, i’d like to explain that we need to use microsoft accounts to log in microsoft store, it is different form office 365 for business accounts, and you can refer to

this article</a> to know the difference between the two services.</p>
<p>as for “onedrive is not syncing”, office 365 for business includes onedrive for business. it’s

different from onedrive</a>. to sync onedrive for business, it is suggested you use

<h2>            Office 2013 Pro Plus - Licence&#47;Key legitimacy and validation.</h2>
                    &lt;p&gt;Dear Microsoft,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased two copies of Office 2013 Pro Plus, sold on the basis of receiving two licenses/keys and the ability to download the software. The licences/keys were sold as new, not previously used or activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When
 I received the download&amp;nbsp;link, it was to a Dropbox account. Concerned, I went to the following MS sites, shown below along with the results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:30px;"&gt;downloadoffice.getmicrosoftkey.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:30px;"&gt;Sorry,
 but the Product Key provided is either not valid or can no longer be used. Please make sure that the key is entered correctly. If you believe you received this message in error, please &amp;lt;a target="AdditionalInfo" href="/Default/Support"&amp;gt;contact support&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;

<h2>            Devanagari font not visible in Excel during typing &#43; more Qs</h2>
                    <p>hi everyone dealing with Indic fonts in Excel and/or OS X—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years I have been typing Devanagari fonts in Excel (on OS X) quite happily without encountering major problems.</p>
<p>Since I updated to OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard a very unnerving issue has occured: The typed Devanagari with all its ligatures and formations is still being encoded successfully, yet
<strong>I cannot actually see what I am typing</strong> while i do so, rather does the program render the
<strong>symbols all in squares</strong>, just like Safari/Firefox or the like display them when certain language fonts are not installed —
<strong>until I hit 'Return'</strong>. This also used to happen, once a cell was formatted in Devangari MT and one would want to type Latin letters into it, squares while typing and Latin script after hitting Return. Thus whenever I even edit a cell, I will
 not know what I am editing and I can merely make it out in the top row where the cell data is displayed. This leads to utter frustration I can tell you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-17372949-73915/Devanagari.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fdiscussions.apple.com%2fservlet%2fJiveServlet%2fdownloadImage%2f2-17372949-73915%2f450-150%2fDevanagari.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover—instead of expected improvements—I seem to encounter yet something equally, if not even more queer and likewise frustrating:</p>
<p>the <strong>subscript dot (nuqta)</strong> which is used to correctly write certain loanwords from mainly Persian/Arabic or English is now
<strong>malfunctioning</strong>. Looking at previous Excel worksheets, what used to be the dot right beneath the desired consonant, is now resembling a
<strong>Telugu diacritic</strong> (some odd loop) as well as <strong>above and to the right of it</strong>, making utter mess of what used to make sense. Take a look at the highlighted 'z' in 'Angrez', which is now 'j + crooked loop' (the other bugs in those
 lines I will discuss farther down):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-17372949-73970/Virama+%26+I.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fdiscussions.apple.com%2fservlet%2fJiveServlet%2fdownloadImage%2f2-17372949-73970%2f450-262%2fVirama%2b%2526%2bI.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any clues on how to tackle this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subsequent two lines are meant to both read the same sentence as the first, having said that, the first is not actually correct, because the 'i' in 'dibbe' at the very beginning is<strong> simply not displayed</strong> (as the gap in front of the retroflesx
 'd' indicates). This I have encountered at all times, short 'i's (those in front of the belonging consonant)
<strong>do not display if they stand at the beginning of a cell with spaces and further words</strong> to follow (#1). This one can only prevent by
<strong>adding a space</strong> in front of the word (#3). What also seems to happen when
<strong>colours of some consonants or parts of a word are being change</strong>d, is that now the 'd' is missing (if a space is added at the beginning, otherwise the whole syllable would just vanish) — otherwise I could have highlighted it rather than explaining
 it..... These problems are NOT new though, they have been occuring every since and are—by comparison—pretty mild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be slightly out of tune to pose questions about <strong>Bengali</strong> (bangla lipi) compatibility here, but I reckon there might be someone amongst the readers who has ideas on how to solve the simple
<strong>font display issue</strong>. I have tried oh so many fonts (of course mainly from ekushey.org) and even talked to people at an Apple Store in Kolkata I happened to have been walking by about this issue but have not yet succeeded.
<strong>The fonts</strong> simply <strong>do not display</strong> the myriads of ligatures in
<strong>this script correctly</strong>, not even the 'ki' is displayed properly. I did actually manage to awkwardly install a Bengali font which DID display the ligatures and formations correctly, though all in
<em>italic</em> and—most importantly—not any longer under Snow Leopard. We all know the problem I assume:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-17372949-73971/Bangla.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fdiscussions.apple.com%2fservlet%2fJiveServlet%2fdownloadImage%2f2-17372949-73971%2f310-202%2fBangla.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1 incorrect</p>
<p>#2 correct (kitaab)... achieved by false typing (not possible on ligatures)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right, this turned into quite some post, I apologise for this but it is quite a crucial matter for me for I use it a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>some infos:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>— using Excel 12.0 under OS X 10.6.8 on a Mac Pro</p>
<p>— have been happily typing Devanagari in Excel under OS X 10.5.8</p>
<p>— this means keyboard layouts for various Indic languages are activated and respective fonts installed (Devanagari MT)</p>
<p>— scripts reacting in the same style as the Devanagari in Excel are the <strong>
Tibetan script</strong> and the <strong>Nepali </strong>(also Devanagari)</p>
<p>— some scripts that work perfectly fine in Excel are Kannada, Tamil, Gujarati, Gurmukhi</p>
<p>— typing Devanagari works <strong>fine in TextEdit</strong> or any other platform (Finder, Safari, iTunes, whatever)</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>... incase I forgot anything, please just remind me. And please have some ideas on how to fix these issues!</p>
<p><strong>it's highly appreciated!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Thank you &amp; warm regards</strong>

            Info: I have now found the answer I needed to solve ALL OF THE ABOVE, though NOT in MS Excel, but using the free OpenOffice.org (http://www.openoffice.org/), where ligatures and nuqtas are displayed correctly and other reported bugs do not appear any longer.
 Moreover, this now works in the Excel AND Word-equivalent, which it never did within the latter!<br />
<br />
Thus, if you crave the proper scripts and transformations (even Bengali, though still in coarse italic) in Word/Excel, then I highly recommend OpenOffice.org for this purpose.<br />

<h2>            Publisher 2010 catalog merge with 2-page Master Page</h2>
                    <p>I'm doing a Catalog Merge in Publisher 2010.&nbsp; I need the inside/outside margins to be different for left and right pages.&nbsp; I defined a 2-page Master Page in the template.&nbsp; When I run Merge to New, all pages are using the right page margins.&nbsp; If I go to my
 Master Page and Apply to All Pages, I get the correct margins propagated through my pages, but my text doesn't shift and ends up outside the margins for the left pages.&nbsp; My Catalog Merge area is set to Align Relative to Margin Guides, but that doesn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to setup the fields in a Catalog Merge area to automatically shift when the Margins are applied using the Master Page?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I am unable to successfully upgrade to 14366. It goes through the motions of upgrading, then reboots, and it tells me that it's restoring my previous version of Windows, and I'm back to 14361. It then re-downloads the entire image all over again and starts
 the process over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EnablePreviewBuild is set to 1 and there is no RecoveredFrom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the current build expires on the 15th, this has become more urgent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going back to the regular Windows 10 build, but it requires a bare-metal install as I have the generic Windows 10 Pro upgrade key which is rejected by the installer.</p>

            If you have an activated computer then download the latest iso from the insider website. (many links on this forum). If not activated you will have to use a Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 product key to do a clean install or reinstall Windows 7 SP1 or Windows
 8.1. Microsoft will be turning off older Insider Builds this week. There is code in these earlier builds to deactivate and stop booting on a certain day.

    <title>Windows 10 Insider Preview Clean Install&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandonlalonde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Preview Clean Install&#63;</h2>
                    So I've been searching around the Insider forums and interwebs but can't seem to find anybody with my exact question. My laptop has the Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 10130. I installed the Insider Preview from 8.1 about 6-7 months ago. I want to perform
 a clean install of Windows 10 now that it has a full release. I read a blog post from Gabe Aul that explained even with the release of Windows 10 publicly Insiders can choose whether or not they want to stay one and keep receiving Preview Builds. It's also
 my understanding that Build 10240 is&nbsp;<em>the build</em>. So, my question is as follows: how should I go about performing a clean install of Windows 10, while keeping my Insider status, on my laptop? Is there a product key I get after installing the latest
 build or is it all just online activation based on hardware ID? Any guidance would be much appreciated.

<p>As you didn't keep the system on to receive all of the updates &nbsp;and builds as one of the requirements to be an insider, I would recommend &nbsp;just reinstall 8.1 and get the release that was started today. &nbsp;You can do a search for windows 10 ISO and do the install.</p>

Windows Updates weren't working for me for a long time time and I didn't really notice until about a week ago. I finally fixed the problem (A LOT of work) and Windows Update is installing build 10240 as I write this.<br />

            <p>Okay, I'll bite!&nbsp; =) hehe </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me see if I can be of some help; this will&nbsp;be a long reply for I am a wordy kind of fella for the sake of detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) You have Windows 10 Insider Preview build 10130. You installed the preview from Windows 8.1. Are you saying you upgraded your "live" Windows 8.1 to build 10130 or did you install 10130 to a new partition or virtual machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on my main Windows 8.1 partition when I decided to join the Insider Preview and I too started with build 10130. I did not want to mess with my "live" Windows 8.1 partition so I created a new partition drive and installed 10130 there and now I dual-boot
 with the choices of Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) You want to perform&nbsp;a clean install of Windows 10 now that it is officially released today. So did I. Did you want to do a clean install that will update your Windows Insider Preview build 10130 to today's Window 10 build 10240 release or did you want
 to do a clean install on your Windows 8.1 to today's Windows 10&nbsp;release? I am trying to find out if you wanted to update your Insider Preview build or your actual "live" Windows 8.1 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) <strong>If you want to update your Windows Insider Preview build fbl_impressive 10130 to today's newest release so that you will then have Windows Insider Preview build th1_st1 10240 here is what you are supposed to do:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(I) <strong>Ideally, you are supposed to check your Windows Update </strong>while logged in to your Microsoft Account while on your fbl_impressive build 10130. Check Windows Update and make sure you have all updates installed and wait for it to offer you
 build th1 10240.&nbsp; th1 10240 has been out for a little over two weeks now. It is the exact same build number that was released today July 29th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(II)You could also download the Windows.iso that was released today. Microsoft has updated their Media Creation Tool to include the new Windows 10.&nbsp; You can download the tool (small file size) directly from Microsoft and run it. When you run the tool you
 have two main choices: (1) Upgrade your system to Windows 10 or (2) Create Installation Media (ISO, a USB bootable drive, or DVD bootable disc &lt;using the Media Creation Tool's built in dvd-burner&gt;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if for some reason you are not being offered the th1 10240 version through Windows Update you could get it via the Media Creation Tool instead.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT: If you choose this route you MUST select the "Update your system" option!!!
</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You absolutely MUST **upgrade** first
</span>- then *after* the upgrade you can start all over again with the Media Creation Tool and then that time you can choose the "Create Installation Media" option and after creating the USB or DVD&nbsp;media you can then finally do&nbsp;your clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I repeat you MUST UPGRADE FIRST</strong>; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
do the upgrade so that you preserve your Product Key</span>, then after the upgrade you can start all over again and go the clean install route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in summary - If you want to upgrade your Windows Insider Preview build 10130 to 10240 then download the Media Creation Tool and run it choosing the "Upgrade my system" option and when it runs you point it to the partition that has your Windows Insider
 Preview installed. This will upgrade your Windows Insider build 10130 to 10240 preserving the product key you used for build 10130.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that your Windows Insider Preview flb_impressive build 10130 is upgraded to build th1 10240 you can now run the Media Creation Tool a second time and that is when you choose the "Create Installation Media" option. You then choose if you want to create
 a bootable USB or a DVD.&nbsp; If you choose the DVD option it will download the Windows.iso which includes all varieties of Windows 10. You can then use the .iso as is or you can burn it to a dvd using the "Burn dvd" option inside the Media Creation Tool itself.&nbsp;
 I personally chose to burn the dvd and use that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>If you want to update your Windows 8.1 to today's newest Windows 10 release here is what you are supposed to do:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(I) <strong>Ideally, you are supposed to check your Windows Update </strong>while logged in to your Microsoft Account while logged on to your Windows 8.1 system. Technically Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1 consumers (the general public at large) are not supposed
 to be updating yet; the Windows Insiders are the first ones who are supposed to be getting the Windows 10 upgrade first, the next wave or so is when the Window 7 and 8 people would get theirs. So it can be several days or a week or more before the general
 Windows 7 and Windows 8 people are allowed to update via Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(II) You could in theory (I may be wrong) again use the Media Creation Tool and choose the "Upgrade my system" option.
<strong>Again you MUST UPGRADE FIRST </strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">to preserve your Windows 8.1 Product Key
</span>and then after the upgrade run the Media Creation Tool a second time creating the USB or DVD media and on that second run after you create the media you can use it to do a clean install of your "UPGRADED" system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IF I WERE YOU -- I would NOT force any of this to happen.</strong> Let Windows 10 come to you the way it was intended via Windows Update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wanted to update your Windows Insider Preview from 10130 to 10240 then check Windows Update and make sure you have everything installed and wait for 10240 to come down the pipe to you.&nbsp; It probably won't take too long because 10240 has been out for
 a couple of weeks now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wanted to update your Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 then check Windows Update and make sure you have everything installed and wait for&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;to come down the pipe to you.&nbsp; This will probably take a while from several days to a week or more because
 people running Windows Insider Previews will be offered the Windows 10 upgrade first before the people who have Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1 with Windows 10 reservations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Insiders in the first wave, then Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1 people with reservations in the next wave; then after all them everyone else on the planet with compatible systems would follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SIDENOTE:</strong></p>
<p>I am not an expert, I may be wrong but I did have some first-hand experience with this. I have a Windows 8.1 system and I joined the Windows Insider program installing Windows 10 fbl_impressive build 10130 on a separate and new partition. I then had the
 ability to dual boot between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 (preview).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with Windows Preview flb_impressive 10130 using the 10130 ISO and the product key Microsoft gave us for that, that ended in the numbers 3V66T. That product key activated my Windows Insider build 10130. I then eventually updated to 10159, then 10162,
 then 10166, then 10240 and all of these updates preserved that 10130 product key I used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I wanted to do a clean install as Gabe Aul said we could. I did not want to update my Windows 8.1 system yet because I do not think Windows 10 is ready for a prime-time public release yet (just my opinion) but I did want to do a clean install to my
 previous th1 10240 Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded the Media Creation Tool and created the dvd and used that to do a clean install.&nbsp; I did go from Insider th1 10240 build to th1_st1 10240 build but I had to opt back into the Insider Program because doing a clean install on the Windows Insider
 Preview actually puts Windows 10 (real) on top of the Preview and I had to re-join the Insider program via the "Get insider builds" button in the Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update&gt;Advanced Options window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went from Insider th1 10240 to Windows 10 (official public release) back into the Insider program which then updated me to th1_st1 10240.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the problem I had is I was previously a Windows Insider with activated previews to now being an Insider with the newest version but my Windows is no longer activated. I have the "Activate Windows" watermark on my desktop and I am unable to personalize
 my computer now. The problem was that the upgrade and clean install did not preserve the former 3V66T product key because Microsoft deactivated those keys a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I and from what I have read, quite a few others, all have this issue -- we all have Windows 10 that we cannot activate or personalize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if I were you I would wait until Windows 10 came to you naturally and to be honest it's always best to wait it out a while when a new operating system upgrade is available. Generally I think the more cautious people always waited for the first Service
 Pack before taking the plunge. Since Microsoft no longer considers Windows to be RTM releases any more since they are now SAS (software as a service) I would still hold out for a couple of months before upgrading to Windows 10 so more of the bugs and kinks
 can get worked out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long post, I don't actually expect anyone to read this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>I have exact same problem! Well, with the difference that now I got 10525, but it's not activated. I agree with you, W10 is not ready for prime time. I laso need to keep Windows 7 until I find a replacement for Windows Media Center. I feel betrayed and fooled
 as Insider, because I've spent many hours in front of the computers updating.</p>

<br />
This issue could be due to the recent changes to your computer. For proper isolation, kindly answer the queries below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done to troubleshoot the issue?</li><li>Which Windows 10 version/build is currently installed on your PC? To check, type
<strong>winver</strong> in the search option.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p><strong>TL; DR; </strong>Make sure there is not some failing windows update that is trying to install on every boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this issue and it seemed to be due to a failing update to Windows 10 insider preview 16125 (on the fast ring). Out of frustration I changed to slow ring so it stopped trying to update the windows version each time I rebooted only to "restore to old
 version" each time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I changed to slow ring, the defender service started working fine after a reboot - seemed to me that it was the partial windows update that was messing with the service starting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a full scan, offline scan and rebooted a few times to check and it is all working fine - but I am sitting at Windows 10 version 16199 till a new fast ring build comes out and then I will change back over.</p>

                    I've been getting emails with really offensive/obscene subject titles into my junk folder in last week or so.&nbsp; Has something changed in the way outlook filters mail as I've never had this problem before ?

            I do believe that when Microsoft changed from the Hotmail interface to the Outlook.com interface, they started using different filters and so more messages make it to the mailboxes.&nbsp; However, if the messages are in your Junk folder, then why are you concerned?&nbsp;
 They're being placed where they should be.&nbsp; Just ignore them.&nbsp; Don't look at them and you cannot be offended by them.&nbsp; Simply empty your Junk folder periodically or allow the Junk process remove the messages after 10 days, which it should do.

            <p>Hi Carlton963,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uunderstand that you are receiving lots of Junk mails. In addition to what Brian Tillman [MVP-Outlook] said, you can also&nbsp; block the sender from sending you Junk mails by using Blocked Senders list. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><span>1. Sign in to your Outlook.com account.</span></font></span></p>
<p><span>2. You’ll be directed to your Inbox.</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the upper right corner, please click the Gear icon and then choose<font><strong> More mail setting</strong>.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">4. You’ll be directed to the Outlook Options page, under
<font><b>Preventing junk email</b> please choose <b>Safe and Blocked senders list.</b></font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. Click the <font><b>Blocked senders</b> link.<br />
6. On the box under the <b>Blocked e-mail address or domain</b>: option, type in the e-mail address or domain of the sender.<br />
7. Click the <b>Add to list</b>&gt;&gt; button.</font></span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To block a domain, please follow the same steps in blocking a sender provided that when you block a domain, you can only provide the domain name. (Example: @live.com).<br />
<br />
Note: Please make sure that your blocked senders are not part of your contact list, if so, please delete the said contacts for if not you will still be able to receive mails from them.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Should you have further concerns, please let us know.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you.</span></font></p>

            Trying to control junk mail by adding senders to the Blocked Senders list is close to pointless, since junk senders change their addresses all the time.

            I too must agree with those who have received offensive emails, albeit in the junk folder. &nbsp;I never had such types of emails using Hotmail. &nbsp;Please can Outlook do something to stop offensive emails off the nature of 'local sluts' and 'viagra adverts' emails
 hitting our mailboxes please.

            After reading all the threads in this post, the responses to how to resolve this problem obviously reveal there are no concrete resolutions.&nbsp;Microsoft has mis-managed outlook. It's been how many months now since the upgrade from hotmail where&nbsp;account user's
 have been targeted with all kinds of subject matter in their junk mail folder, and are told that they just have to suffer through all kinds of obscenity and other garbage arriving.&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the day is, do any of the moderators who responded to this
 post of obsene material ending up in&nbsp;junk folders have small children? If you have ,&nbsp;name one thing that you would do, that you would care to share with everyone,&nbsp;on what you would do to block this garbage from arriving in your junk folders that could possibly&nbsp;be
 viewed by one of your own children. The junk mail in outlook is an issue that I addressed on the discussion board just today, where I explain what the real dispute is, and what the real reso

<p>3. Under <b>Customizing Outlook</b>, choose <b>Rules for sorting new messages.</b></p>
<p>4. Click on <b>New</b> button.</p>
<p>5. Under Step 1. Which messages do you want this rule to apply to? Select the<strong> Subject</strong>, then
<strong>Contains</strong>, then on the text box provided; type in the keyword for the emails you wnt to block. (You can always change these options using the dropdown arrow depending on your choice)</p>
<p>5. Under Step 2. What action do you want to apply? Tick on Delete these messages—don't even put them in my Deleted folder.</p>
<p>6. Click <b>Save</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Graphics Problems on 14295 and 14316 Builds</h2>
                    <p>I have not seen the following issue until builds 14295 and 14316:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that many times when my PC wakes from sleep, the screen is "elongated" so that some of the screen is inaccessible. Sometimes, the screen resolution is changed to a much lower resolution. I can usually "fix" this by rebooting, setting the resolution
 back to the correct setting, and then have my monitor "auto adjust" to get everything on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anything changed in these last two releases that could cause a problem like this?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running this on an Intel NUC with an i5 processor, 16 GB RAM and 500 GB M.2 SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>I understand that sleep mode can cause this. I was just wondering if there were any known issues with the insider builds that could cause this behavior. The Intel NUC uses Intel's built-in graphics. There was a recent driver update that I have just installed.
 Not sure if it will fix this, but it may have caused some new weirdness.</p>

            <p>I've seen no difference...have you tried to un-install the video driver then restart computer and see if Windows re-installs the driver and restores the issue?..that's the first thing or maybe the monitor settings are changing....does changing the 'screen
 size' have any initial&nbsp; affect?....do you have another monitor to try?</p>
<p>There's a lot of things to try....maybe the video driver needs to be updated.</p>

<p>- There's no MS online calendar I can sync to. MS MyPhone doesn't support recurring transactions and I couldn't even find a way to sync to Windows Live calendar. So I am using Google Calendar that actually works pretty well with ActiveSync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I stopped syncing with Outlook two years ago, after many, many frustrating hours trying to fix appointments being off by a day (DST bug), duplicate appointments, pim.vol swelling to 20 mb, Outlook 2007 not syncing with ActiveSync 4.5 and destroying my
 calendars in the process, etc. So there's no reason for me to sync Contacts with anything MS either. Hello Google contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The level of integration with Google services on Android devices is amazing. The level of integration with MS services on WM devices is miserable. Worse else, these services are not useable (lack of recurring appointments, calendar that's only taking up
 60% of screen leaving the rest to flashy ads that prevent me from using it in a workplace, etc.)</p>
<p>Finally, the hardware... why do I have to pay extra for a WM6x or 7 phone when it's specs are below Android phones ? Doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>When my wife decided to get a smartphone we went Android and I am amazed at the level of seamless integration with Google services, speed and responsiveness, and cost, too.</p>
<p>Come on, MS.&nbsp;I really used to like you.</p>

<p>If you have a windows mobile 6.x phone, you can sync it directly to your Windows Live account right now via the&nbsp;<a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/solution.aspx?solutionid=46bd910c-ed99-497d-80d7-ab8b11237ed0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Hotmail/ActiveSync Access service</a> which
 was introduced last fall.</p>
<br />
<div>1. Click on “ActiveSync” under Start menu or under Programs.</div>
<div>2. Click on the link above to configure the ActiveSync profile for Hotmail access. You may need to delete the existing profile if it is already in use.</div>
<div>3. Disable automatic detection of Exchange server settings.</div>
<div>4. Enter your full Hotmail address in User name field. Enter password. Leave Domain blank.</div>
<div>5. Enter <strong>m.hotmail.com</strong> in the Server address field.</div>
<div>6. Select the data to sync. Hotmail supports all 4 data types via ActiveSync.</div>
<div>7. The device will connect to Hotmail ActiveSync and perform an initial sync for the selected data.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've been using this service on my windows mobile 6.x phones for a couple of months now and it's great and has been glitch free.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then if you decide to move to windows phone 7, your data will already be in place and all you'd need to do is input your windows live id and password into the phone and all your data would be there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is more integration with Microsoft's cloud services and windows phone 7 and I expect to see better integration of these services with windows phone 7 in coming months.&nbsp; IMHO, it is an exciting time to be using Microsoft products, but if you're already
 heavily invested in google's services, it is understandably if you decided to go with an Android-based phone.<br />

<p>Julie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for quick and helpful reply. I did a search for Windows Live sync and wasn't able to find any info related to direct sync. This would've saved me much frustration.</p>
<p>I will definitely try this feature.</p>
<p>Just one more question: is it possible to show a Google calendar in WL and vs versus via HTTP or ICAL feed ?</p>

            I don't know of a way to show a Google calendar in Windows Live, but if you get a Windows Phone 7, you can sync calendars from Windows Live, Google and Exchange Server, so you can easily sync multiple calendars from these different services to the phone.&nbsp;
 On the phone you can color code the calendars to differentiate the appointments and you can turn off a calendar if you don't want to view it on the phone.

<p>Well, no luck. It would only sync parts of the calendar database - some appointments won't sync at all - and while at it, it would create all sorts of duplicate and triple all-day appointments that are off by a day. After three sync attempts my birthday
 was shown on 3 consecutive days - with every sync, it would create a new app't one day behind. Must be the DST bug at work. And I do have MS DST "fix" installed. This reminds me of all the problems I had with Outlook before I gave up on syncing with it.</p>
<p>I am amazed that I can get a reliable and problem-free sync from MS Windows Mobile device via MS ActiveSync to Google Calendar, but not to MS' own Hotmail Calendar.</p>
<p>Thanks for help, anyway !</p>

<p>I'm sorry to hear about that!&nbsp; Syncing has been pretty close to perfect for me, but I don't use the birthday option to sync birth dates - I stopped that a long time ago because they kept getting duplicated....eventually I just created recurring appointments
 (as all day events) for all my birthdays and I haven't had any problems ever since.&nbsp; I use recurring appointments a lot (probably 80% of my appointments are recurring), so I don't really know why you had such an issue with those.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to the DST issue you describe, I wonder if your windows live settings are set to the same region/time as your phone?&nbsp; I don't know how open you are to troubleshooting these issue or if you've just written off syncing to windows live as a hopeless
 cause...let me know if you'd like to proceed with troubleshooting the problem and I'll try to help you out.</p>

<p>HI, Julie,</p>
<p>I spent hours &nbsp;troubleshooting AS sync issues in the past - definitely know the symptoms by now.</p>
<p>This is very similar to the problems that I used to have when syncing to Outlook. Some appointments just never made it over no matter what I tried. Also, the all-day appointments kept being duplicated and pushed a day behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tracked it to the bug in appointments that happen &nbsp;during DST. I installed DST fix from MS site but it didn't seem to help at all. Since syncing was extremely unreliable and was messing up my data (and took a very long time) I just stopped using Outlook
 altogether; this happened first on Dell Axim X51v, and when I got the Touch Pro 2 I tried syncing again (to an empty Outlook) and immediately had the very same problems.</p>
<p>Now what I see on Hotmail Calendar is exactly the same set of problems - I can only assume it's driven by Outlook engine somehow.</p>
<p>I don't use B'day feature, instead I just create all-day recurring &nbsp;appointments. The problem is, I've had so many sync issues, half of them are probably on the wrong date.</p>
<p>Both my device and the Hotmail Calendar were set to EST (GMT-5).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just re-synced everything back to Google Calendar and it worked fine. Since I am using the same set of data and the same ActiveSync the &nbsp;problem must be somewhere in MS calendar.</p>

            There's a theme builder somewhere around that you can probably do it with... but why would you want to? The Time etc. is there to reduce battery usage, if you used a gif, it'd be pretty much like showing an image all the time? :s<br />

Doesn't make sense to me lol, maybe I'm not thinking on the same lines as you? lol, if that's the case, I'm intrigued :p

Yes there is...<br />
<br />
I use XXLScreenSaver V1.09 a great freeware programme, d/l from <a href="http://www.gosymbian.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.gosymbian.com</a><br />
<br />
Once installed, goto c:\system\screensavers\skins and edit animated frames test.gif<br />
<br />
You get 5 frames to play with. When the option is chosen from the list you should see your custom graphics appear.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to also choose gosymbian as the powersaver in your theme.<br />
<br />
Works for me, i wish there was an N80 too.<br />

<h2>            Screen email spam by key words and automatically delete bypassing Junk</h2>
                    <p>I use Hotmail desktop login with MS Edge and Chrome browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want Hotmail to automatically delete spam - not just send it to Junk where you still have to manually delete it. &nbsp;The remote possibility of missing a legitimate email is acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Automatic Processing &gt; Inbox and Sweep Rules does not work. <br />
'Condition: subject or body includes the word 'xxx' then 'Do the following: Delete message', when an email is received with the word 'xxx' it does not get deleted - it goes to the Junk folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Junk Mail Block senders does not work. Adding spam email addresses to the list is pointless as the spammers use different email addresses every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Setting up a Safe Senders list does not work. Email not from safe senders goes to Junk, it does not get automatically deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Hotmail have a way to automatically delete (not put in Junk - delete) any email with trigger words 'xxx'. No legitimate email I would want to receive would contain any of the trigger words so practically there is no change of deleting any email I would
 want to see.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply but it does not answer the question. But I think I found the problem. The Inbox sweep rules do not work when the Safe senders list is also used. If there is nothing in the Safe senders list, then the sweep rules do seem to put the
 emails in the Delete. But it does not help much because the emails sit in the Delete folder and have to be manually deleted. So they are not being totally deleted, they just go to the 'Delete' folder.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The updates I just got&nbsp;installed on 11-09-16 and which included the following removed my favorites from my favorites bar, all of the favorite settings associated with them

<p>I am&nbsp;not a techie and really&nbsp;don't want to be one.&nbsp; I just want things to work.&nbsp; it took me a

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's check if we can import your favorites in MS edge temporarily then, will import it back to IE.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Try this on MS edge. If you can import everything, then import it back to IE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the Outcome.</p>

            <p>Roberto,</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I genuinely appreciate the help but am confused.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I know</span> that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
I have</span> communicated the problem correctly please let met restate it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the update <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all</span> of my favorites were
<strong>plus</strong> a great many more I made&nbsp;after I started using Edge.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all I see is a folder "Imported from" which does NOT include many of&nbsp; those additional favorites I saved.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>What I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">think</span> I read above is that you recommend I export my favorites from Edge to IE, then back to Edge.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; If so, will I have to go through each one again, open them and resave them to my &nbsp;to
 the menu bar to see them?&nbsp;&nbsp; The list is LONG, but I need them all.&nbsp; Then of course there is the problem of the numerous additional favorites I cannot find anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking through my settings in an effort to see how to display these things but it is a frustrating and time consuming effort&nbsp;I would much rather spend on work, not trying to re-configuring what set up just fine yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can use IE but as I noted
 above, not all&nbsp;of the favorites I need are captured there.</p>

<div>
<p>Yeah, this problem is well documented on this forum... favorites just tend to magically disappear (typically associated with a windows update).&nbsp; For some, it happens more than once... and for countless thousands of others, it never happens at all.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>For the vast majority of folks, there is no recovery of your favorites.&nbsp;They're gone...</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>We haven't heard from Microsoft what the root cause is... or how to prevent it from happening again.&nbsp; Instead, they merely suggest that you ignore the problem and reload your favorites from Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>However, "Reload your favorites, and hope it doesn't happen again"... isn't very comforting.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>So, about the only thing that we can offer you is a way to perform a backup and restore of your favorites for "the next time" this happens. (Yeah, I know...)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>There are several techniques that you can use to backup your favorites (after you've reimported them and fixed them the way you want them).&nbsp; There is a simple technique that only works if you're using the Edge "Sync your content" feature and only protects
 your favorites, and a more turn-key version where you install a 3rd-party application that can also protect a lot of the Edge settings</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>1) If you are using "Sync your content", you can copy the contents of the %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState for safe keeping.&nbsp; And then just copy it back after a crash/reset</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>2) You can use the free 3rd-party <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EdgeManage</a> application to perform a backup/restore (plus many more features).&nbsp; This technique works without regard to the "Sync your content" settings.</div>

            <p>I&nbsp;believe I now understand the problem.&nbsp; I want you to know that I, <strong>genuinely
</strong>appreciate your recommendations and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
especially</span> the time <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">you</span> took to help
<p>
</p><p>I completely understand there can be countless issues with any software product and integration issues are usually the hardest to find and fix.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible that this&nbsp;may only an Edge problem.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is also possible that when it comes right down to it,
 the trouble may lie in a bit of unrelated software installed on my computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because we have heard nothing from Microsoft on this, I believe&nbsp;they are in fact, saying a great deal on the subject.&nbsp; I suspect they will eventually get around to fixing this when and IF the problem becomes to big to ignore.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Favorite issue is not the only problem I or anyone else is having with Edge,&nbsp; it is just the most recent.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not made Edge my default&nbsp;browser and doubt it will be anytime soon because of all aggravating little "bugs" I keep discovering.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't want to&nbsp;spend my time looking for and implementing a work-around to make this or anything else&nbsp;do what it is supposed to already do.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will simply use another browser that works most of the time and requires fewer work-arounds.</p>

<p>Greetings Katndog!&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes actually, you should be able to setup a hotmail account, although not thru the regular Outlook application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.)</strong> Open your Pocket MSN application from the Start Menu.</p>
<p><strong>2.)</strong> Select MSN Hotmail, then enter your account name and password.</p>
<p><strong>3.)</strong> You'll need to sign-in, afterwhich your Hotmail e-mail account will appear in the Messaging application.</p>
<p><strong>4.)</strong> To download your messages, press the Menu Key, then Send/Receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to use the hotmail account readily, just by selecting Hotmail from your Messaging Application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a moto Q 9c and I would like to setup hotmail so the home page displays when there a new message, can click on it and pull it right up, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of these forums talk about pocketMSN, windows live, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have pocketMSN and can't find where to get it if I wanted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows live appears to be nothing more than a mobile version of the webiste</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there an windows live app that can be installed on windows mobile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Why when I go to mesaging an click "Add new email"&nbsp; and go to my hotmail email and choose the automated setup</p>
<p>does it not persist anything.&nbsp; It takes me to the windows live website for my hotmail that one time but nothing ever stays setup and I have to reenter all credentials each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greetings MotoQ9cuser!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Owners Circle Forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PocketMSN can be found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/software/pocketmsn.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My understanding is that If you have a free hotmail account, you CANNOT setup Outlook on the PDA to access your POP mail.&nbsp; This is because POP access to Hotmail is a premium service provided to customers who pay for premium service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>You should note that current version of Windows 10 is still under development and testing and it is technical preview. You may download and try it out and play with it but if you are using your PC for production, you better wait for the final release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need to do clean install and just reserve your upgrade and then wait for the final release and install it. This way , you won't lose any files or programs in your PC.</p>

<p><span>After reviewing answers to other questions and reading the FAQ, I have come to the conclusion that:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The
 actual workbook needs to reside on SkyDrive</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>A
 laptop running MS Office 2007 or 2010 OneNote then&nbsp;sync's with SkyDrive</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The
 I-Phone app also syncs with SkyDrive</span></p>
<p><span>Currently all our pc’s in the office share Outlook calendars using Office Live/SkyDrive accounts. We also have OneNote workbooks that reside on our Windows servers that are shared
 with specific managers.</span></p>
<p><span>If we move all OneNote workbooks to a SkyDrive account, can we share them with the team via their pc’s OneNote AND their I-Phone / Win Phone?</span></p>

<p>Almost - OneNote 2007 cannot sync with Skydrive. We made significant architecture change to enable cloud synching and that is only available in OneNote 2010.</p>
<p>But #1 an #3 is correct.</p>
<p>Currently the iPhone client only syncs with Skydrive and currently only personal notebooks - not shared one. But if they are on Skydrive, they can still be shared to others who will&nbsp;accessed them via PC, WP7 or the web interface. But the iPhone client itself
 only sees the personal notebooks associated with one Live ID.</p>
<p>PCs (2010) and Windows Phone 7 can sync with either Skydrive or Sharepoint 2010 - and can sync personal or shared notebooks.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<h2>            How do I get rid of the annoying angle marks on word 2003&#63;</h2>
                    Okay, I know a lot about computers and this problem has me both stumped and frustrated beyond belief. So I'm using word 03 and there are these annoying crop mark/angle thingies on all four corners of the page as shown in the picture. My text boundaries
 check mark is unchecked and I do not have any asian languages enabled. English U.S. is the only one. I don't even think these are the same crop marks described in other forums. Whatever they are, I just want them gone because they are driving me bonkers and
 they distract me from my work.

            Try the following: Make sure that only one document is open. Hold the Alt key and press F11 to display the Visual Basic Editor. Press Ctrl+G to activate the Immediate window. Type<br />
<br />
ActiveWindow.View.ShowCropMarks = False<br />
<br />
and press Enter. This should remove the crop marks. Close the Visual Basic Editor. Restart Word.

            <p>Sorry, I realized that that particular line of code isn't supported in versions older than Word 2010.<br />
<br />
Since you don't have an Asian language installed, you shouldn't see crop marks in your documents. If you look in the Tools | Options dialog box, do you see any reference to crop marks at all?

<p>
</p><p>However, you have to remember that ARM devices do not have a unified boot structure like x86 PCs have. You can't just choose to boot another operating system. Microsoft's requirements for Windows RT have attempted to make a standard for ARM, but you still
 just can't install Windows on a Nexus for example.</p>
