<h2>            Making a custom Word template for others to use</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm a graphic designer who was asked by a client to create a Word template for a proposal format. I understand Word is different than page layout programs such as InDesign, but recently I've been asked by a couple of clients to make both InDesign (which
 I know very well) and Word (I know the basics) templates for the same piece. I hate to say no and would like to learn how to do this in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will only be creating the template, others will actually use it. Part of the document will be boilerplate, but then pre-formatted pages will be added and the text customized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few questions:</p>
<p>- If I create a template with a custom theme, what do I give the users? Do they need the template and theme files? If so, do they need to store them in a specific folder? What's the easiest way to explain this to users?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My users will be working in Office 2010 for PC. I'm on Office 2011 for Mac. I plan to use the standard Office fonts. Are there any problems that may arise working cross platform? I'm already aware that the Mac version of Office has less functionality than
 the PC version so I assume I won't be able to anything the PC doesn't have. The only PC version I have access to is Office 2007. Would it be better to use it to develop the template?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Can anyone suggest a good book or tutorial that will be helpful with this project? Something that really addresses layout? I've read a fair amount and done some tutorials, but nothing I've found really focuses on what I'm trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any and all suggestion!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Laura&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Laura:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, you shouldn't be trying "layout" in Word. &nbsp;It's built to prevent it, and it will fight you every inch of the way :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word is a "text flow application" (a word processor!) &nbsp;Word processors are built to re-flow their text and repaginate their documents whenever a change is made. &nbsp;You cannot prevent this, you need to deign your layout so that Word can automatically re-flow
 text and re-paginate the pages and the document will continue to look good (it can be done...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The secret is to use the properties of styles to help Word decide where you DON'T want a page break. &nbsp;Don't get caught chasing hard page breaks in Word, it will drive you mad. &nbsp;Basically, never use hard page breaks. &nbsp;Use Keep Together and Keep With Next
 (both properties of paragraph styles) to tell Word where you DON'T want page breaks, then sit back and let Word do it all for you the way it was designed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use hard page breaks, every time you edit, you will need to move them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't justify text in Word, it looks disgusting and makes the text very hard to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to avoid floating objects in Word. &nbsp;As far as possible set pictures and tables "In line with text" and use their paragraph properties to position them. &nbsp;Word will then automatically maintain the document for you, and the users will find it easy to work
 with. &nbsp;If you want to flow text around objects, hook the text into InDesign and use the tool designed for the job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do ALL your formatting with styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accept that you CANNOT pre-format "pages". Word has no concept of a "page" in its files. &nbsp;Pages are created at print time when Word outputs the file to the printer; the pages are never stored. &nbsp;So while you can pre-format, you have no control over which
 page your formatting will print on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For things such as Front Cover, Front Matter, Table of Contents etc, you "can" use Section Breaks that will cause designated sections to start on the designated side of the page. &nbsp;Which will achieve the effect: the Front Matter will begin on page iii provided
 the users do not add any text before the front matter, or provided they know what they are doing when they do so. &nbsp;Again, set the section breaks up right and Word will paginate correctly for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use Protect Document to "lock" some sections so the users cannot change its content. &nbsp;A "section" can be as small as one character or as large as a whole book. &nbsp;You can control where you put the section breaks. &nbsp;You can have an effectively unlimited
 number of section breaks in a document (32,767). While you can protect the document to lock users out of sections, don't: it causes misery for the users: they will hate it, and they will go out of their way to defeat it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never use themes in Word: their effects are very unpredictable and it's pretty much impossible to prevent users from changing them. &nbsp;All a theme does is enable users to change Fonts and Colours in a document. &nbsp;But it's a bit of a lottery "which" text will
 change and which will not, depending on how the user formatted that text. &nbsp;And you don't WANT the users changing fonts and colours anyway, that's your job! &nbsp;Do the fonts and colours in the styles of the document. &nbsp;Don't use a theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Professional template users often create special styles: "Heading Base" and "Body Base". &nbsp;They use these styles to set the colours and fonts. &nbsp;All other styles inherit from the Base styles. &nbsp;The Base styles are never applied to text and always hidden. &nbsp;They
 enable skilled users to rapidly restore the original formatting to a document users have "fiddled" with. &nbsp;Things like corporate colours are usually specified in RGB, and can be a bear to re-create if you do not have the RGB values, so put them in the Base
 styles. Do not use CMYK or Pantone colours in Word, it can't cope: you must use 24-bit RGB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have already caught on to using the standard Microsoft fonts: stick to that or you will indeed cause great pain :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you create a custom theme it will be contained in the template you send: you need to send only the template. &nbsp;Do not attempt to explain this to users: they're not interested. &nbsp;Don't give them custom theme files, you do not want them changing themes. &nbsp;Remember:
 no matter what they do to the Themes, YOU will still get the blame: it will be YOUR product that "doesn't work" :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can send template files from the Mac to the PC, but it is not wise to attempt to bring them back. &nbsp;The PC adds extra components in its template files that will cause problems if the Mac attempts to edit them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2007: No. &nbsp;You won't need that unless you are adding VBA to your template. &nbsp;Which you could, but do your level best not to: it gives you problems attempting to deploy and train users. &nbsp;Word 2010 was the bug fix for Word 2007: grab yourself a copy of
 that and upgrade that PC. &nbsp;Word 2010 is cheap (it's in the remainder bin...) and it's nicer to use. &nbsp;Word 2013 is horrid: nasty garish all-white-on-white colour scheme. &nbsp;Working on it all day makes your head hurt. And I think it's currently still too buggy
 for professional work.</p>

 that I know I need to set up to sync to outlook, but can't find it.&nbsp; Where in the world do I go to set this up?&nbsp; I'm very frustrated.&nbsp; I want to use my iphone for my calendar, tasks and emails.&nbsp; I have spent weeks on this and still nothing.&nbsp; I just want everything
 to sync, so it's all going together.

            Hi, Girish -<br />
<br />
Since the last update of iTunes (11.1.4.62 on 1/23), iTunes no longer syncs properly with Microsoft Outlook 2013 -- contacts, calendar, notes.&nbsp;&nbsp; iTunes "goes through the motions" of syncing (and it takes a very long time), and when the process is finished,
 new contacts, calendar appointments, notes are not updated on my iPhone.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It simply no longer works.&nbsp; <br />

<p>Hi, I have been having the pretty much the exact same issue. I, too have an iPhone 4S. I also have an iPad, same issue. Neither of them are communicating properly with each other. It's truly been a hassle. I, recently chatted, twice (2x) online with APPLE
 support. They walked me through the things that I know and have done on my own, to no avail. they, too, had me install</p>
<p>iCloud Control Panel claiming it would correct things. It worked for a hot minute. After an hour on with them and the 2nd day doing the same thing, the tech said I would have to contact Microsoft, because the application isn't supported by Apple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, here I am, frustrated, annoyed and pissed that at one point it worked just fine when I had iphone 3GS. I say it started with Apple's bombardment of updates (versions). I have been using Outlook prior to any Apple products and I don't want to have to
 use some other program, if I really DON'T NEED.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the long and short of, oh too late, is there any way to permanently correct this no longer an issue, but PROBLEM?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I know Apple products are not very intuitive, and Microsoft is starting to get the same way, but you can still use iTunes to sync with Outlook 2013. Once you attach your device, iTunes should start and possibly sync automatically, but you still may need
 to change your settings. Do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the left side of the <strong>iPhone </strong>button, which is on the right side of iTunes 11.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Info </strong>button.</li><li>Select the check box for <strong>Sync Contact with Outlook</strong>; if you don't see Outlook already listed, select it from the drop-down list.</li><li>Continue doing the same for any other Outlook related items, e.g., <strong>Sync Calendars with Outlook</strong>, etc.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply </strong>at the bottom; at this point, it should go through the process of synchronizing.</li></ol>

            <p>Unfortunately, that's not sufficient.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a matter of any settings, it's a matter of Apple and Microsoft (or Apple, at least) deciding that their preferred mechanism for syncing should be The Cloud, forcing users to transfer huge amounts of personal information to a 3rd-party server, so
 it can be fully mined for information and revenue-generation, as a condition of it being transferred from one platform (MS Outlook) to another (Apple iPhone/iTunes).&nbsp;

            Hi, I have the same problem as everyone else.&nbsp; I too think we have been misled and I also agree that I am&nbsp; very uncomfortable with ICloud and&nbsp; only got on it in desperation.&nbsp; Question today is referring to 1 above, where is he IPhone Button to which you
 refer?&nbsp; The only ITune icon I have on my IPhone 6s Plus is for music and can't find a way to dl any other.&nbsp; Thanks and Semper Fi Ben

    <title>Changed my mindspring password and tried to update it in Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allen wilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changed my mindspring password and tried to update it in Outlook.com but received error and now cannot pull my emails.</h2>
                    <p>I am pulling emails from my mindspring account (Earthlink) using POP3 and this has worked fine until this evening when I changed my password via EarthLink's website.&nbsp; After doing so, I tried to update my password in Outlook by going to Outlook.com &gt; Options
 &gt; Your Email accounts.&nbsp; I clicked the "Details" link next to the one that needed to be updated, and then clicked the Edit button.&nbsp; I entered my new password and clicked the Save button.&nbsp; That appeared to work, and on the next screen where it asks "When mail
 is received via *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, where do you want it saved?", I selected "An existing folder" and selected "Inbox".&nbsp; After several moments, I received the error message below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're sorry, but there was a problem creating your account. We've tried to save your settings, but if you don't see your account on your email accounts page, you may need to choose "Add an email account" and start over."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeated this process several times over the course of a half hour or more and finally decided to simply delete the account and recreate it again.&nbsp;&nbsp; This didn't work either and I am right back where I started before doing so - I cannot pull emails from
 mindspring at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; As it stands now (an hour later), I am unable to receive emails from mindspring via Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>NOTE: The password I entered is correct - to make sure, I entered an invalid one once and quickly received an error message telling me as much.</p>

<h2>            Security Essentials won&#39;s install on XP virtual machine. &#34;the feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable&#34;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; Get error, "the feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable".&nbsp; It claims to be looking of epp.msi.&nbsp; When I copy the epp.msi that the install put on my c:drive to the desktop, it says it is an invalid copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally I had a version of SE installed on the XP virtual machine (running on my Windows 7 laptop) but the automatic update kept failing.&nbsp; I followed the instruction to manually uninstall the current copy and then tried to download the latest version
 and it failed.&nbsp; The error messages for the original problem were the same ones that I'm getting now.&nbsp; For that matter, the error message for the uninstall was the same too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically when the file is where the installer put it, it reports it as unavailable.&nbsp; When I put it somewhere "available" it claims that it is invalid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get security essentials to install and run in my virtual XP?</p>

<h2>            Calendar Permissions grayed out in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    
<p>I have a user who has Full permissions on a hosted 2010 exchange site, The user also has Publisher/Editor rights on several conference room calendars. Now, these calendars are setup as a resource mailbox on the exchange server. The issue is this...in Outlook
 2011, she had no problems manipulating or editing the meetings that were setup by users for these conference rooms. She would do that and it would then send them updates. Now, in Outlook 2016, the calendar permission is grayed out and she is unable to edit..even
 though her permissions did not change....also, if i log into OWA , i can change..so it sounds like an Outlook 2016 issue..please, any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>From what you mentioned above, basically, I understand the permission issue was only occurred in Outlook for Mac 2016 but not happened in Outlook 2011 or OWA. But to better understand the issue, I would like to confirm the following information<br />
1.&nbsp;Regarding “<strong>I have a user who has Full permissions on a hosted 2010 exchange site</strong>”, what did you refer to? Do you mean the user’s account and mailbox is resided in on-premises Exchange?<br />
2.&nbsp;Have you deployed Exchange hybrid environment in your organization?<br />
3.&nbsp;Can you share the screenshot “<strong>in Outlook 2016, the calendar permission is grayed out and she is unable to edit</strong>..” To upload images, please click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then select the<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong> button.<br />
4.&nbsp;And, do other users encounter this issue in Outlook 2016?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ran</p>

 the user's account resides on a hosted environment..we do not host exchange in house.</p>
<p>2.no.</p>
<p>also, the user has 2016 client on her macbook and from home was able to see permissions. she was using vpn... why would it work on her laptop from home..but not from her imac here.</p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the information. Since she was able to see permission from home network, the issue is probably related to the network environment.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, regarding “<strong>a hosted 2010 exchange</strong>”, we are still not very clear about the detail information of your environment. Can you let us know if your organization is using Exchange Online (Office 365) as your email service? We can check
 this for you through your email address. So, please send us your email address via PM. I have sent you a private message for the information. Click the link below to access it.<br />

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>To rule of the possibility that this user’s Outlook 2016 client is not working properly, have you tried letting this user log into Outlook 2016 on another Mac within your corp network instead of home? If she can see the permission option on another Mac in
 your corp network, the issue might be related to his client. Please ensure his Outlook 2016 on her work Mac is up to date. And if the issue still happens, to ensure you get dedicated assistance, we also recommend you post it into our Outlook client for Mac
 forum via the following link and involve our client engineers on this issue.<br />

            <p>Hi, Rafasaud. Try rebooting it by pressing and holding the power and the volume down keys simultaneously for 10-15 seconds. You can also check if all the system apps are updated. Store &gt;... &gt; settings &gt; check for updates. Keep us posted.</p>

bsab69</a>. Were you able to perform all the above troubleshooting steps including resetting your phone to its factory settings? Don't forget to back up all important data. In case it didn't work, let's try using the Windows Phone Recovery Tool on your phone.
 For the full instructions, visit this page:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987</a>.
 If these were not helpful, you may visit any third party repair center in Canada to have your phone fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Just to let you know, this is very common for the 640XL model to have the same yellow area in the top right corner of the screen.&nbsp; This is not a software issue of any kind.&nbsp; A reset, color setting, or anything else will not fix the issue.&nbsp; I have the same
 issue as well and have had it within a month of owning the device and ever since.&nbsp; 3 full system restores, Win 10 upgrade, and back to windows 8.1.&nbsp; Shows up every time.

<h2>            How to remove Search&#47;Filter bars</h2>
                    <p>How can I remove these bars from Outlook, for improved screen real estate?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b7c4e53-fe7e-491f-af36-c169c403be35?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b7c4e53-fe7e-491f-af36-c169c403be35?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need or want them, so they may as well be gone.</p>
<p>Search I can do by pressing Ctrl+F, and even that I don't need. Unread messages are already indicated by making them blue-bold. Order by Date (on the right) is done by clicking the headers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These bars is <em>so</em> useless, that I would consider it a <em>bug</em> if they cannot be hidden/removed.</p>

<p>Hi Thanatica,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First you can try to reduce the space size between the Outlook search bar and All/ Unread. Please click<span style="font-weight: bold"> View</span> ( on the top of your Outlook Client) &gt;
Right</span>. After that please check if it can make any difference. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp; the Outlook search bar and the filter options are default features within the Outlook Client, so they cannot be removed/hidden in the Outlook Client, if the workaround above cannot meet
 your requirements, it is recommended that please give a feedback to <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows</a> and post your concerns there.&nbsp; The dedicated engineers in Microsoft will keep monitoring customers feedback there, some features would be changed based on customers feedback and requirements
 in the future, and your good ideas will be very helpful for them to improve the product, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

<h2>            Help with formatting Styles</h2>
                    <p>I'm confused about some options regarding formatting Word styles.</p>
<p>What am I choosing if I check "Update to match selection"?</p>
<p>I understand the choice to apply formatting to "new documents based on this template."</p>
<p>But what happens if I check the "Automatically update" box?</p>
<p>I have modified the&nbsp;Block Text style for "long quotes." On the Properties page:</p>
<p>Style based on: "Normal" [OK]</p>
<p>Style for following paragraph: Should I choose "Block Text" OR "Normal"? [The style&nbsp;will usually apply to&nbsp;only one paragraph, but may sometimes apply to two or more consecutive paragraphs.]</p>
<p>Thank you for help with this issue.</p>

            <p><strong>Update to match selection:</strong></p>
<p>You have some text (which may or may not include paragraph formatting) selected (or have the I-beam positioned in a word, which makes that single word "selected"), and want your style definition to match the formatting of that text rather than having to
 define the style yourself. Word will then look at the formatting of the text as it is in the document, and build the style definition to match that.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a shortcut, but if you use styles properly (i.e., explicitly), then that means that your formatting will never (except in the case of exceptions) be manually applied to text, but only through styles, so the scope for the use of this tool
 will be limited then.</p>
<p><strong>Automatically update:</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, this should <em>always</em> be deselected. It allows no exceptions. Essentially, it says that if you want to make a change to the style, you don't have to open the Modify Style dialog, you can just make the formatting change to the text, and
 Word will add that change to the style definition. So if, for example, you wanted to make one word in your document bold, and that word was in a Body Text paragraph, then when you make that one word bold, all Body Text words in your whole document will become
 bold (since they share the same style definition and that definition has been updated to bold). Not a good idea. A possible exception to
<em>always</em> deselecting this is for Word's built in heading styles, although even there I prefer having this off.</p>
<p><strong>Style based on:</strong></p>
<p>You are OK with this one, but in my own usage, I see to it that all the styles I used are either based on a sensible parent style (e.g., Body Text Indent is based on Body Text) or based on no style, but I never allow my styles to be based on Normal. This
 does require a little work, as being based on Normal is the Word default. But the Normal style (because of its generalist purpose), is qualitatively different from all other styles, and so I avoid having it in my documents, with the
<em>only</em> exception being for the formatting of tables--table styles don't play nicely with any other paragraph style than Normal.</p>
<p><strong>Style for following paragraph:</strong></p>
<p>What style do you want when you are finished with this paragraph and press Enter (i..e, what style is the
<em>next</em> paragraph going to get). I normally set mine to Body Text (and recommend that you use Body Text for the bulk of your document text, rather than Normal). So if I have a Body Text indent paragraph, it makes sense that, normally, the paragraph following
 that is not going to be indented any more, so I set the style for the following paragraph to Body Text. But let's say I created a style called Dialog (e.g., dialog in a play, script, etc.). It makes sense that after one person has spoken, another will reply,
 so then the next paragraph should stay in the Dialog style, and so style for following paragraph will be Dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have written a whole chapter on Styles which includes more detailed information and with copious screen shots, so you can search my website for information on the book if you want to go into more depth (but, of course, there is no obligation to do so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be away until the 28th, so will only be able to return to this thread then.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I'll just add a couple of comments to Jacques's excellent explanation:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Automatically update:</strong> I agree with Jacques that this can cause more problems than it solves, but there are situations where it can be helpful. When you're first setting up a template and making frequent changes in formatting to get everything
 exactly right, you may frequently change your mind about the formatting of styles (a little more Spacing Before and a little less Spacing After for Heading 1, bold instead of italic for some other style, and so on). While you're still experimenting, this setting
 can be a timesaver, provided you remember to turn it off once you're done. It is also the default setting for TOC styles, and this is a big help because accessing TOC styles to modify them is not simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update to match selection:</strong> This can be a shortcut to replace "Automatically update." As you experiment with formatting, once you've settled on the formatting you want for a style in a given paragraph, you can tell Word to modify the style
 to have that formatting. But it can also be a huge help when you have reams of paragraphs in Normal style with direct formatting. Instead of selecting an appropriate style (Block Text, say) and trying to match the formatting in the Normal paragraph, you can
 just select that paragraph, right click on Block Text, and choose "Update to match selection." Block Text will now be formatted to match the direct-formatted Normal paragraph. Where you can get into trouble with this is heading styles, especially numbered
 ones, because of <a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/styles/HowStylesCascade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the way styles cascade</a>. I got into quite&nbsp;a mess when I decided I wanted all my Heading 2s to be Heading 1s but didn't want to change the formatting. Ouch!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Style based on:</strong> What Jacques says about Normal is valid but less important in Word versions in which you can set document defaults instead of modifying the Normal style. For more on this see "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=C6JCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT763&amp;lpg=PT763&amp;dq=the+relationship+between+document+defaults,+the+normal+style,+and+(no+style)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D368aTOzHh&amp;sig=F5Jz0--OAFJU8XFqPnx4gHk8kB0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIo4CJ7aCNyAIVzJiACh0TJAzn#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The
 Relationship Between Document Defaults, the Normal Style, and (No Style)</a>."</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Style for following paragraph:</strong> I usually leave this as the same style except in situations where the next paragraph will
<strong>always</strong> be in a different style. By default, all Word's built-in heading styles have Normal as the following style. I always change this to Body Text. If the document is a printed book, the style following a left-aligned heading will be Body
 Text, but the style following Body Text will be Body Text First Indent. Sometimes I define alternating styles (such as
<a href="http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/QandA2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Q&amp;A styles</a>) where each is the following style for the other. This can be a great timesaver.</p>

<h2>            How Do You &#39;Copy Link Location&#39; in IE8.</h2>
                    I am coming from Firefox and am looking for how you copy the address for a picture's link to the clipboard. I normally do this when I want to copy the location of an album cover off Amazon to a classical music forum that I frequent.
<br />
<br />
In Firefox, you right click the image and select 'Copy Link Location". This give you the address of the jpeg. Then I can paste it in the forum and the jpeg shows up. (Displays the album cover). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I try to right click in IE8 there isn't a 'Copy Link Location', so I don't know how to get the address of just the jpeg.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much.<br />

<br />
to get the address of an image file, for instance, you'll just need to right-click on the image, and left-click on "Properties" in the menu.&nbsp; This will display the object's address and you can copy/paste it accordingly.&nbsp; I hope this helps!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <p>It seems rather far-fetched, but it could be text that's marked as Hidden, placed in a text box that's anchored in a header or footer. In addition, the symptoms would require that the "Print hidden text" option is checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn on the Show button and open the document's header pane. If you can select the slash, then delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work out, save the document to a cloud location such as Dropbox or OneDrive and post a download link here. We'll find out what's going on and let you know.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Steve.&nbsp; My a/v software is actually Bell Internet Security Services which in the normal course of a full scan on&nbsp;October 5, 2012,&nbsp;flagged this file as infected: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Scans\mpcache-DD907112A6137ED9777B2BDAF575B845DF29F51C.bin.VF&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Specifically, the infection is identified as: Gen:Trojan.Heur.FU.au1@aSmMr2di and could not be quarantined.&nbsp; My Google search lead me to the BitDefender forum and to this forum (Microsoft Community).&nbsp; BitDefender is not my a/v software.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I should add that Windows Defender did not pick up this file as infected.&nbsp; I've since done a quick scan with Mawarebytes after installing&nbsp;the latest updates for it.&nbsp; Nothing was found.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would have to conclude that&nbsp;flagging this file as a trojan is
 a false positive.&nbsp; I was hoping others on this forum who have experienced this situation would concurr and add to my fuzzy feeling that all is safe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks for the links to the resources that hopefully I'll never need, but good to know that they're there.

                    Hi There,<br />
<br />
i have a Nokia 6230 and im using the PC SUITE that came with the phone. My OS is XP SP2. My PC Suite Ver: 6.1.012<br />
<br />
Q1:<br />
I want to know how can i export my contact list plus SMS on<br />
my mobile phone to an Excel file into my PC for backup<br />
purposes ?<br />
<br />
I've already created a NFB and NFC files to my PC, but i also<br />
want a Excel file just to make sure. Is it Possible?<br />
<br />
Q2:<br />
If i loose my mobile phone and buy a diferent model of Nokia<br />
is it possible to restore all my contacts to my new mobile<br />
phone using these two files NFB and NFC?

            If you want the additional safety I would syncronise contacts with Windows Address Book or Outlook (if you don't have Outlook, you at least have Windows Address Book), so use the Synchonise option in PC Suite for that.<br />
<br />
For SMS messages, you can archive them to excel, conect phone, select messages, scroll to inbox and you will see an option in upper task bar "messages", select that and you can see the option archive. I think it works with sent messages also (but not with own
 message folders)

you can extract sms into excel .xls file.<br />
<br />
Q2.<br />
&gt; is it possible to restore all my contacts to my new mobile<br />

.nfb and .nfc formats are no longer supported by latest pc suite(since 6.82). You can use
<a href="http://nokisms.googlepages.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">noki</a> to extract contacts from the .nfb/.nfc file as vCard file which is a universal format and can be copied to the new phone safely.

            I could not find a way to sync my mobile phone with Win Address Book. In the sync options from PC Suite there is several aplications that i can choose to sync with, but not any of those is the Win Address Book. I've also tried the outlook but it only copy's
 the content of outlook to my mobile, and not the other way arround.<br />
<br />
In the SMS messages i open the Contacts and Messages aplication, i choose Messages tab and click on the inbox folder, then on the Message Menu on the top there is an option "Save as". This option gives me the possibility to save the SMS ONLY as a TXT file (should
 have more formats available), and only one SMS at the time, i can not select all SMS and then save as a single TXT file.<br />
After this i had to convert the TXT file into XLS, and of course the final format of the XLS file is totaly mixed up in this case.<br />
And if your tinking about copy and paste actions, forget it. PC Suite does not gives me those functions, because the format that PC Suite uses to copy data is not compatible with the format used by the clipboard of windows. I wonder why didn't Nokia correct
 this incompatibility ?...<br />
<br />
So basicly if i loose my Nokia and have to buy a diferent model of it, the backups of PC Suite are of so much use to me as a bunch of garbage on my PC!<br />
<br />
What i need is a simple function of EXPORT on the pc suite to a XLS file or any other type of format commonly used to all Mobile phones, that will give me the possibility of IMPORTING all the backuped data into the new mobile phone in the event of a loss.<br />
<br />
Is there any version of PC Suite that does that ?

            Answering to al_lea,<br />
<br />
it looks like Noki is exactly what im looking for. I haven't try it yet, but i thing i will give it a shot!<br />
<br />
Just one doubt, you said vCard format is common to all Mobile Phones. Does that mean that if i backup all my data from my mobile phone into a vCard format and latter on if i have to import the vCard into the mobile (no matter what model) i can do so with no
 problem ?

            By universal format, I mean vCard is also widely supported by other brands - like Sony Ericsson PC Suite, Samsung PC Studio. But some fields' type might be different (which might lead to comparability problem).

            I wanted to copy my address file to Excel or any other useable PC file, but have been unable to find any option using the Nokia PC suite which seems to be in a Nokia only format and does not appear to be easy to transfer to another Nokia? I use Vista and
 see that synchronising with Windows mail then exporting to Excel is possible? No idea how this works. If I lose my phone or get a new one I have no way of retaining contacts &amp; re inputting - a frightening prospect. Any simple solutions? Many thanks

            Update: I have Synchronised my Phone addres book with Windows mail using the Nokia Suite - however - this just seems to add my Windows mail contacts onto my mobile address book - not - as hoped - copy my mobile phone contacts onto my Windows mail. How
 the heck do I get my mobile phone contacts onto Windows mail!! I can get the Windows mail address book onto Excel - no problem - but still am frustrated that I can't get my Nokia address book onto any sort of useable file. Any help advice here - please!

            I have tried synchronising my address book with Nokia PC suite to Outlook, but none of the information seems to come accross. I am particularly interested in getting all the address information and Notes which have been built up on my old mobile over a
 long time. None of this information seems to come across although Nokia PC suite seems to think it worked OK so I have no clue what has happened. I am really hoping to be able to get all my names &amp; addresses from my old 6230 onto a new 2630 but am pretty stuck.

    <title>How To Disable Windows Defender and use instead my Iolo System - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How To Disable Windows Defender and use instead my Iolo System Mechanics in my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community.</p>
<p>Recently I have to reset my PC because it was running too slowish. Windows did a great job removing all apps and programs except my personal files and re installed Windows 10. After doing all the updates it's performance is great. Except when Windows defender
 is constantly executing its Malware Threads and Virus protection. Memory goes sky high and CPU. Since I have been using for a while System Mechanics in conjunction with Windows Defender. I noticed that System Mechanics is letting Windows Defender do the Virus
 threads function and updates. I use System Mechanics for running and Analysis and fixing all issues it finds, registry issues, windows junk files, internet broken connection, memory issue, optimization and fragmentation issues of the hard drive etc... However,
 it does not use that much memory or CPU when running like Windows Defender does. That's why I wanted to disable it and let system mechanics do all the functions Windows Defender is doing now.</p>
<p>Any advice is welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

<p>I don't think system mechanics is Anti-Malware software and is replacement for Windows Defender. Even if you don't want to use Windows Defender, you must use another trusted and compatible Anti-Malware product.</p>
<p>You may update Windows and Windows Defender and run a full system scan with it.</p>

<p>Thanks.You are incorrect in that System Mechanics is not a Full Malware Antivirus product because it is and have been using it for years until my PC was upgraded to Windows 10. I gave Windows Defender a chance but it hughs a ton of memory. System Mechanics
 has a bunch of tools like recovering deleted data.Registry optimization,Full System Scan or individual&nbsp; File or Folder , Live boosting of Memory when low entire system analysis etc.</p>
<p>What I was looking for is instruction on how to disable it for a while not uninstall it.. I guess I will go to the web with my question.</p>

<p><span>If you have the professional edition of System Mechanic, then I believe it does include an AV component that can be installed with a reinstallation:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="http://support.iolo.com/link/portal/16098/16125/Article/178/Can-I-install-the-System-Mechanic-Professional-antivirus-component-at-a-later-time-if-I-already-have-antivirus-protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support.iolo.com/link/portal/16098/16125/Article/178/Can-I-install-the-System-Mechanic-Professional-antivirus-component-at-a-later-time-if-I-already-have-antivirus-protection</span></a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But I certainly wouldn’t recommend that; for the reasons given here:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/356620/iolo-system-shield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.pcmag.com/review/356620/iolo-system-shield</span></a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Additionally, the reason why Windows Defender is running so hot might have a lot to do with background processes that are being run by System Mechanic – although you might be able to work around that issue by disabling ActiveCare, or by setting up
 exclusions for System Mechanic’s folders and executable processes: </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028485/windows-10-add-an-exclusion-to-windows-defender-antivirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028485/windows-10-add-an-exclusion-to-windows-defender-antivirus</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It’s also worth noting that third-party AV apps are sometimes less prone to aggravation by background processes, so you might want consider switching to another free AV solution as an alternative
 to enabling the System Shield in System Mechanic:</span></p>

<p>Thank you Bruce.</p>
<p>I read all the links you refer me to as well as your comments and others regarding turning off Windows Defender. Before I do it, last night I experimented by only turning off the Antivirus protection in the Windows Defender Security Center Virus and threat
 protection settings (Real Time Protection and Cloud Base Protection.) Instead I went to System Mechanics and did and entire full system scan first that took several hours and enable the ANTI-MALWARE Full Scan, Real-Time and Definitions functions.&nbsp; Enable System
 Mechanics Firewall Functions instead of Windows. Also made sure under Live Boost OptiCare, RamJet AcceleWrite and Power Sense were on.</p>
<p>Then I worked in my project with&nbsp; Wondershare Filmora that utilizes a lot of RAM and CPU. I worked 4 hours straight creating old home videos, vacation etc.</p>
<p>To my surprise the System was humming at a quick pace.</p>
<p>I went to Task manager to check the performance. CPU was running about 64%, instead of 92% with defender Anti Virus. Memory was running between 55% at times as higt as 62% , instead of 80% or more with Defender Antivirus, Disk running between 35% or even
 48%, instead of over 90% with Windows Defender. I do not understand it. Why it was keeping up with the project I was working on. Yet, with Windows Defender a few days ago when I tried to do the same every key stroke I have to wait and wait until memory was
 release. Task Manager shows&nbsp; "Anti malware Service Executable running over 6,4% as high as 8%. What gives? how can System Mechanics Pro Edition be more efficient in using the resources than Microsoft Defender?</p>

            Below are general troubleshooting options for Outlook. Try one by one and and check after each step (try point 5 first). Leave whatever you have already tried. (If nothing below works, below thread has many solutions. You should start reading it from last page to first page - <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-outlook/outlook-2016-search-not-working/75b0acb4-ec1b-41a5-b84e-5c251679700d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/foru...</a>)
<br />
<br />1. Create new Outlook profile to rule out corruption in Outlook profile. - <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-ha102749460.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Repair your Outlook data files - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Run SCANPST.exe. Open your Outlook &gt; Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Task Manager &gt; Under processes tab, right click on Outlook.exe &gt; Open File Location &gt; This location contains SCANPST.exe which you should double clikc to run
<br />
<br />4. Disable Anti-virus temporarily. 
<br />
<br />5. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Outlook in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Outlook icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />6. Login to Windows with a new profile to rule out problem in Windows profile. 
<br />
<br />7. Right click on Outlook icon and run as Administrator.

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Request a refund and explain the reasons, then acquire the HD version.
<br />
<br />Refer to this.
