                    I know why it won't work: It says I need to run Genuine Check before i can download it. So, I downloaded&nbsp; Genuine Check&nbsp;&nbsp; with the link right below it on the&nbsp;download&nbsp;page, (

 anywhere. Can someone help me either download&nbsp;the working version of&nbsp;Genuine Check,&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;Microsoft Image Mastering API v2 without needing&nbsp;Genuine Check&nbsp;?

            No, that still doesn't work. That is the link I showed you above that didn't work. It says it is out of date and get the newest version. &nbsp;It's the same thing I tried before. If you could show me where the "Normal" Verification method is that'd help as
 I thought the "Alternate" method was the only one.

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker&#58; yellow triangle mark</h2>
                    <p>I am using Movie Maker in Windows 7.&nbsp; Have just tried to open some projects and each one will open</p>
<p>but all the movie clips have a yellow triangle with a ? mark. Still images are intact. If I play the movie I just get a blank screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can create and play a new project without any problems.</p>

<p>A Movie Maker project file doesn't actually contain any media. When you are adding clips, photos and music to your project, Movie Maker is just remembering their location on your hard disk. Every time you preview your project, it will dynamically load those
 files and give you a preview of that section of the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reopen your project, Movie Maker checks the original locations for each of the media files and for any that it can't find, it shows a yellow triangle with an exclamation point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what must have happened is that you moved, deleted or renamed something so that Movie Maker can't find it. If you put the files in a new folder, just double-click on the problem video clip and navigate to its new location. If you accidentally deleted
 the source files, try recovering them from your recycle bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The analogy I like to use is it's like giving instructions to your teenager about making a cake where you say get the eggs off the 2nd shelf of the fridge, and get the flour off of the top shelf of the pantry, etc. But in the meantime you've either moved
 them somewhere else, or you've used them all up. So when your teenager comes to follow that recipe, they won't be able to add those ingredients to the cake. At that point you can just show them that the flour is actually moved to a container on the bottom
 shelf and the eggs are moved to the door of the refrigerator. And then they can complete the baking of the cake.</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t I change snap size in Windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> majule1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I change snap size in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am used to being able to have multiple windows open and semi-active at the same time.&nbsp; For instance, I might want to play a game of solitaire while I watch a video and also have my email or twitter up so I can see if anything new comes in.&nbsp; In Windows
 8, the only way to do this is in desktop mode, which would be fine except many of the newer programs ('apps') don't run in desktop mode.&nbsp; I tried using snap but it can use 2 programs at once and, more importantly, It will only let me snap 2/3 to 1/3 which
 made the 1/3 screen program too small to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be nice to have some scalability to the snap feature, at least 50/50.&nbsp; Better yet 25/25/25/25 and 25/25/50% options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even better would be truly windowed 'Apps' that could run in desktop mode in a scalable window.&nbsp; Then us multitaskers could organize them as we see fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize this gets away from some of the key features and benefits of Win8 but it should be&nbsp;available as an option.&nbsp; I actually like new start screen and find it easier to use and more attractive than previous versions.&nbsp; But I've got a big, bulky, powerful
 PC, not a tablet, and would like to run 4 or 5 programs at once sometimes without buying 2 more monitors.</p>

            Well its an intended feature. As a developer,&nbsp;I know that&nbsp;having a custom-scalable screen would ruin the interface. We'd have to accommodate for a completely random screen-width and aspect ratio, and we'd lose the ability to have simple UI designs for
 each snapped mode (ie the small snapped mode, full-screen, or the&nbsp;large snapped&nbsp;mode). I could see it being a nightmare if the user could have manually adjusted widths. So personally I disagree with having custom app snapping sizes.

I get your point, but it could be nice if there was more than one option (320 pixels) since only one resolution gives you the right window Width ratio. Allmost useless snap feature with a full HD display.

If you could run&nbsp; W8&nbsp; in a&nbsp; VM&nbsp; it could be windowized then.</p>
<p>BTW&nbsp; with just standard Windows I don't see what good more than 2 monitors would be?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp; there is only one monitor&nbsp;allowed to be in Metro mode at any time.</p>

I'm not a developer, just a designer, so pardon any ignorance I might show.<br />
<br />
However, couldn't that be a type of pre-established coding that MS gives to its Win8 developers to automatically integrate custom window snapping?
<br />
<br />
I'm saying this because, from what I understand, the feature of pre-made coding was one of the selling points that MS emphasized to developers as a way to speed up app-development by already having a great amount of the foundation and/or framework.<br />
<br />
Again, I could be wrong but I figured it would be worth asking a developer to understand how the process works.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for the insight though. I never thought of it in those terms. I only saw it as a problem that MS needs to fix.<br />
<br />
Gracias!</p>

<p>I'm an End User and software designer. When software is designed for what is easier for the developer to code than for what is easier for the User to use, you get a system that no one uses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laptop/Desktop users have become more productive by opening mutiple windows - hence the name Windows, They add a second monitor for the same reason - to open more windows. The size the Apps window based on their screen size. Something that Tables/phones

<p>Well its an intended feature. As a developer,&nbsp;I know that&nbsp;having a custom-scalable screen would ruin the interface. We'd have to accommodate for a completely random screen-width and aspect ratio, and we'd lose the ability to have simple UI designs for each
 snapped mode (ie the small snapped mode, full-screen, or the&nbsp;large snapped&nbsp;mode). I could see it being a nightmare if the user could have manually adjusted widths. So personally I disagree with having custom app snapping sizes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snap is practically useless in such a small screen for me. I am getting older and the small screen is very hard to read.&nbsp; I use multiple windows&nbsp;open and wish I could use them in 50% mode instead of this tiny view.&nbsp; Please consider changing this for those
 of us&nbsp;who&nbsp;NEED a larger view.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Question, if having a custom-scalable screen would ruin the interface, how do explain the custom-scalable windows in windows XP/Vista/Win7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 17 inch monitor with plenty of room to have multiple windows. I got the screen so I could open more than one window and I could see information in window while type in another window.</p>

<h2>            Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have been waiting on this game since it came out for PC. I went and pre-ordered me a copy, but when I got home I did some research and found out that I couldn't&nbsp;play it on my Mac. So I
 went back and got my money. Then just last&nbsp;week I saw that it's coming out for Xbox 360. I was&nbsp;ecstatic I went and ordered my copy, and had it set up to be&nbsp;delivered to my home on the release date. The 18th comes and the mail man delivers " lol."
</span></p>
<p><span>I get the game out I up&nbsp;disc one of two in, just a screen pops up ok I select my hard drive, then nothing happens; nothing comes up; not a prompted in sight. So&nbsp;naturally I think of " Disk
 2 of 2." I get it out, get it put in. Opening&nbsp;credits , Franchise logos and all; no big&nbsp;whoop. Heck I thought I was on the right path. I go through to set up get everything perfect for game play, and low and behold I get and I&nbsp;quota straight from my screen.

<p><span>I have waited forever it seems like for this game. I've waited up all day to get it after&nbsp;pulling a double and now I can't even get a&nbsp;taste of the game play for myself before work. I sure
 hope it's fixed when I get home from work. I would hate to go on two days no sleep.</span></p>

<p>So the "Failed to load world section" is caused by the game not installing correctly. What you will want to do is this:</p>
<p>1) Go to setting/ memory and delete anything saved under Shadow of Mordor</p>
<p>2) Restart your Xbox</p>
<p>3) Disconnect from Xbox live</p>
<p>4) Start disc 1 and the option to install should show up this time</p>
<p>5) Install the game</p>
<p>6) Insert disc 2 after you are done installing and it should work</p>
<p>This worked for me, hope it works for everyone else.</p>
<p>Here's where I found out how to fix it: <a href="http://support.wbgames.com/link/portal/24022/24028/Article/864/Known-Issues-for-Middle-earth-Shadow-of-Mordor-XBox-360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I doubt your Android phone has a driver for an Xbox 360 controller, so it won't work. It works on the PC because Microsoft created a driver for the controller to work on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have to get a controller that is compatible with Android.</p>

<h2>            How can I whitelist a specific app in Family Safety&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have set up Game Restrictions for my two children (9 &amp; 13) based on ESRB game ratings. I want to filter so my 9 year old can play E10+ and my 13 year old can play T.</p>
<p>There is a game I have been playing that my kids would like to play as well, but the game has a higher rating due to some cartoonish violence. (In this case, you play a shark that can eat divers and swimmers.)</p>
<p>Is there a way for me to retain the Game Restriction based on rating, but allow/whitelist this specific app?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. “Another computer shares the same IP address”- This mean that your router has provided the same IP address to two different computers since the router could not refresh&nbsp;its routing table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. You can reset the router to default settings in order to remove that error. You can refer the router manual for performing that task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Check the following articles about Event viewer. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong><em>There are various methods to reinstall Vista</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact&nbsp;Toshiba and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How to replace Microsoft software or hardware, order service packs, and replace product manuals"</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Windows 7 install may have destroyed this:</u></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall Vista back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p><strong>The Recovery process on a Toshiba&nbsp;can be started by pressing&nbsp;0 (Zero) at Boot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Do a Clean Install and Setup with a Full Version of Vista"</b></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117366-clean-install-full-version-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117366-clean-install-full-version-vista.html</font></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Activate Vista Normally and by Phone Activation"</b></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Demi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Update Drivers</span></strong><span><br />
Try updating the Network Adapter drivers from the manufacturer's website and check if the issue persists.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
Follow the steps to update the Network Adapter drivers:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press Windows key + X key and click Device Manager.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<span>Right-click on the Ethernet and click on Update driver software.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<br />
<br />
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Internet Connection Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Internet connection. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to
 check if the issue is with your internet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer these steps:&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Run the Internet Connection troubleshooter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to download and install the latest network drivers from your computer manufacturer website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            When i talk my voice lag</h2>
                    <p>Every time i start up my computer and enters a skype call my voice is lagging for those i talk to and i have to restart my computer every time before it works. I dont think the problem is my computer since it happened to my old computer too. And if i end
 the skype call and enter one again without restarting my computer it my voice will be lagging again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else experience that? Or know how to fix it?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Nikolai5971,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may check if your Intern connection is stable, if you have insufficient connection it may affect the call quality in Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest to try these steps:</p>
<p>1. Disable your firewall and third party anti- virus (if there's any).</p>
<p>2. Uninstall Skype.</p>
<p>3. Press <strong>Windows key</strong> and <strong>R </strong>on your keyboard at the same time and type in
<strong>%appdata%</strong> click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Open the <strong>Skype </strong>folder and look for your Skype name, open it as well.</p>
<p>5. Delete <strong>config.xml&nbsp;</strong>folder.</p>
<p>6. Restart your computer then <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
re-install Skype</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to open an application that uses your audio device (sound recorder etc.) then record your voice and play it back, check if it's working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if the issue persist.</p>

    <title>Seems my Bluetooth does not exist&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mafifi1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Seems my Bluetooth does not exist&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a fitbit dongle that I am trying to use with windows 10. The problem is I am getting message telling me that my bluetooth is not on. I looked into turning it on but I am not finding "bluetooth" anywhere on my device. For example, on different forums,
 a common recommendation is to go to device manager and click on the bluetooth icon....etc. When I open device manager, there is no bluetooth option. Other recommendations relate to having buetooth devices. I do not have any devices, the only thing I have is
 the dongle and it is plugged into the computer. It used to work until I updated to windows 10. I am not sure what I could do. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately nothing changed when I tried to follow the suggested steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a toshiba satallite laptop. Part number: PSKAYA-00U001</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried connecting the dongle to a different port but that did not make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to my systems and click on devices, bluetooth does not come up as an option as you can see in the image. I've never checked on this before having this problem but in the past once I inserted my dongle, everything work.&nbsp;</p>

            This did not work either (sorry, I forgot to mention that I had already tried this). &nbsp;The driver is listed on the Canon website and being 8.1 compatible.
<div><br />
<div>Is there anywhere I can look to see logs of exactly what is happening during install so that I can try and narrow down the&nbsp;<span>"An error occurred while files were being copied." error?</span></div>

            <p>You are not alone as I have tried all these things also with out any luck.&nbsp; The IJ network scanner selector EX seems to have an issue with something in microsoft's programming that changed since&nbsp;windows 8.0.</p>
<p>The only way I have been able to fix this is a clean install of windows 7 and install the drivers.&nbsp; After everything is confirmed working do an upgrade to windows 8.1.&nbsp; This is a very impractical solution as do not want to do this to my new Surface Pro 2
 tablet but I need a solution also.&nbsp; I ran a diagnostic boot with all startup items&nbsp;disabled so now I have to look at what Microsoft is loading to maybe find the problem.&nbsp; Canon support has not been able to give an answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing I have found is either
 a problem with networking or the fact that canon is using net 4 and 8.1 uses net 4.5.&nbsp; Haven't gone far enough yet to know if that is correct or not.&nbsp; If I find an answer I will post here as from a web search a lot of other people are having this problem.&nbsp;
 I personally have it on 5 different computers so it is not a machine issue.</p>

            According to Canon after 2 hours the best they could say is something is blocking the install.&nbsp; Person I talked with installed it on windows 8.1 but not on a pro version 64 bit which is what all my computers use.&nbsp; I suggested she get her team to do a fresh
 install with 8.1 pro 64 bit and let me know if they could install it.&nbsp; I kind of doubt that they can.&nbsp; My network can see the scanner and give me all the details but Canon's programs and windows programs like paint can not find the scanner.&nbsp; Unit prints fine
 and all of the programs work fine if attached by usb.&nbsp; Not sure if this helps isolate what is happening but maybe it will.

            <p>After some more work I found my solution and have posted it on Canon site also.</p>
<p>I use Avast anti virus software and it was preventing the creation of the network bridge needed by the scanner selector.</p>
<p>The solution was a little different as turning off all features of Avast failed to resolve the issue.&nbsp; Uninstalling Avast also failed to help as Avast does not fully uninstall.</p>
<p>My solution was uninstall Avast</p>
<p>Install Avast</p>
<p>Uninstall Avast again (seems to completely uninstall at this point - this is when it sends you to Avast to tell them why you uninstalled it.&nbsp; Does not go there during the first uninstall)</p>
<p>Load your Canon drivers and software and test to confirm they work</p>
<p>Install Avast and check function again and everything should work</p>
<p>This has worked on 3 desktops, a laptop, and a Surface Pro 2 tablet all running Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>Can't confirm if other anti virus programs have the same issue but they might</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps</p>

<br />Those are the Sync Status for OneDrive or Google Drive backup.  See here:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-do-the-onedrive-icons-mean-11143026-8000-44f8-aaa9-67c985aa49b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-d...</a>

<br />
<br />To remove OneDrive Sync from Desktop, Documents or Pictures folders right click the OneDrive cloud icon in System Tray, choose settings, then AutoSave tab and change drop down menu for each to This PC only.  
<br />
<br />There is also a checkbox there for On Demand to save hard drive space by keeping files only in the cloud until downloaded. 
<br />
<br /> These may have been set by a recent Update without your knowledge.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            It may be that OneDrive is not running.  Type Onedrive in Start Search to open it, sign in if necessary so you have access to where it lives in the System Tray, can right click it's cloud icon to open Settings, then the AutoSave tab.

<p>Only thing i can find is in your profile - privacy settings - there are a number of privacy options such as child teen adult or custom , it looks like the child and teen settings stop you receiving and hearing others , other than friends, cant say for sure
 but you could try then change if no good . Other than that it will be only at the begining of each lobby doing a mute all (which quite frankly will be a pain- and awkward if trying to protect a child) therefore i am thinking the child setting should stop hearing
 randoms. </p>
<p>Let me know </p>

    <title>Missing the file sxstrace.exe, not sure how to fix - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> criticalrocket  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing the file sxstrace.exe, not sure how to fix</h2>
                    Hi there, I've made a small program with microsofts Visual Basic .net 2008.&nbsp;
<div>I then published the program, which gave me a setup file.
<div>
<div>I ran the setup and installed my program. It worked like it should.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then noticed that I had given my program the wrong name, so I removed the program from my computer, and changed the name in Visual Basic. Then I published it again, and ran the new setup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I installed the program, and got an error message saying the application couldn't start and that I should contact the maker of the application.. which is me :p&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I click on 'details' I get the following message. But as you might see, its in Dutch.. (and I've removed the path name because of some private names which are in it)&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://pastebin.com/UqAHxHin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pastebin.com/UqAHxHin</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I get a different error when I try to run the .exe in the Bin - Debug folder of the Visual Basic program I made.&nbsp;</div>
<div>That error says something about side-byside configuration not working.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then tried it some more times, removing it and publishing again, trying if it would run.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I restarted my computer, but it didn't solve it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;In the end I figured out it has something to do with the file sxstrace.exe, which I can't find on my computer. I don't know why it's not there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Maybe it got removed when I removed my program the first time?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I searched the internet, and appearently lots of people have this problem. But I've found lots of links to 'repair tools', and I trust none of them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I'm wondering if anyone here has experienced this problem, and/or knows how to fix it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you do, please tell me :) ~Chris&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Btw, I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. </div>
</div>

    <title>Rainbow Six Siege Forces Xbox to Shut Down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abbsbear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rainbow Six Siege Forces Xbox to Shut Down</h2>
                    Occasionally when I open the game, it will give me just a black screen but still play the background lobby music. To fix that problem, I'll force quit the game. When bringing it back up, however, a few seconds after I select it from the Home menu my entire
 Xbox shuts down, giving me the small bell sounds it would make if I were to manually shut it down. I feel as though it might have something to do with Operation Grim Sky, but I can't 100% verify that. If anyone else has the same problem, has the solution,
 or could direct me in the right direction to fix it, I would appreciate knowing!

    <title>My Xbox Live Account Is Broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> explicit username  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Xbox Live Account Is Broken</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been playing Xbox 360 on the same account for years, and everything worked smoothly up until recently (about a year or so ago). I've been noticing some issues with my overall Xbox Account. For instance, when I sign into Xbox.com with my Microsoft
 account, no matter what page I attempt to navigate to, it seems to redirect me here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/security/error-child-trying-to-access-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/security/error-child-trying-to-access-settings</a>&nbsp;and
 I'm not sure why. Prior to this I would receive errors such as "Oops, It Appears You Found A glitch in the System." or "That shouldn't have happened" and I'm starting to wonder if I have a serious problem on my hands. I can't download my profile to any console,
 the copy still existing from before I was experiencing this issue being the only way I can play games on Xbox 360, which concerns me as to how I would retrieve my data otherwise. In case you're wondering, I haven't gotten around to diagnosing the problem with
 my account until recently because I have been investing more time into pc gaming/development these days, and I have somewhat lost interest in console gaming. However that is irrelevant.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate if somebody can help me diagnose/resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>The redirect issue you get from viewing Xbox.com in a web browser could likely be fixed by clearing your cookies and cache (found in your web browser settings).</p>
<p>If you are having trouble downloading your profile to your Xbox 360 console, you may need to delete the corrupted profile already saved on your Xbox 360 storage source and/or clear the system cache.</p>
<p>Here is an article that might help, just follow the steps!: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/xbox-live/error-code-80070571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>My profile isn't corrupted. When I try to download my profile to my console using my Microsoft account password I get a message saying "That password didn't work" (It is indeed the correct password, however.) So I've been using app passwords, which by the
 way don't work either. I've contacted Xbox support several times, and nobody could help me. This is incredibly frustrating.

<h2>            buy a gift set for a friend from another country</h2>
                    <p>Could you help me? I have a little doubt about buying a game of ragalo for a friend, the problem is that he lives in another country and I want to send him a gift game but I do not know if only changing the region of the console can reach him or even then I will not be allowed to send him for the restrictions of microsoft.<br />An example, I live in Mexico and my friend in the United States and I want to buy a digital game as a gift, but the restructions say that it is from the same country, but if my friend changes the region of his console to Mexico he could receive it or even not Could it?<br />I would really appreciate it if you could help me.</p>

<h3> xemnas_869  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD error 0xc000007B</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - Auto-Restart</p>
<p>Alright, first I BSOD while play WoW. Don't remember the error as I usually get KMode_exception_not_handled errors at least once a day. Took the time to open up the computer with the appropriate precautions(grounded myself to tower). Didn't do much, use
 a can of air to blow away some dust, removed then replaced memory stick, made sure that everything(SATA ports, PCI slots, power slots) were plugged in properly. Put it back together and all that jazz turned it on and got
<u>Bug Check 0x32 Phase1_initialization_Failed</u>&nbsp;immediatly as it boots up. The automatic repair stuff pops up after restart and start running and says it can't fix it. I choose continue and it tries to boot up the OS and I get another BSOD. The problem is
 that the screen becomes scrambled so you can only really see the color and a few dozen random white pixels. I run through system restore (which doesn't work), then mem-check and hard-drive check. Both say that their fine. Then I try and run safe mode. I run
 both safe-mode and safe-mode with networking to be sure, but the same thing happened for both. The screen is no longer scrambled, but I get a BSOD immediately as well. This time the error message is 0xc000007B. I am at a complete loss what to do.<br />
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Background info:</div>
<div>It updated to 8.1 just fine a few days ago.</div>
<div>I have been getting BSOD at least once a day if I run the heavy hitting programs like WOW and LoL. The computer can idle for days and not get a BSOD.</div>
<div>I have no idea how to get the Dump files off of the hard-drive by using the command prompt.</div>
<div>I honestly don't know if it is software or hard-ware related.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Are you able to boot to the desktop or do you just get the BSOD errors on startup?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to boot the computer in Safe mode and disable the Automatic restart</p>
<p>- Press Windows key + R key to open RUN prompt.</p>
<p>- Type SYSDM.CPL and press enter/</p>
<p>- Click on the Advanced tab and then on Startup and recovery.</p>
<p>- Uncheck the option "Automatic restart"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide us the exact error message that you see on restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have sent you&nbsp; a private message asking for the Minidump files. Please follow the steps and provide us the minidump files so that we can analyze and find out what exactly is causing the BSOD errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            BSOD on startup was what was happening. On regular start-up the screen was scrambled. But on safe mode start-up it was fine, albeit still a BSOD. I formatted the hard-drive the OS was on and re-installed and updated it back to windows 8.1 on the same hard-drive.
<div>I started play World of Warcraft again with a few internet pages up, Spotify playing, and I was using the Skype app for windows 8. Got a kmode_exception_not_handled just like before the crash but it restarted just fine. I ran memtest86 a few hours ago
 to confirm a hunch, but unfortunately the test came up completely clean so I don't think its a memory problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Posted the link to the dump file in the main post.</div>

<p>I Ran Through All Those Steps... None Worked :C. They Were Designed For XP, But I Have Games Of A Similar Age That Run Fine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Was Also Looking Into Reinstalling The Secdrv.sys File For A More Robust Solution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any More Ideas About How To Fix This?</p>

<p>If running in compatibility mode did not work on some games it may be the security programs on the system, check to see if your antivirus-firewall may be blocking the exe from running.</p>

<p>Another thing is the OS may be blocking installation of some of the files needed because they could corrupt the system folder.</p>
<p>Say older directx or video or sound drivers.</p>
<p>Some games need to have nvidia's legacy physx&nbsp;</p>
<p>driver to run, even when using intel or amd gpu's</p>
