<h2>            What is the purpose for TMM &#40;Microsoft Transient Multi-Monitor Manager&#41; in the Task Scheduler&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I&nbsp;need some information&nbsp;regarding the&nbsp;purpose and&nbsp;use of a Task Scheduler application named TMM, or Microsoft Transient Multi-Monitor Manager, please.&nbsp; Judging by the name of this&nbsp;task, I would assume that it is necessary for this application&nbsp;to be&nbsp;running&nbsp;when&nbsp;more
 than one monitor is&nbsp;hooked up to a computer.&nbsp; Am I correct in this assumption?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I&nbsp;have only one computer, and there&nbsp;will never be more than&nbsp;one&nbsp;monitor hooked up to my computer,&nbsp;do I really need to have the&nbsp;Microsoft Transient Multi-Monitor Manager&nbsp;running all of the time?&nbsp; If this application does not need to be running in my
 computer, is it okay for&nbsp;TMM to be disabled?</p>

<h2>            Started with Black screen of death and cannot reinstall windows 7 now. Please HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Win 7 64 bit Home Premium was supposed to be already installed on my new PC purchase.&nbsp;Called their support and have rec'd ____ for help. anyway, I removed it from the box, plugged all neccesary cables in. Turned on the PC and it loaded up, showing the
 windows Icon and then went to black screen of death with only the mouse cursor. No Alt-Ctl Del option, nothing. SO I rebooted in safe mode with networking. That worked the 1st time, I was looking around on various websites for help. But then the pc froze up
 on me. I shutdown and restarted several minutes later. Nothing. I have tried reinistalling from the CD. It seemed to work, but it won't finish the installation after the final reboot and now I cannot get into safe mode either, it says I need to let the setup
 complete. Can someone please give me directions on how to reinstall the Windows so I can get up and running?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

<blockquote>Ok. I don't know how to format the drive. Can you explain that to me?</blockquote>
<br />
OK. Here we go.<br />
<br />
Clean Install from DVD (Added how to format the hard drive while installation).
<p>1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD into your computer's DVD-ROM drive, and restart the computer. Windows 7 Setup should start automatically. If Setup does not start automatically, ensure that your computer is configured to boot from the DVD drive in BIOS. (If you
 doesn't know how to check please reply without any hesitation)</p>
<p>2. You are asked to select regional options for the Windows 7 installation. Make your selections and click Next to continue.</p>
<p>3. In the next dialog box, you are prompted to start the installation. Click Install Now to begin the installation. This produces a screen that tells you that Setup is starting.</p>
<p>4. In the Software License Terms dialog box, ensure that you read and understand the End User Licensing Agreement (EULA). When you're ready, select the I Accept the License Terms option and click Next to continue.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;You can select only the Custom (Advanced) option to perform a clean fresh installtion of windows 7 on to you computer.
<strong>(Formatting the drive will remove the issues if you have any with the hard drive but also you will lose the data if you have it on your computer).</strong></p>
<p>6. In the Where Do You Want to Install Windows? dialog box, select the "Device options" option and then you can find some more options (like format, delete and&nbsp;new or create...)<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;Select a partition from the dialog box (If you have only one select that) and click on the option "Format" which you can find at the bottom of the dialog box. (If it gives any pop ups select YES&nbsp;and then it formats the&nbsp;hard drive partition).<br />
<br />
8. Now once again select the formatted partition, and&nbsp;when you're ready to proceed, click Next.</p>
<p>9. The Installing Windows dialog box appears and gives you an updated status of the&nbsp;installation process.</p>
<p>10. After some time, your computer restarts and the newly installed Windows 7 loads. Windows 7 resumes the installation process. Before the restart, a warning appears.</p>
<p>11. After the restart, you'll see a notification telling you that Windows 7 is preparing the new installation. Windows 7 moves back into a graphical display after a few minutes and tells you it's updating Registry settings and starting services, after which
 it lets you know it's completing the installation.</p>
<p>12. After completing the installation, Windows 7 asks you to provide a username and a computer name. After providing this information, click Next to continue.<br />
<br />
13. In the next dialog box, you are asked to supply a password for your user account (which you must reenter as a double-check) and a password hint to help you remember that string. After making your selections, click Next to continue.</p>
<p>14. In the Type Your Windows Product Key dialog box, enter the product key that came with your Windows 7 DVD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>15. In the Help Protect Your Computer and Improve Windows Automatically dialog box, you configure the base security for Windows 7. In most cases, you should select Use Recommended Settings. To make your selection, click it.</p>
<p>16. In the Review Your Time and Date Settings dialog box, set the date and time for your PC and the Day light savings for your country (if any) and click next.</p>
<p>17. Setup your Network type. This should try and connect to your Network.</p>
<p>18. Windows will then setup a password for your homegroup (similar to the Workgroup in Windows XP).<br />
<br />
19. This should finalize the settings and launch you straight into your desktop.<br />
<br />
20. There you go, your new Windows 7&nbsp;OS up and running. Have fun....<br />

<h2>            Is there a way to force a program that runs on the desktop to go back to the Start Screen upon exit instead of just sitting at the desktop&#63;</h2>
                    I have a number of programs that I use that go to the desktop to run. However when I exit them I find myself not back at the Start Screen, were I started them from but rather at an empty desktop. Is there some setting that will force a program on closing
 to send me back to the Start Screen. I really do find I&nbsp;prefer&nbsp;the Start Screen but am bummed out that most of my computer use requires an extra step to get back to it.

            I appreciate the reply but I am curious why something so obvious for the use of the new interface was not added, this effect of dumping to desktop after using a program feels kludgy. Was there no way to force the OS back into the Start Screen when the
 program ended?

            <p>I couldn't agree more.&nbsp; This is a problem.&nbsp; After I close a PDF or JPG using a native win 8 app, Win 8 takes me back to a BLANK Blue Screen when I have a win 8 app in the side margin.&nbsp; I have to click and gesture to get to the desktop.&nbsp; How does taking me
 to a blank screen help me? &nbsp;Here's a screen shot:</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give the user the option to take them back to the desktop or start menu.&nbsp; But a blank blue screen, is not helpful.&nbsp; For this reason, I have stopped using windows 8 native apps, and prefer traditional windows 7 applications, so I don't have to navigate back
 to the desktop after closing a file.&nbsp; </p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
I suspect&nbsp;you are being shown the Taskbar.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there was no Taskbar to show perhaps you would be shown the Start Screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. the W7 analog of what you are asking for is to see only the Start Menu after all Tasks in the Taskbar have been closed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know
 if&nbsp; Auto-hide &nbsp;is on the Taskbar will pop up then but I don't&nbsp;think it&nbsp;shows the Start Menu then too.&nbsp;&nbsp; So then you would have to do something to make the Start Menu show even though it might seem helpful to make it pop up automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another scenario would be not having any explorer.exe running at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you would only have the Desktop wallpaper to return to after closing the last open application window--no Desktop icons, no Taskbar and no Start Menu (Screen).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the analog
 that you would be expecting in this case would be for explorer.exe magically to start again automatically even though the user stopped it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In either scenario in W8 terms you are still "immersed" in the Desktop app.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it sounds like an enhancement request to me but who knows you might find there is some related option already there which could be tweaked?&nbsp;&nbsp; You could run ProcMon to try to
 check that hypothesis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>It would seem a simple enough fix. I mean if a program opens that goes to the desktop all that would need to happen is a pointer in the OS referencing what environment you were in when you opened the program and putting you back when you are done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason this disappoints me is that it is just sloppy programming. MS wants us to move to the Modern UI but then creates a setup that makes this cludgy. Even in the DOS days we had overlay systems that provided easy to use menus and these were able to
 run a DOS app and return to the menu on exit. Even Windows 3.1 could do this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think MS needs to look at this along with for go sake fixing the apps they put in for the start. For the love of god, you had a decent mail and calendar app and you ditched it for the junk that comes with Windows 8? Please do not get me started on the
 picture app, which is a JOKE compared to Live Photo Gallery. WHY do we have apps that are worse than the existing software that MS made?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 overall is a solid OS but it is marred by the cludgy OS interfacing with the desktop and a bunch of junk apps that make you want to use the desktop software.</p>

            <p>Unlike the Modern UI desktop can show more than one application in different windows. In order for an application to close the desktop and revert to the start menu it would have to know that no other applications are running. I suspect this would not be
 impossible programmatically but this would need to have all programs to also be aware of the Windows&nbsp;8 environment when they were originally written for earlier versions of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would make sense on RT where legacy programs&nbsp;cannot be run but not on 8/8 Pro.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the limitations MS puts on programs/app run from the Modern UI, I've found I prefer to pin some things to the Start screen that will launch to the Desktop and of course, Office 2013 apps launch from the Desktop forcing extra steps to get back to Start
 seems just sloppy.</p>

<h2>            audio problems with win 7 ultimate, Gateway P6860FX laptop</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Gateway P6860FX laptop computer. under Vista 64 bit the audio worked great! i upgraded to Win 7 ultimate a few months ago and the only major problem i have is with the sound!! after installig win 7 the audio was half it's volume and the pop up controls
 didn't work. I tried reinstalling the older vista drivers and got the controls to work BUT, i may have sound for a few boot ups and then, for no reason at all, i get a speaker icon with a red X over it, as I have right now!! the laptop has IDT audio hardware
 and I have searched for a win 64 bit version with no luck. i just tried installing a version of vista 64 that was newer than what I have, half way throught the install the audio started working. then it reboot and told me it wasn't successful??? this is driving
 me nuts and I would greatly appreciate some help!!</p>
<p>thank you,</p>

<div>Hi Ronezed,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. When you see the speaker icon with red X, is there no souund in your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In most cases, this behavior is temporary and the red 'X' will disappear when:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Windows 7 has finished booting to the desktop and hard drive activity has decreased.<br />
- The first time the user clicks on the speaker icon to change the audio playback volume level.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>d. Under General tab, check for the status of the device under Device status.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Does it show any error message/code associated with device? If yes, let us know the exact error message.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If there is no sound at all, you may uninstall the audio drivers completely and place a check mark on "<strong>Delete driver software for this device</strong> " while uninstalling it from device manager and then install the drivers in<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 Vista Service Pack 2 compatibility mode</a> .</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type Device Manager and hit Enter.</div>
<div>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the device manager select Sound, video and game controllers and expand the same.</div>
<div>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highlight the driver, right-click and select&nbsp; Uninstall. (<strong>Delete driver software for this device)</strong></div>
<div>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer, if prompted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            rundll32 in win7 wont terminate after a program loads.</h2>
                    i have a bunch of old games and softare i use on my acer travilmate 4200 laptop running win 7. If i load programs like zune soft and some games the system will get laggy and unusable without a reboot. i found out that when you first start an app the rundll32
 is first started to initiat the program and uses up to 84 percent cpu utilasation. i have gotten around this by firying task manager a terminating manualy when the program is loaded past a certain threshould but i dont want to have to keep doing this and would
 like a perminate fix.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
rundll32.exe application is used to launch functionality stored in shared .dll files. This executable is a valid part of Windows, and normally shouldn’t be a threat.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> The valid process is normally located at \Windows\System32\rundll32.exe, but sometimes spyware uses the same filename and runs from a different directory in order to disguise itself. If you think you have a problem, you should always
 run a scan to be sure.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would strongly recommend you to run&nbsp;an<strong>online&nbsp;Virus Scan.</strong></div>
<div>Sometimes the installed security program might not be just enough. I also recommend&nbsp; you to update your security software regularly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Follow the link below to run the free online scan:<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool.</div>

<h2>            &#39;Access is denied&#39; Error&#58; Shared file&#47;folder</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, frustration is setting in here. I have a home network with 2 machines and an AT&amp;T 2Wire Gateway (it's a 2701HG-B if that matters). My machine is connected directly (via ethernet cable), the other machine is connected wirelessly. Both machines can access
 the internet with only the occasional hiccup.&nbsp;I'd like to be able to share files between the machines, but when I set up a shared folder on one, any attempt to copy or create a file from the other&nbsp;machine (in/into the shared folder)&nbsp;results in the 'Access
 is denied' error message. Both machines are running XP Home.</p>
<p>I found a 'Fix It' file at help &amp; support, but running it on both machines did nothing. What am I missing?&nbsp;I read a thread that seemed related, but the advice was confusing to my feeble old brain.</p>

            <span>For XP, start by running the Network Setup Wizard on all machines (see caveat in Item A below).<br />
<br />
Problems sharing files between computers on a network are generally caused by 1) a misconfigured firewall or overlooked firewall (including a stateful firewall in a VPN); or 2) inadvertently running two firewalls such as the built-in Windows Firewall and a
 third-party firewall; and/or 3) not having identical user accounts and passwords on all Workgroup machines; 4) trying to create shares where the operating system does not permit it.<br />
<br />
A. Configure firewalls on all machines to allow the Local Area Network (LAN) traffic as trusted. With Windows Firewall, this means allowing File/Printer Sharing on the Exceptions tab. Normally running the Network Setup Wizard on XP will take care of this for
 those machines. If you aren't running a third-party firewall or have an antivirus/security program with its own firewall component, then you're fine.&nbsp; With third-party firewalls,&nbsp;I usually configure the LAN allowance with an IP range. Ex. would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.254.
 Obviously you would substitute your correct subnet. Refer to any third party security program's Help or user forums for how to properly configure its firewall. Do not run more than one firewall.
<br />
<br />
B. For ease of organization, put all computers in the same Workgroup. This is done from the System applet in Control Panel, Computer Name tab.<br />
<br />
C. Create matching user accounts and passwords on all machines. You do not need to be logged into the same account on all machines and the passwords assigned to each user account can be different; the accounts/passwords just need to exist and match on all machines.

http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Autologon.htm</a> <br />
<br />
D. If one or more of the computers is XP Pro or Media Center, turn off Simple File Sharing (Folder Options&gt;View tab).<br />
<br />
E. Create shares as desired. XP Home does not permit sharing of users' home directories or Program Files, but you can share folders inside those directories. A better choice is to simply use the Shared Documents folder.

<h2>            Accidently turned computer off while installing an update</h2>
                    So I accidently turned my computer off when it was updating. I didn't realize it until now. I can't do anything on the computer. All it displays is a white screen with black spots on it. Is my computer physically broken? Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;

            Hi WIlls, your PC is not physically broken, your actions have just caused the Update to become corrupt . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

            When I open the laptop, it never shows the windows logo. It immediately. Shoes the white background with black spots that I described before. I tried to hold the power button for the 5-10 seconds, but every time I did it, which was about 5 times total
 to be safe, it came up with the same screen.

            OK, do you have Windows Installation Media, you can get into the Repair Environment using that . . .
<br />
<br />Boot your system from the Installation Media and click "Repair this Computer' instead of installing Windows 10
<br />
<br />The Repair will fail, but you can then click 'Advanced Options to get into the Recovery Environment . . .

            This happened to me yesterday evening. What I did was power down, wait 10 seconds, start it again and just kept waiting. Wait at least 1 hour to see if it boots to the sign in screen.
<br />
<br />If not, then do the following:

<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<h2>            Dell Inspiron 13 5000 5368 problems turning on after installing Anniversary update &#40;1607&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Dell Inspiron 13 5000 5368 2 in 1 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An issue developed after I installed the Anniversary update 1607.</p>
<p>I shut down the computer and it sits all night with the charger adapter plugged in, so its charged full.</p>
<p>When I push the power button as normal, nothing happens--it will not power up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow after a few minutes of trying to press the power on...it will finally power up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have wondered if the Fast startup is hanging up something when it shuts down, or its Just a HARDWARE issue.</p>
<p>Once it was on I tried to reset the computer and it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
seemed</span> to resolve the issue, But it has happened again---I also Upgraded to the Windows pro version since I owned a pro license...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched online...The only posts were related to DISCHARGING STATIC by removing battery and holding the power button 30 seconds.....Well you can't remove the battery on this unit without opening it up!!</p>
<p>Not convenient!!---besides my other dell 13z laptop NEVER had this issue--even after the update to 1607.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell support was telling me that it is an issue with the New 1607 update and that I should wait until a patch comes out</p>
<p>before allowing it to do more&nbsp;updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe they were relating to the bulletin that said that some partitions will be missing after</p>
<p>the update....this is weird. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? I may return the computer before my 30 days is up if they cannot come up with something better than discharging static.....</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can understand that must make you feel upset and we will work toward fixing this situation for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try performing a startup repair using an installation media and check if it helps. Startup Repair is a Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer
 for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps given below:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On a working PC, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>Download the media creation tool and then run it. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span>Create installation media for another PC</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit). </p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select <span>Finish</span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<span>Next</span>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span>Repair your computer</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Choose an option</span> screen, select <span>Troubleshoot &gt;</span><span>Advanced options</span> &gt;<span>Startup repair</span></p>

            Hi TJ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Download and install the card's driver from the maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />If problems go into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  to uninstall the Device driver including any software package noted.  Then install the driver from it's extracted download.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            TJ, Is the card still within a year of purchase so you can contact the maker's Support for help or possible RMA?  If so I'd do that now before it runs out so any replacement also gets tested.
<br />
<br />If not then I'd try another Card to compare.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This issue could occur due to incompatible, outdated or corrupted device drivers. You can also check if detaching all other peripheral devices except for keyboard and mouse works out the issue. The issue (black screen) you’re

            <p>It is an Acer Aspire 4739 Model: ZQH</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the problem fixed, but i have another problem, the Windows start bar and menu does not work, and there are no windows 10 apps, it like all the apps were wiped off the system, and the only things that work are the windows 7 programs and anything external
 like internet browsers, what to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer boots up fine like windows 10, after i logo in there is aprox 2 minutes of black screen and cursor until i get the home page, and the system behaves like win 7 with a not functioning win10 start bar. Nun of the win 10 apps are visible or can
 be found. That is as best i can describe this new problem</p>

            It might be too old to run on your computer.
<br />
<br />Option 1: try compatibility mode:
<br />
<br />The first thing you need to do is point where the setup files are located. If you are installing from a thumb drive or CD/DVD. Launch File Explorer (Windows key + E) and open the location where the setup files are stored.
<br />
<br />Right click the setup file for the program, this can be designated as setup.exe or something similar. Click Troubleshoot Compatibility
<br />
<br />This will launch the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter wizard which will check for issues.
<br />
<br />Select the option “Troubleshoot program”
<br />
<br />Depending on the problems you are experiencing when attempting to install or use the software, check off the problems. In my case:
<br />
<br />    ‘The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won’t install or run now’
<br />    The program requires additional permissions.
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Select a version of Windows the program is known to work in. I notice the program works great in Windows Vista (with Service Pack 2), so I will select that option. Click Next
<br />
<br />Proceed to run the through the programs setup routine by clicking Test the program….
<br />
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to install the program as you normally would.
<br />
<br />If all is successful, click the option at the end of the wizard ‘Yes, save these settings for this program’
<br />
<br />Wait while your settings for the program are saved.
<br />
<br />Click Close. Try launching the program.
<br />
<br />OPTION 2: If that does not work, then you will need to consider installing in virtual machine under a compatible version of Windows such as Windows XP.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reinstall 7 or 10, but not both.</p>
<p>So it is your choice which path you take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 7:</strong></p>
<p>
You can contact&nbsp;HP and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.
</p><p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can also borrow the exact same Retail Windows 7 Edition&nbsp;DVD and use your Product Key to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Or you can use this for preinstalled or Retail Licenses</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the correct ISO file and make your own disk and use the Product Key that is on the COA Sticker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And&nbsp;here are&nbsp;instructions on how to burn&nbsp;ISO images to&nbsp;disk:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then do a clean install:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1649-clean-install-windows-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1649-clean-install-windows-7-a.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The COA sticker, which has the Product Key on it,&nbsp;is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>With a Desktop it is either on the side, rear or top of the Computer Case.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fgsPE6.gif" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Using the downloaded ISO file Method may require phone Activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does require phone Activation, do not follow the <em>Auto Prompts</em>, but hold on for a real person to explain to as to what&nbsp;has been&nbsp;done for re-installation purposes</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Sleep Writing MASSIVE amounts of data to SSD &#40;100GB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikkoelite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Sleep Writing MASSIVE amounts of data to SSD &#40;100GB every minute&#41;</h2>
                    Hello.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a HUGE problem regarding Windows 7 and it's "sleep" mode.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whenever my computer goes to sleep (accidently happened today) MASSIVE amounts of data are written to my harddrive (SSD).</div>
<div>Why is this happening? Today my computer was accidently in sleep mode for 30minutes, and 2976GB WAS WRITTEN! Yes you heard it right, almost 3TB was written in this short amount of time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is happening? Why is it like this? I know it's the sleep function causing this because it has happened two times before, and it stops writing this data when I restart my PC, and only happens when it goes to sleep.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can see how much data has been written to my SSD thanks to a program named "SSD LIFE" which shows how much data has been written and so on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, is this a bug or what? I don't want my SSD to die on me within a month only because sleep function writes 100GB of data/minute to my SSD.</div>
<div>What is this data being written? What data can be so huge?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance hope you can help me out, this is a big issue for me.</div>
<div><br />

<br />
<div>Well that's what's strange! If my computer have been to sleep and I recover it from it's sleep mode, hundreds and even thousands of gigabytes have been written, but where??? There are no traces. Just like it's getting written and then erased at the same
 time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Intel Toolbox also states host-writes as 4 TERRABYTES so it's not SSD-Life that's faulty.</div>

            <p>&nbsp;I would look at the SSD drive to see what files are there.&nbsp; The statistic you're reporting doesn't say which file(s) are being written to.&nbsp; Could it be a page file?&nbsp; That would seem more likely.&nbsp; If so, you can move the paging file to another drive if you
 wish via the System applet of the Control Panel.&nbsp; My understanding of sleep mode is that it keeps everything in RAM rather than writing it to a file.&nbsp; Hibernate writes to an external file I know, but I didn't think sleep mode does.&nbsp; If you have a desktop PC
 (you didn't say), you may have hybird mode and&nbsp;wnat to change it to just sleep without writing to the hard drive.&nbsp; Here's what the Windows 7 Help and Support says about these.</p>
<p>
<b>What's the difference between sleep, hibernate, and hybrid sleep?</b></p>
<p>Sleep is a power-saving state that allows a computer to quickly resume full-power operation (typically within several seconds) when you want to start working again. Putting your computer into the
 sleep state is like pausing a DVD player—the computer immediately stops what it’s doing and is ready to start again when you want to resume working.</p>
<p>Hibernation is a power-saving state designed primarily for laptops. While sleep puts your work and settings in
memory and draws a small amount of power, hibernation puts your open documents and programs on your
hard disk, and then turns off your computer. Of all the power-saving states in Windows, hibernation uses the least amount of power. On a laptop, use hibernation when you know that you won't use your laptop for an extended period and won't have
 an opportunity to charge the battery during that time.</p>
<p>Hybrid sleep is designed primarily for desktop computers. Hybrid sleep is a combination of sleep and hibernate—it puts any open documents and programs in memory and on your hard disk, and then puts
 your computer into a low-power state so that you can quickly resume your work. That way, if a power failure occurs, Windows can restore your work from your hard disk. When hybrid sleep is turned on, putting your computer into sleep automatically puts your
 computer into hybrid sleep. Hybrid sleep is typically turned on by default on desktop computers.</p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p>&nbsp; I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<br />
<div>Thank you for the information provided.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm almost sure it's sleep because in my power options it was like "Put computer to sleep: after 30minutes" and that's why it fell asleep. That's the sleep function right? I've also (the two times before this time) pressed Sleep (not hibernation) and the
 same problem occured.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a desktop PC, not a laptop :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have been in live chat with Intel for the last hour and he suggested me to possibly do a RMA of the SSD because some of the SMART values had strange numbers and some could not be read.</div>
<div>But he might be wrong, who knows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If anyone else has anything about this please post, thanks</div>

            If you can't figure out what to do tell us more about your system and maybe we can look up the drivers for you.<br />
<br />
I don't think I would let Windows Update decide what sound drivers you need (or any drivers).&nbsp; It is usually best to get them directly from the manufacturers WWW site.&nbsp; Here is a good place to begin your search:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.analog.com/en/content/soundmax_drivers_information/fca.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.analog.com/en/content/soundmax_drivers_information/fca.html</a><br />
<br />
If the MS Answers would prompt for a little system information when a new question is asked, you would be done by now.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
Now provide a few more details:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
For audio driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.<br />
<br />
