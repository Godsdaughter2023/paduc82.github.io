    <title>Windows 7 and 8.1 display scaling on high DPI settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;o_o&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 and 8.1 display scaling on high DPI settings</h2>
                    <p>I have both my win 7 and 8.1 scaled (zoomed) to 125%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In win 7, some application did not get zoomed. I didn't really notice it or care about it until I got win 8.1 and set it to 125%. Those applications that were not zoomed in win 7 are now kind of "stretched" and blurry in 8.1, which I dont like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround would be to open up the properties for these blurry applicaitons and check the "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings" option. But in win 7 I did not have to do such thing. Can I make win 8.1 do the same and automatically disable scaling
 for applications that doesn't work well with the zooming feature?</p>

    <title>UAC not blocking installation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            UAC not blocking installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering why UAC will allow a program to be installed on my computer, even though I selected 'no' on the prompt 'Do you want to allow this program to make changes to your PC?'. I am asking, because I do not want my son to be able to install programs
 without our permission, yet if he just selects 'no' in the prompt, the new browser is installed anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello CG_567,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I had this problem with my own computer. From what I've known, some browsers (Including Google Chrome) were designed not to require administrative privileges to install. However, you may try to restrict the use of Windows Installer via Group Policy and check
 if it will work. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Start</strong> or <strong>Windows</strong> icon and type&nbsp;<strong>gpedit.msc&nbsp;</strong>and hit
<strong>Enter</strong> to open the <strong>Group Policy Editor.</strong></li><li>Go to <strong>Computer configurations &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Installer</strong>.</li><li>Double-click the&nbsp;<strong>Turn off Windows Installer</strong>.</li><li>On the next window, choose&nbsp;<strong>Enabled,</strong>&nbsp;hit <strong>Apply</strong>, then<strong>&nbsp;OK</strong><strong>.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>By enabling this, you can prevent users from installing software in the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 is forcing me to update to Windows 8.1, help please</h2>
                    I don't want to update to Windows 8.1, My Windows 8 suits me fine but I recently received a message that shows the option of updating to Windows 8.1 now or in 4 hours. I could not choose remind me later or exit out of it, so I turned off my laptop and
 turned it back on. The message did pop up again on my laptop a while after I turned it back on. I desperately need help on how to get rid of it without choosing to download it. Thanks<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/048879ac-fc9a-4d26-b1e0-567fba252bcf" />

<p>Have you tried to check your volume control? Sometimes for some odd reason Windows can lower volume for some applications. I haven't had a chance to install Windows 8 quite yet, but if you know where to go to get to the volume control portion of the OS check
 the volume mixer for Xbox Music and see if the volume bar is all the way up.</p>

<p>That's not particularly what I was getting at. See a sample of Windows 7 (like I said, not quite sure if this is the same in 8).<br />

<br />
Notice how you can adjust certain volume levels for certain applications/devices. That's what I was asking you to check out, but if you've already checked that out not quite sure what the issue could be. I'm sure someone will come around that is better able
 to assist you in regards to this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hmm, that's very funky. &nbsp;So even the volume control from within the app will make noise? &nbsp;Have you tried playing videos as well? &nbsp;Same deal?</p>
<p>I'm curious about the library itself. &nbsp;Were these songs you previously owned, or purchased through the marketplace. &nbsp;What if you try to play the files with another program?</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with us!</p>

<p>Yes, I was talking about the volume control from within the app, and yes it does make noise. The songs I am trying to play are songs previously owned, and those files play with programs like iTunes and VLC. The Video app doesn't play sound for videos, either.
 Apps like iHeartRadio play music, however.</p>

<h2>            Fable 2 goty disk look here amd get your answer</h2>
                    
<p>The disk game that contains the dlcs aren't showing up at all from the xbox one version. It does when using a xbox 360. From xbox one using any copy of fable 2 from a dvd will install 8.45 gigabites. Buying the digatal game will install 8.45 gig. When you
 download the dlcs it would come up as 8.5 gigs. What I gather about B/C a copy of a dvd game only proves you have the license of the game. Then would install the digital game. That's why the dlcs won't work for your save. Of you think i'm wrong try a fresh
 game and see from the xbox one, no dlcs.</p>
<p>Just incase xbox rep thinks the box has a dlc code or two dvd.</p>
<p>fable 2 goty has dlc's preloaded in the dvd there isn't another dvd</p>

<p>Apologies for the delay! To clarify, are you able to install Fable II but not the DLC?</p>
<p>Have you checked the 'Ready to install' section of Fable II on your Xbox One console to see if the DLC's show up there? To check this, highlight the Fable II game tile in 'My games &amp; apps', press the menu button, and then select 'Manage game'.</p>

<p>Ok I will make this clear</p>
<p>I have installed the game and only saw free dlc downloads I tried out couple years back. But not the premium dlcs</p>
<p>You can't install fable 2 offline or no connection. </p>
<p>The digital fable 2 download only works when using the dvd license of the game.</p>
<p>The dlcs are free and premium. The fable 2 goty has the premium content preloaded on the dvd game. The digital game doesn't have preloaded premium dlcs.</p>
<p>I have already explain before please don't have me explain again. You should try out fable 2 goty for the xbox one. You even should know that all xbox 360 games dvd's don't install to the xbox 0ne. You get only get the digital copy.</p>

<p>Kristine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a clean boot per Ramon Imp's recommendations - the error persisted. &nbsp;The post he linked was also about using clean-booting to identify problematic software. &nbsp;Given that the problem still occurs in safe mode, i think this is a windows issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update installed smoothly, but i remember getting a bluescreen error once i started using the computer immediately after. &nbsp;I can't recall what i was doing at that time. &nbsp;I believe i was closing my first Runtime Error window after trying to open the file
 explorer. &nbsp;I haven't had any more bluescreens since the reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error window says:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><em>Runtime Error!</em></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><em>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.</em></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Visual C++ redistributable but all that did was force an AutoCAD re-install. &nbsp;The error with explorer.exe continued before and after the re-install of AutoCAD.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The system file checker did not find any integrity violations.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">No errors were found on the hard drive (i only have 1 in this computer).</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that Windows still recognizes the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages that you originally had on the system. The packages may not be sitting well with Creators Update, thus resulting to the error. Before proceeding with the last suggestion
 you were given, we'd like to verify some things. Kindly answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>After initially uninstalling the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages, have you checked if any parts of the packages remained on the list of programs in Programs and Features?</li><li>Did you get any errors when you were uninstalling or reinstalling the packages?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you happen to have a program that can remove all traces of apps or services that you add on the computer, you can use it to check for remnants of the packages when you uninstall your version of Visual C++ Redistributable Packages. Once you have ensured
 that no traces of the packages remain, download the correct version of Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for your PC again and see if the error will no longer come up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's where you can <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download the latest Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Windows computers</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update so we can move forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling the Visual C++ packages, i did not see them any more in the Task Manager, but i did not use any third-party software to "remove all traces". &nbsp;I didn't get any errors when i removed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just noticed the same behaviour on all systems in our office, but confirmed that the error only occurs when i click the File Explorer icon in the start menu. &nbsp;When i access the File Explorer folder from my taskbar, i don't get the error. A potential problem
 with the start menu or some sort of conflict with AutoCAD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to to uninstall all the Visual C++ distributables again as it requires a reinstall of AutoCAD and i've got work to do. &nbsp;I've spent too much time dealing with this already.</p>

</p><p>Sure it is possible, and in fact preferred.&nbsp; You can create a second user in the user control panel using the administrator account (which is the first one you put on the computer.&nbsp; To get to the user control panel use the win key +"X"&gt;control panel&gt;user
 accounts&gt;manage another account&gt;.&nbsp; Add a new user. It should look something like this.&nbsp; BTW you may have to install some of the software for the new user account</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I started creating a new user account but it was recommended that my wife should create a Microsoft account first.</p>
<p>I managed to find&nbsp;the "Create an&nbsp;Account" page asking for name, dob, gender etc but the page wouldn't allow me to enter a password. I remember I had the same problem when I set up my Microsoft account but I cant remember how I overcame it. How do I set up
 the Microsoft account?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Insurgency... xbox one&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been watching a lot of this on YouTube... it's seems like it's PC only... could this ever come to xbox one?? &nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a FPS without all the over-the-top BS in games like cod, bf4 and titanfall.. I'm not saying those are bad games because I absolutely love battlefield, and titanfall sends a lot of fun, &nbsp;but this insurgency game, seems a lot slower paced and more realistic
 and basically looks awesome..... &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update... 15 minute warning and no rescheduling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nebraskaguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update... 15 minute warning and no rescheduling</h2>
                    <p>I can understand needing updates to fix bugs and improve security, but the latest update that occurred for me on 8-11-2016 had a very Orwellian feel to it.</p>
<p>I was working on data entry for my business with less than 1/2 hour more before I was done, and a windows popup appeared stating that I could update now or 15 minutes from now (no "x") which Microsoft said looked like a good time.&nbsp; This occurred at 2:00
 PM on Thursday.&nbsp; Not exactly a convenient time for a shutdown on the computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Just in case, I logged out of the database and saved the work.&nbsp; I then attempted to reschedule but that option was grayed out allowing only "restart now" or to continue with the 15 minute countdown.&nbsp; At 2:15 it started and 1 hour and 5 minutes later it finally
 finished but with only the upper left of my desktop showing.&nbsp; I had to hold the power button then come out of standby to get the full screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Update history states "no updates have been installed yet".&nbsp; I purchased this laptop on 9-15 and as anyone with windows 10 can attest to, it updates itself automatically, quite frequently and mostly without the user being aware of it.&nbsp; In fact, it auto updated
 (on powering down) about 3 times in the last 2 or 3 weeks.</p>
<p>I checked my active hours setting and that was 8am-5pm with the optional restart at 8:54pm (kind of an arbitrary time...).&nbsp; So the restart didn't adhere to anything but Microsoft's whim.
</p>
<p>After I got full screen, Webroot (the virus protection that came with my laptop) had a popup which stated that a program "C:\WINDOWS\System32\Drvinst.exe" was trying to boot and it would automatically block in 120 seconds. When I tried to manually block
 it, it would just reappear.&nbsp; Sources says it is not core windows, not necessary, and is 72% dangerous.&nbsp; It then went away and I couldn't find the file anywhere.</p>
<p>Is there any way to prevent these unscheduled restarts (that directly affects my work) from happening (particularly in the midst of a work day and without any choice whatsoever on schedule)?&nbsp; Do I need to be concerned about the Drvinst.exe?</p>
<p>I know Microsoft is taking a very aggressive approaches to compensate for some floundering sectors but when it affects my work then I believe they are stepping over the line.&nbsp; My trust level in Microsoft is very low and I find myself avoiding their products
 in general which I know I'm inadvertently bypassing some good products because of these bad practices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Maybe this question could be answered:&nbsp; Now that I've had it forced on me with only a 15 minute warning during a work day and no rescheduling and not being made aware of the 10 day rollback period, how do I actually roll it back?<br />

    <title>Windows 10 1803 Bluetooth headset disconnect issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jose5678  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1803 Bluetooth headset disconnect issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have an issue to report:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Bluetooth headset that supports both high quality audio,&nbsp; and low quality audio + mic. (In the sounds menu, it shows up with a"Headphones" entry and "Headset" entry, the device name is "Shure BT1").</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous version of Windows, I had the Headset entry in the sounds menu marked as "Disabled", to avoid VoIP programs from trying to use the Headset functionality (I have a separate mic that I prefer using).</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the new 1803 update, as soon as the Bluetooth headphones connect, they turn off. If I re-enable the Headset entry and then connect the Bluetooth headphones they work correctly as expected. At this point, disabling the Headset entry again does not turn
 off the Bluetooth headphones again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, if the Headset entry is disabled when Bluetooth headphones first try to connect, they turn off. If the Headset entry is enabled, they connect successfully, and the Headset entry can then be disabled without problems.</p>
<p><br />

<p>The error code 0x80070005 is also described as <strong>ACCESS DENIED </strong>
(<span>you do not have permission to install updates.)</span></p>
<p><span>Please check that you have logged on an account with administrative privileges.</span></p>
<p>Please follow these instructions if you are encountering this error code when checking or installing updates via Windows Udpate.&nbsp;<strong>The following is only applicable to Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
</strong>1. Download AccessChk (Sysinternals).&nbsp; This tool allows you to evaluate the access level of specific users or groups of resources including files, directories, Registry keys, global objects and Windows services.&nbsp; Here's the link to download the tool:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb664922.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb664922.aspx</a><br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;Save the zip file on your desktop, and extract the file:<br />
- Right click on the file, and select Extract All...<br />
- Click Next when prompted for the Destination.<br />
<br />
As a result, you should see a folder called AccessChk&nbsp; on your desktop.<br />
<br />
3. Open the folder AccessChk&nbsp; <br />
<br />
4. Hold the shift-key and right click in the window.&nbsp; Select "Open Command Prompt Here"<br />
<br />
5. A command prompt window should open with a similar prompt:<br />
C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt;\Desktop\accesschk&gt;<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp; Type the following command, and press Enter:<br />
accesschk.exe -s -n "nt service\trustedinstaller" -k "hklm\software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing" &gt;accesskchk.txt<br />
Tip: You should be able to copy and paste the command into the command prompt.<br />
<br />
7. Close the Command Prompt Window.&nbsp; Open the Accesschk folder on yoru desktop (if it has been closed).<br />
<br />
8. Double click on Accesschk.txt (the text file), this should open Notepad.<br />
<br />
If this does not help, <br />
<br />
1. Please download the subinacl.msi file from the following link and save the installation patch onto the Desktop:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en#AffinityDownloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en#AffinityDownloads</a><br />
SubInACL (SubInACL.exe)<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            <p><span>Hi Yassine,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your description I can understand that you get an error message while performing system restore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Before we proceed with the troubleshooting steps, please answer the questions given below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you able to run Windows updates?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform the methods given below, and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Check if the Volume shadow Copy is Started.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press Windows Key + R</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type <strong>Services.msc</strong>, hit<strong> Enter</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure that the
<strong>Volume Shadow Copy</strong> Service is<strong> Running</strong> and set on
<strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If the Status of <strong>
System Restore</strong> Service is not <strong>Started</strong>, <strong>Start</strong> it. Also set it on Automatic if it is not.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: <span>Perform Clean Boot.</span></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important: Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the <b>â€˜Windows + Râ€™</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the <b>â€˜Runâ€™</b> windows type
<b>â€™MSCONFIGâ€™</b> and click <b>â€˜Okâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the <b>â€˜Generalâ€™</b> tab, click the
<b>â€˜Normal Startupâ€™</b> option, and then click <b>â€˜OKâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>â€˜Restartâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Disable third-party Security Software</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On your Computer screen Task Bar next to System Clock..</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>You will see the third-party Security Software Icon.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on the third-party Security Software Icon, you will see a pop up.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In that pop and select the option to disable, click on it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now the third-party Security Software will be disabled. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: Run a system file checker scan</span></b><span> and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following steps to run SFC scan:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.<br />
b) Click on â€˜Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click â€˜Yesâ€™ if it prompts for permission.<br />
c) In the command prompt type in the following command: â€˜<b>sfc /scannowâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps! If you need further assistance, please feel free to post. We are here to help you.</span></p>

    <title>&#34;File as Volume Driver&#34; and &#34;Volume Manager&#34; keep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joef9000  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;File as Volume Driver&#34; and &#34;Volume Manager&#34; keep installing</h2>
                    <p>Running Win 7 Starter with all of the latest updates on an Acer Aspire. Everytime I Boot and/or Reboot&nbsp;whether in Normal mode or SAFE Mode, I keep getting a messsage stating these 2 programs have been sucessfully installed and then am told I must Re-Boot.
 After numerous re-boots, the same message keeps appearing.</p>
<p>I have tried going back several restore points with no success. Searched the Forum for this problem and found one posted in 2010. Tried the recommended 'fix' and still have the problem.</p>
<p>I can just select "Restart Later" but that does not fix the problem.</p>
<p>Any ideas, tips, solutions would be most welcome.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tips. I will try them all. A 1st quick look thru the driver list did not reveal these 2 files. I will have more time tomorrow and I will definitely try all of your recommendations.</p>
<p>What do you think of the idea that I just go into the System Folders and delete these files?</p>

    <title>Not able to delete the local printer port on my system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raghava_216  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to delete the local printer port on my system</h2>
                    Hi !
<div><br />
<div>I wanted to use my colleague's printer(HP Laserjet P2015d), which does not have a LAN port. But, our PCs are connected to a LAN. Hence, I created a local port on my system to access that printer. I have been using that printer since last 15-20 days. I
 have Windows 7 Professional 64 bit running on my system whereas my colleague has Windows XP 32-bit.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not know what happened but since yesterday I am not able to print the documents using that printer. After I give the document for print, I check the status and it says "Error-Printing" in the tray icon of the printer. I then removed the printer from
 control panel and added it back with the same existing local port. It worked once, but the problem has come back again.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought of deleting the local port itself and adding it back.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then, I tried to delete the local port by selecting that printer-&gt; Printer Server Properties -&gt; Ports tab -&gt; delete port.. But the local port under question is not getting deleted. It throws a message "The requested resource is in use".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then, I repeated the above procedure after stopping the spool service and restarting it again. But, it just did not work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then, changed the printer driver but the problem is not solved yet. Lastly, I asked my colleague to check if the printer is working by giving a print from his system. It worked that way. I then, asked him to disable the sharing of printer and re-enable
 it. Yet, the problem was not solved.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I request you to give me guidance on how to solve this issue.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

                    <p>I have made numerous steps to update the Acer Aspire &nbsp;(originally a Vista computer then upgraded to Win 7 Home Premium SP1)</p>
<p>I have followed all the advice given in various locations including:</p>
<p>-clearing Windows&gt;Software Distribution&gt;Downloads directory</p>
<p>-chkdsk /f</p>
<p>-removing any USB devices other than keyboard and wireless mouse</p>
<p>-updating Nvidia driver (not needed as it was up to date)</p>
<p>-originally most common error code on attempting install was 80240020</p>
<p>
</p><p>ERROR CODE now is as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>0xC1900101-0x2000A The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during PREPARE_FIRST_BOOT operation</p>
<p>

    <title>Missing folders after an update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickolas brightbill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing folders after an update.</h2>
                    <p>So, yesterday I installed an update. As soon as the update finished, I got on my computer normally right? Typed in my password..Logged on...But...then its as if my personalization on my computer never existed. My desktop background is default to be Kylo
 Ren (I have a star wars themed computer from my B-Day). And the normal default apps are there. I soon discovered that all my folders are still here. But just not on my desktop. So, I navigated to my Users folder and clicked on my profile/user folder. I then
 clicked on desktop and dragged my folders onto my desktop. I also found my desktop background again! But, then the day after. (Which is now). I come on and....My folders are gone again. Its nothing but the recycle bin. I went to the Users folder. Switched
 on view hidden items to see the folders more clearly or see the hidden folders. I then went through all the users listed and DID NOT find my folders! Where can I locate these folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought when I installed that update it initiated some sort of glitch. Which caused the computer to think I logged on for the first time. Then the day after it fixed it but forgot my folders or something. So, i'm lost here on what to do. All my stuff is
 still here except for those folders. I searched EVERYWHERE for them and couldn't find them. I used the search bar in the bottom left and it still didn't find anything but Star Wars Themed stuff....-_-</p>
<p>Anyways, can anyone help me? Did anyone have a similar problem and can share their solution to me? ANY help is appreciated. I hope I explained this well. If you still got any questions feel free to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Sorry if the Windows topics part is a little off because I can't find the right category for it. So I chose the one that kinda fit best for this situation.</p>

            <p>For 1. I dont know which update it was. I was on vacation for 2 and a half days so I dont know when windows 10 pushed out an update. But I installed it yesterday. So probably the most recent one if it updated all windows 10 pcs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For 2. I did not lose ANY files, I just mislocated them and i dont know where to find them. Yes I used the search bar on the bottom left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For 3. No, because i just dont know where they are so a system restore isn't best for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing in the AppData and Temp folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing in the OneDrive folders (my computer is conneted to the internet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the drives and found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And nothing is in the recycle bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are still any questions please reply. But remember. After an update it probably initiated a glitch which caused windows to think I was on a new computer. Everything was still there but nothing on the desktop. So I went to my Users, and dragged out
 the folders from my desktop. And put them on the desktop i currently have. Its probably in a desktop folder somewhere on my computer because I can't find that particular desktop folder. So if I find that desktop folder then I can retrieve them. Also, if this
 has anything to do with it. I created the folders that im missing. An "Apps and Games" folder which held my apps and games. (such as steam, mc, etc). Another called "Music And Sounds" and yet another called "Other" which was filled with miscellaneous folders
 and files that I didn't want to fill my desktop up with. The names of the folders do not matter i believe but these folders were created by me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I read through the "Find lost files after update" page and found this part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p>This means Windows attached an extra account to yours, so youâ€™ll need to restart your PC and sign in again to get to your account settings and data.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
Be sure to copy anything you worked on since you upgraded to an external drive or it will be deleted when you sign out."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im pretty sure this means that those folders are gone. Deleted. sorry for wasting anyones time with this. But I'll still appreciate help to see if they arent deleted.<br />

    <title>Music library missing from Media Player after upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Music library missing from Media Player after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 today. When I opened Windows Media Player, my library was empty. I had possibly hundreds of CDs stored on Media Player under Windows 7. What happened??

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>To the best of my recollection, I upgraded using the Media Creation tool and selected Keep My Files and Settings. I went to Sync My Settings as you suggested and did not find the
 message about a temporary profile.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Actually, the files aren't missing. I found them in a folder named "(new name)&gt;Music". Wiith the old OS, the files were in a folder named "(old name)&gt;Music". The change in the folder name was not a change I initiated to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The problem appears to be that Windows Media Player isn't finding the files under the new OS.When I right click on a file, the menu has the selection "Add to Windows Media Player list", but the number of files would make this a lengthy chore. When I highlighted
 all the files and chose that option from the menu, only one file was added to Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I also tried this sequence in Media Player: "organize&gt;manage libraries&gt;music", but nothing pops up that would allow me to identify the folder where the files are. When I choose one of the other options such as "videos", a window opens which would allow me
 to specify a location for videos, but not so for music.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I'm thinking of changing the (new name) to the (old name) to see if Media Player can then find the location. Before I try that, I'd like to know from you whether the name change would interfere with the system in some other way.</p>
<p>

            I finally solved the problem by opening the folder containing the music files, selecting all the files, right clicking and choosing the command to play on Media Player. I was doubtful that the files would do anything more than play, but they started reappearing
 in the Media Player library although it took much of an afternoon and almost all night for all the files to appear. I'm relieved that I didn't have to do this for each individual file.

    <title>Surface 3 Dock error &#34;unknown USB device &#40;Port Reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel71317  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 Dock error &#34;unknown USB device &#40;Port Reset Failed&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues with the dock on my Surface 3...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: When I connect my Surface to the dock, I receive a USB error. In Device Manager, it shows up under USB controllers as "Unknown USB Device (Port Reset Failed)." I believe in trying to troubleshoot this, that it is referred to as a "code 43." This error
 does not present itself if the Surface is attached to the dock when I start it up from a full shutdown. If I remove the Surface or it goes into sleep mode, when I wake it up/set it in the dock, I receive the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>1. Updating all drivers</p>
<p>2. Uninstalling the device and allowing Windows to reinstall</p>
<p>3. Running the device and hardware troubleshooter, which does detect an issue, installs a driver, and prompts a restart. Problem solved, until, as stated earlier, I remove the tablet from the dock or allow the tablet to sleep.</p>
<p>4. Turning off the option to allow windows to turn off power to the USB root hubs</p>
<p>5. Searching various forums for any other help on the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

    <title>My 03, 2019 update KB4495667 disabled ALL Firefox apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed375  say:</h3>
<h2>            My 03, 2019 update KB4495667 disabled ALL Firefox apps</h2>
                    <p>Prior to installing: 2019-04 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 version 1809 for x64 based systems KB4495667, all the apps for Firefox 66.0.3 were working properly. After the update ALL WERE DISABLED as "could not be verified for use in Firefox".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update disabled three adblockers, video download helper, and Print Edit WE that were downloaded from the Mozilla Firefox web page for Firefox 66, and also disabled Avast's&nbsp;Online Security and Avast Passwords ( 8 total including Avast Safeprice ). Both
 FF and Avast were checked for updates and ARE Up To Date. The versions did NOT change between May 02 and May 04.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I was BLOCKED from trying to download the Firefox (FF) apps to re-install them. The error message: "download failed, check your internet connection" immediately appeared. This happened even when I Deleted the app, Closed Firefox, turned my computer
 OFF overnight, and tried to download the deleted app the nest day!</p>
<p>(If I had an internet problem, I wouldn't be able to reach the Mozilla web page!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have a verified, easy solution to this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My options:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Remove then re-install ( after a re-start) both Firefox and my Anti-virus, and hope that solved the problem.</p>
<p>2. Uninstall&nbsp;KB4495667, and maybe have to do option 1 anyway.</p>

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />A certificate expiring on FireFox's side caused an issue were addons would not work or download. They have a fix that is being rolled up, but could potentially take some time to roll out to everyone. 
<br />
<br />There is a step you can take to make sure that this fix should be pushed to you. 
<br />
<br />You can read more about this and see where to check that setting here:
<br /><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/upda...</a>
<br />
<br />I would recommend temporarily switching to a different browser if you need the use of the extensions until Mozilla fully fixes the Firefox certificate issue.
