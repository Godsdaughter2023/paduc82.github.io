<h2>            Problem uninstalling</h2>
                    I installed the 5K Player on my Windows 10 and was not able to use it as it is incompatible with Windows 10. I've been trying to uninstall it and it will not allow me to do so. It keeps saying it is running and exit and try again. I restarted my computer
 several times but nothing will allow it to uninstall. Assistance would be greatly appreciated.

<h2>            So, a bit of an error with MCPE&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, I play Minecraft: Pocket Edition online, as a light time-killer when I have nothing better to do, and recently I've noticed that I can no longer connect to realms, add friends, or pretty much anything else multiplayer. Apparently, I need to edit my privacy and online safety settings on Xbox.com. So I head over to the aforementioned settings, and everything is in working order. So I go back to the game, and nothing has changed. Help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>I tried drag and drop.&nbsp; I tried CTRL+C &amp; CTRL+V.&nbsp; Neither work when trying to move a large folder (7-8GB) from my USB to my hard drive.&nbsp; I feel like I am the only one having this bug.&nbsp; It works with smaller files from my USB to my hard drive - even up to

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; XP says "Cannot copy file.&nbsp; Cannot read from the source file or disk."</p>

<p>It sounds like there may be corruption on your drive. &nbsp;Here's how to check it for errors:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - Open Computer, then right-click on the drive and choose Properties.</p>
<p>2 - On the Tools tab, click Check Now.</p>
<p>3 - I recommend you scan and attempt recovery of bad sectors, but this type of scan can take some time (but it's far faster on USB disks).</p>

<h2>            System File scan  Or DISM versus System Restore</h2>
                    I want to try doing a SFC on my older, Sony Vaio with Windows XP Version 2002 (Service pak 2), but I am afraid that if I do it it will have the same effect as doing a System Recovery or system restore, in that it will erase (or delete) a lot of the newer
 programs that I have installed, or downloaded over the past few years, &nbsp;that I would NOT be able to get back onto it since they're no longer in circulation_compatibility TODAY with this older Windows program, as they were a few years ago when I downloaded
 them then. Will running a SFC have the same type of complete restoring-to-its-original status and PC programs &nbsp;as a doing a System Restore does? And, would I lose my invaluable --slightly outdated programs too? &nbsp;I NEED to recover Windows programs that got
 accidentally erased or corrupted when I accidentally deleted them after tinkering around with them in order to create more space and, also trying to make newer programs run without conflict to the Pre-installed (now ver

            Yes, I have a "back-up/Recovery CD" &nbsp;that was made back when the PC was &nbsp;new,. I unwittingly used it, when I thought the PC was zapped--and, "dead" after a power-outage that had struck 3 times in a row, and, I couldn't get &nbsp;it to come back (around 2014).
 The recovery disc was made about 2009, or so. When used it, it had erased EVERYTHING and, was effective at putting the PC back to its original status of having an outdated and, thus ineffective -OLD Internet Explorer, and other Internet surfing Programs that
 I think are not even in existence anymore: like Opera etc. So, I struggled with painstakingly getting the thing to even recognize an internet connection and, then the slow process of non-stop trying to re-install some Programs that I had had on it PRIOR to
 the Recovery disc-erasing tragedy. That's why I am SO hesitant to run the SFSC --in case that whole ordeal happens again. &nbsp;It took me two weeks of re-trying to establish an internet connection using its original IE pro

            Thank you, Andrew E! I may be brave and, go ahead and try it, per your description. I got so far as &nbsp;choosing one of the 3 types of "scan now" options, under command prompt, last week, and, backed out of it, altogether when I saw the "suggested warning
 to make sure that I had "backed-up all" files or something like that (FIRST), and, decided to be safe and ask the community experts BEFORE doing, after the bad experience I had a few years ago . I appreciate your time in answering my question!! ;-)

            <p>Since you have a recovery CD, run the sfc command and see if it will fix the files. When it is running, it might ask for the recovery CD to get any files that are corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running recovery CD will put the computer back to original settings. This is done as a last step and making a current backup of the whole&nbsp; hard drive to make sure you have all drivers.</p>

            <p>Most folks think that running sfc /scannow will replace missing or corrupted files in the system32 folder but that is not what sfc /scannow does and that is not what it is designed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even suggesting sfc /scannow as a way to resolve some problem since you believe it will "replace missing or corrupted files" is the same as saying "I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc /scannow is designed to run one time after Windows is first installed. &nbsp;It's job is to populate the dllcache folder with backup copies of 3498 important Windows files (there is a list).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody thinks sfc /scannow replaces missing or corrupt files in the system32 folder here is a test scenario you can safely run on your own system to prove that is not what sfc /scannow does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll use the spoolsv.exe file in the system32 folder in this lesson.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot your system into Safe Mode or the Recovery Console so Windows File Protection is not running.<br />
<br />
Rename your c:\windows\system32\spoolsv.exe file to something you can remember (like spoolsv.bak) so that the file is now "missing".<br />
<br />
Since Windows File Protection is not running in Safe Mode, the missing file will not be automatically replaced like it would be if you were booted in Normal mode.<br />
<br />
Reboot your system normally so Windows File Protection is running again (the spoolsv.exe file is still "missing").<br />
<br />
Run sfc /scannow and it will not replace the "missing" spoolsv.exe file - because that is not what sfc /scannow does.<br />
<br />
Now copy some bogus file like your boot.ini file into the system32 folder and call it spoolsv.exe:<br />
<br />
<strong>copy &nbsp;c:\boot.ini &nbsp; c:\windows\system32\spoolsv.exe</strong><br />
<br />
In effect, now you have a spoolsv.exe file, but the spoolsv.exe file is now "corrupted".<br />
<br />
Run sfc /scannow again and the corrupted file will still not be replaced since that is not what sfc /scannow does either.<br />
<br />
Of course sfc /scannow is good for only one thing, but not these kinds of things and not what most people think.<br />
<br />
Rename your spoolsv.exe ifle back when you are done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you know what sfc /scannow doesn't do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this on any of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection and the System File Checker know about (yes, there is a list).</p>

    <title>Upgrade from win 7 to 10 Drivers missing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrade from win 7 to 10 Drivers missing</h2>
                    I upgraded from 7 to 10. I skipped 8 entirely as I heard it was a nightmare. Upon finishing I couldnt run my games as well as before. I checked and sure enough the video drivers failed to load from 7 to 10. Shouldnt all drivers transfer from one windows
 install to another??? I am not going to reinstall all my drivers, *I found others missing as well* after upgrading to 10. If the driver is there in windows 7 it should remain there in an upgrade. If not this isnt an upgrade at all. I reverted to win 7 and
 untill this type of issue is fixed to my satisfaction I will remain with Windows 7. At least it works and doesnt remove other vital functions of windows.

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, since you have performed an upgrade, your all apps or drivers should also have to upgrade to Windows 10. This issue may have caused due to some incorrect installation settings or incompatible drivers. Windows&nbsp;10 is designed to be compatible with the
 vast majority of Windows 7 and Windows&nbsp;8.1 devices, so your device is most likely compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For details on your specific device and apps, you can use the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app to do a compatibility check. Click the menu in the upper left of the app, and select “Check your PC” or “Your PC is good to go.” This displays any compatibility issues we find
 and recommends a resolution; while we don’t have info on every app or device in existence, it provides a comprehensive list of all known potential compatibility issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Windows&nbsp;10 features will require advanced hardware and not all features and services are available on every device, nor in every market. For instance, Cortana is not available in all markets.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep us posted if you face any issues on windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</span></span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Answers Forum.&nbsp; The first thing you need to check is that your PC is set to boot from the CD.&nbsp; The boot order is set in the BIOS and you will need to check with the PC manufacturer for instructions on changing it.&nbsp; Once
 you are set to boot from the CD drive first, then boot from the XP CD into the Recovery Console.&nbsp; This link explains how to boot to recovery console:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307654#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307654#3</a><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have booted to the recovery console I would suggest running the following two commands (the links after the commands give explanations\instruction about them).<br />
<br />
chkdsk /r&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265</a>&nbsp;(the instructions explain running cmd from the start menu, you won't need to do that step)<br />

<h2>            Windows Easy Transfer- does it overwrite the data on the new PC with the old data&#63;  </h2>
                    I just purchased a new HP Pavilion Dm3 laptop with Windows 7. And I have been using it since 10/22 (a couple weeks).&nbsp; Yesterday I decide to start to transfer all my data from my two older laptops to my new one.&nbsp; My documents, Outlook data, Music, Photos,
 etc...&nbsp; I used Windows Easy Transfer and I think I lost all the data on my new laptop, I think it was overwritten with the old laptops information.&nbsp; Could this have happened?&nbsp; Is there anyway to get my data back?&nbsp;

<p>I am having the same problem. &nbsp;I am playing Forza Motorsport 6, and am in tuning area. &nbsp;As soon as I hit the B button on the controller to exit the tuning area, it instead stops streaming and brings me to the Xbox App screen on my Windows 10 machine. &nbsp;This
 seems to be fairly new as I have streamed a bunch and have not run into this amazingly frustrating experience. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this has killed my ability to stream as I cannot interact with the games as needed.</p>

<p>there is a fix for Microsoft... take away the ability to navigate the xbox app via your game pad.. since they added that in all this started.. before they added that in the app worked really well with the odd issues (stuttering and frame drops)</p>
<p>the workaround (apparently) is to use the xbox beta app.. don't bother does the same on there since the latest update.. because of this I now cannot even use my xbox.. so atm I have a xbox one that I cannot even play games on because I can only play this
 though my pc because of no TV.. Microsoft get your act together</p>

<p>wow checked above thread posted by Mister Maka and someone has posted a fix for it.. it appears going to settings &gt; Xbox One &gt; and turn off "Typing on Xbox One"
</p>
<p>and that sorted the issue out</p>
<p>**note... I do apologise for above message as I was quite frustrated at the time because I have been waiting a long time to play assassins creed syndicate and I wasn't able to. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It's been over a week and after spending hours on here&nbsp;I am no closer to a solution.80% of the stuff I'm reading is over my head the other 20% does not apply.I have not remapped any keys,I have no maleware, no virus no spyware.I don't need to defrag,empty
 cache and have plenty of free space. I also didn't get a error code.&nbsp;I have never had this problem before with an update and doupt it has anything to do with my PC. So how do I solve this and how will it effect any other updates that are in the works. I also
 downloaded the update and tried to run it from my desktop and was told I don't have permission to update windows XP and to contact administrator. I am the administrator. I tried it again a different way and got the message :Setup can not continue because one
 or more prerequisites required to install update failed .For more details check the logfile.Well here is the logfile and it's all greek to me. Ready to give up&nbsp;...Kinda sad that microsoft doesn't step up to the plate with help but rather relies on kind hearted
 people in a forum.</p>

            <p>I'm having basically the same problem. Just the one security update, KB2686509 fails to install. Others have installed since then. I've tried the Windows Fixit Tool, no help, I've renamed the Download file, no help, I've run the MS Baseline Security Analyzer,
 and am working my way through the more arcane suggestions, but so far no luck. </p>
<p>Tech support used to be free for security updates, but they told me today that XP is so old that they don't offer that anymore, but would be happy to remotely fix my laptop for $90. Heck, this old laptop is probably only worth about $90, so I said "thank
 you very much, but I would rather do it myself". </p>
<p>I run Ubuntu Linux on this machine in a dual boot, and find myself using it more and more. It is a lot faster and lighter on older systems. Maybe that is the solution to Microsoft security issues.

Sorry, Edie,&nbsp;I was asking Mystic ET and should have quoted his remarks.&nbsp; There's more than one error in the report listed by you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did your system come with Windows XP pre-installed or was there a previous OS and you upgraded to Windows XP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Using SubInACL - Reset Registry Permissions to Default</b></p>
<p>For Windows XP Home Edition (and Professional Edition), you may use the SubInACL tool to reset the registry and file permissions. Download and then install the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Subinacl.exe</a> (~370 KB) from Microsoft. SubInACL is a command-line tool that enables administrators to obtain security information about files, registry keys, etc.</p>
<p>Download <b><a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/reset.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset.zip</a></b>, unzip and run the
<b>reset.cmd</b> file. This script resets the registry and file permissions in your system.</p>
Reset.cmd Contents
<p>The file reset.cmd contains the following lines:</p>
<div>cd /d "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Resource Kits\Tools"<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive%\ /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Known issues with this security update
<p>In some scenarios, the %windir%\FaultyKeyboard.log file might not have been created on your computer. If the file was not created, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the following registry entry for a "IgnoreRemoteKeyboardLayout" or "ScanCode Map" entry. These entries may cause the installation of this security update to fail.&nbsp;
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard layout
</li><li>Back up this registry entry. To do this, click <strong>Export</strong> on the
<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;menu. Save the .reg file to a safe location, such as a disk or a USB storage device.&nbsp;</li><li>Delete the registry entry. </li><li>Install security update 2686509. </li><li>Restore the registry entry (the .reg file) that you previously saved. To do this, double-click the .reg file that you saved, and then click&nbsp;<b>Yes</b> in the dialog box that appears.
</li></ol>
<p>Retry update </p>

<h2>            Ongoing Win 10 Wifi issues&#59; tried everything now I think</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>This is copied and edited from another reply I made to another comment somewhere. I hope someone can help. This issue is getting beyond a joke now. I even tried contacting MS&nbsp;Live Chat support. They were no help and said sorry --&nbsp;Win 10 and no WIFI is&nbsp;a
 common problem and to contact my vendor. I live in Indonesia and my brother-in-law had&nbsp;a similar&nbsp;issue and called Microsoft's regional branch and managed to solve it. However, I don't speak the local&nbsp;language and have tried his "fix" as I see it (same&nbsp;driver
 version and all his settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my issue: I used to get fine WIFI with the Windows 8.1 OEM version this computer came with (an HP 14 series laptop). All my Apple products also work fine throughout the apartment with WIFI.&nbsp;I was so&nbsp;looking forward to Windows 10 as an ex-Windows pro&nbsp;user
 I'd say&nbsp;(right from 3.1 through to XP) turned Mac user. Indeed, all was good for the first month or so. Then the WIFI started showing&nbsp;the seemingly common&nbsp;"limited connection" problem, and I found I could only get WIFI if I was right next to the router. Then
 it stopped intermittently, then&nbsp;altogether. I have the dreaded Realtek RT3290 wifi adapter...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried various fixes before the 1511 update. These included:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Doing the obvious power-plan management fix and the&nbsp;Device Manager&nbsp;wake/sleeping issue fix and uninstalled all anti-virus software and stopped the Windows Firewall. (And restarted after all of these steps.)</p>
<p>2. Doing all the command-line stuff with netsh.exe, flushing DNS, release/renew IP, autotuning etc.</p>
<p>3. As the signal&nbsp;said it was&nbsp;"limited" I bought a signal booster, which has not solved the issue.</p>
<p>4. Uninstalled the WIFI adapter and checked for hardware changes to reinstall it. Done this many times.</p>
<p>5. Played around with the WIFI adapter advanced options,&nbsp;like&nbsp;&nbsp;"801 ad hoc support."</p>
<p>6. Enabled and disabled the adapter repeatedly in Device Manager&nbsp;(this worked for a short period of time; now it has no effect).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">7. Updated WIFI drivers many, many&nbsp;times and downloaded loads of old drivers, tried Compatability Troubleshooter etc. before I got the one my brother-in-law uses, which worked for a time after I ran the
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">netsh winsock reset catalog and</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<span>netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log commands then restarted. Now even with that driver I have nothing.</span></span></p>
<span>netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log commands then restarted. Now even with that driver I have nothing.</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>8. I did try disabling IpV6 with limited success (it worked for a bit but not for long and then not at all).</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Currently I am on WIFI adapter driver version 5.0.57.0 dated 5/18/2015 from Media Tek as this is the one I've had most (but very limited) success with, and which works on my brother-in-law's HP laptop.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Anyhoo,&nbsp;along came 1511 and since that time I have no working WIFI. Well, I've had hope a few times when it&nbsp;shows five bars.&nbsp;But then it drops out again and won't come back after 1-5 mins and is then gone for days or until I fiddle
 with the settings and even then I only have it for another 5 mins and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
cannot access any websites.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Given the fact that I spend more time trying to fix this issue than I&nbsp;have actually&nbsp;using the computer for work, I can't remember the fixes that&nbsp;I've tried that have worked for the short periods of time I've had working WIFI. Oh,
 and I resorted to downloading a third-party Win 10 internet fixer, which did no good. And the Windows&nbsp;troubleshooters and the HP's built-in troubleshooter don't fix it either.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">If I connect to the router via Ethernet, it's all good. I've also tried resetting the router and signal booster. No effect.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Sometimes Edge won't connect to a website or even search from the input/address field. IE works but I prefer Edge and hate IE like many. I don't know if this&nbsp;is related. I may try Chrome as Edge has this problem, though I don't
 want to: I want Win 10 to work as it should.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've reset the computer fully twice causing me great time lost in redownloading Office 365 and I've created and used multiple restore points. Sometimes a restore point that was created with a working WIFI comes back with none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've lost so much time on this that my wife is very&nbsp;upset about how long&nbsp;I spend on&nbsp;it each and every day and says we should get another Mac and throw this&nbsp;PC away basically and be done with Windows. But&nbsp;I don't want to waste money and neither do I think
 I should.</p>

            <p>Well, the wifi is gone again and the fixes don't work now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was OK for a few days with good connection speeds. I created a restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed iTunes and ensured the Bonjour service was deactivated. Wifi was fine and I created a restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after a restart (I usually leave the PC on and let it sleep) the wifi went. And it hasn't come back since. The restore points don't come back with working wifi either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

            <p>BTW, latest Network Diagnostic error is the common "One or more network protocols is missing from this computer". I get this error a lot. Sometimes it seems&nbsp;fixable in Network Diagnostics when I click "Try these fixes an an administrator." Most of the time
 it says it cannot fix them, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also get the simple "Cannot connect to this network" a lot too. It says "Secured, No Internet" when I go to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my Apple products work fine so I don't suspect the router at all.</p>

            <p>Same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wifi crashes every 5-10 minutes.&nbsp; Sometimes it sorts itself when I run the recommended fix but, often I have to run it 3/4 times after being told the problem can't be fixed.&nbsp; It can! -&nbsp;if you keep trying but, this is no way to run a system.&nbsp; Watching any
 live streaming is now a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started a thread on this but eventually, because I suggested I would give up my 20 year association with Windows - computer and phone due to be updated in two months or so, was going to go for Pro 4 and the new Lumia&nbsp;-&nbsp;the responses go dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; My son has
 Apple and loves it.&nbsp; I really want to stick with Windows, BUT. . . !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wait to see what Microsoft are going to do but I am getting to the end of my tether.</p>

<p>Same thing here too on my Dell XPS Desktop, Wifi suddenly drops and can no longer find the network connections.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I have attempted re-installation of Network drivers via Windows Update.&nbsp; Then tried the drivers straight from Dell specific for my Wifi card.&nbsp; Problems persist.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the Event Viewer, I'm seeing a cluster of Services that "terminate unexpectedly" every time the wifi drops:</p>

<p>Wi-fi is re-established and functions normally when restarting the WLAN Auto-Config Service, and after a certain period of time (usually every ~15-30 minutes), these same errors pop up and Wi-fi is again dropped.</p>

<p>The site for the survey is accessed though a link in a email from 'The Xbox team' so not sure how to make that UK only, i would guess thats handled from their end. When i use the Xbox website to manage my account and use these forums it has en-GB in the
 web address and my Xbox has UK content like iplayer on it so i figure my gamertag account region must match my physical region.</p>

<p>Hi Hash,<br />
<br />
That is odd. <strong>There is no reason a survey sent by Microsoft should ask for your email or phone number, especially since we sent it to your email in the first place.&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
I would disregard the email, and if you don't mind, send me a PM with the email address that sent you that survey. To send a PM, click the little green envelope underneath my post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>G'day all! Fear not, the email in question was legit.<br />
<br />
<span>Regardless, this is a good reminder to be wary of who you're giving your information to. If it's for a promotion or survey like the email here, make sure it comes from a trusted source. =) Sometimes that contact info is purely just
 for getting in contact with you.<br />
</span><span><br />
As for the phone number being invalid for the field, see if there is a Terms &amp; Conditions form linked to in the survey. If the survey is only for certain regions, then those will likely be listed in the T&amp;C.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you; </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you facing any issue with your PC because of Silverlight?</li></ul>
<p>Microsoft Silverlight is a free web-browser plug-in that enables interactive media experiences, rich business applications and immersive mobile apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft designed Silverlight with the ability to deliver high-fidelity experiences on the broadest set of system configurations. Some features, such as HD video, may benefit from the power contained in newer personal computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can choose to uninstall Silverlight, however, media experiences,&nbsp;some business applications and immersive mobile apps may not function without it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall the driver and restart the computer it will automatically install the driver for the USB device.</p>
<p>Reset the USB controller and check if it makes any difference:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>devmgmt.msc</b> in start search box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Expand <b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click Uninstall to remove them one at a time.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer, and then reinstall the USB controllers.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Plug in the removable USB storage device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Renewal</h2>
                    
<p>So when I try and use the credit card payment method it keeps giving me error messages like 801901F7. And sometimes if I keep trying to purchase gold it says there is an error with your account pplease go to account/xbox/live.com and so I went there and
 the sight just kept asking for my Windows Live ID and confirmation, but didn't tell me anywhere what the problem was with my account. So what I'm wondering is does anybody know how to fix it?</p>

<p>Hello Julie</p>
<p>I always used email to log into my account. I had Skype from when it was first introduced. I have used it for years. Now it wipes out my Skype contacts and wants to connect me to contacts on Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since 1998 never had success with Outlook. I never liked Hotmail because of the spam. Outlook is no better. So I have a list there but that is not my personal list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now everything is gone. Ask for help, they couldn't careless. Your tough luck. I am becoming more unimpressed by Microsoft all the time. Since Bill Gates left it has gone down hill with customer service. I have always been an avid supporter. However, I am
 starting to have second thoughts about this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was hacked and I was forced into Windows 10 instead of 7. Not interested in people spying on me. 10 is user unfriendly compared to 7. XP was good. Vista and 8 were garbage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now they took over and destroyed a great application. Have had more problems since Microsoft got their hands on it. No, I am unimpressed. &nbsp;I had contemplated Apple earlier. Now I am kicking myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Correction customer service everywhere is going downhill. Taking pride in one's work. What is that.&nbsp;Quality, what is that? The Younger generation has no idea about that with all their entitlement ideas. Deserve = to serve. The more you serve, the more you
 deserve. What has happened to work ethics?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even deal with Canadians or Americans that speak proper English. No, it is farmed out to a foreign country. Then they wonder why consumers get agitated. I am not prejudiced, I am just tired of trying to speak to people who don't understand my language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>High time people know this. John</p>

            The problem is still unsolved. I expect it will remain unsolved. My contacts are gone. My only hope is that I can retrace history before Microsoft got their hands on it. Very unimpressed.

<h2>            New Notifications and Calendar icons in my Task Bar don&#39;t work. Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm having issues with my new Windows 10 laptop* and am now creating separate threads on them to help other End Users who have the same issues find the threads when searching the Community for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the 10th February Windows Updates (WU) gave me Build 10586.104 to my version 1511, which is when the new issues started appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Calendar:</span> In Win7, left-clicking on the Calendar icon (bottom task bar, bottom right, brought up a Calendar through which we could page&nbsp;to get whatever info we needed. Nothing happens now. Should left-clicking
 take me to the same/a similar calendar in Win10?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">New Notifications:</span> In Win7 this was the Windows Action Centre. My New notifications icon (next to the Calendar icon)&nbsp;currently is&nbsp;showing what looks like a 'No Entry' sign in&nbsp;its bottom right - I've not seen
 that before - and that may be the reason why left-clicking the icon has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm NOT saying that WU last week caused these two issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>* HP Envy OEM / main browser is Internet Explorer / Norton Internet Security / and just in case it's relevant, Norton Safe Search enabled, Bing Search disabled. (PS a friend has just emailed me to cynically suggest my issues have been triggered by my Adblock

            <p><span>Hello Taffy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What happens when you click on the action center?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if similar issue persists on another user profile?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be informed the Calendar in Windows 10 located in the system tray is improved according to the operating system. The new &amp; improved Calendar has changed only by the appearance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may be facing the Action center issue due to the missing or corrupted files and folders present on the PC.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> I suggest you to run SFC scan and DISM scan on the PC by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open an <strong>Administrator command prompt
</strong>window by</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></li><li><span>Check if it says <strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>Type the following commands in the <strong>
CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 3: </strong>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> If the issue persists,
</span><span>create another administrator user account by referring to </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Set up accounts</span></span></strong></a><span><span>on
 Windows 10 article and check if similar issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Write to us with the answers to the above questions and the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Likhitha. The new notifications icon no longer has the 'no entry' sign on it. (Black circle with white bar across it.) When I left-clicked it, nothing happened - I gave it five minutes but still nothing happened. I right-clicked it and selected Open Action
 Centre, nothing happened after eight minutes. I've only one UA on this PC so I can't try to replicate the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry but I'm unable to go through the sfc /scannow rigmarole just now as it may interfere with the System Event file that a Moderator needs in another thread. I'll try it as soon as I can but meanwhile please remind me - in your Step 2, do I enter the
 three commands all at once or one at a time? or is that a silly question?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not prepared to try Method 2. I've had enough problems on my upgraded PC trying to set up an additional UA and it has never resolved those problems. :o)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning to the Calendar, I'm sorry but I don't understand what you mean by "<span>Please be informed the Calendar in Windows 10 located in the system tray is improved according to the operating system. The new &amp; improved Calendar has changed only by the
 appearance."</span></p>
<p><span><strong>When I click on it, should it open the Calendar?</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And I can't help but think that there's a connection between Action Centre icon / Calendar icon / Start icon&nbsp;Search box/icon all failing at the same time. It's too big a coincidence!</span></p>

<p><span>Restoring the missing files might help in resolving the issue. Repair in-place upgrade will restore the missing system files and replace the corrupted files &amp; folders on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform
<strong>Repair</strong> <strong>in-place upgrade</strong> by downloading and installing Windows 10 using
</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Media Creation Tool</span></strong></a><span><span>.
 Select <strong>Keep all the apps and files</strong> option to retain the apps you have downloaded and saved files &amp; folders on your PC.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>An in-place upgrade is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system. It is the upgrade performed on the same version/edition of the operating system to repair the damaged
 files or to restore the lost files of the operating system.</span></p>

            <p>Hi again, Likitha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have so, so&nbsp;many issue now with this two months old PC. Helpful people such as you, MVPs, Insiders and Moderators have given me lots of advice including PowerShell, Classic View, Clean&nbsp;Install etc that I now have brain overload and don't know which of
 the solutions I should do first and the order then of doing the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a brand new PC and it worked when I set it up in January. It crashed twice when I installed Office 365 and the WU on the 10th February caused major damage, including the loss of documents &amp; pictures. Oh, and the loss of the Start Icons and many other
 things such as Calendar etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that programs on my PC have been corrupted but it's clear that&nbsp;Microsoft has corrupted them, not me. It's disappointing that no-one will accept this. And the Start Menu&nbsp;Critical Error is now thirteen months old with no signs for we End Users that
 a solution is anywhere in sight,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please put this on hold. I will now go to the retailer and demand that they sort it out, free of charge of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS None of this rant is aimed at you Likitha -it's aimed entirely at Microsoft/the OEM manufacturer (HP) who have allowed mistakes that have made my PC no longer 'Fit For Purpose' - or am I wrong, anyone?</p>

            <p>Not had chance to visit the retailers but there's been a change. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can now right-click the date to open this menu:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2130988d-8fcd-4f20-bc66-322fd0215bbe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2130988d-8fcd-4f20-bc66-322fd0215bbe" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and it works. Right-clicking Notifications brings A menu to Open Action Centre and turn on quiet hours. They don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd right-clicked before but nothing had happened so I have to wonder whether the Date menu now appearing is&nbsp;in any way due to the fact that&nbsp;I've been playing around with (to get used to) Narrator (Win+Enter to open/close) and that seems to have kicked-started
 other failed icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Likitha, you may wish to add to the start of your template reply "First, have you tried right-clicking the Date/Time?" If you need the approval of the level above may I suggest that you do is as quickly in case this works for others with the same problem?</p>

<p>Using my recent "workaround"</p>
<p>Right click the task view icon on the taskbar, then properties and customize..., that should bring you to the System settings.</p>
<p>In the search box type the word :&nbsp; Noti</p>
<p>That should bring up a bunch of options to choose from , just at random I choose the blue flag called : Review your computer's status and resolve issues.</p>
<p>In the new&nbsp;page showing&nbsp;under the&nbsp; check for solution, click : view problems to report.</p>
<p>Then on the bottom right click check for solutions. If that does do good.</p>
<p>Go back and retype : Noti, and choose some&nbsp;else, who knows you may get lucky !!.&nbsp; (:-)</p>

<h2>            removing Bangla&#40;india&#41; kb</h2>
                    Removing Bangla(India) Keyboard is not possible. I think the Indian programmers of Microsoft have done this nuisance. Bangladeshi users facing trouble using local Bangla Apps like Avro. I wonder how microsoft allow this hypocracy??

            Hello, Mamlukarrahman, 
<br />
<br />To Remove the Program:
<br />Click on Settings, select Control Panel, click Uninstall a program
<br />Find out and highlight Avro Keyboard on the list of installed programs
<br />Click on Uninstall on the top, and you will start the default uninstall process
<br />Following the removing instruction to finish the removal
<br />Restart the computer after the removal
<br />
<br />If the above fails to uninstall the keyboard, use this fix from Microsoft for uninstall/install issues.

            You should do following - 
<br />
<br />A. Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />Copy and paste below and Enter in Powershell 
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList 
<br />
<br />Now, you will get the languages which are installed. Make a note of language tag of the language which you want to retain. Let's say that this language tag is en-US. 
<br />
<br />Now, Copy and paste below and Enter in Powershell 
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />This will make other languages disappear. (In case, you want to add again or other languages, you can add again from language settings) 
<br />
<br />B. I would also recommend that you submit this issue as a feedback to Windows team through Feedback Hub

            I don't want to uninstall Avro, rather I want to uninstall Bangla(India). I did not install Bangla(India) but it came by default and can not be removed like other languages.

                    <p><strong>I read that this security update will be rectified "in two weeks", but JUST FOR THE RECORD</strong>, my desktop has 32-bit XPsp3, installed 2 weeks ago, with already c.150 updates!! I have tried hiding this KB2538242 in Microsoft Update - this did
 not work, although I have used this option in the past&nbsp;with an unrelated&nbsp;update&nbsp;.</p>
<p>After two days I was alarmed to find (in Microsoft Update) this automatic download had "succeeded" on about 30 occasions. However,&nbsp;nothing showing in my installed updates.
</p>
<p>Eventually turned off the install from the taskbar icon -&nbsp; I have seen no mention of this method..</p>

    <title>Horrible lag and freezing while using brand new Xbox one bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shts weak brah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Horrible lag and freezing while using brand new Xbox one bluetooth controller on Windows 10 1607</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;just purchased a brand new Xbox one S wireless controller (new&nbsp;bluetooth version)&nbsp;for use on Windows 10. I updated the controller using the xbox accessories app in Windows 10 and followed all instructions for troubleshooting and connecting/reconnecting the controller. Unfortunately though, any time I&nbsp;use this controller I&nbsp;have a huge amount of input lag and general lag within any game. This includes the game occasionally coming to a complete stop for sometimes 5-20 seconds before resuming.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a pair of xbox 360 controllers and PS4 controllers, which all have given zero issues running on the same computer. In fact, I&nbsp;can start playing a game with the new xbox wireless controller and it will have tons of issues, then turn it off and switch to a 360 controller which will solve everything.&nbsp;</p><p>For over $50 I&nbsp;expected a better experience. I'm not sure if my controller is defective or if this is a current issue that can be resolved

            <p>Thanks for posting!&nbsp;Definitely sounds like an odd issue, but lets try to sort it out. First, are you using multiple Bluetooth controllers at the same time?&nbsp;Additionally, have you ensured that all Windows updates have been applied?&nbsp;Open up your Start menu on Windows 10, and then search for 'Check for updates' to proceed updating your PC.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you run into the issue and have already ran the updates, the next step I recommend trying is searching for the 'Xbox (beta)' app within the Windows Store. Does the beta app prompt a different update?</p><p><br /></p><p>Lastly, be sure to check out our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-and-troubleshoot-xbox-one-bluetooth-issues-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One Bluetooth Controller Troubleshooting page</a> for further steps we recommend following.</p><p><br /></p><p>Once you have tried all of that, post back here to let us know what the results are. </p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for your reply, here is some info based on what you suggested -&nbsp;</p><p>1) I have never attempted to connect the controller while other controllers are connected. I&nbsp;even went as far to delete all other bluetooth controllers from the computer before trying again.&nbsp;</p><p>2) All windows updates have been applied up to today's date.</p><p>3) I&nbsp;downloaded the Xbox beta app, but haven't received any prompt for an update. Is there a specific place to check for updates?&nbsp;</p><p>4) This was the first thing I&nbsp;did when I&nbsp;ran into trouble, unfortunately I didn't have any luck with the usual troubleshooting steps.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Apologies for the delay! Based on the information you've provided us, the Xbox One S controller you're using may unfortunately need to be repaired. If you're still within the exchange window with the retailer you purchased with, the best route may be to reach out to them to inquire about a possible controller exchange. If you're not, I recommend beginning the repair process through our <a href="https://devicesupport.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a>. </p><p><br /></p><p>Please be sure to keep us in the loop!</p>

<b>Control Panel</b> - <b>Programs </b>- <b>Turn Windows features on or off</b> -

</blockquote>
<br />
According to Microsoft you can't install Windows Media Player 11 on Windows XP Media Center Edition Version 2002.<br />
I have Windows Media Player 9 - the original - on my Windows XP Media Center Edition Version 2002 OS based HP pc.
<br />
I have no problem with the Windows Media Player at all. However the Media Center Version 2002 unfortunately does not work.<br />
&nbsp;These ehshell.exe- Common Language Runtime Debugging Services and JIT debugger error messages keep coming up whenever I use the Media Center.<br />
Sorry, I was not too clear previously.<br />

            Apologies, those instructions I posted were for Vista/7 only. I have removed them from my original post since this is an XP forum.<br />
<br />
Since when are you experiencing this issue? If it only started recently then I suggest that you use System Restore.<br />
<br />
If System Restore isn't an option, please open the Start Menu, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">
All Programs </span>- <span style="font-weight: bold">Accessories</span>, and choose
<br />
<br />
and press Enter. Let it run until it completes. Does it find any problems, and if so, is it able to fix them? Do you still get the same error messages afterwards?

            <p>I Ihave re installed windows media edtion 3 times in the past 2 months</p>
<p>On the second try the media player worked.</p>
<p>Now it is same as 1st time.</p>
<p>After you have installed the windows there is a message that says do not touch any keys for 30 mins that windows is loading aplacations</p>
<p>I waited this time for 55 min and then had to manuely end the program.</p>
<p>I think the problem is in the installing of windows.</p>
<p>I would like mine to work but not worth all the trouble of reinstallin windows and getting all those updates.</p>

            That function is partially broken and doesn't work the way its really supposed to anymore. What you should be using is the Share charm in File Explorer located on the ribbon.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30056dd6-3710-43b7-a1a5-8f88ad14e21a?upload=true" />

            Thank you for the suggestion.&nbsp; However, using the Share charm as you suggest does not allow me to use Microsoft Outlook as the e-mail program.&nbsp; It does let me use Windows Mail, but I want to use Outlook.&nbsp; And using the Share charm does not allow me to
 resize the photos being sent.

<h2>            Beat, delete, repeat.</h2>
                    <p>Are you one of those gamers that can't bring yourself to delete/uninstall games you are no longer playing or do you get rid of them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son made me buy him an external hard drive so he doesn't have to delete games even if he never plans on playing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me, I only play one game at a time until I'm completely finished or had enough. I then delete it. I never go back to older games after I've beaten them unless there is planned DLC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beat, delete, repeat. Beat, delete, repeat.</p>

            It's depends. Since I get my games digitally, I can always download them again and replay if I feel like it. Since my HDD on my Xbox One is 500GB, I have to uninstall certain games.

            Hahaha. Im facing this dilemma as we speak. Because my kids play some of the games i have installed and beaten, i cant bring myself to delete it on them, but ive always got another game ready that i wanna install. Ive sacrificed a few games, but it was
 a unanimous decision between me and my kids. We all had to agree. So it wasnt just me deleting games for my benefit. But i will be investing in a hard drive very soon. Lol

<p>Once the game is beat then I delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a few games installed that I might just jump on once in a while,&amp; a few that I haven't started yet thanks to sales &amp; me being weak but anything I've finished gets deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If at some point I do fancy a bash on one of them games then i'll just download it again.Got fast broadband &amp; no data caps so re downloading stuff isn't an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Somehow I always have at least 1tb of free HDD space.</p>

<p>I cant bring myself to play more than one game at a time. If I play one game, I always think about the other and vise versa. It's like dating two different girls at once. You always be thinking of the other.&nbsp;</p>

            At first it was really hard for me to delete any games. The second I noticed that I had no more space it became an instant struggle between keeping the games I got or beating the games and moving forward. It's kind of a good thing now since I'm beating
 games I havent yet.

            If I absolutely know I wont be coming back to it, I will delete it. Theres no reason to keep it so I normally just delete them.
