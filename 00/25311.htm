<h2>            How do I set the preview screen to use text vs. HTML mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know how to change sending from HTML to text mode.&nbsp; But I can't figure out how to change the preview screen from HTML to text.&nbsp; If it can be done, can it be done only for the preview screen and remain HTML for any emails I actually fully open?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related question: can I disable Java for just the preview screen but continue to allow it for opened emails?&nbsp; Actually, can I disable Java for just Outlook without disabling it for everything else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been hit by this recent Microsoft Agreement fake email malware problem where just viewing the email was enough to require MSE to need to clean and quarantine a Trojan that infected me and the above were the&nbsp;recommendations to prevent such occurrences
 (if I could figure out how to do them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance, guidance, comments, workarounds, or suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

            <p>You can set outlook to <a href="http://www.outlook-tips.net/tips/tip-648-always-use-plain-text/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
'read mail as plain text'</a> - it's in Tools, Trust Center, Email security in 2007. It's going to apply to all mail - anything you want to see in HTML will need to be changed one by one by right clicking in the info bar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook does not do java or javascript. It does not do active content. If the virus came in from email, it was MSE that kicked it off - i had a similar problem with a website and it seemed to be installed when i ran MSE to get rid of it. (I switched to a
 different AV after that.) </p>
<p>ETA: plain text might not help if MSE installed it when it scanned the secure template folder. All attachments are written to the folder when you read a message.

            <p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping someone with your skills, knowledge, and experience would reply.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fully understand the plain text vs HTML part now.&nbsp; I suppose I can keep it HTML and skip over anything I'm not 100% sure about and then change to text and look at the others that way and then jump back to HTML when done.&nbsp; I don't suppose there's a way
 to program a button to jump back and forth using a macro or something to accomplish what's done in Trust Center or you'd have mentioned that.&nbsp; Sure would be a "nice to have" feature (alas).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offensive email has no apparent/obvious&nbsp;attachments - but I suppose they could rather easily&nbsp;be buried and simply not showing (intentionally).&nbsp; I know it's a Java problem because it's Trojan:JS/BlacoleRef.AP (which I don't think I could get without Java)
 and the problem is better seen in the following compliments of PA Bear:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***********************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it's not java or active content in Outlook itself (per se), but if I understand correctly, it's likely from an MSE scan of the secure template folder in which the attachment (and I guess we have to then assume one exists or this otherwise could not be
 happening if the java can only be in the attachment and not in the&nbsp;body of the email (HTML or not)&nbsp;since only it can contain java-based code which would cause even a preview with pushing no buttons or merely hovering to ID the true links behind the visible
 ones can activate the problem)&nbsp;is the culprit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That begs&nbsp;a couple of questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Can one turn off&nbsp;Outlook's recognition of attachments&nbsp;(so to speak) so that Outlook sees nothing to move to the secure template folder and thus MSE has nothing there to scan&nbsp;(but hopefully still show the attachment icon even if it can't be accessed or
 viewed or moved to the secure template folder or scanned - but OK if it doesn't show the icon&nbsp;but can otherwise be done)?&nbsp; If possible, only in the preview, but global (like text vs HTML) if that's the only way?&nbsp; And can this be done so that when turned back
 on the attachments are/were not lost but become recognized with the icon visible&nbsp;(and I suppose moved&nbsp;in batch or as needed or&nbsp;if the email is viewed "again" to the secure template folder&nbsp;like normal once re-enabled again).&nbsp; This way I could keep it off unless
 there was a specific email with an attachment&nbsp;I wanted to see and otherwise&nbsp;avoid all movement to the secure template folder so MSE would see nothing to scan and thus avoid this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Can movement of attachments to the secure template folder be limited to only if the email is actually opened but "blocked" if the email is only viewed in preview mode?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Can I rename that folder so Outlook cannot send attachments there unless I change the name back (so I rename it unless I have an attachment I want to open and then I change the name back before opening any attachment) safely (so I don't allow myself to
 become infected) and without causing some type of error in Outlook about unable to find the folder or something like that with all emails or all emails with attachments?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. What is the path to the secure template folder?&nbsp; I'm wondering if I can exclude that folder in MSE if the attachment isn't actually being run until I request it or fully open the email (vs. being run without my consent).&nbsp; If that's safe, then I can exclude
 the folder unless there's an attachment I want to see (which doesn't happen all that often) and then first go to MSE to remove the exclusion before opening the attachment to protect myself if it is infected.&nbsp; Periodically, I could turn off the excusion and
 scan just that folder to confirm no infected attachments I've excluded exist and deal with them all at once (and I'd normally expect none or only a rare one like this one to pop up).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, it's not convenient, but my "home" is V&amp;M and I MUST be using MSE to be able to see problems (like the current definition problem compared to the MMPC change log) and help people properly (something I can't do with a different&nbsp;primary real-time AV program
 because only one can be&nbsp;installed at the same time)&nbsp;- just as I imagine you aren't using Lotus Notes or Thunderbird or even WLM (though you may have them installed for comparisons and related questions as well as probably almost every version of Outlook ever
 made even if you really use only one).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence, is there ANY safe way out of this mess (even if complicated) like I imagined above or that I don't know enough about Outlook to even consider (or that I'm considering but isn't safe because of how Outlook actually works - as with the MSE exclusions)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I promise this is the last time I'll ask.&nbsp; I love Outlook and I love MSE and don't intend to abandon either of them.&nbsp; I've been with both since the beginning.&nbsp; I must keep MSE if a choice is the only choice (but if&nbsp;WE can't find a way for two major MSFT
 products to work together without infecting users, then I consider it a very sad day for MSFT indeed).&nbsp; I'm not trying to coax you back to MSE, but I'm asking you to consider the situation&nbsp;being that use of MSE and Outlook&nbsp;together is mandatory&nbsp;(I'll help
 if you have any MSE questions) and see what comes to mind to workaround this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity though, what AV program do you use that doesn't cause this problem and, if not, then how does that program protect you from infections from email attachments if it doesn't scan them (or is it a matter of when it scans them which I suppose
 is what I'm trying to change by some of the above {perhaps somewhat lunatic} suggestions).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for a helpful response which really should be the answer and would be the answer if I weren't so determined to find a workable solution aside from removing Java and that may not be 100% either&nbsp;(and in any case,&nbsp;also isn't an option for me because
 of the enterprise system to which I often need to connect where it is mandatory).&nbsp; I'm sorry to take so much time with this but I'd really like to find a way for both products to work in harmony and still keep people safe even if a complex setup or annoying
 procedure is necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With much appreciation,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I'll look over this better when I'm on my computer, but from a quick peruse of the email source on my iPad, there is no scripting in it. If so, you'd &nbsp;need to visit the site to be hit. If I missed scripting, outlook won't run it unless you open the message
 using 'view in browser '
<div><br />
<div>Outlook writes everything to the secure temp folder, where the virus scanner scans it. This includes HTML bodies, last time I checked.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; No rush - take your time.&nbsp; Do keep in mind that a review of the legit version (assuming that's what you got)&nbsp;may (probably doesn't) contain everything in the fake ones that infect just by mousing over the links or&nbsp;previewing&nbsp;- which besides being
 different may also include the java exploit scripts&nbsp;that probably don't exist in the legitimate one (which may contain no java or other scripts at all for all I know).&nbsp; But it DID infect me that way and I certainly did not use the browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dare not send you the infected version I have deleted (but not fully removed yet in case it proves useful in resolving the problem later to have such a seriously dangerous fake for analysis), but some of the articles discuss how it exploits the java "hole",
 but I don't know if just having Java installed is enough to make&nbsp;using HTML vs text allow the attack even if Outlook technically doesn't use java.&nbsp; Could the HTML include java and just the mouseover image or process be the way it gets in?&nbsp; Can the email itself
 - which almost looks like it might be an image (and looks much different text only) - be HTML-based AND include the java script so text only would actually work to avoid the problem (even if the email would contain the infection if ever viewed using HTML and
 thus never be cleaned until that point)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know very little (next to nothing) about the details of HTML or Java or how Outlook treats such code.&nbsp; I'm beginning to get the idea that while Outlook may not technically use Java, that if it includes HTML in what goes to the Secure Temporary Folder and
 not just attachments {I suppose that shows my lack of understanding of Outlook if HTML is considered to be an attachment} and the HTML includes Java script (or IF it could), then that might explain how just clicking on the email to see a preview and doing
 nothing else could cause a java-based exploit (or whatever else could be buried in HTML - maybe C++ or other script/code so it might eventually go beyond just java) to be "a new entry or entries in that folder", scanned, recognized as malware by MSE {thank
 heavens}, and cleaned/quarantined.&nbsp; What's odd (though perhaps reasonable because it was cleaned and not directly quarantined) is that the location of the malware that was quarantined was:
</p>
<p>C:\Users\Kosh\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\QKEVNJEK\index[1].htm and not this Secure Temporary Folder (wherever that is).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Anyway, thanks again.&nbsp; It sounds like much progress has been made and things look far less gloomy than they did yesterday and I'm feeling much more optimistic.&nbsp; Thank heavens I reached you because I'm too weak in this area to have known anywhere near enough
 to have thought about what you just mentioned and are now considering.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm already thinking about whether to just point to this thread in those other threads or come up with a more succinct summary to help those using this method (which may also help others who know more about other email programs and browsers with add-ons
 but not&nbsp;through hotmail or outlook.com).&nbsp; Does that give you an idea of how encouraged I'm feeling now after hearing&nbsp;your latest ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much!&nbsp; But take your time.&nbsp; While it would be nice to help them ASAP, as I know we both believe, a great answer that takes a while is far better than a merely adequate one which is better than saying it can't be done&nbsp;because the latter two are
 faster and don't take as much work.&nbsp; You've proven that to me here already and in the many other excellent posts of yours I've viewed.&nbsp; You can see my belief in it either by visiting V&amp;M or by the fact that I'm here asking for help on this tough problem partly
 for me but also because I want to help more in the other threads where this remains uncovered - even if it ends up only being an explanation of why nothing can be done (though I'm convinced/hopeful there's a solution even if it may be complex, annoying, partial,
 or have unpleasant side-effects or ramifications).</p>

            <p>I got the real one with the email.microsoft.com links (path coded with a key which is a bad idea IMO).&nbsp; I'm trying karpasky (sp?) right now. I have no idea if it's going to be any better against this exploit... and I don't feel like finding an infected site
 to see if it does a better job. &lt;g&gt; What is the point in AV software if it installs the bugs you're trying to keep out?
</p>
<p>I had the 'your hard drive is damaged' hit a few weeks ago (got it from a link on the MSN homepage no less), for the second time in 2 months&nbsp;(brand new laptop, used the factory reset after the first hit)-&nbsp;I was suspicious that the first hit infected the
 2 OEM partitions - i deleted them, reformatted&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;installed win8. Have not installed Java on this system yet (still getting everything else reinstalled for the 3rd time) and i don't think i will. I'm undecided about removing it from the other computers...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. No, you can't turn off attachments. You can turn off the ability to automatically download external content - I keep it off by default since only bulk mail uses external content and it takes a second to enable it for the messages where i want to see the
 images. &nbsp;If jar in the one exploit is external content, this will prevent it's download.
</p>
<p>Using plain text should prevent outlook from writing to secure temp just by viewing. I'll look into a macro to toggle plain text off and on.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. How&nbsp;attachments and securetemp&nbsp;behaves depends on the version, so watch the folder with Outlook 2007 and see how it works on your install. Outlook 2013 is only saving the attachments if they are opened, not just viewed. Older versions wrote the files
 when the message was viewed. Then there was an update to 2007 that changed the secure temp behavior (it does a better job at removing files left behind), but i didn't do a lot of investigation&nbsp;into what other behaviors it changed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Outlook will recreate the secure temp folder if you delete or rename it. Honestly, Outlook will not run the virus and the antivirus software *should* stop it, so this step would not be necessary.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. To&nbsp;see the Outlook Secure Temp folder, type shell:cache in the address bar of win explorer. The attachments are in Content.Outlook. It writes html email content (downloaded content)&nbsp;&amp; social connector stuff (photos etc) to the Content.IE folder.</p>
<p>I wouldn't want to exclude the folder, but if MSE is kicking&nbsp;off the installer.... if you never open attachments (disable reading&nbsp;pane preview and&nbsp;save the attachments yourself before opening)&nbsp;you'll be as safe as you are now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know in both of my cases, i forced the browser closed and rather than getting rid of the files manually, i ran MSE (it never detected a thing until I did a manual scan) and that is when it was installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook is not the problem. It does not "do" active content. Mail is viewed in the Restricted zone, scripts will not run. While reading in plain text is safest, reading HTML (with external content blocked) in the reading pane is a tiny bit safer than opening
 it. If saving a file to the temp folder 'runs' the file, the problem is not with Outlook, but with Windows and the antivirus software that is supposed to be protecting you.</p>

            <p><strong>Could the HTML include java and just the mouseover image or process be the way it gets in?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I'm not a java expert but outlook saving the file shouldn't cause it to be run. If the java hole is so bad that saving a jar to the hard drive runs it, then java needs to be removed from computers. No 'if ands or buts' - it needs to be gone. Yesterday.
</p>
<p>Mouseovers in outlook shouldn't run java because outlook doesn't run scripts. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Re:&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\QKEVNJEK\index[1].htm and not this Secure Temporary Folder (wherever that is).
</strong></p>
<p>The secure temp folder is in TIF and is&nbsp;called Content.Outlook. Outlook also uses the TIF folder for&nbsp; blocked external content and social networking stuff... but are you sure the index.htm file was from an outlook email?

<p>On the sample from Rutgers, the last line is </p>
<p>&lt;img src="http://infected-site/WXVgYmMJ/index.html"&gt;</p>

<h2>            App purchased from dite, not appearing on phone</h2>
                    I've 'purchased' a free app from the Marketplace site, signed on my phone as per the install instructions, but the app is nowhere to be seen.
<div>I'm running a cooked ROM with WM6.5 and have already 'purchased' and installed 5 apps, albeit directly from my phone.</div>
<div>Even doing a search for said app in my phone comes back with no results.</div>
<div>App in question is Home Screen Customizer.</div>

                </div>

            Live account is the same, I think I may of discovered the problem, the app seems to be for United States and I'm in the UK, seems that my PC marketplace live account was defaulted to US, which is I could see it, but my phone account defaults to UK, I'm
 going to see if tricking my phone into thinking it's in US makes it appear, I will post back later and let you know the results

    <title>How to display Latex equations automatically in Word&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tahmid nafee  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to display Latex equations automatically in Word&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a block of text that looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The fuzzy value of the variable x_{j} be denoted
 by A_{\circ,j}, and the representative value \text{rep}(A) of a triangular fuzzy set A be defined as the mean of the X coordinates of the triangle's three odd points: the left and right extremities of the support a_{0}, a_{2} (with membership values = 0),
 and the normal point a_{1} (with membership value =1).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are latex equations inside this block of text. When I paste it into word, I would love for a way to automatically generate the equations from the latex code. Is there some way to do this? Thanks.</p>

<p>You cannot create or edit equations in Word Online (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Differences-between-using-a-document-in-the-browser-and-in-Word-3E863CE3-E82C-4211-8F97-5B33C36C55F8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Differences-between-using-a-document-in-the-browser-and-in-Word</a>).
 To do anything with math areas, you must choose the "Edit in Word" command to download the document into desktop Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In desktop Word, you can indeed convert text in LaTeX format to Word equations. The steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the text representing a single equation or math expression.</li><li>Press Alt+= or click Insert &gt; Equation to create a math object containing the selected text. This causes the Equation Tools context tab to appear on the ribbon.
<ul>
<li>In the Equation Tools ribbon, if the LaTeX button isn't selected yet, click it. Then it should stay selected for the rest of the current Word session.</li></ul>
</li><li>At this point you have two choices: You can click the down arrow at the right end of the current equation and click Professional (but you'd have to do this individually for each equation), or you can wait until you've marked mos or all of the math areas
 as equations and then click "All - Professional".</li></ul>

            <p>Are you sure it is not chat messages you are receiving? Texts sent to one number will never appear on another phone. The chat messages are associated with the accounts on your phone.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also note if you performed a restore of your old phone when setting up the new one, all old messages will appear on the new phone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you do not intend to use your old phone, you should <em>definitely</em> factory reset it since it holds your Microsoft Account etc.</p>

<p>Hi Cole,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my understanding and test, the News web part displays news posts which we create and store in the Site Pages library from this group site. So, when you add the second or third News web part, they are actually the same one as the first one. It cannot
 be used to just display one specific news post in each news web part. </p>

            You can't. Unlike Office for Windows, the Mac versions UI can only be displayed in the specific language you buy.<br />

If you have access to an English copy you can install it in place of your present language version using your same Product Key.<br />
<br />
Language of the text in your documents is up to you based on the Language formatting you choose to use. In Tools&gt; Language you can specify the Default to be used for new documents &amp; set the language formatting of selected text. Language formatting -- as with
 any other formatting -- is best done in the Styles used to format your documents.<br />

<h2>            Sync Freezes - and Files Missing From OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Ok Community....OneDrive for Business newbie...and frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows 10</li><li>All Updates are current</li><li>New Install of OneDrive (3 days ago)</li><li>I don't want ANY of my doc files on my laptop....I want them all on OneDrive ONLY</li><li>I moved ALL of the docs from my laptops Documents folder, to OD</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PROBLEMS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>MISSING DOCS</strong>
<ol>
<li>I have docs which DO SHOW when I access it from my laptops file explorer</li><li>However, these files DO NOT SHOW on my OneDrive iPhone APP, and DO NOT SHOW when viewing the folders via IE.</li></ol>
</li><li><strong>SYNC IS SEEMINGLY TAKING DAYS:</strong>
<ol>
<li>If I look at the OD icon info, it will be uploading at 39.6KB (wifi) &nbsp;However, it will at some point just freeze and the sync is not completing.</li></ol>
<p>My guess is that the "missing docs" is as a result of the sync not completing and/or freezing.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>WHAT HAVE I DONE:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Rebooted the laptop</li><li>Forced the stop of OD
<ol>
<li>Then I Restarted OD</li></ol>
<p>NOTE: &nbsp;There are NO listed sync errors. &nbsp;While there were a few the other day, while using the "#" symbol. &nbsp;I changed the filenames and this did not cure ANY of the above problems.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Lastly, I am on a TRIAL of this program, and hoping that there will be a simple fix so that I do not have to look at other options like Google Drive or DropBox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

this article</a> and try steps below:<br />
1. Download and run the <a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            posting fractions in excel and not converting to date</h2>
                    I am trying to copy and past grades from a web screen into an excel spreadsheet.&nbsp; The grades are in the form of (correct)/(possible) like 88/100 or 8/10 and when I post the grades many convert to a date.&nbsp; if I change the format to text the dates change
 to a number.&nbsp; if I format the cells before pasting then when I past the data in it changes the format back to general.&nbsp; Is there a way to past a large amount of data with "3/3" and "8/10" with out having excel change it to a date by adding "/2015" to the data
 and making the data useless?

 an old XP laptop I do get a message it says the device has malfunctioned. The phone works perfcetly well in every other respect.</p>

Have you tried plugging the device into another USB port and trying a known good cable?</p>
<p>Is there a problem with charging it?&nbsp; It could be a connector failure on the device.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>

</p><p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience this has&nbsp;caused you. </p>

<p>
</p><p>The updates are intended to introduce new&nbsp;features, improve existing ones and fix bugs. Once the older version retires, you won't be able to sign in until you

            The E61i *DOES* have a Java Virtual Machine, but like virtually all mobile devices, it is the so called J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition) Java (also known as MIDP/CLDC).<br />
<br />
Most web sites require J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition) as is available on PC's (Windows, Mac, Linux). Such J2SE Java "applets" will not work on mobile phones, I'm afraid.<br />
<br />

            Unfortunately the JVM on the E61i at least with the firmware version I have is severely degraded (i.e. very very slow, esp saving to recordstore and slow key response and screen repaint) to the point of total unusability!

            There is no "standard version JVM". There are three different Java specifications; J2ME ( Java 2 Micro Edition), J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition ) and J2EE ( Java 2 Enterprise Edition ).<br />
<br />
Then there is a multitude of different Java VM implementations from various vendors/manufacturers for all these Java versions. All with their own quirks, extensions, defects, etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the J2ME implementation in Symbian/S60 is, as far as I know, based on the J2ME Java VM from Sun, so it is as compatible as they come. ( There is no complete J2SE version that is small enough to run on mobile phones yet; some partial implementations
 on some [older] models, only. )

            Those phones already have the Java runtime for J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition), also known as MIDP/CLDC.<br />
<br />
There is no Java runtime for J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition), sometimes just called JRE, Java Runtime Environment for those phone models (or any phone model I know of).

            J2ME is the Java version designed to run on Mobile phones. If you're trying to run an applet that was designed for the J2SE ("Standard Edition")--it will not run on mobile phones.<br />
<br />
OK, despite what all the "E90 is not a communicator" folks out there want, all Symbian-based devices (including the E61i) are CELLPHONES FIRST. If someone looking for something that gives them all the power of their laptop, they're looking in the wrong place.
 Especially for us Symbian people, it's likely the best that we'll ever do is the J2ME version.<br />
<br />
Of course J2ME is very powerful in its own right... but Java applications have got to be specifically written for it.<br />
<br />
If that's not good enough, you might want to look at the more powerful of the Windows Mobile devices. They too have J2ME, but people have ported J2SE to it such as the Mysaifu JVM (<a href="http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~dat/java/project/jvm/index_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~dat/java/project/jvm/index_en.html</a>).
 Of course, this is "hackware" and you'll probably run into lots of oversights and incompatibilities with a typical J2SE app anyway... but it's about the only way in the near future where you can even hope to get a full J2SE JVM working in a pocket-sized device;
 Also remember that the power comes at a price: typical Windows Mobile PDAs that have the power to run a full J2SE rarely has the battery life necessary for a true road warrior.<br />
<br />
Cheers.

            <p>While I don't believe Outlook 2016 knows about all the new TLDs that have been created, it'd fairly easy to create a rule that looks in the message headers for those.</p>

            <p>Be judicious in the use of a rule like this because it will also fire on domains like "topnotch.com" or "spacescience.org". It doesn't matter where in the header the substrings occur. If they start a string, the rule will detect them.</p>

            I handled this by including the dot as in '.top' or '.xyz'. This seems to work quite well.<br />

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No the Cortana (and Task View) icon cannot be moved, but there certainly should not be that gap that you appear to have. There have been some issue with scaling in the prior build(s) which has been fixed but maybe you are seeing a remnant of this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Make sure the Taskbar&nbsp; is not locked (right-click Taskbar), drag it to the side and back to the bottom.</p>
<p>if that fails to correct the issue:</p>
<p>2) Toggle a different Scaling value (right-click Desktop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either method should force a re-arrange of the icons in your Taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just out of interest, do you have an 'exceptional' monitor, say a 4K monitor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>
<p>

            Just make sure that your internet works.<br />
Just open default browser and open youtube.com site. If flash video player is used to play YouTube video, if your internet connection is slow, switch to standard video player.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.

<h2>            &#34;Cancel editing mode&#34; error message in PPt or Excel</h2>
                    Editing data in old PowerPoint slides became impossible just after mid July when Office for Mac 2011 Version 14.2.3 was installed. Now I get a message ordering me to "cancel editing mode" in MS Excel. None of the solutions posted here work.<br />
<br />
I suspect Version 14.2.3 is worse than its predecessor. Can I go back and install the OLDER VERSION of Office 2011?

<h2>            Windows 10 for Phones, Build 10136, Usability</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really got the feeling Microsoft tries to convert a full dektop Computer experience to a small mobile screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I installed Build 10136 on my 930. OK, after a hard reset (defently needed or you like bugs) it feels much smoother than 10080. But, here is the thing:</p>
<p>Usabilty is now so much more complex, that I Need much more time to do Basic Business on my phone than in WP8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g.: </p>
<p>Outlook Mail vs. WP8.1 Mail:</p>
<p>- I have 4 mailboxes. In 8.1 it was easy to Combine them in a connected Mailbox. After all I also use many Outlook rules at my Exchange mailboxes, e.g. sorting mails in different locations right after arrival. So what I had to do in my connected mail box
 was to just sync the Folders, were my rules Point to. Et voila: Everytime I open my connected Mailbox i click the menu and folders. There I could see all Folders I Need from all mailboxes connected with one Scrolling down. Estimated time: 20 seconds to check
 all mail boxes.</p>
<p>And now with Outlook Mail from Windows 10 for Phones: oh my fu***** god. No connected mailboxes available anymore. The syncronisation with the underfolders (were my rules Point to) is the same like in 8.1. BUT: Now I have to open every single Mailbox manually
 wich takes for ever and ever. From 10080 to 10136 they also changed&nbsp;the view when you have more than 2 Mailboxes. in 10080 they&nbsp;were all among themselves, just need to scroll down to see the other mailboxes. In 10136 the added a new button: View More (or View&nbsp;All)
 wich will lead into another menu to look at, another click to do, another waste of time!&nbsp;I don 't want to go into detail with bugs, but there are a lot. (After selecting a Mailbox in "view all" it crashes / Mailboxes from an Exchange Server with selfsigned
 certs won't work...blabla error with cert... and so on)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook Calender:</p>
<p>To make it short: There is more or less only a full day view and a work list. Changing the year to make an entry will lead into scrolling every single day.... have fun. More clicks, less fun.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spartan Favorites:</p>
<p>More clicks to do then in IE in WP8.1.</p>
<p>No sync</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So thats a small amount of things, but the most&nbsp; important for me. Don't get me wrong. I am with the time and I like progress. But I was a beta tester for years beginning with WP7 up to WP8.1. Now it feels really OK with 8.1. It's fast, easy usabilty, unified
 approach. With 10 I don't see an approach in usabilty. It's catching some IOS and Android things and putting them together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>just my2cents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS.: It's not my mother language :-)</p>

                    <p>We use an internal SMTP server in our company in order to send links for subscription (carpool.be, etc)</p>
<p>These mails however are regarded by Outlook as suspicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>We also added an SPF record for smtp.taxistop.be, but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the outlook settings there is an option (filters &amp; reporting) "Show attachments, pictures, and links for senders with good reputations"</p>
<p>What does this actually mean? How is Outlook determining whether a sender "has a good reputation" or not?</p>

            <p>The answer is not helpful. I can understand that you choose to delete items from senders that do not have a good reputation.
</p>
<p>The question is: <strong>How do you decide the reputation of a sender?</strong></p>
<p>For instance: do senders with more that 12 characters in the name have a bad reputation?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In determining Sender Reputation, many companies use Bayesian Spam Filtering method. This method uses series of word-use to identify spam e-mail. There is an algorithm involved to categorize those words. Example of those words are "free" or words in all
 caps. As technology goes, spammers found a way to bypass this method. Anti-spam filters pursued a better way to identify spam from permission-based email marketing messages. By creating a profile of what a spammer looks like based on sending and user behaviors,
 mailbox providers and anti-spam solution providers were able to do a much better job of keeping spam out of their users’ inboxes.
<br />
<br />
This also provided a more predictable framework for senders on what to do, and what not to do to get their emails delivered to their users’ inboxes. This is what sender reputation is all about.<br />
<br />
So using this method, Outlook detects the "reputation" of the sender and acts accordingly.</p>
<p>
