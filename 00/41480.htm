<h2>            My mp3 files are being turned into .temp files</h2>
                    So I have my mp3s on my xp server and i added this music directory to my win 7 htpc and also my win 7 work computer.<br />
<br />
I noticed earlier that some of my mp3's have been renamed to ~partialfilename.tmp<br />
At first I didnt pay much attention but ive just been looking at my albums on my work computer in media player and i noticed tracks are missing - I looked in the folders and the original mp3 files have gone and are now generic tmp files.<br />
<br />
what is this about? Are my files destroyed????

<p><span><span>Hi buggerlugs,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>We would like to get more information from you, to help troubleshoot your issue. Please answer the following questions
 as best you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Is your work computer connected to Domain?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>When was the last time it was working?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>First I would suggest that you run an online virus scan on the computer to check and run any virus

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is not fixed after the scan completes would suggest to check in the safemode if you
 face similar issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            Hi<br />
My computer have always run okay.<br />
<br />
1. I'm not on a domain<br />
2. its always working fine<br />
3. Yes I have nod 32 on all machines and firewalls.<br />
<br />
My network is simple. I have 3 computers, a cable modem/router and a switch. I use static ip addresses.<br />
<br />
1. Server (XP Pro) with all my files on - virus free. Ive not touched anything on this machine.<br />
2. htpc that accesses my media from the server - previously had vista ultimate on with no problems. virus free.<br />
3. work computer that previously had XP on with no problems. Virus free.<br />
<br />
I updated my htpc and work computers both with windows 7 pro. <br />
<br />
I had only accessed my music from the htpc via media center. <br />
<br />
It was later on I tried to add my servers music folder to the music library on my work computer that I noticed files were missing or changed.
<br />
I then looked on the server and saw several files had been renamed and broken, these were all files i had played on the htpc via media center earlier on.<br />
I assumed they would revert back as they were 'tmp' files but they havent, they are also much smaller in file size.<br />
<br />
Incidentally the songs still appear in meda center and still play.<br />
<br />

            update<br />
<br />
I started looking for my files because they still play on my htpc via media center and i found full undamaged files in the library on my htpc.<br />
<br />
so im totally confused my this - why has windows (or media center or media player) moved my original files off a server, copied them locally and ruined the originals?<br />
I would like to understand what is happening here and stop it from happening.

            It works, I just can't figure out how to get it to see my speakers as a subwoofer. Is it possible to get it to see it as a subwoofer or no?<br />

            <p><span>Hello PULIVIJAY SAGAR,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your issue in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with Office and Inbuilt Webcam on your laptop after upgrading to Windows 8. I will definitely assist you regarding this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Which edition of Windows 8 have you installed on the laptop?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have Windows 8 RT edition, then you will be having Office Home and Student 2013 RT preinstalled. But other two editions Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro doesn’t have office in it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To reinstall Office 2010 on Windows 8, I would suggest you to check with
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010">
Office Support</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Run “Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter” to diagnose the exact issue. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer was installed correctly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press “Windows key + W”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “Troubleshooting” without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select “Hardware and Sound” from the Troubleshooter Window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select “Hardware and Devices” under Devices option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Follow the On Screen instructions.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Since Windows 8 drivers is not available from manufacturer, download the latest driver for Windows 7 and install it in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Program compatibility is a mode in Windows that lets you run programs written for earlier versions of Windows. Most programs, games and drivers written for Windows Vista and Windows 7 also work in Windows 8 Release Preview, but some older programs
 might run poorly or not run at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Download the latest Windows 7 driver from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.sony.co.in/support/product/VPCEB24EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sony.co.in/support/product/VPCEB24EN</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on the setup file of the driver and select “Properties”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select “Compatibility” Tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Place a check mark next to “Run this program in Compatibility mode” and select Windows 7 from the drop down list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps you to fix the issue. Still if you have issue with the webcam then reply us to this thread, we are glad to assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>Thankyou indeed Mr. Sathish for your reply.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have&nbsp; purchased Windows 8 Pro, as suggested&nbsp; on line.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windows 8 Pro downloaded&nbsp; which took almost 9 hours&nbsp; for download.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was successfully installed,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; Windows office and&nbsp; Web cam software&nbsp;
 totally disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am unable to understand.&nbsp; Office 2010 software was part of OEM&nbsp; with Windows 7 with this laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please advise, whether I should&nbsp; purchase afresh&nbsp; W.Office ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regard to Web cam,&nbsp; I will be trying the route, as suggested by you,&nbsp; however, it is disheartening to note that why Sony has not been taken into confidence&nbsp; wwhile formulating the&nbsp; download procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; am now facing hurdles&nbsp; from the day, I purchased&nbsp;
 Window 8 Pro</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have had my Surface Pro4 for 3 months and in fact since the beginning I have the problem with fan. It makes a very loud sound when it runs. Is it normal or I should sort it out? I attached the link of sounds of my fan.</p>

<h2>            I have been hacked</h2>
                    <p>i have been hacked in the past several times both me( in uk)&nbsp;my partner in peru and all our family etc. when hacked last time contacted msn was told well obviously you have been hacked here is a password reset link! i am sad and also very angry toward that
 attitude as i am sure if a business i would have been dealt with differently. i got told use security, i was, microsofts very own lol they breezed through it! infact it was me myself got suspicious and ran a malware programme as it was not picked up. well
 now i have&nbsp; good security in bullguard and have had network attacks several times but todays attack was sustained. it was 5 minutes long scanning my ports&nbsp;i have the ip address, though when checked it came up as googles own hq i also have address name and
 mac address though i suppose nothing will be done as usual?If&nbsp; nothing done this time i think will get a different os and advise all i know to also as is pathetic there are obviously many loopholes in windows security.</p>

            <p>Anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti-malware programs do not necessarily protect you&nbsp;againist hackers, this is more a function of a firewall. There are essentially two types of firewalls, software and hardware. In addition to the Windows software firewall,
 I'd suggest that you install a router with a hardware firewall between your Internet connection and computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many years ago I remember getting many intrusion attempts hourly even though I had (supposedly) an excellent software firewall. Once I inserted a router with a hardware firewall these attempts disappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article below provides tips for protecting your system:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>, , , if installed a hard firewall will it protect me from a pc in my network if they are hacked?</blockquote>
<p><br />
I'll use my home network as an example to answer&nbsp;your above question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My network consists of my cable modem then the router then my computers and devices. My network consists of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 Windows 7 Professional x64&nbsp;desktops&nbsp;- wired</p>
<p>1 Windows XP Professional x86&nbsp;desktop - wired</p>
<p>1 Windows XP Home Edition x86&nbsp;desktop - wireless</p>
<p>2 Windows 7 Home Premium x64&nbsp;laptops - wireless</p>
<p>1 TV - wired</p>
<p>1 Blu-ray home threatre - wireless</p>
<p>1 Gaming console - wireless</p>
<p>Plus several virtual machines on the 2 Win7 Pro desktops (MS Virtual PC and VirtualBox), the WinXP Pro desktop (MS Virtual PC 2007) and one of the Win7 Home Premium laptops (VirtualBox). All of the virtual machines (when running) are accessible on the network.
 The virtual machines include 1-Windows 98, 1-Windows 98 SE, 2-Windows XP Mode x86, 3-Windows Vista all x86, 3-Windows 7 1-x64 and 2-x86,&nbsp;and the Windows 8 Developers Preview x64.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the above are protected by the hardware firewall in the&nbsp;router plus all the computers and virtual machines&nbsp;have&nbsp;their individual software&nbsp;firewalls (I use the built-in Windows firewall).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should a hacker break-through the router's firewall into a single computer, it would make the other computers more vulnerable as only their software firewalls would remain, but it would not automatically&nbsp;grant them access to the other computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to answer your question: No - once&nbsp;a hacker broke through the router into a single computer it would no longer protect the other computers in the network, the other computer's protection would then fall onto their individual software firewalls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all that said, if a hacker is smart enough, they can break through any firewall, but for a home network having both a hardware and software firewall is about the best you can do. Large corporations and governments spent countless $$ on protecting themselves
 from hackers and then, occasionally, this is still not enough as someone will still break through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've included the two links below as they have some good information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Carnegie Mellon University<br />
CERT Coordination Center<br />
Home Network Security<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/home_networks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/home_networks.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Making your network more secure<br />
</strong>(although this article is within the Windows Vista portion of Microsoft.com, the information is still good reading)<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that some of what I've provided helps you in protecting your network and&nbsp;to reduce your worrying as you can only do so much to protect yourself. If I could design a system that would totally protect&nbsp;a network from any kind of attack, I'd be rich and
 on a beach somewhere!</p>

    <title>Xbox One Poor Performance across many games. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Poor Performance across many games.</h2>
                    
<p>My gaming room has 2 tvs set up next to each other both with Xbox Ones. &nbsp;Makes it easy to compare performance. &nbsp;One of the Xbox ones is constantly preforming worse in games, have to hard reset it every few games so the frame rate stays at least playable
 in many games. &nbsp;Halo MC for example runs smooth on one xbox and stutters like crazy on the other. &nbsp;Borderlands has similar problems but that game is a mess anyways.</p>

<p>Might be Update related, didn't have this issue when playing Titanfall and Plants vs Zombies last year. &nbsp;IRRC even as recent as Evolve at launch didn't have this issue.</p>

<p>Any idea how to fix this, already reset xbox to factory. &nbsp;Is it possible to send it in for a replacement?</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don't have any more suggestions for you to try regarding the console acting up as it is, as you've pretty much covered all bases with the factory reset that I am aware of.</p>
<p>I can point you in the direction of the service centre though, who can assist with a replacement if that is what you're after:

<p>Yeah, personally it does seem like it could be a fault with the xbox. I know you've said you have hard reset the console, but have you power cycled, then unplugged the brick for a couple of minutes? So with the xbox on, hold down the power button for 10seconds
 until it turns off, then from there unplug the brick from the console and outlet, leave for a couple of minutes, then try again. Its really the only suggestion I have sorry.

<p>I have the exact same problem with my Xbox One. It started around mid march. Id have to hard reboot just to get the performance back to playable levels. Ive literally tried everything. Did you end up returning your Xbox to get repaired? Honestly I was thinking
 of selling mine and just getting a new one. I have no patience for Microsoft customer support, and Id rather not send my Xbox away for a few weeks when I use it every day. Heres the link for the long and descriptive post I made recently describing the same
 issue you are having. Maybe we can try to find similarities?</p>

<p>After I did the 2nd reset to factory haven't had the issues at all. &nbsp;Don't know if it was the cause but seems Borderlands problems were causing it for me. &nbsp;Haven't turned it back on (sold the game off) and haven't had any issues with any other games I've
 tried. &nbsp;I'd recommend factory reset if you can.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 freezes and random restarts.</h2>
                    Like the folks before me, I've been plagued by random restarts and freezes. I've tried pulling out one of my sticks of RAM &amp; running on 3GB (DDR2-6400) and, remarkably, the system seemed quicker... Go figure. Still, about 5 minutes after turning my pc
 back on, I encountered another freeze.&nbsp;One forum suggested it's a PSU issue. I was unaware Windows 7 was THAT much more of an energy hog than XP was. I ran the event viewer and actually DO have a critical event. It occured once in the last hour but it was
 event ID 41 Kernel-Power. Another code on there is an error event, event ID 7001. THAT occured 29 times in the last hour! Wow! Here's the rest of my setup:<br />
<br />
AMD Athlon X2 5600 @ 2.8 GhZ.<br />
now 3 GB PC2 6400 Ram<br />
Asus M3A MoBo<br />
NVIDIA GeForce 220 (with newest drivers, installed, uninstalled and reinstalled)<br />
PSU is 500W that came with the Smilodon case (which looks really cool!)<br />
<br />
ANY help would be greatly appreciated!!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p>Hi Denman0621,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Forums.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft Windows Forum.</p>
<p>Error ID 7001can be related to several sources, to troubleshoot this issue, we'd better get the exact source name where the error code comes from. Thus I recommend that you open Event Viewer to copy the detailed description of this error to this thread.</p>
<p>Check for error details</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press WIN + R to open a Run window.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type in eventvwr in the run box.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find these error and double click to open the Event Properties.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Copy and post in this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, I would like to share the following websites with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;EVENTID.NET</p>

<p>I'm trying out the new feature in the Xbox app that lets you edit your clips in any PC software and re-upload it to Xbox Live afterwards. I'm unsure of how I'm supposed to let the Xbox app know which game it's from though.</p>
<p>I downloaded lots of my Fallout 4 screenshots and clips directly from the Xbox app, loaded them up in Sony Vegas and made a little compilation. I saved the video back out as an mp4 file which is seen instantly by the Xbox app, and it lets me play it and
 rename it - but under Game it says 'unknown' </p>
<p>This makes sense, as it's a brand new video file with no way of knowing where it came from. So how am I supposed to upload this clip? It tells me it can't recognise the game when I press upload. Is there a step I'm missing?</p>

<p>Hey Mr Xbob,</p>
<p>I don't think you're missing a step here. We've had a few other users report this issue, so it could certainly be an issue with the Xbox app. If you haven't already, please submit feedback through the Xbox (beta) app and that will help to aid our investigation
 :) . </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey Mr XBob,</p>
<p>If it's working in the Xbox (beta) app it could be that we've already resolved the underlying issue and that fix just hasn't made it to the Xbox app as of yet. Glad to hear it's working in Xbox (beta) either way!</p>

<p>It takes a while, from a few hours to a whole day before you can share it - it's because it has to be moderated by Xbox staff.</p>
<p>Problem is, even though it takes that long, they don't seem to care what gets uploaded. People on the trending feed upload all kinds of random youtube rubbish (nothing to do with gaming) and it gets approved...</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t purchase apps in Windows 8 Store&#58; &#34;Your purchase couldn&#39;t be completed, something happened and your purchase couldn&#39;t be completed&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I attempt to purchase an app off of the store I receive the error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<strong>Your purchase couldn't be completed</strong> | <strong>something happened and your purchase couldn't be completed"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retrying results in the same error.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried most, if not all, solutions for this problem listed on the forums (setting location, date/time, resetting windows store cache, switching to local profile, using multiple PCs running different versions of Windows 8, using
<em>"sfc /scannow"</em> in an elevated command&nbsp;prompt,&nbsp;etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>This issue is not present on my windows phone 8 device.</li><li>At one point I was able to successfully purchase apps.</li><li>I recently configured a VPN (although disabling the VPN does not resolve the issue)</li><li>I run 2 Windows 8 PCs, and use the same Microsoft Account for both</li><li>I recently transferred an XBOX live gamer tag to&nbsp;my Microsoft Account</li><li>I have both a credit card and a PayPal account configured in my billing options</li><li>Recently the PayPal account was not authenticating properly on my windows phone, I deleted it and re-added it and it now works fine</li><li><strong>Inside the account settings for the store (Windows + C || Settings || Your Account || Payment and Billing Information) it says: "Before you can purchase an app you need to add a payment method to your account"&nbsp; When I click to add one it does NOTHING.&nbsp;
 At </strong><a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://account.live.com</strong></a><strong> billing options, there are two clearly listed and functional payment options.&nbsp; What is going on?</strong></li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's about all I can think to mention at the moment.&nbsp; I know that Microsoft is currently modifying parts of the Microsoft Account system, however I didn't think an error like this would be due to that.&nbsp; So let me know if there is anything I can do to immediately
 resolve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Ok, I solved the problem.&nbsp; I am still have issues using my PayPal account, however I am now able to use my credit card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Store app</li><li>Hit Windows Button + C, and select Settings</li><li>Select the menu labeled: <strong>Your Account</strong></li><li>Select <strong>"Change user"</strong>, and then <strong>Login to a DIFFERENT account.</strong> (I tried simply logging into the same account again, and it didn't work)</li><li>Select the <strong>Add Payment</strong> option (which should now work and load a menu)</li><li>Close the menu, and switch back to your previous account using <strong>Change User</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Add Payment</strong> option again, it should now actually open up. (Assuming it wasn't before, which for me it wasn't)</li><li>It will now allow you to add a payment, and I strongly suggest you re-add any payment options you currently have listed there.&nbsp; I think that there is an issue with the PayPal accounts especially.</li><li><strong>Buy your favorite apps again, finally.</strong></li><li>Done.</li></ol>
<p><br />
My PayPal account still will not work after this.&nbsp; Although, I think it has something to do with the "preferred payment method" settings in PayPal.&nbsp; It might be worthwhile to contact PayPal regarding this, because I am able to use regular credit cards perfectly
 fine after this "fix".</p>

    <title>Wrong &#34;Settings&#34; font size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrea pitto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong &#34;Settings&#34; font size</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am facing a strange problem with my new laptop. I actually got two brand new PCs, both Asus ZenBooks 14 with same specs, save for the different CPU, RAM amount and SSD. Also the first one sports a matte display while the second has a glossy one. I actually
 want to keep for myself just the second one, and then I copied all data and personalization from PC 1 (matte) to PC 2. They now have same programs and apps installed, same settings and same windows versions. Still, the PC 2 has a problem in settings app, in
 fact I noticed (and the screenshot will prove this) that PC 1 had smaller and nicer font size throughout the whole app. This does not apply in other microsoft apps (e.g. Maps, where as you can see both screenshots are exactly identical in terms of fonts and
 spacing). I included 2 screenshots from the xbox settings page since there is where the difference is evident the most, tough a closer look will lead to seeing the differences even between the other screenshots, i.e. the windows build page (both of them were
 taken when the vertical cursor on the right was at the lowest point possible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, both systems have the same dpi scaling (i mean the 150% suggested font and window zoom, given they have a 14" screen), and toggling that option does not solve the problem. Also, since I have the 1809 update, I can no longer find aid in control
 panel display options, because it has got removed. I have tried restating the PC, with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another strange thing I noticed is that if I try to set zooming to 100% (= no zooming), the xbox settings page still has that icon messed up, so my issue does not depend on that option at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(OS language is italian, sorry for the incovenience) Image order:</p>
<p>Windows version from PC 1,&nbsp; Windows version from PC 2, Xbox page from PC 1, Xbox page from PC 2, Maps from PC 1, Maps from PC 2<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1cbdbe2e-aee2-4dc8-9ecc-6a0c23dcb497?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1cbdbe2e-aee2-4dc8-9ecc-6a0c23dcb497?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63fde7dc-3b08-4f99-9bdf-f2e05de73ddf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63fde7dc-3b08-4f99-9bdf-f2e05de73ddf?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36aae13e-8435-4b20-bd23-192ce5504d37?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36aae13e-8435-4b20-bd23-192ce5504d37?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://files

            Hi Andrea
<br />
<br />I am sorry, I cannot read your screenshots . . .
<br />
<br />Since you have version 1809 of Windows installed on both systems, please check this setting
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App, go to Ease of Access - Display
<br />
<br />Is 'Make Text Bigger' set to the same size on both laptops?

<p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>Sadly, i had already checked that: they both have 100% here, the lowest possible value. I also tried to change it to another value then resetting it back to the default 100%, with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps If you cannot read due to the language that's ok since I just wanted to show the different in font size, which is still visible. If you mean that they are too big or corrupted or whatever i can upload them again.</p>

    <title>Gmail account in Mail App does not show attachments. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tejasvibhat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gmail account in Mail App does not show attachments.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see a few posts related to this but I want to make a detailed query. Recently upgraded to Windows 10 Home. Started using the Mail app to which I have added one Gmail account and two office365 mail accounts. The two office365 mail accounts seem to
 work perfectly but the gmail account has issues in terms of time it takes for the emails to show up and most mainly issue with attachments. If an email comes to my gmail account with attachments this is what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In edge if I open gmail, I can see the email and attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In MAIL app under the gmail account I get the email but there is no sign of the attachments. Its not a case of me not being able to open attachments but its more like the mail never had attachments.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This seems like a specific problem with gmail accounts on MAIL app (or could be non Microsoft email accounts). I say this because I used one of my office365 accounts (calling&nbsp;it account 1)&nbsp;to send a test email with attachments&nbsp;to the other office365
 account (account 2)&nbsp;and gmail account. The office account 2 received the email with all attachments but the gmail account received the email with no attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a big issue so please provide some solution or fix the mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tejasvi</p>

            <p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have finally fixed my issue&nbsp;by uninstalling Mail/Calendar and then re-installing from the store. Used the instructions from this link:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>http://www.howtogeek.com/224798/how-to-uninstall-windows-10s-built-in-apps-and-how-to-reinstall-them/
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought I would lose my Calendar entries but they are all still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tested attachments by sending from Gmail (PC) and also from iPad - both worked. Unfortunately still have issues with forwarded emails - iPad has option to include original attachments and that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also noticed that an email my wife received in Gmail had headers and original message that had been forwarded to several people. When opened in Mail for Windows 10 only the original message was shown - very strange (although in this case helpful since she
 wanted to post it to others).</p>

            <p>Did as you said but am continuing to face the problem. I send attachments using the MAIL app through another account to a gmail account. I check my gmail account on MAIL there is no attachments. But if I go to the browser and check gmail account the attachments
 are there.</p>

    <title>Why do Windows programmers have such a problem with log files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen_ford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do Windows programmers have such a problem with log files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As I understand it the log file is there to help solve problems by providing information. I suppose it could have legal overtone too in various scenarios. However, when a file is in a temporary folder, by its very location it's expendable. Therefore when
 a log file is in a temporary folder it's telling us that there is probably something wrong. If there is nothing wrong and it's in a temporary folder, then the Bl**dy software should tidy it up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have been mortified in my programming days if a user had levelled the complaint at me that my code had left lots of log files scattered around temp folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been plenty of issues posted where OneDrive goes into overdrive in filling up its log files. But I suggest that when OneDrive creates the&nbsp;aria-debug-xxxx log files it should delete them when the PC shuts down, or at the beginning of a new day,
 or at a user-configurable milestone. Leaving log files around is in my view and indication of an untidy mind. Do we want programmers like this working on Windows? For me it doesn't bode well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any chance that a log file may be required then it's not temporary. And at that point there needs to be some explanation of it's purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then there are other programmers who create systems (eg drivers) where it would be really handy to have a log file for debugging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in the Window's fraternity we get log files when they are of no use, and we don't get them when we need them. What sort of mindset operates like this? Nanny McPhee?</p>

    <title>New items on the desktop don&#39;t appear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thanatica  say:</h3>
<h2>            New items on the desktop don&#39;t appear</h2>
                    <p>When an application (ANY application, including but not limited to first-party apps) creates a new file (any type of file) on the desktop (i.e. C:\Users\[username]\Desktop), the file doesn't immediately appear. It also doesn't appear after a short delay
 of, say, a few seconds. It also doesn't appear after a minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get newly added files to appear, is to trigger a refresh on the desktop. So manually that means to F5 it. But there are other triggers that randomly cause a refresh, like (un)installing something, or dragging files to/from/on the desktop.
 When I drag a new file to the desktop, it does appear immediately. And when I delete a file from the desktop (directly on the desktop, or via an application that does it instead) the file also disappears right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this problem only pertains to new files that are added to the desktop, but not directly by me. Like when I've got notepad and save to the desktop. Or take a snippet and save its capture to the dsktop. In such (and other similar) cases, I have to press
 F5 on the desktop to make them appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be fixed so that files that are added to the desktop appear right away?</p>

            <p>When I try the Defender Offline tool, I get this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a71cd0d-a714-455e-9afd-3b7334aebc42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a71cd0d-a714-455e-9afd-3b7334aebc42" height="275" width="453" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have Defender on my system turned off since I have SpyBot installed. So I ran Spybot and found no malware (only some tracking cookies). I'm currently running a full virus scan as well, just in case, using Avast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, instead of using a tool to build an offline Defender USB stick, can I just download a prebuilt ISO somewhere? You'd think that makes it a billion times easier for both Microsoft and its users: no silly download manager to maintain, and
 a downloaded ISO is guaranteed to be complete and free of ****.</p>

<h2>            HDD to SDD OS transfer</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to clone (or even image) my 1TB-HDD to a Kingston 120GB-SDD. Space is not issue as I'm only using 70GB on the HDD. My problem is sector size. My HDD sectors are 512 (not 512e) and the SDD sectors are 4096. I'm also unable to use my system image/backup
 because it is on a HDD with the same sector size (512). I've tried a number of cloning programs, including Macrium Reflect, with no success. Is there a way around this?</p>

<p>If you need help just ask</p>
