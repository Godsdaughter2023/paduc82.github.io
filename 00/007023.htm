<h2>            Why can&#39;t I save a document with a question mark, colon, exclamation point, quotation marks, in the title</h2>
                    I have been using Word since 2003, and I have never understood what the deal is with saving a document title that has punctuation marks, particularly,&nbsp;&nbsp;question mark, colon, exclamation point, quotation marks. I am now using Office 2016/365, and I still
 can't. Why not?

<h2>            firewall messes with Bing and bing weather images.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using wifi for internet access.</p>
<p>Bing and Bing Weather do not display background images. for Bing I get the original space photo and a night sky photo is displayed as bing weather background, no matter what time of day or what weather we are having. temperature and other data are displayed
 properly, so I guess our firewall is blocking URL to those images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody knows URL of those images so I can test it manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I don't have this problem with bing weather app on my PC</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;fvp4ever,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this is information known only to the app developers. I suggest using communicating directly with them for the answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Bing Weather =&gt; touch the three ellipses "..." =&gt; send feedback =&gt; And in the box to improve the app, you can ask for the URL and leave your email address for feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI ... at work, I set our firewall to not block the following domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>bing.com</li><li>microsoft.com</li><li>xbox.com</li><li>live.com</li><li>outlook.com</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!<br />

            <p><strong>Hello all:</strong> </p>
<p>A frustrated lady named <strong>Debbi3</strong> in one of the many other threads on this issue has posted this solution in her particular thread. I am posting her workaround here for all, as we're well into the new year with no appreciable progress from
 the MotherShip to date:</p>
<p><em>Hello fellow Calendar users :-)</em></p>
<p><em>I ran out of patience - I used a site on the web that provides <strong>Public Holiday calendars for many countries (by state)</strong>and subscribed to that instead.</em></p>
<p><em>Now have the holidays for the next 3 years in my calendar. Took just a few minutes.</em></p>
<p><em>The site link is: </em><a href="http://holidays.kayaposoft.com/public_holidays.php?year=2013&amp;country=aus&amp;region=New+South+Wales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>http://holidays.kayaposoft.com/public_holidays.php?year=2013&amp;country=aus&amp;region=New+South+Wales</em></a></p>
<p><em>you can then select your own country and either download .ics file and import or simply copy the link they provide, click subcribe in Hotmail and paste the link.</em></p>
<p>Myself and many others in several countries have followed this link and are using the no charge offering in our own calendars. There are hols for a great many nations and tho' there are no guarantees, so far the system is appears bulletproof. Please fee
 free to try it for yourselves. </p>
<p>(<em>Note that this issue was first reported back in August 2012, as near as I can figure, and all of us have been receiving nowt but canned "we are working to resolve, but..." Until real progress is made, or MS simply licences the above offering, this seems
 to be a viable workaround</em>.) Hope it helps!</p>

    <title>Office 365 Mail attachment Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Mail attachment Issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a user that logs in to office 365 and goes to mail. When she tries to attach an email it says The following files couldn't be attached: filename. Please try again later. So I looked it up and it said it was a mailbox sending limit issue. However we
 do not have a limit and the file she is trying to attach is only 25kb big. The drag and drop into the email works fine however when she tries to click the attach button and go to my computer and select the file it fails. She has tried multiple browsers and
 different computer systems and the same issue happens. The weird thing is that when I went to troubleshoot the issue. I log in with my account and can attach a file just fine. I then log out and log into her account and attachment then works. However once
 the browser has been closed and reopened this issue reappears again. We tired Chrome, Firefox and IE and all do the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been working fine in till this last week. Nothing has been changed account side and no other people are having issues.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Brandon,<br />
<br />
Thanks for reporting the issue and letting us know the troubleshooting steps you’ve tried. To move forward with this case, I’d like to further check these details:<br />
1. Based on my experience, I suggest you clear the browser cache to see if there is any improvement.<br />
2. Does the issue merely occur to the small file which is 25 kb or all the other files when using the attach function?<br />
3. About ‘once the browser has been closed and reopened this issue reappears again’, may I confirm if you set up your account or hers at this time? If it’s her account, what if you enter your account again?
<br />
4. The detailed version of the Outlook Web App (e.g. 16.1579.10.2194415) in the affected account and your own account (which works fine). To get the version number, just right click any blank space in OWA and choose
<strong>View Page Source</strong>. </p>

            <p>1. I did clear the cache and even uninstalled and reinstalled the chrome browser.</p>
<p>2. It happens to any files not just that one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If i log in to hers, once the browser has been closed it still fails. However, when I log back into mine then log out and back to hers it works again in till the browser is closed and reopened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I can not get the version today because the library is closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>2. &nbsp;They do not have a local outlook client on the systems.</p>
<p>3. The browser i have uninstalled and reinstalled.</p>
<p>4. I switched to the light version and it works. I have her using this now and I don't think there will be a problem if she continues to use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I went to check it today. I tried it in the different browsers again. IE seems to work now and before it didn't. I checked the versions and it is 16.1589.11.2201636 for IE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Chrome it is 16.1549.7.2175991 and still doesn't work. Firefox still doesn't work as well but didn't get the version.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Brandon,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the detailed updates.<br />
<br />
From your description, I learnt that it worked well in OWA light version and started to work in IE. Since the OWA version in IE is higher than that in Chrome, the issue may have something to do with the OWA version. However, I have done some tests and noticed
 that the OWA version of the same account in different browsers should be the same. Therefore, I’d like to collect more OWA version numbers from your side for further analysis.<br />
1. Relevant screenshots about the OWA version of the affected account in IE, Chrome and Firefox.
<strong>NOTE: </strong>The steps to get the OWA version in Firefox are similar to that in other browsers. Just right click the blank space and choose

    <title>N80 Screen Not lighting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alison556  say:</h3>
<h2>            N80 Screen Not lighting</h2>
                    The screen stopped lighting up on my N80 on Saturday - the keypad still lights and the phone is working perfectly fine - just not lighting up - which is a bit of a problem!!<br />
<br />
Now here's where I have to get honest!<br />
<br />
It was dropped in the bath about 4 months ago (not by me, I have to add) and it's been working OK since but I have a feeling that this problem with the screen is probably the water damage catching up with it.<br />
<br />
Question is, is it worth repairing? The Nokia Service Centre said they could replace the screen no problem but is this probably just the start of the phone dying a death. If the board inside eventually dies, can that be replaced and is it financially viable
 do you think?<br />
<br />
I'm really just looking for an independant opinion cos the Service Centre guy is gonna repair it no matter what and no matter what he does, it's gonna cost me.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />
Alison

            Of course it’ll cost you… one way or another... it’s business sweetie – not humanitarian… I guess, your mobile damaged because of the impact when it fell not the water (unless you turn it on immediately without letting it dry completely)…<br />
<br />
…well, I suggest you let this technician evaluate the damage and estimate the cost to repair it… ask also the reliability once it is fix… then balance, is it worth to repair or buy new one?<br />
<br />
…goodluck!

            Thank you for the reply.<br />
<br />
I didn't type what I meant very well!! I wasn't expecting work done for nothing LOL it was the fact that the engineer was a bit vague in that I asked him if it was worth fixing, ie was it just going to develop one fault after another, but he just wanted to
 fix the existing problem and take it from there.<br />
<br />
Anyway, your comment about impact has rung a bell. I had the phone in one of these body glove things and I'd attached it to my belt while I was carrying stuff from the car and it fell off! I didn't think much of it at the time as it seemed to be OK, but now
 I'm wondering if it was this impact that's caused the screen problem (and hopefully not the water damage) - in which case, it would be viable to fix it..........<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help (and helping me argue with myself!! :))

            I just popped into a local mobile phone repair shop (not the Nokia Repair Centre) and the guy there has said that in his opinion, it's not worth fixing the phone. He could put a new screen in it, but it might die a death within a couple of weeks if the
 problem is down to water damage. He was gonna charge £35 for a new screen. The Nokia Repair Centre are looking for £59 for a new screen.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to do. Whether to try and get it repaired. Go with the cheaper option, go with the approved option or just get a new phone!!<br />
<br />
I'm really frustrated at not being able to see my screen!

            The problem with water damage is that it's not just that something "breaks" instantly and needs to be fixed, but that the water starts corrosion (ie: rust) within the phone which means that parts of the phone could starts shorting out and dying at any
 time as the corrosion progresses.<br />
<br />
You could be lucky and find that nothing is affected for months or years, or you could find that tomorrow there's a short in the main board and you're left with a very expensive paper weight.<br />
<br />
Whatever happens, I definitely wouldn't pay the extra for Nokia to do the repair.<br />
<br />
If you're on a contract where you will get a new phone free or very cheap in a couple of months time, it might be worth taking a punt on a repair.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you have a long time to run on your contract or you don't get a subsidised phone at all or you can get a replacement for less than £100 or so, I'd bite the bullet and buy a replacement now.

            Thank you. I kinda thought that maybe it was starting to die a death. It's a shame too because everything's working beautifully - apart from the screen.<br />
<br />
I'm actually on pay as you go, so no nice new phone for me. I've been looking at a replacement and to get an N80 direct from Nokia would be £299. I don't know whether to wait a little while and see what else comes out in the run up to Christmas.<br />

Sad, sad - poor poor phone............:(

            You might find a 2nd hand one on ebay from someone who's had an upgrade .. obviously there are certain risks involved in buying 2nd hand phones: you'd definitely have to check that the water indicator you can see inside hadn't been triggered.

 asking if I checked in for that flight. It was not on the calendar.

<p>I believe the email reminder for that flight came through was because it was still connected to the auto event post prior to me changing the setting. I have not received any further alerts from email about upcoming travel and they no longer are auto populating
 to my outlook calendar. </p>

                    Hello, The cells in my Excel worksheet do not have numbers in them but only text. I would like to assign a numerical value to a column of cells. A ''0'' if it is empty and "25" if it has text in it. and then sum it up at the bottom of the column. I've
 been &nbsp;ripping my hair out over this for days on end. Please help
<div>My version is Excel 2003.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Have a great day everyone.</div>

            Hi Gord, Are you sure this formula exists in the 2003 version of Excel?
<div><br />
<div>I'm only doubting because I am using Excel in another language and I can't find the equivalent of 'ISTEXT'. Perhaps I would find the formula written as you did if I change the language setting of Excel?</div>
<div>Can anyone tell me how to change the language setting of Excel?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am sorry to compplicate matters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>HOWEVER&nbsp;</div>
<div>I <i>was </i>able to solve the first part of the problem (assign a numerical value to cells containing text) using Excel in this other language.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>More importantly, I want to sum these numerical values. Gord, I cannot find 'SUM(range)'. (or rather, it's equivalent in this other language) does this function exist in the 2003 version of Excel?</div>
<div><br />
<div>How does one sum-up these ''phantom values'' to cells containing text in Excel 2003?? What is the formula?</div>
<div>Aside:</div>
<div>I currently have two problems: When I try to do a formula, the cell returns the actual formula. and not a result.</div>
<div>I cannot find formulas that I have previously written. How do I 'toggle' between seeing the formula and the result or return please?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can I link my spreadsheet to some online place for you guys to check it out?</div>

            <p>Hi all, I was able to solve some of these problems on my own. To help answer my own questions I will outline what I did.</p>
<p>There was an error or &nbsp;setting that prevented my formulas from working, so I created a new file and painstakingly retyped all the information in another spreadsheet. (I could not copy and paste for fear of copying the mystery setting or error that corrupted
 my old spreadsheet). I never did find out what the corruption or error was.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><em>Eureka!</em></p>
<p><strong>CONTA.VALORI </strong><em>(in italian</em><em>)</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This formula counts non-empty cells and sums it up in a designated cell.</p>
<p>I was able to achieve my goal of automatically counting (summing-up) the cells by simply apply the formula to the whole spreadsheet and typing something in select cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By taking a hint from some of the answers here, I figured that I could assign my value to each cell by typing ' *25' at the end of the formula. (Thanks Mike H.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to add up different ranges of cells and subtract/add those results to great effect. I found how to reveal/hide cells from view. and conditionally format. I now have a rather complex machination behind a concise, clear, readily understandable spreadhseet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this has helped anyone who had a similar problem.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Build 10041 Strange shutdown and startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyyoung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Build 10041 Strange shutdown and startup</h2>
                    <p>In build 9926 Windows 10 shutdown was the same as any other Windows OS, shutdown message displays for a bit before the secondary HDD&nbsp;shuts down and the display &amp;&nbsp;primary HDD(one last in use) shuts down and fans shut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However in build 10041 the shutdown message lasts MUCH less than in build 9926. After maybe 2-3 seconds output to the monitor will stop but the computer will still be running for a few seconds(about 2-3 seconds) before powering off the secondary HDD and
 the primary HDD a second after it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting the computer after shutting down isn't right either. Normally&nbsp;the F12 prompt will display&nbsp;to get into BIOS however, that doesn't happen after shutting down in build 10041. Instead, the F12 prompt is gone and the computer boots like normal into Windows
 10. When it does and the windows logo shows, it loads EXTREMELY fast(3-4 seconds) before going to the login screen like normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting will restart the computer like any other Windows OS and takes at least twice the time to load the OS as shutting down does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And&nbsp;I guess&nbsp;my question is, is the boot sequence described considered&nbsp;normal In build 10041(i.e. intended by MS)?&nbsp;If not, would anything bad happen if I continue to shut down the computer while in Windows 10?</p>

            <p>You don't see the F12 when you startup after Shutdown because its sort of using a blend of hibernate for caching&nbsp;the system files&nbsp;with Shutdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That way the system is more&nbsp;quickly loaded at startup..&nbsp;&nbsp; But its also not a fresh start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use Restart it does&nbsp;a full&nbsp;shutdown without caching the system to the 'hibernate file - and then you would see your bios screen message for the press F2 for setup or F12 to choose boot drive.(or similar)</p>

<h2>            Form fields disappear after setting the Record Source...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am creating a form that is based off a query which I have already created one and it works perfect. For some reason as I am creating another form from a different query, I am running into issues. I actually had trouble with my first form and found out
 that the missing piece for me making it run was setting the record source which like I said runs perfect now. I literally followed the same process in my 2nd form and when I set the record source in design view and then go back to form view, all the text boxes
 and drop down box are gone. They still show up in design view but are not available in form view. The only difference from my 2nd form to my first form is the 2nd form has a query based on two tables. I wouldn't think that would have any bearing on what is
 going on but that is literally the only difference from the forms and queries. I am just wondering if there is a&nbsp;easy answer to why this might be happening or what I may be doing wrong. I can definitely provide more information if that will help but just wanted
 to see if this is a common issue and there is a quick troubleshoot for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any thoughts or advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>A totally blank form like this will appear if the form's Recordsource returns no records (so you can't see existing data) and is also not updateable (so you can't see the empty New Record either).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes you can use a multitable query as the recordsource for a Form, but it's generally better to base the Form on a single table, and use Subforms (or other tools) for the data from related tables. What are the two tables you're trying to use? Could
 you open the Query you're using in SQL view and post the SQL text here?</p>

</p><blockquote>he only difference from my 2nd form to my first form is the 2nd form has a query based on two tables.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>A form can be based on a query which joins two or more tables provided that data is being entered or edited in the referencing table only.&nbsp; Take the following example of a form based on a query which joins the following tables in a simple linear hierarchy:<br />
<br />
Customers&gt;----Cities&gt;----States<br />
<br />
In this form data can be entered into the Customers table, including into a foreign key CityID column, but not into the Cities or States tables.&nbsp; A control bound to the State columns from States can be included in the form, but this control would be read-only.&nbsp;
 Once a CityID value is entered into Customers, via a combo box in which the first column (CityID) is hidden and the second column(City) is visible, the state in which the city is located will automatically show in the read-only control.<br />
<br />
In situations where it is necessary to enter data into two related tables the form should not be based on a query which joins the two tables.&nbsp; A subform should be embedded in the form.&nbsp; Taking the example of an Orders table and an OrderDetails table, a form,
 in single form view, would be based on the former and a subform within it, in continuous forms view, would be based on the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The subform would be linked to the parent form on OrderID.&nbsp; For each order entered into the parent form as many order details
 rows as necessary can be entered into the subform, one row for each item ordered.<br />

            <p>Yes, it should be on today or this month when you close and reopen Outlook. If the computer date is not correct, Outlook will think the wrong day is "today".

Thanks for the reply but unfortunately neither of your proposed solutions work.  


For some reason  I cannot dowload tracking lists - keep getting an error message to say that the list could not be added for one of the following reasons: 


- a necessary file could not be downloaded; 


- the website is unavailable; 


- you are not connected to the internet. 


You might want to try again later. 


(Obviously I was connected to the internet, and no matter how often I try, I still get the same error message.) 



Also tried your tip about adding the -inprivate parameter to the shortcut.   


This doesn't work either I'm afraid. It tries to open a website called 'inprivate' which obviously doesn't exist - but I do get a load of 'helpful' links suggested - mostly to **** sites!

            Kai got it a bit wrong. To open IE in InPrivate mode, the shortcut should read
-inprivate</span>. This will always open IE in InPrivate mode and works for either IE8 or IE9.<br />
<br />
InPrivate mode doesn't keep web history, cookies or a cache.<br />
<br />
For Tracking Protection Lists, go to the <a href="http://www.iegallery.com/gb/trackingprotectionlists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
What procedure are you using for that?&nbsp; What do you see?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With IE9 you can probably use the Developer Tools, Network Capture tool for more clues.<br />

<p>This might have happened because:</p>

    <title>Windows Defender not working, says &#34;Virus and Spyware Definitions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> austindressick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender not working, says &#34;Virus and Spyware Definitions could not be updated. Error code&#58; 0x80004004</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: &nbsp;WIndows Defender Not Working Right</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this computer with Windows 8, which I upgraded to 8.1 long ago, and everything was running fine until around last week I tried to update Windows Defender... It says "Virus and Spyware Definitions could not be updated.... Error code: 0x80004004"<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7fc46b8c-0122-4679-8e75-db8388c8f1b7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So then I thought I had a virus... So I ran a scan. And when it was complete, i went to the "History" tab, and clicked to show the "All Detected Items".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gives me another error. It displays a message saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The class is not configured to support activated elevation." Error code: 0x80080017</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a27a6c48-2242-4a80-a265-63b8e26a6681" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I get that same error code ^ when trying to apply changes to Defender settings as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel very vulnerable since Defender is not working properly, I have no idea what happened but it's really frustrating and any help is appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other virus- malware fighting program on my computer is Malware bytes- Anti malware. I have removed all other antivirus programs. I did a full system scan with MWB and it found nothing. I just have no idea why Defender isn't working properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO: &nbsp;From the picture, it says Defender ism monitoring and protecting my system. But I am getting the &nbsp;red flag that says to turn my virus and spyware definitions on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d544fe9-ed1e-41b1-8591-775f532d2186" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>LASTLY... Ever since these errors started, my computer is all-round significantly slower. It's super noticeable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I was trying to install win 10 preview but crashed - Error 80096005</h2>
                    <p>I was eager to try win 10 preview.&nbsp; It downloaded the very large update and it was successful.&nbsp; When I was told I was ready for the preview, I agreed and started.&nbsp; It was going through the configuration and when reached 99%, I got a BSOD with an unhappy
 face but was unable to see it with the exception of a brief flash.&nbsp; It tried again to redo the install but again BSOD.&nbsp; It restored it to my original win 7 pro and that was it.&nbsp; When I was checking the update history it showed that win 10 update failed with
 an error of 80096005 which is considered important.&nbsp; I don't know why this happened as I was told everything was go.&nbsp; Maybe there is a way to do an iso download and burn to disk.&nbsp; Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for trying to Install the Windows 10 Technical Preview. </p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Remember, trying out an early build like this can be risky. That's why we recommend that you don't install the preview on your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up everything.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you want to stop using <span>Windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Preview</span> and return to your previous version of Windows, you'll need to reinstall your previous version from the recovery or installation media that came with your PC—typically a DVD. If you don't
 have recovery media, you might be able to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            OneNote Sync Problem&#58; Progress Bar Stays Green FOREVER and Sync Never Completes</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using my Surface Pro and using OneNote desktop version.&nbsp; I am extremely frustrated with this product.&nbsp; I used to never have a problem with it and I have created a new notebook for classes this year and the notebook never finishes syncing (regardless
 of if I try manually or automatically).&nbsp; When I click on the "View Sync Status" icon, I see the progress bar next to my notebook as green (indicating the sync progress), but the sync never completes.&nbsp; The bar remained like this for over 24 hours before I decided
 to cancel.&nbsp; I have been on the phone with Microsoft and they failed to resolve the issue.&nbsp; Extremely disappointed with OneNote now.&nbsp; Does anyone have any advice?</p>

                    I have two exxel 2003 workbooks open.&nbsp; When I copy a tab with data from one to the other, all formatting in all tabs in the destimation workbook&nbsp;is lost.&nbsp; Not only the copied tab, but other tabs in the destimatioin workbook suddenly lose all formatting
 even though nothing was done to them.&nbsp; I do not have skype on my machine.&nbsp; Also, I am using the&nbsp;excel 2010 with Office 2010.&nbsp; I don't know if that is causing a problem or not.&nbsp; There are lots of cells with data and the formatting is just gone.&nbsp; All I'm doing
 is copying a tab from one workbook to the other.

<h2>            Public Folder Favorites &#40;Only&#41; vanishing from Outlook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>I have a user that has three Public Folders added to his Public Folder Favorites, which are then listed as "Show in Favorites" so that they will appear in the normal Mail view, along with other folders he has listed as "Show in Favorites."&nbsp; (They're actually
 Sub-Folders of a Public Folder: Public Folders =&gt; Faxes =&gt; Faxes 1, Faxes 2, Faxes 3, where Faxes 1, 2, &amp; 3 are the ones listed as "Show In Favorites.")</p>
<p>At random intervals, these three Public Folders will vanish from the list of Favorites in the Mail View.&nbsp; They will still be in his Public Folder Favorites, and I can add them back to his "Show in Favorites," but a few days later, they will vanish again.&nbsp;
 Other Favorite Folders (mail folders in his Mailbox, as opposed to Public Folders), do not have this issue, and will still be there after the Public Folder Favorites have vanished.</p>
<p>This is happening in Outlook 2010, 32 bit.&nbsp; Exchange version is 2010, hosted with Intermedia, connected via RPC over HTTP.&nbsp; The problem has persisted over multiple PCs and OSes, both WinXP 32 bit and Win7 64 bit, and including deleting and rebuilding his
 Profile, and the whole PC at one point.&nbsp; While it's not a show-stopper, it is becoming extremely annoying to receive a call every few days of "They're gone again, why did this happen?"&nbsp; All current patches are applied for Outlook 2010.</p>
