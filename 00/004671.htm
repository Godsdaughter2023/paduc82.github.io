<h2>            I cannot login to Skype. I don&#39;t remember my password and Skype won&#39;t send me a new password. It keeps sending me to Microsoft office.</h2>
                    <p>I keep trying to login to Skype and it won't work because I have a new computer and I don't remember my password. I tried to setup a new account with a &nbsp;different email address, and the process was almost complete, but it got stuck on "processing profile."
 All I need to do is setup a new Skype name for my new account or get a new password for my old account. Would appreciate any help!!!&nbsp;</p>

 the page. It sort of bounces of the page. The same thing happens with a picture. Is this a Win 10 problem? Any solutions what to do? Roll back to 2007?

<h2>            Unprofessional and extremely disappointed after sales service with Nokia Indonesia</h2>
                    Dear Nokia users and support,<br />
<br />
I would like to withdraw your attention to unprofessional, unpleasant, and extremely disapointed after sales service with Nokia service center in Indonesia. If you know the right person for this matter, kindly direct this email to the right person. You wouldn't
 believe that this kind of service is given by a big multinational and wellknown company like Nokia. I think Nokia should re-evaluate and do fit and proper test to Nokia Indonesia branch.<br />
<br />
I bought a brand new Nokia 2505 CDMA in Mid of September 2007 at one of Nokia authorized dealer. The name of the authorized dealer is Oke shop located at Menara Jamsostek, Jakarta – Indonesia which was a retail chain store of PT Trikomsel. At first I was happy
 with the product but it only lasted for two weeks. After two weeks of normal usage and it was always turned off every night, the phone started to show abnormal operation. The phone somehow discharged the battery by itself. Therefore, although the battery had
 been fully charged, it could only last for 1 hour and the phone unit was very hot. Since there was a long holiday in Indonesia due to Idul Fitri celebration, I just brought the phone unit to Nokia service center in Mall Taman Anggrek Jakarta on November 3,
 2007. This service center was also a subsidiary of PT Trikomsel.<br />
<br />
The officer of the service center checked the battery of the phone and the battery condition was still 100%. Therefore, they needed to check the phone unit. The officer of the service center told me that if the technician of Mall Taman Anggrek service center
 could not repair it in 7 days, they would send it to Nokia service center head office in Indonesia. The officer explained to me if the phone unit was unrepairable and needed hardware swap, it might take up to 1 month to get the unit ready for pick up. Then,
 they registered my phone unit for repair with job number N0507002421. They promised to contact me when the phone was ready for pick up. After two weeks, I contacted the service center asking the status of my unit. They told me that the unit needed a hardware
 swap because the level of the failure was three.<br />
<br />
A month later, I came to the service center asking the status of my phone unit and they told me that it was still being repaired. They could not give me an estimation when the unit would be ready. They said it depended on when swap unit was available and I
 was not the only customer in the waiting list for swap unit. I was disappointed and asked to talk to the on site service manager but the service manager refused to see me. I was extremely upsad and asked the cell phone number of the service manager. The leader
 of the customer service, gave me the cell phone number of the service manager. I called to the cell phone of service manager but again, he refused to talk to me by rejecting the call. Once, my call to the service manager was picked up but the wife. She told
 me that he was very sick and could not answer the call. It was very contradicting with the answer of the service center officer a day before who told me that the service manager was out for lunch, meaning he was not sick. It was clearly that the service manager
 refused to talk to me by saying he was sick or out for lunch. The bottom line was that the service manager was never available on site and didn’t want to take complain from customer. There was no solution given by the service center and I had to wait.<br />
<br />
On January 1, 2008 (which was about 2 months since my phone unit was turned in for repair), I came to the service center directly with a hope the unit was ready for pick up. Unfortunately, the unit was not ready yet. The service center officer promised to notify
 me again in one week. I refused to wait for another week and insisted to get the status of my phone unit by January 2, 2008 afternoon. They promised to call me on January 2, 2008 afternoon but they didn’t call me. So, I called them on Jan 2 evening. They told
 me that they just received the unit from Nokia service center head office and needed to test the unit bofore notifying me the unit was ready for pick up. I asked them to call me when the unit was ready for pick up but, again I have to be disappointed, they
 only gave me notification via sms. What a very irresponsible and unprofessional service!<br />
<br />
On January 6, I picked up my phone unit. At first, the customer service told me that the unit was still at Nokia service center head office. I was angry and told her that I had received an sms notifying me the unit was ready for pick up. She went inside to
 look for the unit again. After waiting for 15 minutes, she finally came with my phone unit and asked me whether the sms sent to me told me the repair expenses. She told me that the status of my phone unit warranty was expired. I was surprised and told her
 that this was a brand new phone and still under warranty! Then, I started questioning her whether or not the phone unit was a refurbished unit / swap unit from a fail unit which was sold again by Oke shop. Later, she told me that the warranty status on the
 service receipt given to me was not updated yet but, after checking with nokia online, my phone unit was still under warranty. This incident raised my big doubt on the originality and the quality of Nokia phone sold by authorized dealer PT Trikomsel which
 is the parent company of Oke shop retail chain stores.<br />
<br />
My disappointment still continued by knowing that my phone unit was only repaired and not swapped by a new unit as promised before. Then I demanded explanation on the problems/failure of my unit and repair action had been performed on my unit. Unbelievably,
 the service center could not explained it to me! They told me that the repair explanation had not been updated by Nokia service center head office.<br />
<br />
I don’t care with that as it is Nokia internal problem. As a customer, I have the rights to know the problems/failures of my unit and the repair actions have been performed on my unit, especially the repair took 2 months!<br />
<br />
I demanded the contact person and phone number of Nokia service center head office but, again, they refused to give them to me. My next disappoinment was that I received my phone unit in a very dirty condition. The color of the white strip became greyish and
 yellowish. I demanded them to return my phone unit with the same condition as that when I turned phone unit to them for repair but they said it was out of their control. In other words, I had to accept the dirty condition of my phone unit and they refused
 to be responsible for the dirty condition of my phone unit. I couldn’t believe that I received a very unprofessional and irresponsible service from an authorized service center of a big, multinational and well known company like NOKIA! This incident has caused
 me to suffer loss of time, money, energy, and receive a bad condition phone unit from the service center.<br />
<br />
Since I could not accept that, I made a complain by sending email via Nokia Indonesia website which I received not response and made a call to Nokia care line at +62 21 52 66 542 with complain number 2 – 239262001.
<br />
<br />
The Nokia careline officer promise me that I will be contacted again in 2 x 24 hours but, until a week, I received no response. Thus, I called again to Nokia careline on Jan 6,2008 and made a complain for receiving no response. This time, I got a response.
 Later in that afternoon, the officer from Nokia Mall Taman Anggrek service center (the leader of the customer service) called me telling me that they were willing to replace the case of my phone unit. I told him that I wanted to speak to the service manager
 but, as usual and I already predicted, he told me that he was not available. So, I told Mr. Yusuf that I wanted:<br />
<br />
1.Explanation of the problems / failures of my phone unit printed on Nokia company letter head signed by the authorized person<br />
2.Extention of warranty at least 6 months as the phone was in repair for 2 months and could only be used for the first two weeks. Meaning the quality of the unit was very questionable<br />
3.The replacement of my phone unit cover was done at my place, meaning they had to send their technician to my place as I didn’t want to spend any more time, money, and energy to go to the service center.<br />
4.Compensation on my loss of time, money, and energy for contacting and going back and forth to Nokia service center.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
5.Replace my phone unit with a brand new unit from unopened box.<br />
<br />
As I already predicted before, he could not give any solution to any of my demand. That was the reason why I wanted to speak with the on site service manager.<br />
<br />
I called again to Nokia care line +62 21 52 66 542 telling her my above demand and, same as Mr. Yusuf, she could not give any solution. Thus, I asked her to give any contact person and number at Nokia Indonesia head office but she couldn’t fulfill my request.
 She promised to process my demand in 2 x 24 hours. I told her that somebody from Nokia Indonesia should call me to give solution on my demands. I told her that I expected to receive a solution from Nokia on Monday (Jan 14) evening or Tuesday (Jan 15) Morning
 at the latest.<br />
<br />
However, based on all things I had been through, I doubt I will receive a satisfaction solution from Nokia Indonesia. Therefore, I wrote this email at this group hoping that the right person at Nokia Head Office will follow up this tiring experience and extremely
 disappointment with Nokia service center in Indonesia. I believe a big multinational and well known company like NOKIA would give me appropriate, professional, and responsible response on my complains and demands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

            They have fixed the handset problems but I had to accept that my handset cover becomes dirty now.<br />
<br />
Until now Nokia Indonesia still doesn't give good solution to me. I am very upsad and disappointed. I have promised to myself that I will never buy any Nokia product and, off course, will recommend my friends not to buy any Nokia product by telling them my
 bad experience with Nokia aftersales service.<br />
<br />
The worst thing is that Nokia in Finland and Nokia Asia Pacific in Singapore do not respond to my complain. I know this because Nokia Indonesia Officer told me no one from Nokia Finland or Nokia Asia Pacific contact Nokia Indonesia to investigate the complain.
 What an unprofessional company Nokia is!<br />
<br />
I think Nokia has become too arogant and start ignoring customer. History has proven that when a company becomes arogant and ignoring customer, that is the starting point of company's fallen. We'll see as time goes by.

            This is not an isolated incident. The same unacceptable customer service happens in Australia. I've had a simular problem regarding a phone that after a short time needed to be sent for repair. I have also been offered a refurbished phone which I find
 unacceptable as I paid in full for a new phone (which I expected to work). I also have called the Nokia care more than once. I also have been promised calls returned within 24-48 hrs which I never received.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Nokia does seem to arrogant. This is not what I expected from such a well respected brand. (which I'm now asking myself how that reputation came about)<br />
<br />
I am still trying to negotiate between the retailer (Allphones) and Nokia for an acceptable solution. The retailer is however saying that it is Nokia Policy to replace faulty phones still under warranty with refurbished phones.<br />
<br />
It's sad to see so many frustrated Nokia purchasers who have not received value in terms of product or customer service. So many of us have already used the 'contact us' section and are posting here out of exhaustion of other methods of finding a solution.<br />
<br />
It's almost ridiculous!!

            Why this was moved to this forum I don't know... It should have been moved to the Insider forum for Mac. If you are using 15.37 it indicates that you have opted to participate in the Insider
<em>Fast</em> program which provides pre-release updates that are undocumented. The purpose of the program is for advanced users to test the update before it is released to the general public. Insider participants have their own venue for discussion of the
 testing as well as information regarding the update, but the documentation will not be made available until the live release is issued.<br />

            Had the same issue. Numerous times in the update history it says "Upgrade to Windows 10 | Status: Failed". I just went into the Get Windows 10 app now and it's there ready to upgrade. Worth a check.

</p><p>I got my Lumia 950 in April and have had no problems with it really until a few days ago when suddenly my chargers will not securely insert into the charging port. I have looked in the port and tried a couple of different USB-C chargers and have had the
 same trouble. I am still able to use Continuum but is frustrating when charging as it needs to be completely still as not to become unplugged.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>
<p>
</p><p>Joel<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/deb2fc96-7c03-46f4-92cc-26a62f3963c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/deb2fc96-7c03-46f4-92cc-26a62f3963c7" /></a></p>

            I had the same problem too and the solution for me&nbsp;was to use compressed air to blow out the lint and dust that had compacted in the port and was not allowing the cable to fully plug in. After doing that the cable now stays in the port&nbsp;when I move the
 phone around and I can even&nbsp;lift the phone&nbsp;by the cable and it stays in too.

</p><p>I am a student in high school and my school provides us with computer. I had to get some parts on mine fixed so currently I am using a loaner. When I opened my One Note the font in my toolbar was insanely huge! It is the same for my word, powerpoint, and
 excel. I have already gone to control panel &gt; appearance and personalization &gt; display &gt; make text items smaller or larger and changed it from 125% to 100%. It did bring my toolbar back down but then everything else became super tiny! Please help me, this
 is bugging me to no end and I just can't focus with my font like this!</p>
<p>Here is another picture of my recents page in excel because it's not just in the toolbar.</p>

            You can do that by going to Contacts-&gt;Options-&gt;Settings-&gt;Contacts-&gt;Contacts to display-&gt;Sim memory. After that its just to delete the once that you see on your contacts list.

<p>hi rbf,</p>
<p>to clarify the scenario, i would like to confirm the following details:</p>
<p>1. about "when i access our sharepoint portal directly", does the issue occur when accessing the
<strong>sharepoint admin center</strong> page as below? <br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=332e1c8d-19c9-4235-becd-75e089c9d552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d332e1c8d-19c9-4235-becd-75e089c9d552" /></a><br />
2. could you share with us the url which the page directed to? <br />
3. a screenshot about what the&nbsp; page displays is appreciated so that we can try to reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>to upload images, please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> when replying to the post, then click the<strong> insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft community forums</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are wanting to remove installed music from your device, from Groove Music, you will need to uninstall the music from the file explorer on your device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Opening the file Explorer on your device,</li><li>Select Music from the left hand side 'Quick Access' menu</li><li>You should then see a folder called 'Purchases', you will need to open it</li><li>You can then delete the Music from the folder,</li><li>Then empty the recycling bin</li></ol>
<p>You should then see that you will need to install it again onto your device. </p>

<p>In my Music folder, I had a <strong>Purchases </strong>folder and a <strong>Music Cache

</p></div>
If you sync OneDrive to your computer with the desktop client, make sure that you're not looking at the Music folder on OneDrive. Just click the address bar and make sure that it doesn't reveal a path like C:\Users\<em>&lt;your username&gt;</em>\OneDrive\Music. If
 it does, just go straight to C:\Users\<em>&lt;your username&gt;</em>\Music.

</p><p>There are requirements for Windows 10 on earlier phones. If the phone does not meet the minimum specs they have not allowed those phones to upgrade. My belief is one of the reasons is that it just will not provide a good experience.</p>

            The Insider program for Windows Mobile ended in January this year, after all development for W10M was discontinued in November last year - there is no point in having an Insider program if there is nothing to Test/Preview.

<p>I think 93tid answered your question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The program is over for Windows Phone so support is not going to be around.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for getting it&nbsp; by other means then that is your choice but it is still not supported so you are own your own.</p>

            <p>An empty file will occupy about that much disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a separate issue, note that you should NEVER open a&nbsp;Word document when it is located on a USB drive.&nbsp; Catastrophic, unrecoverable corruption of the document is an almost certain result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for you original file, you may find something you open the document (blank as it maybe) and then go to File&gt;Info&gt;Manage Versions and see if there are any previous versions of the file.</p>

    <title>Conditional Animation Triggers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_low  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Animation Triggers</h2>
                    <p>I'm not too sure if this is possible but what I'm looking to do is set up a memory quiz that the live audience will participate in. What I'm looking to do is create a situation where the audience will have the choice of 1 card from a 4 by 4 grid of cards
 that card will then flip over revealing a symbol. The same user then has the choice to pick a second card this causes the conditional trigger</p>
<p>If the second card flips over and the symbol matches a tick animation will fade up then away and will no longer be able to flip or</p>
<p>If the second card flips over and the symbols don't match a cross animation will appear then fade away and the two cards should flip back over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have set up all the card flipping animation and i also have the tick or the cross (currently works by pressing a button) though I'm looking to join these two sections together and be automated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a strong feeling this isn't possible but i would be impressed if it is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced!</p>

<p>Lots of messages stored on the phone is one of the cause for such problem.. Delete as many as possible from all the subfolders of Messaging (Inbox / Sent).. and check again.. If you need to keep these messages..then Back-up / Sync with the OVI Suite on your

    <title>Product activation key already redeemed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madcatmephi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Product activation key already redeemed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to activate my Microsoft Office subscription, but when I enter my product key I get an error message saying it has already been redeemed by another account. I
<em>know </em>this account is not mine, because to my knowledge I only have the one, and even if it was one I created in the past and forgot about it still can't have been mine because the email address is @outlook which I have
<em>never</em> used for any email account I have ever had. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get this sorted out? All of the solutions I've found just point to using other Microsoft accounts I may have forgotten about but since that isn't the case here I don't know where to go from here. Please help!</p>

            <p>Hello Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Turn internet explorer On or Off.</p>
<p>1. Click the Start button Picture of the Start button, click Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off. Administrator permission required if you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password
 or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>2. Turn off the internet explorer, clear the check box. Click OK. Restart the computer.</p>
<p>3. Follow the same process again to check the box next to internet explorer 11 and restart the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to disable add on and check the issue.</p>
<p>Add-ons are apps that browsers use to interact with web content like videos and games. Incompatible or out-of-date add-ons might cause Internet Explorer to run slowly, crash, or prevent sites from displaying correctly. Before you turn off all add-ons, try
 starting Internet Explorer without add-ons to see if the problem goes away.</p>
<p>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Installation Failures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff yuhas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Installation Failures</h2>
                    <p>I have been on the Windows Insider Program form the onset of the first downloadable preview build of Windows 10, and I have yet to be bale to successfully install Windows 10.&nbsp; I have an HP Pavilion desktop that runs flawlessly on Windows 8.1 but have been
 able&nbsp;to upgrade to Windows 10, either through upgrade, clean install, or clean boot. &nbsp;EVERY single time&nbsp;with every build and now even with the released version and subsequent updates&nbsp;it fails at the exact same point: on the first reboot during the installation
 process, the Windows splash screen comes up and freezes.&nbsp; I do a forced shutdown and on restart it reverts cleanly back to 8.1 with the installation message of failure during SAFE boot operation.&nbsp; I have tried many suggestions disabling this or that but it
 always comes back with the same failure every time.&nbsp; I don't want to give up on running Win10 on this computer so ANY magic bullets out there?? :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any guidance.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all the tips and suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these I have followed before but I made sure all devices were unplugged except keyboard and mouse,&nbsp; made sure I had security software disabled or un-installed (I don't have any so I disabled Windows Defender),&nbsp;disabled
 all possible services per the instructions you sent.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I received the exact same result: on first installation reboot, my computer freezes on the Windows startup splash screen.&nbsp; The message I receive is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>0xC1900101-0x20017</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what, if anything to try at this point.</p>

            HP Pavilion a1430n&nbsp; this is an older system and may not work with Win10 as it was an XP then upgraded by HP to win7, that error code refers to the bios, you could try updating the bios but not from HP as there is&nbsp;no support for Win8 or Win10 per HP web
 site. &nbsp;

            I have&nbsp;an HP Pavilion a1034n.&nbsp; Original specs:&nbsp; <span>
<p>http://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c00313196</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the original specs,&nbsp;I have an AMD HD-6450 video card and have used all four RAM slots. I either have 4 512k sticks or 4 1GB sticks (I'll have to verify later).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1 (which is running fine) and I have tried going back to a clean install of Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried most things on the post link you provided, but I will re-review.&nbsp; I have noticed on some suggestions regarding disabling certain
 items in the BIOS that hose are not available in my BIOS to change.</p>

            So where would I find a reliable BIOS update supporting Win8 or Win10 if not from HP?

            <p>Thank you for the instructions on updating the BIOS from the manufacturer's site.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not go to the HP site because another&nbsp;reply on this thread said:&nbsp; "<em>you could try updating the bios but
 as on my computer.&nbsp; If there is not an update from what version I currently have,&nbsp;then what?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
