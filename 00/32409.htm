<p>Hi Augustinas,<br />
<br />
Since performing the startup repair using the ISO failed to work, we would suggest that you boot your PC in
<strong>safe mode</strong> and run the <strong>System File Checker and DISM</strong> tools using the command prompt to scan your computer for any missing or corrupted update components that may be causing this issue. Kindly refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Boot your system in Safe Mode</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the Windows Recovery Environment.</span></li><li>In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the&nbsp;<strong>Choose an option screen</strong>, tap or click<strong>&nbsp;Troubleshoot</strong>.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</li><li>Tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Startup Settings</strong>.&nbsp;<span>If you don't see&nbsp;<strong>Startup Settings</strong>, tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Advanced options</strong>, and then tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Startup Settings</strong>.</span></li><li>Tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>, and then wait while your computer restarts.</li><li><span>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select&nbsp;<strong>4</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>F4</strong>&nbsp;to start your PC in&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode</strong>. Or if you'll need to use the Internet, select&nbsp;<strong>5</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>F5</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Safe
 Mode</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>Networking</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Your PC will now start in safe mode.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>This will start Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services to help troubleshoot issues.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Open Command Prompt and run SFC and DISM tools</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Determine your current Windows version/build. To check, type <strong>winver</strong> in the search box and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Start</strong>, and in the search box, enter <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Right click on Command Prompt from the search results and select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>Kindly refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4075150/how-to-recover-devices-from-an-unbootable-state-after-installing-the-j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> and follow the steps under
<strong>Uninstall the update using Command Prompt</strong> depending on which version/build your Windows 10 is currently on.</li><li><span>Enter <strong>sfc</strong> <strong>/scannow</strong> (note the space between "sfc" and "/").</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

    <title>Intermittent wireless internet connection with windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kdrodgers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent wireless internet connection with windows 7 </h2>
                    We recently bought two computers -- with the second one relying on wireless connection to access internet.&nbsp; We have a Cisco linksys compact wireless-G USB adaptor for the wireless connection. The problem is that the&nbsp;second computer&nbsp;frequently&nbsp;loses its&nbsp;internet
 access, expecially when we try to navigate from one website to another.&nbsp; We tried many possible solutions, including one recommended by microsoft using the "fix it for me" program (support.microsoft.com/kb/299357).&nbsp; That worked for a short while, but then
 we again lost the connection and were unable to re-establish a solid connection.&nbsp; Why does this problem keep coming back?&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we need to do to get stable internet access?&nbsp;

<p>The majority of connection problems within Windows 7 have been solved by installing the latest driver for the network adapter obtained from the manufacturer.&nbsp; Try to download Windows
 7 compatible drivers if the manufacturer provides them. If not, try Windows Vista drivers and contact your OEM for any update on the driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make use of the Compatibility Center and Upgrade Advisor to see if your hardware is compatible or requires a download:</p>

<h2>            How Can I Fix My Registry For Fixing Comctl32.dll Errors</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Since I have Upgarded&nbsp; To The Latest Version Of Windows I Observed That Some Of My Browsers Were Not Opening But Even Not Giving Any Errors...</p>
<p>So I thought Restarting My computer Might Fix My Problem..</p>
<p>But It didn't restart so I had to close it by pressing the power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next Time I booted It Up Some Files were corrupted and it didn't start </p>
<p>So I had to run the dell recovery which was successful recovering my pc..</p>
<p>But When I booted It up&nbsp;there were some&nbsp;Comctl32.dll errors when I opened some apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked The File Location The .dll file was there and was equal in size to the other comctl32.dlls in the&nbsp;neighbouring locations</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I tried many ways of fixing it like sfc scan dism scan and at last I tried to reset my pc but it said there was a problem resseting your pc, Even Restore System point Didn't work..</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I Think This&nbsp;Problem Might Be because of some registry entries because once I messed up with it..</p>
<p>Please let me know How I could Fix This Problem..</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems that you almost exhausted all possible solution for issue. However, you can still perform a repair install to replace a missing or broken system file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be reminded that you need to choose the option <strong>Keep personal files and app</strong>, to prevent data loss.
<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<br />
<p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<br />
<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Are you an administrator of the computer?</span></p>
<br />
<p><span><span>3.<span>
</span></span></span><span>What do you mean when you say “</span><span>Its ok if it is only for the first time
 (new user)”?</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>The hardware changes which you make on the administrator account will be same on all the other user account.
</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>You may follow the steps to set sound card as default.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>a)Right-click the speaker icon located on the Windows Task Bar and select "Sounds".</span></p>
<span>b) In the "Sound" window that opens, select the "Playback" tab.</span><br />
<span>c) In the list of displayed sound cards, select your computer's sound card by clicking on it one time.</span><br />
<span>d) Click the "Set Default" button to set your computer's sound card as the default card for playback.<span>
</span>Your computer's sound card should now have a green check mark next to it.</span><br />
<b><span>NOTE</span></b><span>:<span>
</span>If the Signal Link’s sound card is listed as the "Default Communication Device"<span>
</span>(indicated by a green colored telephone handset icon), then we suggest setting another device such as a modem or the computer's sound card to be the Default Communication Device.</span><br />
<span>e) In the "Sound" window, select the "Recording" tab.</span><br />
<span>f) In the list of displayed sound cards, select your computer's microphone by clicking on it one time.</span><br />
<span>g) Click the "Set Default" button to set your computer's microphone as the default sound card for recording.<span>
</span>Your computer's microphone should now have a green check mark next to it.<span>
</span></span><br />
<span>h) Click OK to keep the changes and close the Window.</span><br />
<span>Please note that you may not be able to select your computer's microphone as the default if it is disconnected.<span>
</span>If this is the case with your computer, then you will be able to select it later if you plug a microphone in.<span>
</span>This will not have any affect on the operation of the Signal Link. </span>
<br />
<span><strong>NOTE</strong>:<span>
</span>If the Signal link’s sound card is listed as the "Default Communication Device"<span>
</span>(indicated by a green colored telephone handset icon), then we suggest setting another device such as a modem or the computer's sound card to be the Default Communication Device.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Hope it helps.</span><br />

<h2>            Skype to phone problem</h2>
                    I am using the web Skype. The one I first sign into does not work at all and I am advised to try a new beta version. I do this and sound is fine and skype to skype video and calls fine too. The problem comes when doing a skype to phone. I am based in Thailand
 and when I call the international number (Italy) it comes out as _+6639 and then the rest. But this is the Thailand code (66) plus the Italian code (39) jammed together. I am not dialling the Thai code and it is just appearing automatically. The beta web skype
 also does not allow you to see the number as you dial...you can only see it after finishing. Does anyone know what is going on and how I can fix it?

            <p><span>Hi Sevukar,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you have an issue using the <strong>integrated webcam</strong> of HP after you upgrade to Windows 8 pro from Windows 7. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To assist you better I would like know the detail below.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do you get any error message/code? If yes, provide the complete error message/code.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Let’s perform the steps below and check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Run the </span><strong><span>Hardware and devices Troubleshooter</span></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks the hardware connected to the computer for any known issues and provides the details on how to fix them. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong><span>Start.</span></strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong> in the search bar and press “Enter”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the <strong><span>“Troubleshooting</span></strong>” window, click on
<strong><span>“View All</span></strong>” on the left pane.</span></p>

</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> <strong>Uninstall</strong> and <strong>
reinstall</strong> the drivers of webcam in compatibility.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also I suggest you uninstall the webcam driver and then re install drivers from
<strong>manufacturer’s website</strong> and then run the drivers in <strong>compatibility mode</strong>. Refer the below steps to install a driver in compatibility mode:</span><span>&nbsp;

    <title>IME handwriting input for CH or CT in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davenla  say:</h3>
<h2>            IME handwriting input for CH or CT in Windows 7</h2>
                    What happened to the CH (Chinese Simplified) or CT (Chinese Traditional) handwriting inputs? They do not seem to exist in Windows 7 (Ultimate).
<br />
<br />
The only work around I found consists of installing Office 2007 before the handwriting language packs for Chinese is enabled.
<br />
<br />
This puts on an extreme crimp on things when attempting to learn a new word.

    <title>My account is in &#38;quot&#59;Avoid Me&#38;quot&#59; status - Looking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pix3ly  say:</h3>
<h2>            My account is in &#38;quot&#59;Avoid Me&#38;quot&#59; status - Looking for other gamers in same situation who have GTA5 so we can play online together and get out of &#38;quot&#59;Avoid Me&#38;quot&#59; status.</h2>
                    
<p>This message is for anyone who is in the "Avoid Me" status, and who has GTA5 for the Xbox One. As i'm sure all of you are aware, the REP system on the X1 is flawed to all hell. I received 2 reports for cheating on Halo MCC and have never cheated a day in
 my life. I informed the xbox rep team about this and all they did was copy/paste a response that was zero help, nor did they respond to my issues regarding false reports of cheating. It's like they go "okay your account has 2 reports for cheating, so you must
 be cheating".... Riiiiiiiight. I'm not even sure why these people are on the rep team if all they do is copy/paste crap that is of no use... and I love how everyone says the rep system isn't flawed... as if they coded the system themselves. Just look at the
 Xbox One (a "next gen" system) and how terrible/sluggish/non-intuitive the UI is... and not to mention the state they released MCC in... absolutely terrible.</p>
<p><br />
I've been at the avoid me status since last friday (about 5 days) and because I can't find matches in Halo MCC, nor can I randomly find players in GTA5, I am here to potentially schedule some time with you guys who are at the avoid me status so we can play
 together and get out of this stupid "avoid me" status. I only own GTA5 and MCC and I can't think of a better way to do this than find others in the same situation who have GTA5.</p>

<p>I'm thinking if we just schedule some time, we can boot up GTA5 and join "online". If we're not automatically placed with each other (because you know... microsofts amazing system is supposed to match "avoid me" players with one another..) then we can just
 send game invites to one another to ensure we're in the same game.</p>

<p>Once we're in the same game... we can literally "set it and forget it" — meaning just go to your house (in game) and sit on the couch and watch TV. Make sure your controller is connected via USB&gt;Micro USB to your console that way if you're away for some
 time your controller doesn't shut off. I let my console idle last night while I was asleep by doing this method and it didn't shut off or kick me from the game session once.</p>

<p>If we do this for long enough, we should get out of the "avoid me" status and into the "needs work" category.</p>

<p>Respond to this thread if you're interested, or just send me a message via XBL, my gamertag is: &nbsp; &nbsp;PIX3LY</p>

<p>Adding an important point to Syed Md Bilal's reply:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often when you download fonts, they are packaged in a ZIP file (.zip extension). If that is the case, then you need to extract the font files from the ZIP package first. In File Explorer, you can double click on the .zip file to view the contents, then you
 can drag/drop or copy/paste the particular font files into another location. At that point, you can follow the steps provided above.</p>

    <title>Why won&#39;t Groove show all my music - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t Groove show all my music</h2>
                    <p>I cannot get Groove music to show all my music. I have about 7,800 songs. My music is all named consistently, all the tags are perfect. One album, had one song that was not showing up, I I changed the name ever so slightly, adding a 1, to the end. It showed
 right up. I decided to delete my music and start again. So I deleted all my music off the SD card, and synced my music to my SD card using Media Monkey. After 12 hours only a handful of songs show up. In fact on my one album where only one song was not showing
 up, it is the only song showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand how Microsoft can be so bad at music software. Do the people that work on this software, actually listen to music?</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the "Windows phone app for desktop" to sync my complete library of iTunes to 200 GB SD card. And to my great surprise the Groove app tells me that there is nothing happening here. Even though I loaded about 18.000 titles (150 GB)&nbsp;on the SD card. When
 I go to the SD card and I click on any kind of song, Groove music opens and the song plays. How crazy can it get?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Searching through the Groove software I found that you can refine sorting and filtering. When you set in filtering the app to “Offline available” it starts loading the music of
 the SD card. You will see a banner on top saying that music is being added. 18.000 titles take some time of course and the sync is for some reason interrupted from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Having this I was hoping to leave my iPod Classic behind and use the Lumia in my car (BMW 4 with Business Media system). One device for communication and music!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The disappointment was huge when, after 30 min of reading the device, the car system told me that nothing was connected on the USB connection. On the other hand, if the music
 is on the phone memory everything works perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Then I tested with Bluetooth and there I was able to connect and play music from my SD card. However, the music has to be selected on the phone which is very unpractical and dangerous
 while driving. With USB you can use the car system for selecting music on the phone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don't understand that a giant like Microsoft isn’t able to master these things better.</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Backup In Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have a question about backing up in Windows 10. I am using the Windows 7 Backup built into Windows 10. I am doing a backup every day. The problem is, after a month or two, my 2 TB external hard drive gets full, and I have to go in and delete some
 old backups, which, of course, is not a big deal, but I wonder if I can do better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here's my question: If I only set up backup to do a backup, say, weekly, will it still do incremental backups daily, and then a new, full backup weekly, or will it just do a new, full backup weekly, with no incremental backups daily?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated...</p>

            Most third-party backup programs blow Windows backup out of the water, and they can be configured to automatically delete older backups according to criteria you set. This is just my opinion, but I can't see a reason to waste time on Windows backup.

            I mean there's no shortage of utilities for everything, many times way better than the defaults. But I'm also a minimalist, I will use the most basic thing that meets my needs, and this does for me. &nbsp;But I have very simplistic needs. A scheduled
<strong>copy *.* e: </strong>command would probably be enough for me.

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. I've always used a program called SyncBackSe for backup - simple, flexible, etc. My current client does not like third party applications added to his computer, but the responses to my question have convinced me that that;s the
 way to go. Thanks again for the feedback...</p>

            <p>I agree. Based on the answers that I've gotten to my question, I've decided to go with my favorite backup program, SyncBackSE. I thought Microsoft's built in backup might be worth a try, but it obviously doesn't fit my needs. I appreciate the feedback...</p>

            I was probably a little harsh on Microsoft. Backup is not really their business, but on the other hand there are Windows users who have no idea how to install third-party software and would be scared to try even if they knew. For them, Microsoft includes
 a very basic backup capability. It's low rent, but at least people will have <em>
some</em> way to backup

<p>I purchased a movie for streaming and now it keeps stopping and says that my network connection was lost or timed out and throws up an error code of c00df243? It is deffinately not my network connection because l can play on live just fine, this is rediculous.

<p>Hello PREMEDCYPRESS10,</p>
<p>I realize you think it isn't a network problem, but if it lagging and its telling you there is a networking problem. Then most likely it is.</p>
<p>I recommend testing your connection at <a href="http://www.speedtest.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.speedtest.net</a></p>
<p>If that doesn't help try this.</p>

<p>Sorry, EG GHOSTLY CM, but it is an issue with xbox video. &nbsp;Amazon Prime Instant Video works just fine and my speed test gave a download speed over 10mbs. &nbsp;Next you'll tell us to clear our cache 5 times, because clearing it once just doesn't clear it enough.</p>

<p>Hi - I'm sorry if this sounds a bit slow... How do I quit the Backgammon game without having a new game start and losing in my statistics?&nbsp; I have been so amazed and thrilled to win a game but then don't have time to play another so I click on Match Won/or
 lost (!!!) and the board sets up again and when I go to close the game it says it will count against my statistics.&nbsp; Any help would be REALLY appreciated :¬)&nbsp; Thank you</p>

<p><span>Hi Sara Star,</span></p>
<p><span>If you are in the middle of the game then you will not be able to quit the game in between and you will lose the game. However, if the game ends
 and you get a message “You have lost” or “You have won”, then, rather than clicking on the X in the top right corner if you click anywhere else it will present a “Would you like to play again?” window. In that window if you select play again then you will
 have to finish the game and if you choose quit then, the game will quit without starting a new game.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this helps.</span></p>

 elsewhere...... and will let you know if it works.&nbsp; All the best, Sara

<p>I am having the same problem as Sara Star. There seems to be no way out of the Backgammon game without it going against your statistics - even after you've finished a game. Besides, we shouldn't have to hunt for a secret spot on the screen to exit without
 penalty. As long as we exit after the game has finished and before the next one has started - by the normal method of clicking on the Close box, there should be no reason to penalize us.</p>
<p>By the way, what are those statistics used for - and where can we view them?</p>

            I also have this problem. &nbsp;Reading the posts below it seems MS support have no actual idea, they are either useless or do not read or test out what we are claiming.
<div><br />
<div>After a game and I have won/lost, if I exit I get the 'this counts as &nbsp;loss in your statistics' even after the game has finished!!!! &nbsp;In addition, when playing, if I play against a 'human' and they leave half way through a game, and I play against the
 computer, I would rather exit then and play against a real opponent, but alas, that also goes against your statistics according to the system pop up box.</div>

<h2>            Re Activating Windows 10 After changing laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was using Sony Vaio laptop. But now the motherboard has been failed. I am unable to use it now. It's really hard to get a new motherboard since sony has stopped laptop business. If it is available in market it is really costly. And it only has limited
 warranty.</p>
<p>My laptop was preinstalled with windows 8. I have upgraded to latest windows 10 version and linked my Microsoft account for reactivation in future. It says if a significant hardware change is occurred we can reactivate windows 10. Since I cannot use the
 laptop in future can I buy a new laptop and use my Microsoft account to reactivate windows 10 licence linked to my Microsoft account.</p>

            You can only transfer a Windows 10 licence from one computer to another if the original installed version of Windows was a retail version. If, as I suspect, the original version of Windows 8 was preinstalled by Sony on your Vaio laptop it would be an OEM
 &nbsp;and not a retail copy of Windows. You cannot transfer an OEM copy of Windows or it's successor Windows 10 to a new computer. THe licence is linked to the computer , not your Microsoft Account.

            <p>Linking your Microsoft Account only eases the reactivation on the machine the upgrade originated, not on another machine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<h3> soulrider2013  say:</h3>
<h2>            XboxLIVE Error Code 8C230002.</h2>
                    
<p>I've been a gold member fo something like two months now, and up until a few days ago I didn't experince any kind of problem with the marketplace at all. A few days ago I noticed that when I sign in to my profile, there are ton of things missing like the
 music section, TV &amp; Movies section, and etc. On top of that, I can't seem to see some sections in the game section, like Add-Ons, Indie, Demos, and Extras. If that's not enough, there are tons of games that doesn't show at all. I tried to sign in from a different
 account that doesn't have Live memership and on that account everything in shown and looks good, so I tried to buy Dragon Age 2, and when I tried to sign in to my previous account which has the gold membership to confirm it, it gave my error code 8C23002,
 which says<strong> "Sorry, There's a problem with the XBOX service. Try again later. Status Code: 8C230002".<br />
</strong>Now I tried to check the support section a few times regerding that error, and from what I understood then, it seems that my profile is blocked form this contents for some reason. So I did everything and anything the support section said, starting
 from turning off the Family settings, and then customize the privacy settings, and still nothing seems to change. I tried to download Darksiders 2&nbsp;from the game marketplace on the site, but it doesn't work either. I tried to clear the system cache, but still
 nothing seems to fix the problem. Help will be much appreciated.<br />
Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replay, but like I said, I already tried everything suggested, and it didn't work. Does anybody else experienced this problem before or something along this lines that can help with the matter? I already tried setting the family settings off
 and turn the console off for an hour but that didn't work. Can this contact be blocked because I'm not a US citizen or something like that? Thanks in advance to anybody that helps out.</p>
