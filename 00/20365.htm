<p>This would be helpful, however I am using a mobile phone.. And in Outlook.com I do NOT have the settings you listed under Options. And my phone settings do not sync with many apps on my Windows 10 phone. Seems each update brings another problem with font
 sizes and reading text on the phone settings. It is extremelysmall. And advanced settings no longer offer an option at all. At a loss.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Change a password on a &#39;dummy&#39; account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shinyscalp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change a password on a &#39;dummy&#39; account</h2>
                    <p>I set up a phantom email account for RSVP responses to my wedding invitations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent Â£70 getting wedding invitations printed using this email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it was required during account set up, I used the date that my fiancee and I met as the date of birth, which caused some to-ing and fro-ing as, being 8 January 2010, Outlook.com assumed (quite correctly) that the account holder's age was only 8 and so
 would need parental consent. So I used Microsoft Family to set it up, it is now associated with my own account - to the point where I can restrict access time etc. for my non-existent family member -&nbsp; and thought we were good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, however, I've forgotten the damned password and all my attempts to reset it require me to enter personal details (such as the last email addresses sent to and an exact subject line of a sent email, when no such details exist!!) for a person who does
 not exist. Consequently all I get is a red message saying "you have not entered enough information to proceed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reassuring to know that a third party would struggle to access my own hotmail account, but annoying in this instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the password reset on a special purpose account like this? I can't postpone the wedding and don't want to get the wedding invitations reprinted - can anyone at Microsoft do this for me? Or just delete the (entirely empty and unused) account
 and let me set it up again from scratch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>

<h3> djemen  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I show all not flagged messages in to do list&#63;</h2>
                    I tried all the filtering options but even when you choose filter -&gt; all mail -&gt; flag status -&gt; equals Unflagged&nbsp; you can see no emails at all in the to do list.<br />
We use flagging for emails to mark them visually as dealt with across different computers on imap account so I need the to do list to show a list of all unflagged items which is something exactly opposite to what the list does by default.<br />
<br />
Is it possible at all? I know there is an option for SQL code so I presume everything is possible but it needs to be possibly someone from Microsoft or with programming knowledge to answer?<br />

<p>Hi RobMuroff,</p>
<p>Itâs not feasible to set up Address Book to search GAL (Global Address List) in Outlook 2016 for Mac because Outlook clients on Mac donât support sync or update GAL. The Outlook clients on Mac use EWS (Exchange Web Service) to connect to the Exchange Online
 server.&nbsp;EWS will perform a lookup in the GAL when composing a new message and start typing in the To/Cc/Bcc fields, and will return result if there is a match in the GAL. You need to add the contacts manually to the Outlook 2016 for Mac client if they cannot
 be searched. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>About this feature, we suggest you submit feedback to the related team via clicking the smiley face in the upper right corner in the Outlook client. Understanding your experience helps us to make our product and service better for you and others.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Larry</p>

            OneNote is turning into one of those multiple applications with the same name only MS applications.
<br />
<br />MS is deprecating OneNote 2016 and on the PC side replacing it with the "improved" OneNote Windows 10.  The problem with OneNote Win10 is that it can't read files stored on your local drive. 
<br />
<br />This article goes into more detail on some of the differences between the 2. It includes instruction on how to download OneNote 2016.  
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-the-difference-between-OneNote-and-OneNote-2016-a624e692-b78b-4c09-b07f-46181958118f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s...</a>
<br />
<br />So, what you could do is setup Windows inside of Bootcamp so that you can load OneNote 2016.  Then you should be able to open the files and transfer the information to OneNote Mac.

<h2>            Outlook 2010 sending unreadable&#47;unopenable file</h2>
                    I have been sent an email, sender using Outlook 2010, in which the sender has attached their contacts. I cannot open the file for the life of me. Any help? I am using Windows XP. Word 2003. OE6, but it doesn't seem like any of that matters. Is it me, or
 is it the senders attachment settings?

            good to know; however, i was attempting to open this email attachment through hotmail, gmail, outlook, etc.. the attached file is always unopenable. the only information that i have is that the sender asked outlook to assemble some contacts from outloook
 and their addresses in the attached file and then sent the email. that attached file is unopenable. i am assuming that whatever program outlook 2010 uses to compile and attach this information is the problem. but i have no real basis for assuming this, other
 than i cannot open this file on any computer...albeit no computer i have used has outlook 2010.<br />

            <p>What is the file extension of the attached file?</p>
<p>What happens when you try to open the file? Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>You can ask the sender to export the contact file in CSV format attach the file to an email and send it to you.</p>
<p>Once you receive the email, save the attached file on the desktop and then try to import it in outlook express and check if it helps.</p>

            there is no file extension attached to the file. It was saved as "jonathanslist" and that is all that appears. I was kinda surprised by that also. I was expecting it to be .dat but it doesn't have that extension. It is just listed as "unknown file type."
 When I choose to download the attachment it calls it "application/octet-stream" which I have no idea what that is. When I attempt to open it, it doesn't have a program to open it with, so it asks me. I have tried virtually everything. I tried word and all.
 I tried adding an extension to the file type so that it would open in Word. All a no go. When I open it in Word, there are a bunch of error messages that i click OK to a bunch of times...and then word opens the document...but only 5% of the document is readable.
 I will try the CSV format method.<br />

<h2>            Lost phone - how to recover contacts from Nokia PC Suite &#40;backup&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Regrettably&nbsp;I recently lost my Nokia 6303 along with all my contacts. I did however sync and backup my 6303 with Nokia PC Suite. I have since bought a replacement - a Nokia 5800 - and am trying to import my old contacts (from the lost 6303) to my new replacement
 (the 5800) - but I can't see how to do this within Nokia PC Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts very welcome!</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.techsmith.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SnagIt</a> will do that, in as much as you can capture any screen or part of a screen and send it to an open document (or a new document). However only one Word version can be the default because of the way Office applications
 share resources. You can also send the captures to a variety of other applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SnagIt is not free, but it is the one application I can think of that more than justifies its expense. If there is a better one, I don't know it.</p>

            <p>I'll second Graham's recommendation. In addition to providing numerous capture methods (including "printing" a Word document to a graphic file) and graphic file types, it also offers a wide range of editing tools for adding captions and callouts, cropping,
 blurring, adding effects, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One caveat: It appears that Kaspersky Internet Security (which I use) interferes with Snagit's All-in-One capture, and Kaspersky hasn't seen fit to correct the problem.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response, but I am looking for an add-on that can be installed in Microsoft Word Document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the step wise process of taking screenshot once the add on is installed :</p>
<p>1.Install the add on in Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>2.Open a word document with add on installed.</p>
<p>3.Start the add on.</p>
<p>4.Go to the application or website of which screenshot need to be taken.</p>
<p>5.Press Print Screen key of keyboard.</p>
<p>6.the copied screenshot will be pasted automatically in word without doing an Alt+Tab and pressing Ctrl+V.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can save enormous amount of time if one has to take so many screenshots.As it saves the time of doing Alt+tab and then pressing Ctrl +V every time.</p>
<p>

<p><b>NOTE:
</b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie âsend to Bluetoothâ, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different ârandomâ symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Itâs not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>

<b>Donât Assume ANYTHING!</b>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Donât assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesnât apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just arenât aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too easy to have
 an unwanted app installed if you donât carefully read every screen. </p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<b>Uninstall Recent Software</b>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;

<p>I recently used online chat support myself. I found it had several advantages over phone support, even though you still contact the same outsourced, support personnel:</p>
<p>
<span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No ESL accent issues</p>
<p>
<span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Provides instant time stamped transcript</p>
<p>
<span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When you get transferred to the ârightâ person, they can review the history</p>
<p>
<span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If they donât read history, you can copy / paste the past conversation to them, saving you having to repeat yourself</p>
<p>
<span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They are more likely to go off line to ask other people for help (good for you)</p>
<p>
<span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You donât have to listen to âelevator muzakâ then they are off line</p>
<p>
<span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You have 2 hands free to surf the web then they are not talking to you</p>
<p>that waiting for online chat responses less frustrating than listening to elevator music.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And when I was handed off to someone else who asked redundant questions, I simply copy and pasted the earlier replies I had given.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus it immediately gives you a timestamped transcript which you can share with the world ... &lt;grin&gt;</p>

    <title>Calls to my Skype number ring split second, but cut off before I can - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c.carroll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calls to my Skype number ring split second, but cut off before I can answer</h2>
                    <p>I set up a Skype number in anticipation of a job interview this coming week.&nbsp; I tested it on Thursday before giving it to the hiring company by calling the number from my cell phone.&nbsp; I was able to answer the call in the Skype application on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be sure, I tried testing again today.&nbsp; Now it fails miserably.&nbsp; The call rings and rings (on the phone I'm calling from), but in the Skype application on my laptop, all I get is a quick flash of the "answer/hang up" box.&nbsp; It disappears way too fast for
 me to answer the call.&nbsp; On my cell phone, the call continues to ring.&nbsp; The "answer/hang up" box may flash again in the Skype application after several more rings, but it again disappears much too quickly&nbsp;for me to answer (maybe half a second).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's more, I am unable to log into Skype support; when I try to log in with my Skype account, it asks for an email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(And now, as I try to submit this, I am being forced to make selections about the type of question that are not relevant to my problem.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate the case, please provide the <strong>exact version </strong>
of the Skype application that you are using. Also, please specify the <strong>Operating System version</strong> of your Windows Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And with regards to contacting Skype Support, it will ask&nbsp;some &nbsp;information like an
<strong>email address </strong>and <strong>Skype name </strong>before being connected to a live support.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, it never connects me with live support, even after I log in with my Skype user name and password.&nbsp; As soon as I click Help, it logs me out, and I'm in a never-ending loop of trying to log in so that I can get something other than "Ask the Community"
 as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For <strong>general and technical Skype </strong>concerns, you will be redirected to Skype community for support. While for
<strong>billing-related</strong> <strong>concerns</strong>, you will be routed to Skype live chat&nbsp;support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for us to isolate the case, please follow the troubleshooting steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Sign out and quit Skype. Make sure that it is not running in the background.
</span><br />
</li><li><span>Launch Run command by pressing <strong>Windows + R keys</strong> at the same time.
</span><br />
</li><li><span>On the Run dialog box, type in <strong>%appdata%\Skype</strong></span><br />
</li><li><span>This will open your Skyp</span><span>e folder. Locate a file named <strong>
shared.xml&nbsp; or shared </strong>if your file extensions are hidden then delete it.</span><br />
</li><li><span>Next, locate a folder named after your Skype name and double click on it.
</span><br />
</li><li><span>Delete a file named <strong>config.xml or config. </strong></span><br />
</li><li><span>Exit and rename your entire S</span><span>kype folder to <strong>Skype_Old.</strong></span><br />
</li><li><span><strong>Re-launch</strong> the Skype application.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know of the results.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The answer/hangup flashed even more quickly than before.&nbsp; The call kept ringing on the cell phone for a few more seconds, but then hung up with no answer.&nbsp;

<p>I just want to summarize what happened after Aljon_T contacted me privately.&nbsp; He put me in touch with another support person via live chat.&nbsp; That person spent an hour trying to troubleshoot the problem, having me repeat Aljon's suggestion of deleting config.xml
 and shared.xml and renaming the Skype folder.&nbsp; He then tried to call my Skype number, but the same problem occurred.&nbsp; On his end, he could hear the phone ringing and ringing, but on my end, nothing happened for a long time after he dialed, and then something
 would flash in the Skype desktop client.&nbsp; Eventually a "missed call" notification would show up.&nbsp; The phone continued to ring on his end.&nbsp; It flashed again in my client, but disappeared so fast that I couldn't even see what it was.&nbsp; I ended up with four "missed
 call" notifications for the one call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After nearly an hour, he offered to refund my fee for the Skype number, and suggested I buy another one (?!).&nbsp; He seemed to thing that the problem might be specific to that particular number.&nbsp; There was no way I was going to risk my interview on yet another
 Skype number, so I borrowed someone's phone and gave the employer that number.</p>

<h3> rwr_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 btinternet sent folder not syncing with on line version - mail does send</h2>
                    <p>I've got a btinternet.com (Yahoo) email account set up in Outlook 2013. &nbsp;Inbox and all folders show the same content in Outlook and the webmail version EXCEPT the Sent folders.</p>
<p>If I send from within Outlook, the message only shows in the Outlook Btinternet Sent folder; if I send from the web version, the mail only shows in the webmail Sent folder, but the mail does send from both methods.</p>
<p>Other devices (IPad etc.) mirror the webmail folder content (which sounds reasonable to me).</p>
<p>This has only been happening since 10 October 16.</p>
<p>Other mail accounts (gmail etc.) I have set up in Outlook correctly sync all folders.</p>
<p>I think it's no use contacting Btinternet as they will just say it's an Outlook problem!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just like the subject is, whenever I close a task reminder that popups, I try to save it to popup later, but it does not save and shows in the reminder window.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Why so many problems with outlook as of lately?</p>

<h2>            Email attachment permission problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running Outlook 2003 SP3 on MS Windows 7 Home Premium using MS Word as my email editor. Lately when I try to manually attach any file from My&nbsp;Documents to an email I get the following error message from MS Word: "You don't have appropriate permission
 to perform this operation." I can left-click on the same file in My Documents and "send-to" as an attachment. Nor is there any problem with manually attaching&nbsp;files on the Desktop or in shared folders on my network. It's just with manual attachment of files
 in My Documents that I'm encountering this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.</p>

            Thanks for your request for more info. I have MS Office Pro 2003, including Outlook, installed locally on my home PC. This is not an Exchange connection. The My Docs folder also resides on my local HD and this email attachment problem only affects that
 folder and its contents. There is no problem attaching documents located elsewhere in my local network.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digging on the Windowsphone.com/support, I found a tool that fixed some issues with BITS that were apparently the cause. It was a "Fix it" tool. It did the trick.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 not receiving all gmail emails</h2>
                    I am having a problem with Outlook 2010 and 2003 not receiving all gmail messages. All gmail messages are coming through on my and my husbands iphones. And our gmail acct is set up as pop in Outlook and on our iphones. The emails that are not coming through
 into Outlook are still on the server so it's not a gmail problem as far as I can tell. And our account is set up to leave messages on the server. Please help. Thank you. Susan

            <p><span>Hi Susan,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. As I understand, you do not receive all the emails in Gmail inbox configured in Outlook.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Before starting the troubleshooting steps just a quick questions:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Is there any similarity between the emails not receiving in Outlook (like; the issue occurs with a particular recipients or particular domain etc.)?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you created any rule in Outlook to move the emails to any folder?</span></p>
<p><span>To check:</span></p>
<p><span>Click on <b>File</b>&lt; <b>Manage</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Alerts</b>&lt; under
<b>Email</b> <b>Rules</b> tab check if there is rule set. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Check if the email is received in junk email folder in Outlook.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Remove the email account, re-add it in Outlook and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><b><span>To remove the email account:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Close Outlook. Click on <b>Start</b>&lt; <b>Control</b> <b>Panel</b>&lt; <b>Mail</b>&lt;
<b>Email</b> <b>Account</b>&lt; highlight <b>Gmail</b> account and click on <b>Remove.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>To-re-add the email account:</span></b></p>

            <p><span>Thank you for getting back to me. The messages that donât show up in my Outlook 2010 inbox are not in junk folder. They show up in my husband's Outlook
 2003 inbox. Or sometimes they show up in my Outlook 2010 and not in his Outlook 2003.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no similarity in emails that don't arrive. Yesterday I didnât receive a message from a teacher â sent to all parents, but I did receive a different
 message from the same school (therefore same type of email acct) from a different teacher. I didnât receive an email my husband sent me from this
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;acct, but it did show up on my phone and his Outlook 2003. I also didnât get a message from a hotel, or a facebook update. These were all on his computer and both of our iphones.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I carefully looked over my gmail server settings and they are good. And I removed and reentered the email acct in Outlook using the settings link you sent,
 which is exactly the same settings I had in there â exactly. Iâm a very detailed oriented person and I looked carefully.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The only rule I have is âclear categories on mail (recommended)â and I donât believe I entered that, itâs a default setting I think.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What else? I donât understand why some messages arenât coming through to my Outlook 2010 or my husbands Outlook 2003. Thanks for helping me.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely, Susan Houlihan</span></p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a quick question:</p>
<p>Is the same email account configured in both Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2010?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Login to Gmail web-mail and check if you are able to view all the emails on the Gmail server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also check if Leave a copy of email on the server I checked on both Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2010 (because, the emails that are not received in Outlook 2010 are received in Outlook 2003).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Outlook 2003:</span></p>

            Thanks Anula, but as I answered above, I have all of the settings correct in Outlook 2003 on my husbands computer, and Outlook 2010 on mine. Both have "leave a copy of message on server" checked, and there has never been a problem with my gmail server
 - the messages are always there. The problem is with Outlook. Like I did not receive the above message from you on my computer Outlook 2010 but it came through my husbands Outlook 2003 computer and on my phone as well. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Because Outlook 2003 and 2010 have different settings, our 2003 is set up as incoming pop 995, outgoing 25 smtp. And for 2010 Outlook incoming is 995 and outgoing is 587 TLS. That is what the settings you emailed me said, but is there a problem because
 they are different for the two different Outlook versions?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm really quite frustrated. I should be receiving all email messages in my outlook and I am not. Nearly a third don't come in on my 2010. I wonder if you, or someone else might be able to 'share' my computer and look at why?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

            Susan I am having the exact same issue here with one of the PC's in my office. We are using Gmail Email for our domain (ie @wincotx.com) however one pc is having issues with emails not coming into Outlook 2010 at all and this has been since 8am this morning
 till now of about 4pm and happens off and on. There is email in the account since we can look at them online by logging directly in.
<div><br />
<div>I know this is an issue with Outlook 2010 and many others are experiencing the same exact issue with a complete silence from Microsoft for some reason. I am looking for a solution and hoping that I can find it cause it is causing big issues here in the
 office. I really do not want to have to deal with this lol but I do not have a choice.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have double checked the setttings and mine are exactly the same as yours and set up correctly. Please post here if you do find a work around and I will do the same. Right now I am working on finding a solution to this problem. Needless to say its driving
 me nuts.</div>

            After spending so long dealing with not all of my emails arriving in my iphone or in outlook or my husbands iphone or his outlook, I did a lot of research online. If you go into the settings on each of these devices for the email account, change the Incoming
 Server Username from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" to "recent:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" this puts it in "RECENT MODE" and it means all devices will receive all emails. You'll need to potentially do this to all of your email accounts, or at least the ones that aren't sending all
 devices all the email messages. Good luck, Susan

            Hi Susan,
<div><br />
<div>I was having the same issue where I was not receiving emails in Outlook after checking them on my iPhone or iPad first.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I use IMAP and followed the instructions in the link below to setup my Outlook settings.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The instructions ask you to first log-in to GMAIL and&nbsp;verify that<b> </b>IMAP is enabled. &nbsp;I took is a step further and
<b>Disabled POP download</b>. &nbsp;Once I made that update, I received all my emails on my Apple devices and Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/17248/set-up-gmail-imap-in-outlook-2010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/17248/set-up-gmail-imap-in-outlook-2010/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<span>I hope that little updates helps others running into the same problem.</span>

            Can you pls resend the instructions? Microsoft censors the critical stuff i.e.
<br />
<br />
<i>"If you go into the settings on each of these devices for the email account, change the Incoming Server Username from
<b>"*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</b> to <b>"recent:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</b> this puts it in "RECENT MODE" and it means all devices will receive all emails."<br />
</i><br />
ALSO where do I edit "Incoming Server <u>Username</u>"? You don't mean the Incoming Server name, do you? That should be pop.gmail.com for Outlook 2007. If you only have the Outlook 2003 or 2010 procedure, that's fine.<br />

<p>Seemingly random email not being received from gmail account and no 'rules' setting. Not showing up in Junk either. The emails are still visible on the gmail website. I reset a bunch of them to unread, thinking that perhaps that would help. No luck.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It started when I tried to synchronise my ipad contacts with Outlook&nbsp;- which got too complicated and didn't work, so I am certain that it resulted from altering some settings as it used to work perfectly before hand.</p>

    <title>Outlook Live Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erikcotter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Live Folders</h2>
                    <p>I have a Hotmail email account, which changed to Windows Live, and then as an Outlook Live account. Over the years, I created multiple folders for organizing emails that I want to save. But, for last several months, most of these custom folders I created
 do not appear on the left side of the screen where they used. Only one of the folders I created is visible on the left side of the screen, which I think was the last folder I created. The folders show as options for moving emails to, and using the search feature
 I can find email within the folders. So, I think they still exist, but I don't know how to access them.</p>

            <p>Nobody here knows what the Microsoft plan is. The impression I get [FWIW] is that the intent is to make Mac Office more like Win Office, even though that means first stripping it of anything Win Office doesn't have. Apparently, the comfort level of Win Office
 users has a far higher priority than that of the Mac client base.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that we will not see NBL View returned to Word... Otherwise it wouldn't have been removed to begin with. Instead, OneNote most likely will be expanded to include the narration feature. Even if my hunch is correct, when that might occur I have
 no idea.</p>

    <title>COMPLAINT&#58; Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmcdivitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            COMPLAINT&#58; Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>On my Windows 10 system it's necessary for me to completely disable UAC by way of registry entry, the same way UAC is disabled in Windows 7. This is because of a security issue reading files and folders in some of my processes, that full and complete access
 cannot be obtained unless UAC is completely disabled. Simply setting UAC to the lowest value with the slider is not sufficient, unfortunately. Research yields no resolution to this issue through coding changes to the processes, except to completely disable
 UAC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to try Microsoft Edge, but cannot, because like other Windows Apps, Microsoft Edge will not run with UAC disabled. The only Windows App that works with UAC disabled is the settings app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It annoys me to no end how Microsoft continues to try and coerce everyone into the same user profile, regardless how they use Windows, and regardless of proficiency. For instance, I don't ever want to see any pictures in my Windows Explorer lists, and I
 always want the details view. It is very, very hard to maintain that. Microsoft consistently fails to hear the needs of people who use Windows outside their force-fed user profile. This is a reason Microsoft is losing market share. As soon as a workable alternative
 to Windows appears, people will change. For instance I do a lot with android PCs and have a nice network utilizing Windows and android together. Microsoft might pay attention to Remix OS at &nbsp;http://www.jide.com/en/remixos-for-pc &nbsp;and also the&nbsp;Jide Remix Mini
 at &nbsp;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0177OAIIK/ref=pe_2313360_164985650_em_ti .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft completely missed an opportunity by failing to make a version of Internet Explorer available on all platforms including android and iPhone. Because of that I use Chrome. It is the only browser that seamlessly shares my bookmarks and history across
 all devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please change Microsoft Edge so it will work with UAC disabled. And while you're at it, do the same for some of those other apps you want me to play with. Thanks</p>

            <p>Upon install Edge I began to encounter a multitude of problems.&nbsp; When this thing automatically updated to 11, the problems multiplied tremendously.&nbsp; I cannot get any YouTube videos to play... comes up with errors and all errors point back to Edge being incompatible.&nbsp;
 Also cannot play many of the Pogo games because Edge does not support flash player.... Searches are severely slow and crashes are more common than connections.&nbsp; To add to all of that frustration many websites will not open or sometimes deemed non existent.&nbsp;
 ie&nbsp; adobehelp.com, Marlboro.com, AARP and some of the more important sites I visit each and every day.&nbsp; Some of the ones on my favorites list, &nbsp;and these have been for years, come back as unknown and/or bad address!&nbsp; I do not understand a business&nbsp;like MICROSOFT&nbsp;
 who would intentionally put out a product that is not only inferior, but did not do the proper testing prior to enacting the change.&nbsp; NOT NICE GUYS.&nbsp;

            <p>There is an old saying, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."&nbsp; It is old country advice that Microsoft would do well to learn.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Offfice 365 in Internet Explorer when you download an attachment from Mail you get the options "Open, Save or Cancel."&nbsp; Using Office 365 in Edge when you download an attachment from Mail you get the options, "Open, Open folder, or View Download."&nbsp;
 Save is not an option.&nbsp; Also in Internet Explorer you had a down arrow next to the "Save" that gives three additional options of "Save, Save As and Save and Open."&nbsp; Edge does not provide this very useful tool.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer was not broke the way it was in this area.&nbsp; What possible good reason did the Microsoft Edge developers have to take this ability away.&nbsp; As it is, I will stick with IE.&nbsp; That is until IE is no longer supported and I move away from Windows
 based machines and end up an Apple user, never to ever buy or use Microsoft software again.&nbsp; And yes, unfortunately it looks like that may be the way it may go.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly wish I can say this is the only example of this.&nbsp; But it is not.&nbsp; I can write a long email on the changes in the software "Paint" that made the older version far more useful than the newer one.&nbsp; And the reason, the same, they took capability away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft
 should never make newer software&nbsp;LESS capable than their tried and true old software.&nbsp; All I can to that is, "Shame on you Microsoft."&nbsp; Continue down this road and you will see market share continue to erode until this once&nbsp;great company joins Nokia in the&nbsp;trash
 heap.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi d0gknees,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first, and relatively minor issue, is that in Paint, you can't start another iteration of Paint.&nbsp; Today, I have to ask Cortana to open another Paint.&nbsp; This is more of a nuisance.&nbsp; But why was this taken away?&nbsp; I often need three or four iterations of
 Paint up at a time to move and combine images or elements between the iterations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest issue is in the old Paint, you had varying sized squares and large "+" zones to&nbsp;pick from&nbsp;for your brush strokes.&nbsp; And though, I get that this feature didn't operate like a brush, it was very useful&nbsp;when I cleaned up images at the maximum zoom.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
 current Paint strokes does not&nbsp;provide these blocks of&nbsp;solid color option, like the old Paint.&nbsp; This is a major take-a-way in functionality.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;the maximum zoom was greater in the old Paint&nbsp;than in the&nbsp;new.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a&nbsp;big issue too, as&nbsp;it is more limiting
 in getting to the details of the image.&nbsp; The new Paint has some nice added features, but overall I miss more of what was lost from the old Paint, than what&nbsp;is gained from the newer version.&nbsp; Had Microsoft just added to the older version, then I would be one
 very happy puppy.&nbsp; But alas, as I have found so often of late, newer is not necessarily better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some other minor issues, but I would need to go back and use the old Paint for a while to provide those details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YMMV</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bill</p>

            I can help with one of those issues. You can run as many copies of Paint as you want, and the same applies to most applications. Just hold down Shift and click the icon and it will launch another copy.

    <title>Cross-reference applying same formatting that is applied to the parent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexli84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cross-reference applying same formatting that is applied to the parent caption that it is referring to</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this question in another thread but for some reason it's disappeared.</p>
<p>Issue I'm having is that the cross-references I'm inserting carry over whatever formatting is applied to the parent caption. For instance,</p>
<p>if the caption is in bold, the cross-reference would be in bold when the field updates. If I start a new line before I insert the caption, like a Table heading, the cross-reference would also start a new line. I often use page breaks before a table so that
 the table is not split across two pages. The caption is inserted after the page break. The cross-reference carries over the page break so I'm getting breaks in the middle of my paragraphs! It seems fine initially until you update all the fields in the document.
 It seems rather than just referencing the caption, it's actually replicating the caption along with any formatting associated with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doug Robbins posted this reply to my initial question:</p>
<p><em>"</em><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)"><em>Avoid using manual page breaks. &nbsp;Instead, format the caption, which I assume is inserted before the table, so
 that it is kept with next and make use of the settings available for the table rows to prevent them from breaking across pages and format the paragraphs in the table so that they are kept with next were applicable."</em></span></p>
<p>I can't see any option that allows me to link the caption to the table, and the row break option only allows the row
 to shift to a new page, not the entire table.</p>

            <p>For the character formatting such as bold, I can reproduce the carry-over but only for manually applied (not style applied) formatting. To prevent the cross-reference from getting the manual formatting of the caption, open the cross-reference's field code
 and insert a switch, <strong>\* charformat</strong>. This will force the field result to have the same formatting as the first character of the field code (in this case, the R of REF) regardless of what's in the caption. Of course, it would be better to modify
 the Caption style instead of applying manual formatting, and then there wouldn't be any carry-over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the manual page break, I can suggest something that may help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you insert a cross-reference, Word creates a hidden bookmark that surrounds the caption (or just the caption's label and number), and the cross-reference is just a REF field that points to that bookmark. Open the Insert &gt; Bookmark dialog and check the
 box for "Hidden bookmarks". Click on one of the bookmark names that start with _Ref and click the Go To button. That will select the bookmark. If the bookmark includes the preceding page break, then the cross-reference will also include the page break. In
 that case, delete the page break and reinsert it outside (above) the hidden bookmark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WRONG:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3295268e-665c-4649-938f-177d7ab1f14d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3295268e-665c-4649-938f-177d7ab1f14d" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>The "wrong" arrangement can happen if you insert the cross-reference (creating the bookmark) first, then put the cursor at the left end of the caption and insert the page break. If you do these steps in the reverse order, the bookmark will automatically
 exclude the page break.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a nokia e72 and I want to delete the two hotmail mailboxes on my phone because they do not work since january 27 2011. Why no idea. Now I want to delete them but I cann't because I have no connection. The phone says, you need to have connection first
 before deleting? Can anybody help?</p>
<p>I also need to setup my hotmail.com connection again. Can anybody have an idea what the new mail server are or are they still the same and what are the exact settings. Because I changed so much on my phone. I think I do not have the right settings anymore.</p>
<p>I run 052.005 software on my phone.</p>
