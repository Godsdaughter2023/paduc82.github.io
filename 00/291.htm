<h2>            Upgrading to OneNote 2016 from 2013, issues with the move</h2>
                    <p>A couple of problems, might be related, might not be. You tell me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin, I had OneNote 2013 configured so that notebooks were displayed from my C: drive, and the backups were stored on an SD card (in addition to Sky/OneDrive).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded from 2013 -&gt; 2016, my C: drive filled up almost immediately, and I believe OneNote was simply copying the files from the 15.0 folder to the "C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote\16.0" one. I moved some files so that I'd have room,
 and I let it finish. Total, my notebooks are 17+ gigs. Medical school has me printing a lot of PDFs and copy images to OneNote...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I noticed some of my pages weren't loading. It displayed "We couldn't open this page." instead. So I took a look at the online version to see if it was salvageable.
<strong>Loaded just fine on the web</strong>. However, even when I tried using the app (which I never use and didn't even have configured), I couldn't get the pages to display on my PC. Then, I noticed that 11 notebooks were "up to date," but 9 were syncing.
 Fast forward ~24 hours of leaving it this way, and none of them finished, and none of the pages which didn't work had started working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suspicion is that something occurred when my C: drive filled up (when OneNote unexpectedly decided to copy the whole collection to a new folder) which screwed up the files somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compounding this is the fact that the 'screwed up' notebooks refuse to 'close.' They just hang 'closing' forever. So I can't remove them and re-load them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read the related "syncing issues" posts here, but none of the solutions have worked for me thus far. I also recalled that I had throttled OneDrive (secondary to latency issues), but after removing that restriction, the issue persists.
<br />
<br />
Question: <strong>How can I remove the notebooks (which refuse to 'close') in order to re-download apparently functional versions from the web?</strong></p>

            For those who stumble upon this thread from Google and who are too afraid to do a wipe (like me): I ended up just dealing with the "!"s. It doesn't ever fix itself, but it doesn't interfere with function. I'll note that it might be behind my computer's
 impossibly-large bandwidth demand. When I'm on a network, ping goes from 30 --&gt; 500+ for everyone else on that network. Airplane mode = only solution there. :/

            Do NOT update your phone untill Nokia release newer update than this available. This has more holes than golf course (something like internet explorer). Forget it. I have problems with gizmo, my phone restart several times a week, had problems with garmin
 after update....<br />
Maybe I wrong but read other posts and you will see how many problems do people have with new firmware.

            After using the new firmware for 2 days, i also do recommend not to change.<br />
Would like to go back to old firmware, but this is only possible on a Nokia Care Service.<br />
<br />
With the new firmware i can not create a stable Bluetooth-connection to the pc any more. Never had problems like that before.

            DO NOT update the firmware as i have a friend that bought the E71 2 days ago with the latest firmware 110.*.* dated somewhere Oct 2008 has a big issues in trying to connect to the company exchange server where "CONECTION ERROR" keeps appering every time
 we sync with exchange server using the 3G connection with the latest Exchange Client 2.7.0 for S60_3_1 which is downloadable from the nokia website.<br />
<br />
All firmware revision starting with 100.*.* works fine with the exchange client 2.7.0 for S60_3_1.<br />
<br />
NOKIA if your reading this post PLEASE ensure that the Exchange Server client is updated and tested with the latest hardware firmware.<br />
<br />

            The firmware support of E71 is a total disgrace.<br />
<br />
It took Nokia 4 months to come up with an update.<br />
<br />
When they finally did, the update was faulty. Besides, why couldn't Nokia improve the camera performance? OK, it's a business phone, but one should expect more from the camera, business phone or not.<br />
<br />
I have had a lot of cellular phones. Most of them have been Nokia, but unfortunately most of the faulty phones has also been Nokia (in percent). Most of the issues have been firmware related.<br />

            Likewise I was keen to see improvements in the camera functions, most other things are OK but the camera output seems pretty poor (IMHO) for a &gt;3MP system, shame!<br />
<br />
I'll keep a look out for other Firmware upgrade options.<br />

            There is NEW firmware ver. 200.21.118.<br />
If you want to update your phone it is right time. Nokia has really improve ever part that I had problems with. Believe it or not camera is also better (some software correction). It's not great but after the reddish or greenish problems that I had this is
 cool :)

            Updated to v200.21.118. Everything fine but:<br />
1) White blackground for contacts (I actually don't care)<br />
2) "groups" tab vanished! I explain better : when you go to contacts, before the update you had two tabs, one with the contacts, and the other one (you went to it via pressing RIGHT on the pad) with the groups. Now the second one seems gone.<br />
3) Camera sound in previous version was silenced by posing warning tones to off, now that trick seems not to work anymore. Probably the buggy version was the older one.<br />
<br />
Can you let me know if anyone else has these mini-problems?<br />

 I had specifically categorized.&nbsp; Now all those color schemes are gone which is horrible because now I cannot quickly look at my calendar and see which events are most important, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I create a new calendar item (or edit an existing one), I can choose
 to categorize and even select a color, but that color does NOT get shown on the calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp; I NEED A SOLUTION AND FAST.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP.&nbsp;

    <title>Review&#58; Windows 10 build 9926 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andre da costa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Review&#58; Windows 10 build 9926</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p><strong><span>INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The end of an era! That is how it honestly feels to start this journey writing about Windows 10. It’s no surprise, the 90s and even the 2000s have been filled with reviews of technologies such as operating systems that are written in thousands of words;
 just check out some of our own previous reviews and even those from technology websites that have written about new releases of Windows from an encyclopaedic point of view. I personally looked forward to reading them, but looking at the future, this methodology
 of covering the latest version of a Windows release will eventually become obsolete. Windows 10 is certainly the last major (what they call big bang) release of the company’s popular desktop operating system.</span></p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p><span>A lot has changed since 2006 when Windows Vista came to market, a colossus overhaul of a platform that almost brought down the entire industry with it and at the same time giving rise to old and new players. The Internet certainly facilitated the changing
 landscape of how we use and consume technology. The 80’s and 90’s encouraged the upgrade treadmill which encouraged users and companies to take advantage of the latest advances in computing when they became available, processors, memory, graphics, software.
 In a sense, we are almost going back to those days but in a way that does not present the disruptive painstaking migration that was always a certainty of migrating to newer technologies.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 presents a challenge in a market that has pretty much migrated to the Internet. It’s at a cross roads between a world that is old and new. Since I started writing this preview, Microsoft has released four revisions of the still in development
 operating system. Normally I would have jumped on the first build and started preparing content for readers about the new operating system with the first preview build, but I felt a bit reluctant. I think that was within good reason, considering that Windows
 10 has undergone significant changes since October and the most recent build, 9926 is still a reflection of the platforms infancy.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b836532b-ae4d-4221-9390-eb2ddad1cc4b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since Windows 8 came to market in late 2012, it has been met with mixed reviews. The bold strategy behind that release left behind a market of more than a billion users who have enjoyed working on desktop and laptop computers using mouse and keyboard
 for more than two decades. The consistent evolution of the Windows interface since Windows 95 gave users the confidence about how they operated a PC. Windows 8 took most of its influence from its mobile sibling Windows Phone OS which was practically unknown
 and lacked the market penetration to provide a familiar transplant to the desktop. A mixture of bad execution, lack of modern applications and questionable design decisions made Windows 8, the company’s Vista 2. This even resulted in the company having to
 scramble to tone down a lot of the earlier design choices a year later with a revision called Windows 8.1 and another major update seven months later called Update 1. With the continued rapid growth of competing platforms such as Android and iOS, both of which
 own nearly 100 percent of the mobile market have left Microsoft in a position of defending its legacy.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since the launch of the Windows Insider Program in October 2014, Microsoft has provided two editions of Windows 10 for evaluation, Pro and Enterprise. A Core SKU exist for PCs running consumer editions of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1, but is only applied
 when setup is initiated through Windows Update. For the purposes of this review, I will be using the Pro edition, build 9926. Pro includes additional premium business functions such as Domain Join, Group Policy, BitLocker Drive Encryption, Network Backup and
 Remote Desktop. Microsoft has not finalized all the details regarding pricing, but existing Windows 7, 8/8.1 users will be able to upgrade to the final release of Windows 10 for free within the first 12 months of release. If you are running volume license
 clients, you will still procure Windows 10 the way you do licenses today. Windows XP/Vista users will need to purchase a new license or you can work around this now by migrating to Windows 10 Preview today which will provide a direct upgrade path to the final
 release. Keep in mind, you will be installing pre-production software. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13590fc4-6973-4b75-9254-4399c3969a77" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Familiar Desktop Experience: </em></strong><em>Users coming from older versions of Windows such as Windows 7 will feel more at home. The start menu makes a triumphant return in Windows 10, but holds on to much of its Touch functions. Notification
 Center also centralizes notifications and makes it easier to access common functions like Wi-Fi, Display, orientation and Location.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System requirements for Windows 10 remain remarkably unchanged since Windows Vista, although users should expect some caveats. Microsoft has noted that some older AMD and 64 bit capable CPUs are not compatible with Windows 10 at this time. Although
 the final requirements have not been defined, if your system can run Windows 7, it should be able to run Windows 10. Do keep in mind, meeting the system requirements is one aspect, low level requirements like PAE, SSE2, NX support are still necessary. The
 Windows 10 user interface remains pretty much the same as Windows 8.1, some would argue more subdued, yet refined, with bolder brighter icon palettes, re-emphasized window shadows, loss of window chrome and subtle window controls that are more desktop friendly.
 Long-time Windows 7, XP, Vista users are sure to feel more at home in Windows 10 than its predecessor. Immediate changes such as direct boot to desktop, removal of the controversial Charms bar and Alt-Tab menu are sure to bring a lot more cheers than sneers.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>SETUP</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It is evident that the Windows Setup experience in Windows 10 is a place holder, hints of changes to come can be seen in the Out of Box Experience. If you have installed Windows Vista or later, you pretty much have an idea of the setup routine. Rumour
 sites have shown leaks suggesting a refresh to the wizard interface adhering to more of the subdued design theme for this release. For the purposes of this article, I have done mostly clean installs on an existing partition or in a Virtual Machine utility
 such as Oracle Virtualbox. I thought build 9926 would have been the build that I committed to, but since build 9860, Windows 10 has gone through more unstableness than stability. In fact, I would describe the development experience more like Windows Vista,
 where features are built as the team goes along. This does not feel like a Windows 7 or Windows 8 at this stage of development where the planned, frozen feature set is being engineered. Then again, I can’t blame the Windows Team considering that Windows 10
 was originally intended to be Update 2 for Windows 8.1. Evidence of this can even be found in the Group Policy editor. It was even noted that the OS at one point was called Windows 9. Overall, the traditional setup experience is about as stable as you can
 get. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Windows Team and Microsoft have clearly learned from the disaster that was Windows 8.1 acquisition using the Windows Store. Since 2013, the experience upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 remains unstable and uncertain, so much so that Microsoft
 recently released a Media Creation Tool (which is what they should have done in the first place) that makes it easy to do an in place upgrade using media from Windows 8.0. Existing Windows 7/Windows 8.1 users will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 directly
 through Windows Update by downloading a small tool that enables the capability. Once this tool is installed, all you need to do is check for updates and download the 2 to 3 GB Update and this will start into setup after a reboot. . I always wondered why Microsoft
 never thought of it this way from the get go? Windows XP and Vista users will have to do a custom install by booting from install media, you can’t even start setup from the desktop in those versions of Windows. The Windows 10 development story is not expected
 to end at RTM as with previous releases. The Windows Insider program which started in October 2014 will be an ongoing part of the Windows Development model, providing a vast community of users who are risk takers interested in evaluating fresh code when it
 becomes available. Microsoft will push out revisions of Windows 10 using the Preview Build mechanism built into Windows Update for such testers. Business users will of course be able to avoid this by using a slower mechanism for deploying updates and revisions
 to Windows 10 in the future. In fact, you can’t do build to build updates unless you have Administrative privileges. Microsoft will give company’s the choice though to move to revisions much quicker if they wish, providing a Current Branch and a Long Term
 Branch, both of which will be well tested after going through Microsoft’s rigorous internal development processes and Windows Insider Program participant paces.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 setup continues the excellence in hardware detection introduced in Windows Vista. Although all the systems I tried Windows 10 on required that I connected to Windows Update to download Video drivers. I was of course pleased to have out of
 the box network support. Only thing I had to do was run Windows Update, download the drivers without even doing a reboot. The Out of Box Experience continues to be refined although the company needs to understand not everyone wants to use a Microsoft Account.
 So I would like to see more prominence for setting up a Local Account instead of hiding it to the point it feels like you are coerced into setting up or using a Microsoft Account. I do like the benefits of using my Microsoft Account with Windows 10 though.
 Lets face it, Windows 10 is a heavily cloud centric revision of Windows, it is heavily based on a servicing model, if you really want to harness the benefits of using the OS, a Microsoft Account will be strongly recommended (not required). Otherwise, you will
 be just upgrading I guess to use a revised Windows 7, although there is much more to the OS than just the online experience.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are just coming from older versions of Windows other than Windows 8/8.1, a lot has changed since. For instance, Control Panel is being deprecated, replaced by a more modern configuration tool called Settings. Settings simplifies and consolidates
 the myriad of Control Panel items into a set of logical, stoic groups that lead to more verbose options. Of course, this might take some getting used to and so far there have been some outcry, especially with the revised Windows Update that Microsoft has gone
 too far with. I agree to some degree, for instance, Windows Update no longer provides options for customizing and defining which updates are installed. You will have to settle for all or nothing. Although you can view the details of an update, there is not
 much more you can do. I hope Microsoft listens and refines these areas before RTM.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>DAILY USAGE</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 might be going in the direction of being the best desktop operating system yet. It basically includes the best of Windows 8.1, with the advantages of what made Windows 7 a great desktop operating system, probably the best version to date.
 Of course, your first experiencing logging into the OS might not be desired, users will have to adjust to a reality of what it means to be connected to the cloud. As I noted, if you really want to get the most out of a Windows 10 device, a Microsoft Account
 is preferred, although you are not required to have one, if you want to utilize Windows 10, you should jump in.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Windows 10 desktop at first glance feels, subtle, yet underwhelming. You are greeted by a revised Start menu that you can immediately feel is trying its utmost best to please two audiences. So far, it feels disjointed. I personally prefer the ideas
 that were introduced in Windows 10 build 9841. Windows 10 build 9926 the Start menu still feels like it’s trying hard to hold on to its Touch Centric roots too much. I have to be honest with you, the tile apps while nice are just not for me, I hardly use them,
 so I would have preferred if Microsoft had none at all. Regardless of my opinion, much of these choices need to be understood, Windows run on over 1.5 billion systems worldwide, you are not going to be able to reach a perfect compromise. Regardless you might
 not agree with all the design choices, it actually works. Just to make it feel like I am using the OS, I will pin apps I do use, mostly desktop apps such as Office and VLC for instance. I particularly despise the new integrated Cortana Digital Assistant menu
 on the Taskbar (I have it disabled). Although I appreciate the benefits, the implementation looks awkward, I personally would rather have Cortana be more omnipresent than having an actual visual presentation.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3556fd6-679d-46e3-9efd-43a3bbba0f0a" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Desktop productivity: </em></strong><em>Windows 10 introduces a long awaited feature, multiple desktops. Called, Task View, Microsoft's implementation uses an app centric approach to managing your opening applications. Snap Assist improves Microsoft's
 earlier implementation, making it easier to snap and organize available windows you have open.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Start menu as I noted tries to reapply much of what was lost in Windows 7, but does so in a way that feels unfamiliar at times. The new alphabetically grouped application listing under All Apps which replaces the Start Tip (8.1) and All Programs
 (7/XP/Vista), feels rough and is more akin to Windows Phone users who have limited navigation options. On a desktop computer with generous real estate, this does not seem necessary. Again, I resolve this by pinning or using the run command to launch apps.
 Windows 10 reintroduces old favourites like the Jump List, although users complain that it’s not like Windows 7, for instance, you can’t pin your favourite personal folders like Favorites to the Start menu like you did in previous versions. The menu features
 basic customization, such as the ability to resize on the fly or maximize to a full screen Start Screen and of course, you can pin, drag and drop items. Power Options and Fast User Switching have been split into two separate menus.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Taking into account over 300 million persons seem to like running Windows 8/8.1, Microsoft is not leaving those users behind. If you are running a Tablet or 2 in 1 device, the operating system still provides the familiar Start Screen. If desktop users
 wish, they can enable this menu on the fly by clicking the expand button on the menu which will immediately provide a familiar environment. The All Apps menu is now a part of this improved Start screen. Users will notice that the Taskbar is always on screen
 instead of being hidden. Called Continuum, the aim is for users to get the best of both worlds. Microsoft is working to ensure that there is little manual interaction required. For instance, 2 in 1 devices will automatically switch to the appropriate mode
 depending on the mode the Tablet is in. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The desktop might seem unchanged, but as noted, Microsoft has removed a lot of what made Windows 8.1 unique and different to existing Windows 7 users. Activating menus such as Charms or Alt-History are no more. Two new additions that desktop users
 will like though include Multiple Desktops called Task View and Notification Area provide more productive benefits. Although I do find the Notification Area to limit options I preferred such as the quick access to Wireless Networks and defining connection
 settings. Notification Area consolidates all notifications into a centralized pane; for example when you connect a storage device or disconnect one, receive messages, app updates from the Store. Notification Centre also lets you can quickly adjust settings
 like screen orientation when on a Tablet, Quite Hours and connect to a Virtual Private Network. Task View in Windows 10 is unlike Spaces in OS X or Linux implementations. Instead, Windows 10 takes an app centric approach by making each app define the experience
 while keeping a single manageable approach using the Taskbar. I would like to see some customizable options such as Setting a unique Desktop Wallpaper, drag and drop options. Another productive improvement is Snap Assist. Windows 7 first introduced an iteration
 of this function which allowed you to snap together to windows on screen by simply making it possible to drag the window to opposite sides of your screen; automatically each window will fill its half of the screen. Snap Assist in Windows 10 is more intelligent,
 when you drag the first window to the other side of the screen, it immediately organizes the other windows into small thumbnails on screen, you can quickly choose from. So, it’s more of a less effort process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Probably the biggest change users will experience if you are coming from the Windows 8x releases is the fact that Modern apps are now windowed. Unlike the apps in Windows 8x which were full screen, you can now have modern apps floating on your desktop
 alongside traditional desktop applications such as WordPad. They feature most of the functionality of a desktop app such as window controls for minimizing, maximizing, closing and even resizing and taking advantage of functions such as window snapping. Modern
 apps include a couple more window controls though, a full screen function lets you go back to the traditional full screen mode. Also, functions of the Charms menu are now tucked under a separate title bar menu called App commands, it offers functions such
 as Searching, Projection, Play To and app settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>FILE MANAGEMENT</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Not a lot has changed in File Explorer with exception for the addition of a Home Directory (something that might sound familiar to OS X/Linux/Unix users. Unlike what you see in those operating systems, the Home Directory is more of a host for recently
 accessed locations. I like it, it makes opening frequently used directories faster. For instance, I am always browsing directories on my external hard disks, whether it’s backed up files, music or movies. These are often tucked away into sub folders on an
 external storage device. File Explorer will learn my behaviour and keep a shortcut of the most frequently accessed directories on the drive in the Home directory. So all I need to do is just open it when I connect my external drive. This works just as well
 with network shares or folders you frequently accessed within Windows. Privacy options are included so you can easily clear any traces of recently accessed locations from the folder options.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Windows Team has also added some customization options such as the ability to define the default directory you would like to have open by default when you launch File Explorer, whether your Personal Folder or Computer environment. Overall, File
 Explorer remains unchanged since its introduction in Windows 8, the now familiar Ribbon still remains same.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>CONNECTIVITY</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The days of knowing protocols such as TCP/IP or 802.11 are really behind us. I remember reading about Internet Connection Sharing in Windows XP. Today, I connect to the Internet on my Windows 10 PC over wireless by simply sharing the Internet from
 my Nokia Lumia 625 smartphone. It doesn’t get any easier than that. </span></p>

<p><strong><em>Settings: </em></strong><em>Windows 10 introduces a less confusing and refined settings app which focuses on bringing pretty much all the functionality found in the classic desktop Control Panel. In fact, managing updates are exclusively done
 through this new Settings app. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>INTERNET EXPLORER and PROJECT SPARTAN</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 includes Internet Explorer 11 which is expected to be the last revision of the company’s 20 year old web browser. Microsoft is preparing its next generation web browser code named Spartan that will focus on providing a streamlined interface
 and enhancing web site compatibility. Internet Explorer remains unchanged from current versions available for Windows 8 and Windows 7. The browser of course offers better site compatibility, I notice many sites that I often browse with IE display pages better,
 without broken elements or having me resort to compatibility mode. Spartan which is an exciting project promises to provide both compatibility but with greater emphasis on modern standards. Spartan uses a heavily revised code based off the existing Trident
 rendering called EdgeHTML. Spartan will support advances in Windows 10 such as Cortana for finding information on the web, Annotation, PDF support and a superior reading experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>MULTIMEDIA</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Users of Media Center which was Microsoft’s major push for bringing the PC into the living room should get the message early that Windows 10 is the end of the road. Unlike Windows 8 which still offered support, Microsoft decided to end all support
 with this release. Users running Windows 8/8.1 with Media Center will have it removed automatically when they upgrade. If they need this feature, they should think twice. Apart from that, legacy applications like Windows Media Player are still around, but
 are hidden. The OS now comes with out of box support for standards such as .MKV and FLAC which would have been nice 10 years ago, but I guess better late than never. This of course provides one less reason to use a third party solution such as VLC Player which
 I have been loyal to for years. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft’s modern multimedia apps such as Music and Video are greatly improved reincarnations of earlier versions. They are much more stable, full featured and integrates better with the desktop and mouse/keyboard. I especially like Music which supports
 many of the standard features of a desktop jukebox. Of course, I still can’t stand the fact that these apps are not as quick as their traditional desktop counter parts. I am still greeted by a splash screen that leaves me waiting. Don’t get me wrong, they
 are much improved over what were obviously buggy iterations in Windows 8.0, but I thought by Windows 10, they would have matured to the level of desktop app performance. I can have a movie playing in VLC or Media Player quicker than I would in Video. I honestly
 would love to make apps like Video, Music and Photos my default choices, but I tend to be an impatient guy. Also, they still lack some desktop support like Jump List support or Live Tile controls.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e588a51-7eb2-47f9-b788-06fcc0f9a2c4" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Modern apps: </em></strong><em>Modern apps take on desktop functionality with the ability to be windowed.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Speaking of Photos, the approach to library management in Windows 8.0 was complicated, but I liked the premise of bringing in everything from the different sources such as Flickr, Facebook and other services. That has ended and Microsoft is focusing
 exclusively on making the Photos app a mature, robust app for library management and editing. The integration with OneDrive is also a critical component, providing syncing with the service, so not only are your photos backed up to OneDrive, but they can also
 be accessed naturally from within the app.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Navigating the application is so much more logical than its predecessor. You are greeted by a Library view with all folders in which you store your pictures displayed in thumbnail view. One of the things I still need to get use to is navigation in
 these modern apps. For instance, getting out of a folder requires that I right click to activate the back button which takes me to the main folder. It’s a small learning curve and at the same time you learn that Microsoft is trying to appease two audiences
 here. Photos app is not just library management, you can also edit your photos by accessing again (hidden) options for adding effects, adjusting colour, lighting and basic corrections. Could Photos be a replacement for something like Photo Gallery? It offers
 most of the functionality you would expect to find in Photo Gallery, you can import photos directly into the app from your digital camera, organize them, edit them and even play a slide show. Will you like it is another question. I would say Photo Gallery
 remains more Touch friendly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows 10 includes the latest version of DirectX version 12 which will be an exclusive. The new version includes significant performance and optimization updates. Microsoft has noted there is a 20% performance improvements in GPU bound games.
 Microsoft said <em>‘In DirectX 12 the app has lower level access to the hardware and when combined with higher level app knowledge of when things like resource synchronization need to happen, the app has the power to make optimizations specific to its use
 case.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 and XBOX ONE will support streaming games to your various devices such as a Tablet or PC. After setting up, an XBOX app on Windows 10 will present all games available on the console so you can stream them to your PC or over the network.
 Your XBOX Controller can be paired to your PC so you can interact with your games. The XBOX app will let you capture and share 30 second clips.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ADVANCED FEATURES</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 includes Microsoft’s Digital Assistant which will provide deeper interaction with your device in new ways. Cortana, can be used for finding and retrieving information on the Internet and your PC, such as files and directions. You can also
 use it to control applications such as the Music Player and prepare an email message. Persons who might not like this feature can always turn it off if they wish, since it requires users activate it in the first place. I personally don’t like to have it on
 my Taskbar at all times. Hopefully a future build will resolve this. Cortana is not limited to just the desktop, Microsoft is also integrating the service into its new web browser Project Spartan.
</span></p>

<p><strong><em>Start Screen lives: </em></strong><em>Windows 10 still supports Windows 8 functionality, the Start screen is more refined, now called Contiuum. This mode offers greater support for 2 in 1 and Tablet devices.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Universal apps are a big part of the Windows 10 story and to help really bring across that message, the company is finally delivering universal versions of their Office suite optimized for touch. The new Office apps while not as full featured as their
 desktop counterparts, provide an environment with the relevant tools for users who are mobile. Users can edit, prepare documents, spreadsheets and presentations with full document fidelity regardless of device. Windows 10 also comes built in with a touch optimized
 version of OneNote. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Application compatibility story can’t be determined yet, but my collection of apps work just fine with Windows 10. I have Office 2013, VLC, Firefox, Adobe Reader 11 and iTunes 12. I notice that iTunes 12 though is not recognizing my iPod Touch and
 other users have reported experiencing this problem as well with Apple devices. Why am I still using Adobe Reader? Well, I would love to go all Windows, but the built in PDF app cannot view and sign certain PDF files, so I have to keep around Adobes PDF tool
 for the time being. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For enterprise customers, Microsoft is making it easier to deploy Windows 10. In the past, corporate customers with volume license Windows Upgrades were required to ensure that machines had a qualifying premium business SKU installed before they could
 be reimaged. The license compliance was at times weird, considering, you would normally have to blow out that preinstall image anyway with your own custom image. Now, you can upgrade preinstalled Windows licenses to Windows 10 without having to do that.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft is looking beyond its traditional mobile and desktop platforms and promises to bring Windows 10 to new areas, in particular wearables. Called Microsoft Holo Lens or Windows Holographic, the product can be best described as a smart glass unit
 that is cordless running Windows 10. Holo Lens uses advanced sensors, a high-definition 3D optical head-mounted display, and spatial sound to allow for augmented reality applications, with a natural user interface that the user interacts with through gaze,
 voice, and hand gestures. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Apps that take advantage of Windows Holographic include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">HoloStudio a 3D modelling application which can produce output for 3D printers.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Holobuilder, a demonstration inspired by the video game Minecraft.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">An implementation of the Skype telecommunications application.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">OnSight, a software tool developed in collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>OnSight integrates data from the Curiosity rover into a 3D simulation of the Martian environment, which scientists around the world can visualize, interact with, and collaborate in together using HoloLens devices. OnSight can be used in mission planning,
 with users able to program rover activities by looking at a target within the simulation, and using gestures to pull up and select menu commands. JPL plans to deploy OnSight in Curiosity mission operations, using it to control rover activities by July 2015.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Among the sensor types used in HoloLens is an energy-efficient depth camera with a 120°×120° field of view. Other capabilities provided by the sensors include head-tracking, video capture, and sound capture. In addition to a high-end CPU and GPU, HoloLens
 features a Holographic Processing Unit (HPU), a coprocessor which efficiently integrates data from the various sensors. The HPU allows the HoloLens to perform tasks such as spatial mapping, gesture recognition, and voice and speech recognition, while operating
 without cords or wires. According to HoloLens chief inventor Alex Kipman, the HPU processes "terabytes of information" from the HoloLens's sensors in real time. Microsoft expects HoloLens to be made available "in the Windows 10 timeframe" and priced for use
 in both the enterprise and consumer markets.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft recently announced that Windows 10 will support USB Type-C and Dual Role standard. USB Type-C features much smaller design in addition to twice the speed of standard USB 3.0, meaning you can move data at 10 GBs per sec. USB Type-C is not
 like micro-USB ports, it features a design that makes it easy to use for instance, there is no wrong way to insert a male end into the female end. USB C can also deliver 100 watts of power and power 4 K displays other peripherals.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>SERVICES</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>OneDrive would probably be described as one of the most important parts of Windows 10, it defines what the platform means to be connected to the cloud, and it is in fact the key to using Windows 10s new features. With Windows 10, Microsoft is deprecating
 the dedicated modern app and focusing exclusively on the desktop client instead. Another major effort is the unification of the sync engine, instead of separate engines for its consumer and business versions, OneDrive will have just one unified engine for
 both markets. The placeholder feature introduced in Windows 8.1 is being replaced in Windows 10 because. It was kind of confusing by providing shortcuts to files that were not available offline, this was of course great for devices with limited storage. The
 Windows 10 version of OneDrive replaces this with selective sync; with this option you can choose to sync just the folders you often access. I find this option way better since I won’t have to be forced into syncing everything. I mostly need just my Office
 files, which I have in a special documents folder on OneDrive, so I will just have that synced and leave everything else on OneDrive. Another feature OneDrive offers is remote access, you can enable this through a settings option to access your files remotely
 from another computer as long as the computer is available. AutoPlay now supports saving Pictures and Videos directly to OneDrive in addition to that, Microsoft promises to add music and playlist integration in OneDrive. OneDrive also adds performance improvements
 also for syncing large amounts of files that demand a lot of bandwidth.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1abed41d-6d47-4f4b-b512-f656e25ff6d2" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Services: </em></strong><em>Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant makes the jump from mobile to the desktop, providing exciting new ways to interact with your PC. You can ask for directions, write an email message, search the web, ask for directions
 and of course find files on your PC or network. OneDrive continues its deep integration in Windows 10. Providing a unified engine, better performance and better syncing options such as syncing options called selective sync.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft recently announced that Windows 10 will include FIDO 2.0 support. FIDO short for Fast Identity Online provides alternative methods to using traditional passwords for authentication. Some of the services that FIDO specifications in Windows
 10 supports includes Windows 10 sign-in, Azure Active Directory and access SaaS services like Office 365 Exchange Online, Salesforce, Citrix, Box, Concur. With Windows 10, for the very first time Windows devices and Microsoft-owned and partner SaaS services
 supported by Azure Active Directory authentication can be accessed end-to-end using an enterprise-grade two-factor authentication solution – all without a password. Windows 10 will also include Active Directory integration for on-premise scenarios and Microsoft
 Account integration with other Microsoft services such as Outlook.com, OneDrive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>CONCLUSION</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 is a major revision of an established platform, reimagined to be what Windows 8 should have been. The OS focuses on innovation with a healthy dosage of practicality. It is obviously trying its very best to meet the needs of a dynamic market
 while still trying to meet the needs of a legacy of users who actively enjoy using their traditional form factors. Unlike Windows 8, there is not much learning curve, it will certainly be a much smoother transition for the more than 900 million Windows 7 users
 who still are holding on tight to the nearly 6 year old operating system. Windows 8 users will feel welcomed too, the OS does not destroy that platforms investments in touch which has spawned a variety of interesting form factors over the past three years.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The meaculpa is a big one with Windows 10 and the olive branch extended in the form of a free upgrade, it certainly makes it an enticing offer. I am sure Microsoft does not want a repeat of the staying power Windows XP has experienced with Windows
 7 either as a contributing factor to the free upgrade decision. Will users jump on it is another question, there have been some outcries regarding design choices in Windows 10 and I can see Microsoft responding. There is a problem in regards to contentment.
 I rarely find a Windows 7 user who is unhappy with the OS. It accesses all of the modern websites users visit and spend most of their time. A lot of the competing technologies that come built in Windows 10 like OneDrive have alternatives to contend with like
 the popular Dropbox, users seem to prefer Chrome no matter what and let’s not forget, popular apps like the latest versions Office, AutoCAD, QuickBooks, Adobe Creative Cloud and Google services also run Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This certainly makes it a hard sell for Windows 10 and at the same time I love it and want to see it be a success. I like using the OS, it contains a lot of innovation, Cortana, OneDrive, further desktop productivity improvements like Snap Assist,
 Notification Center, richer modern apps. There will certainly be a challenge ahead for really bringing a message across that Windows 10 is an upgrade you want to take advantage of, even with a major incentive of it being free.

<p>PopVasile,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia Discussions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried clearing existing pairings on your Play 360? If not, here are the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Switch the speaker off,and press and hold (-) button and the power key for 5 seconds. The blue and red indicator lights alternate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>After the pairings are cleared, you must pair the speaker before you can use it again. When you switch on the speaker, pairing mode is automatically activated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that doesn't resolve the issue, I advise sending it back to the retailer where you have bought the item or to a Nokia Care Centre in your area for a warranty claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Good luck</div>

<p>May I kindly know what phone / device do you use to pair your Nokia Play 360 with? I'll be needing that information in order for me to supply the right advise for the issue that you are currently having with the device.</p>

<p>Hey Thanks for the reply,</p>

<p>Okay. I'll advise doing some basic fixes first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, clear all the pairings on your Play 360 by following the instructions I provided on this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't do the trick, try removing the battery by opening the compartment lid located at the bottom of the device. Bring it back on after 5 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If both fails, please provide an update so I can see what to do next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Good luck</p>

Exactly the same problem with my Nokia Play 360. Removing the battery did not help neither clearing the bluetooth pairings.</p>

<div>Switch the speaker off,and press and hold (-) button and the power key for 5 seconds. The blue and red indicator lights alternate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>After the pairings are cleared, you must pair the speaker before you can use it again. When you switch on the speaker, pairing mode is automatically activated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that doesn't resolve the issue, I advise sending it back to the retailer where you have bought the item or to a Nokia Care Centre in your area for a warranty claim.</div>

            Hi Mark, <br />
<br />
To rotate 90 degrees for a PDF view in Microsoft Office client, we can follow the steps below taking Word example:
<br />
<br />
1. Open Word and add a PDF file. <br />
2. Click <strong>Picture Format &gt; Arrange &gt; Rotate &gt; Rotate Right 90 degrees/ Rotate Left 90 degrees</strong>.
<br />

<h2>            Word 365 &#40;newest version&#41; crashes multiple time while typing - NO COM - add ins&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have had bad luck with Word. I have had crashes since the 2003 version and I keep on upgrading to the newest version hoping the crashes would stop, but they do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have subscription to the newest Word 365, with newest updates - I believe that is 2016 version.&nbsp; I disabled and removed all Add ins so when I go to Options and Add Ins, I have ZERO COM add ins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open or create a new document, am typing and out of the blue, voila - my Word either freezes and/or restarts.&nbsp; About 20 percent of the time I get Autorecover - so some of my work is saved. About 20 percent of the time I get Recovered - so all of my work
 is recovered. About 60 percent of the time it opens in the last saved version so my last few minutes are not saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I delete regularly all temp crash files from all drives - sometimes after repeated crashes I will have a dozen or more temp files starting with ~.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it saved every minute now and sometimes click on SAVE ever EVERY SENTENCE and still manage to lose a paragraph or so of my work in between crashes! Ridiculous!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can keep on crashing my Word?&nbsp; It is a new PC with lots of memory and huge hard drive!&nbsp; Even after doing Quick Repair or even Full Repair, it can cash within the next few minutes.&nbsp; I have had occasional crashes maybe once a week in the 2003 version.&nbsp;
 Today it crashed at least 20 times despite Quick Repairs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Again, I have NO Add Ins and check Add ins after each crash to make sure none were added, if they are added without my knowledge, they are promptly removed.&nbsp; I am getting tired of the crashes.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>As Stefan says, constant crashes shouldn't be happening. Windows offers a helpful tool for possibly finding out what's causing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within a few days after a crash, click the Windows Start button or Cortana and start typing the word
<strong>reliability</strong>. When the Reliability Monitor is shown in the menu, click it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/659bd8d5-2ab7-4e2b-9bab-a5b4cb42741e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/659bd8d5-2ab7-4e2b-9bab-a5b4cb42741e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This program shows a timeline by days, and you'll see an X in a red circle in the top row when a rpogram such as Word has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff667752-38d1-4113-9de0-209531e2d685?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff667752-38d1-4113-9de0-209531e2d685?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on that day's column and look at the details section below the timeline. It will tell you what program failed, at what time, and at the far right is a link for "View technical details". If the failed program is Word, click the link. That will give
 you a list of details, most of which require special knowledge to interpret. The possibly useful detail is the line that starts with "Faulting module path" -- if you're lucky, that points to the file containing the code that caused the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at several Word crashes and they share the same faulting module, take a screen shot of the list of details and post it here. We may be able to use it to tell you how to stop the crashes. (If you need instructions about how to post a screen shot,

<p>OK, got it.&nbsp; It's my friends at HP, I guess, with my Officejet Pro K550 needing the space for paper handling.&nbsp; Also, I now understand why it's the "same" problem, cutting off bottom page borders in portrait and left-hand edges in landscape.</p>

            Dear JerryGans ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />If your Microsoft account was deleted due to inactivity, that means that you have not been using it for more than 5 years ( or even less, depending on when it was created, please see more information here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13811/microsoft-account-doesnt-exist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13811/...</a> ). After it was deleted the "name" for that account was free so anyone could have registered that account in the meantime. So the best option to check if this account exist will be to try to login to it <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/inbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/inbox</a> . Now if you will enter your previous account and you will be brought to the password page, it will mean that someone else already registered that account. If not you will get error saying that this Microsoft account does not exist, so you will be able to recreate it.

<p>Hello JerryGans</p>
<p>
</p><p>The password for outlook.com can be recovered and the recovery of password depends on your account activity. For the password, the account holders should Logged IN at (<a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/inbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/inbox</a>)
 once in every 365 days and after 365 days of inactivity the email account will be deleted and cannot be recovered. If you entered your mobile number you can also recover your email with it.</p>

<h3> chrisdsy  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Library Properties in Office 2016 Programs</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have been having an issue with Office 2016 version 16.0.7341.2021, that I have requested support for and I am a bit frustrated with the Microsoft support. It seems to me they are say the issue is my problem, we don't care.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other users are on a previous version of Office 2016, and they are not experiencing the same&nbsp; issue as I am. But being the designated IT person I try to stay on top of the latest releases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue, I get two different behaviours:</p>
<p>1. When I try to save a document to our SharePoint (Office365) Document Library I am unable to add the required document properties to the document so&nbsp; it will not save to SharePoint.&nbsp; In my version of Office 2016 under 'Info' next to the property name it
 say's 'Show Details' when I click on this nothing happens. It should open a dialog screen with the content type and the content type properties in it to fill in, but it does not.</p>
<p>2. When I try to save a document to our SharePoint (Office365) Document Library I am unable to add the required document properties to the document so&nbsp; it will not save to SharePoint.&nbsp; In my version of Office 2016 under 'Info' next to the property name it
 say's 'Show Details' when I click on this&nbsp;it opens a dialog screen with the content type at the top in a drop down list, but has non of the required document properties&nbsp;in the dialog box that the content type is supposed to have, that do show up on the 'Info'
 screen&nbsp;under properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Behaviour 1 seems to happen most with existing documents, while behaviour 2 happens most with new documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office365 support spent 2 days and around 4 to 5 hours with me on a screen share trying to fix the problem. Then they came back with, we cannot replicate the issue, and my engineer say's it an issue at your end. With&nbsp;your computer profile, you
 will need to&nbsp; delete the profile&nbsp;and recreate it. Now we are on a widows 2008R2 network, and if any one has tried to delete recreate a profile they know its not a 5 minute job, and can have all sorts of other issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is when I sore red, and unfortunately started to take it out on the support person who was only trying to do their best. I am experiencing the problem on my home computer and my laptop, which are&nbsp;not connected to the work network. So how can it be the
 profile. I believe its and issue with either sharepoint or the office version I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone having similar problems? </p>

            <p>Hi Fraser</p>
<p>As explained, I am experiencing the exact same issue at home where I fist noticed the issue. The computer I an experiencing the issue on at home has a fresh install of windows 10 Anniversary on it from last week end. Is not connected to my work network,
 so&nbsp; the profile it uses is&nbsp;completely different&nbsp;to the profile on my work computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing issue on my work computer, Windows 10&nbsp; anniversary&nbsp;- connected to a windows SB server 2011</p>
<p>My home desktop, Windows 10&nbsp; anniversary - not connected to work network&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Surface Book Windows 10 anniversary - not connected to work network</p>
<p>
</p><p>All are using the same version of click to run office, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And sorry, I don't seem to have access to you PM after MS's community maintenance today. My community profile seems to have reverted&nbsp; to an old one, and I don't seem to be able to access ChrisDSy, it seems to log me in automatically from office365 under

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>That is the number that was on the support request that I lodged from O365 admin console, it was also the number in the subject of the email from the from the support person, and in the body.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have any other number. If its any help I spoke to s support person in the UK. What I also find annoying is that in the new admin console when a support tick is marked off by the support person it just disappears from the console as if it never existed.
 You cannot review past support requests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never spoke to an engineer, only a support desk person. Towards the end of the conversation about my issue the support person basically said the engineers are too busy to to look at the issue, he said they were unable to replicate it. So if I did not delete
 my work profile and try to fix it myself that way, they would do nothing to help. I, he could attempt to escalate the issue with the engineers but they are so over worked that it could be 12 months before it was dealt with. At which point I told him to forget
 it, I would try to solve the issue myself. To say I was not impressed would be an understatement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence my post to the community to see if anyone else has had this issue and how they dealt with it. Or whether they received the same level of support I did!</p>

            <p>Now am I not only having trouble with adding O365 SharePoint office document properties to documents. But as of yesterday our column data is not working correctly. Where as before you could click on the column and filter by property now not all properties
 are showing up. See attached pictures, the tax property does not show up in the filter but is clearly been entered, and neither does the client code, and yes they were added many weeks ago so indexing should have captured them. I am getting really frustrated
 with SharePoint. I am seriously considering Google Apps. It does not have all the bells and whistles, but some times less is better as it works. This all started when when renewed our subscription, our old plan was no longer offered, Midsize Business, so we
 went to Business Premium. Since then there has been nothing but issues. </p>

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
Thanks for letting us know what you have experienced. I will&nbsp; pass it on to our related team for improvement.<br />
<br />
Now, let’s focus on the issues&nbsp; to try resolving&nbsp; them.<br />
<br />
To further investigate the first one, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.You mentioned both your work computer and home PC encounter the same issue. Are those documents to which you failed to add properties stored in the same document library?<br />
2.Go to File&gt; Infor and click Properties&gt; Advanced Properties to check whether&nbsp; those required properties are there.<br />
3.Are the required properties default SharePoint properties or custom properties?
<br />
4.If&nbsp; they are custom properties, which type of column did you create for&nbsp; them in the document library, Single line of text, number, managed metadata,&nbsp; etc.?<br />
5. Did any other user in your organization encounter the same issue? This can help us find out whether this issue is related to a specific Office 365 account.<br />
<br />
For the second issue&nbsp; that column data is not working correctly, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.Is this the library&nbsp; where you failed to save the document from Office 2016?<br />
2.Based on your screenshot, it seems you are using the new document library experience. Please click&nbsp;
<strong>Return to classic SharePoint</strong> to check&nbsp; whether this issue occurs in the classic document library view.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Answers</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes</li><li>Yes the properties do show up, pic below</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/662a3a7c-99e5-44c4-acff-e139e53ac737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/662a3a7c-99e5-44c4-acff-e139e53ac737" /></a></p>
<p>3. They are Term properties, setup in the Term Store. 'Client Code' is open, and 'Financial Year' and 'Doc Category' are closed.
</p>
<p>4. Columns are site columns, and are managed data. They are included in custom content types so I can add them to the libraries without having to recreate them. We all 6 client libraries are currently affected, in the one site.</p>
<p>5. The issue with entering document properties is currently only affecting me. I am on a different version of Office 2016 to everyone else, version 16.07167.2055. I have been going to update one other users to see if they experience the same problem. However,
 there is an update that looks to have come out today so if I update them they will go to the new version. So will update mine first to the new version to see if the issue is corrected. If not I will update another user to see if they are having the same problem.
 Then go from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** I have removed office from another users computer and updated it to the latest from the Office 365 portal and they are experiencing the exact same issue I have. When the click the 'Show Details' in the properties section of excel they get the screen
 below, they can select a content type but are unable up add the required SharePoint properties as they do not display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This picture is what I receive when I click on on of the properties to enter it, there should be places to enter the required property information. Alternatively when I click it nothing happens.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Second Issue:</p>
<p>1. Yes</p>
<p>1a. The issue with the columns in SharePoint, everyone is affected. The column values are not showing up in the select filter as per previous post.</p>
<p>2. They are working in the classic experience. But they have been working in the New Experience correctly for the past month, at least. Since we moved most of our client working documents (194,000) to SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Symbian is officially over, Nokia outsourced the team and will not release any further devices running it. Retail sales have stalled and developers have abandoned it. That being the case you are going to see less and less released for it in apps and updates.
 Nokia will support the device until 2016 but support only means honouring warranties and providing help for it. All these are facts that aren't open to debate.<br />
<br />
As for Angry Birds Space it is not Nokia's responsibilty to release that for belle devices. It is entirely up to the games publisher, you should try contacting them.<br />

<h2>            Having problem with my Microsoft Teams</h2>
                    <p>I am using office 365 via my office.&nbsp; I am working from home and all my colleague who using this license doesn't have problem with their Microsoft Team. Meanwhile, I can use my Microsoft Teams via website or my phone. It worked perfectly last night
 because the sign out menu showed while this issue occurred. I tried to turn off my firewall while run this application but the issue still persisted. I don't have VPN or Proxy. Could you please suggest something to fix this?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately, I can't find application cache. I don't know why. Maybe because of all the documents, files, and folders synced to my online storage system related with my job. In the end, I decide to reset my laptop and the application
 can work properly. However, I choose to sign out whenever I done with this application from now on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Transfer Contacts from the N900 to the SIM Card</h2>
                    
<p>I got 2 N900, and that was the worst decision I have ever did. Since December I have had the worst luck hi this Phone. Nothing is compatible to working properly. I sent it to Nokia to Fix what was wrong with it and still the same problem. Now I called Customer
 service to see how we can save the New contacts to the SIM Card, apparently they do not have the program on that phone to do it yet. Waiting for the next update. Does anyone knows? Am I the only one having problems with this phone? Also, when taking Pictures
 it would not save the the phone. It says Process Failed?</p>

<p>When you select contacts goto settings / export / v3 and select folder to export. Once the export is done you can send the contacts to PC and later you can use another phone to put it on sim. I know right now there is no program or option on N900 to directly
 do it. See the phone is still in garage and next update is expected to be big and to bring many changes.</p>

<p>Thank you for the response. But what if you don't have another phone except the N900? They have been promising me about the next update since December, And till now I still have not seen anything. Does anyone knows when is it going to be? I mean I honestly
 am disappointed with Nokia to launch something new without backing up everything to make sure it runs perfectly. 90% of my phones were Nokia.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Office 365&#58; Crop button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nataliecl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 365&#58; Crop button</h2>
                    <p>Every time I select an image in Word or PowerPoint and then click on the Crop button, the part of the image within the crop marks goes dark. Almost as if a black screen has been placed over it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This shouldn't be happening: the image within the crop marks should remain as it is seen normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Microsoft's support team but two of them couldn't fix it. Uninstalling and reinstalling Office from Microsoft's web site did not solve the problem. One in three online repairs and restarts works in making this normal, but then the next day,
 the problem reoccurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this problem or knows why it is happening? If anyone has a permanent solution to this problem, please let me know!</p>

            Seeing this too. Image is OK while moving the crop handles but goes black when you release. My guess is it's a bug.

<h3> dutchy12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6110 Navigator 4.22 update.</h2>
                    Hello, my phone is constantly saying that there is not enough memory to perform this action please delete some data. I have the stock standard 6110, no added sim cards or memory sticks etc.<br />
<br />
There is nothing installed on my phone at all, not even on my memory card. I hear that the 4.22 update fixes this problem but I cannot find it anywhere on the internet to download.<br />
<br />
When I try using the update software Nokia provides it just says there are no new updates available when I know that isn't true since I checked my phone version and it is 3.58 and not 4.22.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows where to download the 4.22 update or anyway of fixing this "not enough memory" problem It would be greatly appreciated, thankyou.

            you still have to wait, because your porivdeer has not yet accepted that new firmware (maybe your phone is branded?). or you might visit a nokia service center, they might still be able to update your phone to version 4.22, or even 5.11.

            Oh ok thanks. Do you know if it costs money to get them to update it? or how long the waiting period it is for them to do so?<br />
<br />
The brand of my phone is Nokia and my service provider is Optus is there a way to find out if Optus haven't accepted the new firmware or if they're going to or not etc?<br />
<br />
Cheers.

            nokia service center wants 25 euro to update the phone with new firmware, when there is NO problem.however given the known bug in route66 with the old faulty firmware, they should update it for free. also big shame on nokie, because they are still not
 able to deliver firmware 4.22 to all providers, even if the version 5.11 gets already sometimes installed on phones in nokia service center. the support for nokia 6110 navigator from nokia is currently incredible bad. older nokia n95-version 1 is now near
 to firmware version 30, and we are still at version 3, 4 or in the best case, version 5. nokia sems to have completely misunderstood real customer relationship management.<br />
<br />
about optus: i can nt say whether there is a way to find out whether optus will release this firmware too, if you ask nokia they will probably answer "check for new updates at least once a month". and you might need to check there for years before you get the
 update. if you ask optus, i guess they will tell you, that they are still waiting for nokias firmware...i cant help there :/<br />

    <title>Line spacing problems in Outlook 2007. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> romans10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Line spacing problems in Outlook 2007.</h2>
                    
<p>Defaults: HTML format, Normal Style modified for Paragraph Format: 0 before, 0 after, single space.</p>
<p>When I compose a note the line spacing between lines, between paragraphs, and in the signature block looks normal, i.e. single spaced. When the note is sent to the recipient, or when it comes back as a reply from the recipient, the lines appear to contain
 extra space, almost double spaced. It's looks terrible in the body of the note, but the extra spacing in the signature block looks downright stupid. I have tried all the online fixes with no success.</p>
<p>The only thing I've managed to fix is the signature block by editing it: At the end of each line in the signature I hit the delete key, then hit&nbsp; &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; after each line.</p>
<p>Very annoying and looks terrible going out to customers.</p>

<p>This usually results from the recipient using a browser to read email - Outlook uses the &lt;p&gt; tag and browsers add more space following the &lt;p&gt; tag. Either use Shift+Enter (edit the signature files, not each message) or accept email as an imperfect medium.</p>

    <title>Hyperlinks dragged from IE are always Calibri 11pt &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brcobrem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlinks dragged from IE are always Calibri 11pt &#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Fyi: Environment: Windows 7, IE 10, Outlook 2010. Default email body font is Century Gothic 10.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I <b>type</b> a hyperlink/url (e.g. http://microsoft.com) into a new email, the url retains the formatting of the surrounding text (as desired). However, If I
<b>drag and drop</b> a url from Internet Explorer's address bar, into the email body, it always comes over as Calibri 11pt.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To try to change this, I create a new email, then: Format Text tab | Change Styles expand down | Hyperlink dropdown | Modify.</div>
<div>Yes, this does allow changing the style (once or permanently), but url drags from IE still come into the email body as Calibri 11pt.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I realize that I can copy the url from IE's address bar, then right click paste into the email body, and choose Merge Formatting. That does insert the url as Century Gothic 10.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, is there a way with a straight "drag and drop" to always have the url accept the font of the surrounding text?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for considering this quandary.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Brco</div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p><br />
From your description, I understand that Outlook is not retaining Outlook's font style when you drag and drop the hyperlink.</p>
<p><br />
I will assist you with this issue.<br />
<br />
Provide additional information:<br />
<br />
1) How are you dragging and dropping the hyperlink from the address bar?<br />
2) Are you referring to dragging and dropping hyperlink from within the webpage? If no, what happens when you try the same?<br />
<br />
Reply with the result for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply and interest :-)</div>
<div><br />
You ask: 1) How are you dragging and dropping the hyperlink from the address bar?
<div>I just grab the url's little icon at the leftmost side of the url, and drag it into an Outlook 2010 email body.<br />
<div><br />
<div>You ask:</div>
<div>2) Are you referring to dragging and dropping hyperlink from within the webpage? If no, what happens when you try the same?</div>
<div>I just tried dragging (ie. just click on it and drag, no highlighting required) a link out of the body of a web page over to Outlook. It also was inserted into Outlook as Calibri 11pt. (Where the surrounding lines were already my default Century Gothic
 10.</div>
