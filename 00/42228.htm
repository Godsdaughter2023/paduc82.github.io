<h2>            Remote Desktop App - How to connect to a computer off network</h2>
                    I've been using this app for a little while now. While it is useful at home, I cannot seem to connect to my computer using the app when I am not on my home network. I have done all the steps to allow access to my pc that have been provided by Microsoft
 and was wondering if anyone else had this problem and what they did to fix it. This app would be much more useful if I could actually use it when I'm off my home network.

<p>
</p><p>Brand new Surface Pro 3, all updates/firmware as of 9/21/14 applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two confounding problems w/ the keyboard:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The on screen does not pop on screen after the tablet wakes from sleep.&nbsp; My SP3 is domain connected.&nbsp; I have to enter a password.&nbsp; I can't use a picture-login.&nbsp; I have to detach and reattach the keyboard several times before I can enter it becomes active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the physical keyboard doesn't work, I have to hold the power button down - destroying work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If I flip the physical keyboard backward and use it as a flat surface, I expect the onscreen keyboard to take over as the default input source.&nbsp; Often it doesn't.&nbsp; I have to flip the physical KB back over and enter, then flip it back.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have brand new SP3, with all updates as of 9/21/14 - including the latest firmware to support the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the surface wakes from idle, the on-screen keyboard fails to pop on the screen at login.&nbsp; My SP3 is domain connected, so I have to enter a password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution is to hold the power button down and perform a hard reboot, which of course destroys in-flight work (the latest victim was a photoshop project).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SP3 keyboard often does not work when this condition happens either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, the screen is responsive - for example, i can click on the 'log in options', it's the KB that fails to pop up.</p>

            <p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting the Surface Community regarding two issues you are experiencing with the Surface Pro 3 Type Cover. That certainly is inconvenient to not be able to use the keyboard, and I will try my best to get these issues resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly when did these issues start happening? Was the Type Cover attached when you got all the updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to issue #1, how does the keyboard behave when the device turns on from a complete shutdown?<br />
You mention that the on-screen keyboard won't pop up after the device wakes up from sleep, and you have to detach and reattach the Type Cover for it to work - so neither the on-screen nor the Type Cover is not letting you sign in?<br />
After signing in, do they start working normally again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct about the on-screen keyboard taking over when the Type Cover is flipped back. Is there a particular time when this function doesn't work, such as at the sign-in screen, on an app, or a program, etc.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what you are seeing.</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Type Cover, Surface &amp; Dock were unpacked, brand new on 9/15.&nbsp; I installed all updates to support the dock.&nbsp; Yes, the Type Cover was attached during the firmware process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a complete shutdown/startup, the keyboard(s) work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two oddities occuring - they don't seem to relate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Upon waking up from sleep, the on-screen display often doesn't pop up - preventing me from logging in.&nbsp; Sometimes the Type Cover will work, sometimes it won't.&nbsp; It's hit or miss.&nbsp; I do detach and reattach the Type Cover.&nbsp; Again, hit or miss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When the system is operating normally and I'm using it on my lap, I tend to flip the Type Cover backwards to have a solid surface.&nbsp; If the Type Cover is flip upside down, I would expect the Surface to realize that configuration and pop the on-screen keyboard
 up as default.&nbsp; Again, this isn't the consistent experience.&nbsp; Win8 native apps (various ones) often don't prompt the onscreen KB to pop up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't a major issue and doesn't happen consistently, an annoyance more than anything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTHs</p>
<p>Eric.</p>

<h2>            How do I remove an unknown&#47;unasked for parental control code&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi - We took our 3 month old XBox 360 back to the shop as the tray would not open and close (there was no disk stuck in it - it just stopped working) and&nbsp;they sent it back to Microsoft for repair.&nbsp; Finally
<em>A month</em> later Microsoft sent us a second hand machine (beaten up and covered in scratches - while ours was still in new condition) as a replacement,&nbsp;&nbsp;however this one<em> did not even power on</em>!....back to the shop we went where they said they
 would have to send it away again. Great! &nbsp;We were looking at another month at least with no xbox - not on! So they gave me a loaner - a second hand one from their store. HOWEVER we now discover that this one has a parental control code on it and wont let us
 play any PG (yes PG) games - it will only let us play Grand theft auto,&nbsp;&nbsp;- I know!! backwards huh? I phoned the store to get the passcode and they dont know it - all they could tell me was that the console was supposed to have been wiped when they&nbsp;got it&nbsp;but
 it obviously hasn't been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is my son's birthday today and he was given a Tony Hawk Ride game&nbsp;with the skate board deck controller&nbsp; AND HE CANT PLAY IT!!!&nbsp; Can anybody&nbsp;tell me how to reset the console so it no longer has parental controls?&nbsp; I have been on live chat with someone
 from Microsoft who gave me a phone number to call in the USA (we are in New Zealand) which only had a message in spanish (I dont speak spanish)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried Xbox ambassadors&nbsp;... no one available to help.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......AGHHHHH!</p>
<p>Please please please can somebody&nbsp;help?</p>

<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/online-privacy-and-safety/online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/online-privacy-and-safety/online-safety</a></p>
<p>Promote a child account to an adult account</p>
<p>Xbox LIVE determines whether an account is a child account or an adult account based on the age of the account owner. Account owners who are younger than 18 are given child accounts in the United States. The legal adult age varies by country and region (for
 example, the adult age in Korea is 20).</p>
<p>Child accounts are tied to an adult's Windows Live ID. The adult account can control Family Settings and restrict some features of Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>After you reach the age of adulthood (which varies by country and region), you can promote a child account to an adult account. This promotion removes the Family Settings and Xbox LIVE restrictions.</p>
<p>To promote a child account to an adult account</p>
<ul>
<li>1.Sign in to Xbox LIVE by using the account that you want to change. </li><li>2.Go to My Xbox, and then select your profile. </li><li>3.Select Manage Account. </li><li>4.Select Promote Child Account. </li></ul>
<p>Note This option is available only if the date of birth for the account indicates that you have reached the age of adulthood (18 in the United States). The legal adult age varies by country and region. The age of an account owner is calculated by using the
 date of birth provided when the account was created. This date cannot be changed. If you entered an incorrect date of birth when you created the account, your only option is to create a new account using the correct date of birth.</p>
<ul>
<li>5.Follow the on-screen instructions to promote the account. </li></ul>

<h2>            Hard drive missing Windows 8</h2>
                    I had been running Windows 7 I have three 4TB hard drives on my pc and everything was working fine. &nbsp;The first two hard drives were partitioned a while ago using a partition program called asus disc unlocker. &nbsp; Now that I upgraded to Windows 8 the second
 hard drive (both part ions) are missing. &nbsp;It shows in BIOS but not disk manager, device manager, or my computer. &nbsp;Any thoughts on how to recognize the drive?&nbsp;

<br />
<br />Have you tried the dvds on anything other than the drive you are currently using? How old is the drive? When did the problem occur? 
<br />
<br />Perhaps the DVD only reads and does not write to blank discs?

            Hi Frederick.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to  help.
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-drive-not-working-missing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />Did the DVD drive work in that PC before?  If so this might have been caused by Windows Update.  Did you receive Windows Updates recently?  Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.  You can try uninstalling any affecting Updates there.
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />See if the problem returns with the Update reinstalling and if so uninstall it and block it using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />To attempt to repair this, go to Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Under DVD Device, click on Driver tab, see if Roll Back is available.  If not choose  Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Next right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down to find the DVD drive.  Does it have a driver letter?  If not right click to issue a drive letter so it shows up in File Explorer, save and exit.
<br />
<br />Run Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />FYI there is no DVD player in Windows 10, they want you to buy one from the store.  There are better free options here:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<h2>            My old skype account is hacked, I cannot revoke it</h2>
                    <p>Good day,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a Skype account I have created ages ago. I stopped using it about 5 years ago.&nbsp;<br />
I have tried to connect to it just recently but I was not able to do it. <br />
Account was hacked, email and password changed. I have tried to recover it using this for:&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/acsr</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>People who have my old account in contacts said the image and name were changed more than a year ago.&nbsp;<br />
Is there a way to report my old account to be removed ? It is clearly a fake one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,&nbsp;<br />
Nerijus&nbsp;<br />

            Hi  NeriuR 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support on this issue. (This is not a bot support but staffed by human agents)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Have you tried installing the latest driver first before connecting the camera?

            Hello,

Try reinstalling Camera driver. Open Device Manager by running devmgmt.msc command. Expand Imaging devices, locate your camera, right click on it, select Uninstall. Click Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes.

Let us know if this helps!

            Press Windows key + X
Click Device Manager
Right click the unknown device then click update driver then search Windows Update for update or point to downloaded driver file for that particular camera. See how:

            Hi Alfred.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to the Lenovo Support Downloads web page for your exact model or Serial number to download and install the latest touch/HID, chipset, BIOS, network, USB, Display, Sound and any other drivers that are newer than those presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Then for any remaining drivers missing or in error with a ! mark in Device Manager, report back the Hardware ID found on the Device's Details tab, in the drop down menu, under Hardware ID, right click to copy the short string ID and paste back here in reply.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>I also&nbsp;suffer from&nbsp;hearing loss, and this is always a difficult question to answer.</p>
<p>The more obvious answer is to increase the volume, however, just&nbsp;increasing the volume can also have the effect of damaging the hearing even further.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you consult a local audiology professional for advice. The newer digital hearing aids have the ability to help by filtering the more damaging frequencies without any loss of quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h2>            how to uninstall printer Software</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;can't get&nbsp;my HP Deskjet 3940v printer to work; I have tried the Troubleshooter to no avail. I want to completely uninstall the printer.</p>
<p>I have the original disk for the printer that&nbsp;it came with so&nbsp;if I can remove everything from my hard disk then I can&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;the printer&nbsp;and see if that solves the issue. I don't think the problem lies with the hardware itself. HP no longer offers any
 support for this printer.</p>
<p>Here is&nbsp; the problem and my question for the forum:&nbsp;(I am a novice)&nbsp; I went to control panel then printers and deleted the printer from that location. But I don't think that uninstalled everything. I looked in Programs and Features and I see no program there
 to uninstall. (No HP, no Deskjet, no program for a printer).</p>
<p>&nbsp;I downloaded the Revo Uninstaller and it still did not show any HP or other printer programs on my computer. But there has to be something having to do with the printer still on my computer. I looked in other posts on this website but did not find out&nbsp;what
 steps to take &nbsp;to uninstall a printer in Vista.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me the steps to take in order to completely uninstall the printer's software?</p>
<p>I am using Vista Home Premium O.S. on my Sony Vaio computer. </p>

    <title>Install Windows 8 on a new HDD&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrick mcdaniel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Windows 8 on a new HDD&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, my sister owns an HP laptop that came preinstalled with Windows 7 Home Premium. Recently the HDD started to fail and she called me to help her replace it. &nbsp;She then went out an bought an upgrade copy of Windows 8 as she thought she could use it since
 windows 7 was already installed on the old, failing drive.<br />
<br />
Is there an easy way to get Windows 8 activated on her new HDD? She has already performed a clean install on the new disk but I do believe she has access to the old one as well.

            To use the upgrade on a brand new drive, you have to install windows 7 on it first to qualify for the upgrade. Read this--

<div>Win 8 upgrade must be installed on the boot drive, so having win 7 on another drive that is not installed in the computer won't work. Request a windows 7 disk from the computer maker if you don't have one.</div>

            Her laptop has two available HDD slots. Would it be possible to connect the old HDD in the spare bya and then activate Windows 8 from it?

Thank you for your quick response and helpful link. I'd like to skim the batch file first as my sister isn't the most tech savvy person and I'd hate to give her something that might cause a security risk. I'll update this ticket if it does indeed work.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A number of reasons can cause this issue. Since <strong>SFC</strong> did not work, we suggest that you run
<strong>DISM</strong>. It will resolve as many errors as possible. You may follow the steps provided by
<strong>ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)</strong> on his <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">article</a></strong>.
 Give it a try.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire and Mahjong Have Stopped Working &#40;WIndows 10&#41; -- White Screen</h2>
                    <p>For the last few days now, Microsoft's Solitaire and Mahjong have stopped working on Windows 10.&nbsp; It goes to (it seems like) play an ad, but then freezes on a white screen.&nbsp; It's just nothing but&nbsp; white screen and you have no choice but to close out.&nbsp; Happens
 every time. &nbsp; First it was just with all the Solitaire games, but now it's happening with Mahjong too.&nbsp; I saw someone else listed this exact problem somewhere yesterday, and many commented saying the same thing was happening to them (I can't find that thread
 now).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Microsoft aware of this issue?&nbsp; Is there anything that can be done to fix it?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h2>            A new ISP&#40;Comcast&#41;, the most recent update, and IP address errors.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently switched from CenturyLink to Comcast. I have a great connection, bandwidth, and ping. On my laptop. In the past I didn't use a separate router and I'm not now. I have the large Atheros modem/router from Comcast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I initially hooked up the Xbox to the 360, I had issues connecting, which was expected. I power cycled everything and started again. I was able to connect to xbox live pretty quickly and was prompted to download the latest update.
 It blasted through the first couple of downloads but erred out eventually due to a network error. I tried to connect to xbox live again and got an IP Address Error. I tried power cycling everything again, but the same IP Address Error kept occurring.</p>
<p>I set an alternate MAC address and it worked. I was able to connect to xbox live and was prompted to download the update. However, the first download gets hung up about a 1/12 of the way through.</p>
<p>Did the first time the update erred out cause a significant problem that I need to 'roll back'? What can I try doing to resolve some of these issues?</p>

            <p>Greetings Shieldziee!</p>
<p>Appreciate if you could post up the make and model of your wireless gateway.<br /><br />Also, state whether you use the external network adapter (black, white), or the built-in (Xbox 360 S/E).</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hey taidara,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response. </p>
<p>The modem is an Arris TG862G/CT. I DO NOT use a separate router. </p>
<p>I plug the ethernet cable straight from the modem into the Xbox. So I use the built in network adapter.</p>
<p>Is this a port forwarding issue? I got home today and was able to get the update. Albeit, very slowly. After that though the connection was spotty with the alternate MAC address set up. Without that, the xbox cannot connect at all and it suggested port forwarding.</p>

            <p>Do you have the Xbox 360 Slim, or an older version?</p>
<p>The Arris TG862G/CT (Xfinity) is notorious when it comes to organize traffic, to and from Xbox LIVE. This is due to firewall setting that can cause MTU, Live Connection Error or Can't Access the Internet errors in older versions of this devices Firmware.</p>
<p>Access the web-utility interface of the TG862.<br /><br /> From the menu on the left select <strong>Gateway</strong>.<br />Select <strong>Software</strong>.<br /><br />Make sure this device is up-to-date with firmware version&nbsp;<span><strong>7.6.59c</strong> or newer.<br /><br />The MAC address shouldn't be the culprit. Therefore, could you try restore your console's network settings to factory defaults, to issue new IP configuration from the DHCP&nbsp;</span>server.&nbsp;<br /><br />Navigate to Xbox <strong>Network settings</strong> and select <strong>Configure Network</strong>. Select the <strong>Additional settings</strong> tab and <strong>Restore network settings to factory defaults</strong>.<br /><br />Restart your console and run the diagnostic test to LIVE (Test Xbox LIVE Connection).&nbsp;<br /><br />If its possible, could you try connect your console with a different Ethernet cable, if the current cable you use might have become defect, which can cause the electrical signal to degrade.</p>

<p>Thank you. </p>
<p>I will go ahead and try this when I get home. </p>
<p>I have the older version of the 360.</p>
<p>All in all, would it be a good decision to add a separate router or even ditch the current modem all together? If so do you have any recommendations?</p>

<p>So, after trying everything prescribed, I can now only have either my Xbox or my laptop connected to the internet through the modem at one time.
</p>
<p>At this point, I would really like to avoid troubleshooting any further and I have no issue plopping down a little cash for a reliable modem/router.
</p>
<p>What are your recommendations?</p>

    <title>windows 10 has lost my 2nd monitor again - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 10 has lost my 2nd monitor again</h2>
                    <p>So got up today turned on my pc and I had no 2nd monitor. All cables connected and not moved over night. The pc is detecting my Samsung tv but its no longer in the "monitor" section on my device manager. Its now in the "digital media devices" section.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in the "control panel/hardware and sound/ devices and printers" its no longer in the "devices" like my other monitor, its now in the "multimedia devices" section. When I "remove device" and then "add device" for a second it comes back to the
 "devices" along with my working monitor and even shows a tv/monitor icon then it moves to "multimedia devices" again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running an nvidia 670 with latest drivers (416.34) but nvidia's control panel cannot see a second monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My working monitor is on DVI and my tv is connected to the hdmi.</p>
<p>I'm on windows 10pro and they did an update in the past 12 hours so i'm guessing it could be that but I can't contact Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the call back is erroring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>help anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />
