<h2>            Changing Function Key Mode in Windows 10 version 1511 OS Build 10586.36</h2>
                    <p>Somehow my function key has been reversed and if I want to select F2 on my keyboard I have to hold down the FN key and then press F2; if I just press F2 I get the lowered audio command (which is usually the FN key + F2 response). &nbsp;I have searched the web
 and only see a reply on this issue for Windows 8. &nbsp;The Windows 8 response was to get into the BIOS and change it there, I was able to get into the BIOS but the setting they suggested to change was not available in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone assist with this question please, I have a Dell Latitude E5450 laptop and I have searched the Dell site as well but to no avail. &nbsp;Please advise. &nbsp;Regards, Chris&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface RT - SecureBoot isn&#39;t configured correctly</h2>
                    I have seen many people have this watermark since upgrading to 8.1 on desktops, but I have this on my Surface RT. The upgrade to Windows 8.1 RT seemed to go smoothly, but I now have this watermark on my Surface's desktop screen. I have no access to the
 BIOS on a surface to change any settings. Do I have to revert back to 8.0 via the recovery image and re-upgrade? This is absurd - it's Microsoft hardware, and the 8.1 upgrade can't configure itself correctly? Do others have this problem on Surface RT? Does
 anyone know of a fix?

            <p>Surface tech support is useless. They offer basic, thoughtless advice like "try refreshing your PC" or "make sure all windows updates are installed". Useless. My problem boils down to this: how do I configure SecureBoot? The error message says SecureBoot
 isn't configured properly. So where do I go and what do I do to configure it on a Surface RT? Tech support can't answer that. I hope somebody out there can. Again, this problem was brought on by the 8.1 upgrade. I need to be able to change UEFI and/or SecureBoot
 settings on a Surface RT. Anyone?</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer Favorites empty and unable to add any items - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Explorer Favorites empty and unable to add any items</h2>
                    I'm on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 and recently restored a backup after a system crash. The restore process required me to alter the default locations of special folders such as Documents, Downloads, Video etc.<br />
<br />
After a reboot my Favorites (top of the left pane in Explorer) became unresponsive.
<br />
The Favorites is empty and I am unable to drag any items to the Favorites window (red "no-entry" sign shown).<br />
Even after resetting the special folder locations Favorites is still unresponsive.<br />
Clicking on "Add current location to Favorites" in the context menu has no effect.<br />
<br />
Additionaly, when I have Favorites highlighted and click on File-&gt;Properties in the Explorer menu, nothing happens.<br />
<br />
I have also tried to create shortcuts in the \Users\me\Favorites folder but they are not reflected.<br />
<br />
Anybody else have this experience or know of a fix?<br />
<br />

            Thanks for your reply Gael.<br />
<br />
I managed to fix it using a different tactic though.<br />
<br />
I tried to save a spreadsheet from Excel to Favorites, just to see where it will end up and was told by the dialog that the file could not be saved to C:\Users\me\Links\Links\file.xlsx because the path does not exist.<br />
<br />
I then created another folder within \Users\me\Links called Links to complete the path C:\Users\me\Links\Links\ and moved all my favourite shortcuts in there.<br />
After closing the explorer window and re-opening another, all my favourite shortcuts were again listed under Favorites at the top of the left pane.<br />
Problem solved.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how I managed to set the location of my Favorites to C:\Users\me\Links\Links\ in the first place though but I've changed the location of Links to point to C:\Users\me\Links to remove the redundant subdir and all seems ok again.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the support.<br />

<p><span>Hi Computer Pulse,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Which application are you using when you get this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Have you tried using an external keyboard and check if you get the same issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if you get the same issue when you boot in safe mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To boot to Safe Mode you can follow the below given steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a. If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow<span>&nbsp;
</span>keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode,<span>&nbsp;
</span>and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For
 more information about options, see ‘Advanced startup options’ (including safe mode).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your
 computer and let Windows start normally.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you boot to the desktop then try installing the Windows installer 4.5 that you have downloaded from the link given.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information on Safe Mode follow the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also contact Acer to check if they have any software for the extra features on the keyboard.</span></span></p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using the Administrator option to install the program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click the installation file and select the Run as Administrator option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this does not help, I would recommend that you contact support for that program and ask about any known installation issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            LG HBS-730 Headset does not do Autoconnect which it used to do in Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>Preface: if you do do not have a solution that is AUTOMATIC, that does NOT require manually connecting the headset, please don't post here. &nbsp;I've read 40+ threads on that already, and that is NOT what I am looking for. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 2 months ago, I bought a MSI Ghost GS60 laptop. &nbsp;Rather than following my standard procedure and immediately blowing Windows 8 away in favor of Windows 7, I decided to force myself to use what it came with. &nbsp;This lead to installing Start8 and ModernMix,
 and with those, I'm 98% as happy with Windows 8 as I was with Windows 7. &nbsp;(Funny how when you make a laptop work like a freaking laptop instead of a tablet people complain less, isn't it?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All was going well until a week ago, when I purchased a LG HBS-730 bluetooth headset. &nbsp;I bought this headset SPECIFICALLY for the "Advanced Multipoint" feature, which allows it to connect to 2 devices at the same time. &nbsp;I have it paired with my laptop as
 the "secondary" device, and my phone (a LG Nexus 4 if anyone's curious, though that should be irrelevant) as the primary. &nbsp;The distinction here is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The Primary Device is the one that receives the signals from the Play/Pause and Call buttons.</p>
<p>2. When out of range for more than 30 seconds, the Secondary Device has to reconnect from the device's end, not the headset's end (the headset will search for the Primary device until the end of time, but not the Secondary device.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here begins my problem. &nbsp;I want my phone to remain the primary device. &nbsp;First, I do not make calls on my laptop, because dude, I have a phone, duh. &nbsp;I also listen to music almost exclusively on my phone, because my laptop is mostly for gaming. &nbsp;Also,
 while I often walk out of range of my laptop (it stays on my desk almost all the time) I am never without my phone in my pocket. &nbsp;And when I say "often" I mean easily 30+ times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accordingly, switching the secondary/primary devices around is NOT a solution. &nbsp;The headset would nag me incessantly that it cannot find my laptop if it was the primary, and I could not control Calls or Music on my phone. &nbsp;Manually reconnecting the headset
 every time I return to the room is equally not an option. &nbsp;It is a total PITA on Windows 8 because it takes me 4 clicks and 30 seconds, and while that sounds like no;thing, that's 60 clicks and 15 minutes a day, every day, just totally wasted on reconnecting
 a headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started leaving the headset and my phone at my desk to avoid disconnects, but obviously when I have to leave the house entirely (at least 2-3 times a day, every day) the phone and headset go with me. &nbsp;This solves nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's what I want Windows 8 to do - automatically rescan every 30 seconds for my headset, and reconnect itself, without requiring ANYTHING on my part AT ALL. &nbsp;And this is very, very reasonable. &nbsp;Yanno why? &nbsp;Because my previous Windows 7 laptop did this,
 without fail, for 4 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if this isn't something Windows 8 is going to do, I'd rather burn 4 hours today downgrading to Windows 7 than 15 minutes every day for the next 4 years constantly reconnecting my headset. &nbsp;If anyone knows of something that'll fix/patch this on Windows
 8 (even something that isn't free, I'd gladly PAY to fix this, just not a fortune) then please for the love of all things good in this world, say so. &nbsp;Otherwise, I'm downgrading tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to Microsoft: I cannot believe the sheer stupidity involved in REMOVING A WORKING AND BADLY NEEDED CORE FEATURE THAT YOU ALREADY HAD! &nbsp;I mean I can understand you guys don't want to do a ton of work to ADD new stuff, but why in the **** would you REMOVE
 something you ALREADY HAD?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help anyone can offer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chuck</p>

Thank you for providing us the detail description.<br />
<br />
When you say “</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;Because my previous Windows 7 laptop did this, without fail, for 4 years” did you install and Bluetooth scan software to scan for Bluetooth device?</span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
<br />
The issue is not either with the laptop or phone. The issue is with the settings of the Bluetooth device.
</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Turn on the Bluetooth enabled device, or other wireless device, and then make it discoverable. Methods for making it discoverable can vary widely depending on the device. To learn how to make a Bluetooth enabled device discoverable,
 check the info that came with your device or go to the manufacturer’s website. <br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">I would suggest you to check for the settings on the Bluetooth device when your device is not getting connected.<br />
<br />
Why isn't Windows finding my Bluetooth or other wireless device? (Make sure Bluetooth enabled devices and other wireless devices are on and discoverable)<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">No. &nbsp;Windows 7 would AUTOMATICALLY rescan for bluetooth devices just like it does for wifi every few seconds. &nbsp;This did NOT require ANY third party software, it was an inherent feature of the OS. &nbsp;I know this because my previous
 laptop was an Acer Aspire V3-551G that, like my new laptop, came with Windows 8, so I had to install Windows 7 and all the related drivers from scratch. &nbsp;I never installed ANY supporting software or utilities (except for AMD Catalyst, but nothing for the bluetooth
 or any other radio, i.e. the wifi) so there was nothing but Windows 7 itself, and the driver file (the .inf and .dll, nothing else, NO utility.) &nbsp;This is what I mean. &nbsp;It was an inherent OS feature that you guys have manually removed between Windows 7 and
 Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><em>The issue is not either with the laptop or phone. The issue is with the settings of the Bluetooth device.

<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p>...Seriously? &nbsp;I'm not a 5 year old. &nbsp;Ok fine, I'll pretend this is a helpful suggestion. &nbsp;Making the device discoverable merely unpairs it and forces me to re-pair it. &nbsp;As stupid as this suggestion is, I tried it, and it meant I had to try it twice because
 it swapped the primary and secondary devices, so I had to start over and swap them back. &nbsp;Still, it did NOT fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It didn't fix the problem because it was ALREADY PAIRED. &nbsp;My problem is NOT pairing the device, is NOT connecting the device, and is NOT disconnecting the device. &nbsp;My problem is that the headset will not AUTOMATICALLY
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>RE</em></span></strong>CONNECT when I walk out of range and then walk back. &nbsp;If you read my post at ALL you'd know that. &nbsp;Making the device discoverable is a part of the pairing process, but it is NOT required
 to reconnect the device. &nbsp;If the devices are already paired, then if my phone and laptop will continually rescan for the device - which my phone does, and my previous laptop did, by the way - then even if the device is not discoverable it will still reconnect
 to an already-paired device. &nbsp;I think perhaps it's you who needs the 5-year-old bluetooth primer.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p>It's a headset. &nbsp;A monkeyfighting headset. &nbsp;How am I supposed to "check the settings" on a device with no screen? &nbsp;You know what, don't answer that. &nbsp;Any answer to that question is wrong. &nbsp;Once again, the problem is not being unable to connect the device.
 &nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>RE</em></span></strong>CONNECTING the device is the problem. &nbsp;Not connect, reconnect. &nbsp;RE. &nbsp;AGAIN. &nbsp;ONCE MORE when already paired. &nbsp;Got it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Or perhaps you could just post a detailed, specific answer instead of spitting out a canned response at me? &nbsp;I mean Jesus, what is the point of this site if I can't get a better answer than asking the windows built-in help center?</span></p>

First I would suggest you to <strong>disable the default device (default speakers)</strong> and then enable
<strong>Bluetooth headset</strong> and <span>&nbsp;</span>try to connect again. If you are not able to connect, then
<strong>Disable Bluetooth</strong> <strong>device </strong>and <span>&nbsp;</span>Go to sound properties again and enable default audio device.
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Restart the computer, </strong><span>&nbsp;</span>before restart turn off the Bluetooth headset,
<span>&nbsp;</span>after restart turn on the headset and it will work. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            <p>1) The default device is disabled. &nbsp;It has been since before I ever initially paired the headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The device connects. &nbsp;It even manually reconnects. &nbsp;This was never my problem and continues not to be my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE HEADSET CAN CONNECT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY RECONNECT.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you do, then why do you keep making suggestions that solve a problem that IS NOT THE PROBLEM I"M HAVING?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can connect the headset. &nbsp;I can manually reconnect it. &nbsp;I have been, without fail, manually reconnecting it a dozen times a day for 2 weeks now. &nbsp;Once again, I do NOT need ANY help with connecting the device.</p>

I would suggest you to check your LG HBS-730 Headset manual on how to do Auto connect. If you don’t find any option, then I would suggest you to contact LG support for further support.<br />

            <p>Well it certainly appears that's what I'm going to have to do, though since it has no issues automatically reconnecting to my previous Windows 7 system, I'm 99% sure LG is going to send me right back to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well...thanks anyway, I guess. &nbsp;If anyone else has a zany, crazy, unofficial, non-standard solution to this problem, please feel free to post. &nbsp;Please.</p>

            i'm having a similar problem and its not just the headsets why is it that the Microsoft workers don't have a solution simple windows 8.1 takes some control from the user!!! i want to tell windows 8.1 to&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MANUALLY

            <p>I also have the same problem. &nbsp;Both of LG HBS-730 headsets <em>automatically </em>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">re</span></strong>connect to my android phone and macbook as long as the device has bluetooth activated and I switch the headset on and off once. Neither requires me to go into settings or do anything with the
 headset except turn it on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my new windows 8 setup, I found that I have to open up the settings, remove the headset (since I last connected it) from the bluetooth settings, then let it find the headphones when I turn them on, then re-pair them with the computer. Its certainly
 an annoyance, which is why I ended up here - hopefully someone someday fixes this.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't posted here in a while so I figured I'd drop in to say that, yes, this problem persists and has never been fixed by Microsoft (and it WILL require a fix on their end, since it's a problem THEY created when THEY removed an EXISTING, WORKING feature
 from Windows 7 in the transition to Windows 8.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the bright side, this isn't affecting me any more - though it is still a problem and should NOT be marked as solved, because it is NOT solved. &nbsp;My router doesn't support 802.11a, i.e. doesn't support 5GHz spectrum, so my laptop was getting interference
 between the wifi radio and the bluetooth one that was effectively cutting the signal strength of both in half. &nbsp;This didn't effect the bluetooth much, but made my wifi cut out every few minutes, which made online gaming impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I got a Nexus 9 for Christmas, and now that's my secondary device, and I'm back to a wired headset for my laptop. &nbsp;It's not ideal, but it's better than dealing with either the interference problem, or else with this bug from this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since the underlying problem was NEVER FIXED, this thread should NOT be marked as solved. &nbsp;This is STILL a problem that STILL affects other users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess when Windows RT tablets flopped because nobody likes the Metro UI, Microsoft has decided to cut their losses and devote their energy to undoing their colossal screwup for Windows 9/10/whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully they have sense enough to give us back a start menu. &nbsp;Hopefully.</p>

            <p>Ok I'm going to&nbsp;tell you how mine worked... I had to install The windows 7 driver first then update it to the windows 8 version I gotten the ability to connect via Printers and devices back then Right click your device to connect. It's not an Windows 8 issue
 the manufacturer Purposely for what ever reason took a lot of functionally out of the windows 8 version easiest way to tell compare file sizes between the two I know my HP laptop was like that because when I installed the windows 8 version first it wouldn't
 always connect/reconnect... So i completely got pissed waiting for the forum/official Microsoft responses here and I took matters into my own hands! now when you install win 7&nbsp;version first run in compatibility mode&nbsp;so you avoid the "Not intended for this
 operating system" or "system does not meet minimum requirements" to&nbsp;install Windows 8/8.1 version&nbsp;install with these steps: Press Windows key+ x then&nbsp;click or tap on device manager &nbsp;then find Bluetooth category and find your Bluetooth device The&nbsp;common names
 for Bluetooth devices are QUALCOMM/Broadcom/Or the manufacturers name&nbsp;update it using device manger(1. Right click it/tap and hold then release&nbsp;2. click Update device software)&nbsp;and browse to the folder you extracted it and update it that way! Sorry seen this
 in email for some days Just finally got a chance to share the solution. TBH Microsoft should've had the settings allow to connect devices Microsoft has some work to do!!!

<h2>            Skype for Android Bluetooth Doesn&#39;t Work with skype only</h2>
                    <p>Starting today, Skype for Android has stopped working with my bluetooth headset. This is a critical issue because my phone doesnt have a standard headphone jack so it is necessary for the bluetooth headset to work.</p>
<p>Have tried</p>
<p>&nbsp;- restarting calls</p>
<p>&nbsp;- restarting the phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;- restarting the headset</p>
<p>&nbsp;- reinstalling skype</p>
<p>also of note while in a call on skype it stops the phone from sending any sound to the headset</p>
<p>Does anyone have a solution to this error</p>

<p>Hello Julie_S1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still doesn't work with Skype v8.18. The only sound I here in the headset is the "hang up" sound after the call is finished. I test it by calling the echo service. The rest of the sound goes through the phones regular "phone speakers". I can also switch
 to the "external speakers".</p>
<p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've had a virus attack which hopefully I've sorted with Malwarebytes, however now when I turn the computer on it tells me I can't initialize mapi.log and can't open Wab.log saying:</p>
<p>Access to C:Users\Nick\AppData\Local\Temp\WAB.log was denied</p>
<p>Access to C:Users\Nick\AppData\Local\Temp\Mapi.log was denied</p>
<p>I now have lost all my documents and pictures and favourites - is there anything I can do to sort the problem other than taking it to the repair shop? bearing in mind I'm no expert!!</p>
<p>I've tried system restore to no avail</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Yes Malware Bytes Anti Malware and the computer is protectected with Microsoft security Essentials, sorry I've never had a problem before so not sure of the differences between trojans, virus's etc.and which virus it was.</p>
<p>The docs and pics are there somewhere but I can't access them from the usual location, pics are still on Adobe photoshop album but not in my pictures. I've tried searching. I assumed that wab.log and mapi.log were something to do with it but (sorry for the
 ignorance) I don't know what they are.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, I'm just hoping there's an easy fix </p>

            <p><span><strong>Hi tfnw,</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><strong>Method 1–</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to check if you get the error messages in </span><span><strong>Safe</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>Mode</strong></span><span> as well.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong></span></span></a><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: Make sure you log back into </span>
<span><strong>Normal Mode</strong></span><span> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to select “</span><span><strong>Safe mode with Networking</strong></span><span>” instead of “</span><span><strong>Safe Mode</strong></span><span>”.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Proceed to </span><span><strong>Step 2</strong></span><span> if, the issue does not persist in
</span><span><strong>Safe</strong></span><span> </span><span><strong>Mode</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2-</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
I would recommend you to perform </span><span><strong>Clean Boot.<br />
</strong></span><span>Putting your system in </span><span><strong>Clean Boot state</strong></span><span> helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></span></span></a></span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: You need to follow </span><span><strong>Step 7</strong></span><span> from the article mentioned above to get the computer back to
</span><span><strong>Normal</strong></span><span> </span><span><strong>Startup</strong></span><span> after you follow all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2-</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A virus scan will try to </span><span><strong>repair</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>bad sectors on the hard</strong></span><span> </span><span><strong>drive</strong></span><span> damaged by virus. Any data (including
</span><span><strong>pictures</strong></span><span> and </span><span><strong>documents</strong></span><span>) present on these sectors might be lost in the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that your </span><span><strong>pictures</strong></span><span> and
</span><span><strong>documents</strong></span><span> affected by virus might be lost beyond recovery.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Recover-lost-or-deleted-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>Recover lost or deleted files</strong></span></span></a></span><span><br />
<br />
You may also user your favorite search engine to look for </span><span><strong>third party software</strong></span><span> over the internet that might help you recover the pictures and documents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>NOTE</strong></span><span>: Using </span><span><strong>Third Party Software</strong></span><span>, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any
 problems resulting from the use of </span><span><strong>Third</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>Party Software </strong></span><span>can be solved. Using </span>
<span><strong>Third</strong></span><span> </span><span><strong>Party</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>Software</strong></span><span> is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sounds like a video problem, e.g. screen resolution error.&nbsp; You have limited your symptom description to MUF IE.&nbsp;&nbsp; What about your Taskbar?&nbsp;&nbsp;Press Win-T.&nbsp; Can you see all of it?&nbsp;&nbsp; You can split screen to see both at the same time for comparison purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Also, you can move your Taskbar to another edge to see if that changes your symptom with the bottom of any other window.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW if you have a keyboard you could do a lot without even bothering with an Address bar or its controls.&nbsp;&nbsp; And even without being able to see the Address bar you could use Narrator to tell you what was there and help you use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Press Win-Enter to start
 Narrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Julian,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the files in the computer are hidden, it will not show in the Mail app when you try to attach it.
 Try unhiding the file which you want to attach and check if it helps. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Right click on the file or folder (which is not showing in the mail app when you try to attach.)<br />
2. Click on Properties <br />
3. Under Attributes section uncheck the Checkbox Hidden <br />
4. Click on Apply and Ok.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Now try attaching the file in Mail app and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>
Hope this helps. If the issue persists or if you face any Windows issues in future, let us know and we would be glad to assist you.</p>

<br />
If&nbsp;a directory is marked Hidden you can still use it in&nbsp;dialogs.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. just type it, append a backslash and then see what happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that doesn't work it could mean that there is a more complicated permissions issue to be discovered.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could use ProcMon
 to try to get some details for that case.

<p>The last suggestion was a diagnostic.&nbsp; Diagnostics don't work; they give you a means of refining your symptom description.&nbsp; So, it appears you haven't tried everything.<br />

<p>Start it then do your test, then stop ProcMon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you can use its filters to test hypotheses about what you have seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. the claim is that you don't see folders.&nbsp; If ProcMon shows you records&nbsp;which mentions the&nbsp;missing folders or (more likely) shows
 you an error occurred when trying to do that you would then have more information about your symptom.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another diagnostic you could try is PSR.exe.&nbsp; E.g. start that, redo your test, then stop the recording.&nbsp; Additionally you could run ProcMon while that was going on since it would supplement whatever clues the PSR output would give you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Otherwise, this symptom description is still too vague for anyone to do anything but guess at what it may mean at a technical level&nbsp;and so far the guesses which have been made have not really been responded to.<br />

            I think you're missing the point of the original post. &nbsp;I should be able to browse around my entire computer to find the item that I want to attach to my email. &nbsp;The app seems to be restricted to a specific folder hierarchy and I cannot find any way to
 change this or any place that this restriction is documented or explained.<br />
<br />
If I have permission to see &amp; modify files in a folder in Explorer, then I should be able to find the same folder from the Mail App. &nbsp;As an example, in Explorer I see 8 folders (1 hidden) under C:\. &nbsp;In the Mail App, I only see 4 folders.

    <title>USB Ports not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johntaltavall  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Ports not working</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron N5110 Laptop and a day or so ago 2 of the 3 USB ports stopped working. I tried taking out the battery and all of that as well as multiple resets. I noticed it initially with my mouse but now no device or USB drive I have is working
 in either, I will add though that there is still power to the port because i plugged a cheap USB fan into it and that ran fine. Thanks in advance for the help.

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the USB ports fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted or incompatible or due to hardware problems.</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with devices and hardware. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the USB drivers</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall USB drivers and check if it helps. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Right click on Start and select Device Manager.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>In Device Manager, double click to expand "<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>".</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Right click on the <strong>Host Controller</strong>, click "<strong>Uninstall</strong>" and click "<strong>OK</strong>".</p>
<p><strong>4. Uninstall </strong>all items under "<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>".</p>
<p>Then, restart your computer and Windows will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below article for more information on <strong>Updating drivers</strong>:</p>

<p>Hi I looked into this and found it confusing. I appreciate you offering this info but, why is it necessary to uninstall this and then reinstall it to get it to work properly? I have had Support Assist for nearly two years and this is the first time this
 has ever happened. Each time I try to see if it is working and the window asks me if I want to quit the program it automatically sends a report to Microsoft that there is an issue. So, I guess I am asking if there is a "fix" on the way?</p>

                    <p>Using Firefox, windows 10, game site Pogo. Bought a new computer and when I go to Pogo to play a game, everything on the page is normal except the play area. It fills the play area frame about 30%. I tried screen resolution but it changes the entire screen,
 not the play area. I tried zoom </p>

            <p>That means the play area of that game wasn't designed for your new computer's HD monitor. &nbsp;It's high-definition with more pixels (like Apple's "Retina screen").</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company that makes the game needs to update the game to work on HD monitors (high DPI monitors).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until then, using the built-in "Magnifier" program is your best option.</p>

<p>Dual boot Windows 7 and XP with Windows 7 installed first (method #2):</p>

<p>Windows XP Mode</p>
<p>Or if you have Windows 7 Professional/Ultimate you can download and install Windows XP Mode. XP Mode is a Virtual installation of XP that runs at 32 bit inside Windows 7. It's similar to a normal installation of XP with a few exceptions:
 only uses a single CPU core, only has access to USB and serial ports, DVD access is read only, limited to 16-bit graphics (3D games don't play well). &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your computer must support virtualization. You can check if your PC hardware works with Windows XP Mode by downloading and running this tool:
<br />

XP Mode main page: <br />

</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you need to enable hardware virtualization on your computer: <br />
1. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS settings. <br />
2. Look for the virtualization setting in BIOS and enable it. <br />
3. Save the BIOS settings and then restart your computer. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Have 7 Home Premium? Buying Anytime Upgrade To Use XP Mode <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Type Anytime Upgrade in the Search programs and files box in the Start menu and click on the Windows Anytime Upgrade icon.&nbsp; From there, you can buy an Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Professional/Ultimate. Then you can enter your Anytime Upgrade product key and
 perform a simple upgrade to Windows 7 Professional/Ultimate. All programs and files will stay on the computer.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US you can use Anytime Upgrade. If not you will need to buy the version of Windows 7 you want.

hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Panasonic SDR-H40 Video needs a/c power when downloading hd to computer, bundled software will not support dvd+ format,
<br />
you can use windows explorer to drag and drop them into whatever folder you select. The files will be in a .mod format. you&nbsp; could play them with windows media player if renamed them to .mpg,&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this in MOD file format&nbsp; windows movie maker wont support
 and u need a video converter to convert&nbsp; window media&nbsp; <br />
<br />
How To Make .MOD Video Files Read By Any Software
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic solution</strong> : the most basic solution is to rename the .MOD files manually into .MPG files and then to make sure that the video program you import these files into is set properly relative to the video standard used (PAL or NTSC), the
 aspect ratio used, and the interlacing. </li><li><strong>If your .MOD files were recorded in 4:3 format</strong> then just rename them to .MPG. If they are 16:9 widescreen then you could use
sdcopy.exe to convert them.
</li><li><strong>To correctly edit .MPG video files</strong> it is recommended that you utilize software that supports "<em>smart-rendering</em> " otherwise the resulting video quality may degrade too much.
</li><li><strong>Recommended MPEG-2 video editing tools</strong> &nbsp; posted online are <a href="http://www.magix.com/us/video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Magix</a> , <a href="http://www.womble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Womble Video Wizard</a> or <a href="http://www.ulead.com/vs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ulead Videostudio</a> . </li><li><a href="http://zyvid.com/smf/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=280.0;id=153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SDCopy</a> converts your .MOD files, renames them to .MPG and fixes the widescreen tags issue.
</li><li><strong>The problem with these these tags</strong> stems from the fact that they are being stored in associated small text files with the extension .MOI. Once you separate the .MOD file from its companion .MOI file the video software you use to open the
 video file doesn't know anymore what aspect ratio and video file format is being used and tries to guess automatically.
</li><li><strong>Another solution</strong> is to utilize <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/DVDPatcher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DVD Patcher</a> (which is free) to fix the file header and read 16:9 and 720x480.
</li></ul>
<strong>Windows PCs - Windows Movie Maker</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Launch</strong> Windows Movie Maker </li><li><strong>Go inside Tools -&gt; Options</strong> Menu </li><li><strong>Make sure that the encoding setting is set</strong> appropriately. If you are in tjhe US or Japan it should be NTSC, but everywhere else it should be set to PAL.
</li><li><strong>Set the aspect ratio</strong> to 16:9 because if that is the format you have been recording in.
</li><li><strong>Click OK</strong> and you are set. </li><li>strong&gt;Select "Import..." and bring in your original Canon video file (renamed in .MPG) and the video file will look great.
</li></ul>
<p>If missing you may want also to download and install an updated AC3 Codec.</p>
<br />
u can use any third party free software like quick media convertor, flv to avi convertor &amp; ImTOO MPEG Encoder
<br />
