    <title>Cursor too small on word documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor too small on word documents</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Windows 10 update to built 1704, the cursor (the arrow one, the cross-shaped one&nbsp; to move/adjust the objects, and the parallel line one to adjust tables etc.) on word documents&nbsp; became too small to see and efficiency use. It looks normal on other
 Office applications.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For a full disclosure, I use a MS Surface Book with Window 10 built 1704. It is connected to&nbsp; Toshiba Dynadock Universal USB 3.0 Docking Station to drive 2 monitors. Drivers for the Dynadock (and the DisplayLink adapter in it) are up to date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion?</p>

            When this problem occurred in previous versions, the solution was usually to switch to 400% Zoom and then back to the original setting. It's not a permanent cure but simple enough to do when the problem resurfaces.

<p>I've had my N96 for a year and a half now, but all of a sudden I can't get on the internet any more and I don't know why. Everything is working, and I was even on my mobile internet this morning. But now when I try to open my browser, it looks like it's
 going to start up, it&nbsp;gives me a black screen for a second, and then just crashes back to my main screen. It doesn't matter how I try to open it, it keeps doing this.</p>
<p>I've allready reset my phone, but to no avail. Please help!</p>

<p>The same thing happened to me some months back. What I did was not a proper solution but it did the job. I installed and started using Opera Mini which I discovered was a better browser than the default browser anyway and I haven't looked back since. You
 can download Opera Mini from <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately, I have noticed that my default browser is back working again. Must have been restored after the last firmware update and reset I did afterwards.</p>

    <title>Tab Index - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danumc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tab Index</h2>
                    <p>Input would be appreciated.</p>
<p>I have created a data entry form with MANY fields using Tab Control on the form. There is a header, in the Form Header section, and the Tab Control with two tabs is in the Detail section of the form.</p>
<p>This form has had many changes. I went to the property section of each control and attempted to set the Tab Index of each control but each time I put in a number, the number reverted back to the original tab index number. I did some reading and saw that
 an alternate way of setting tab index is to use the Tab Order dialogue from View. I did that as well and the order was all set. I opened the form back up to do some testing and the tab index was not in order any more.</p>
<p>I then somewhat recreated the form. Opened a new form, used Tab Control and put in only some of the fields then using the Tab Order dialogue, put them in order. Closed design form. Opened the form and those few fields were in order. I then took a group of
 controls from the original form and pasted them into the new form and they renumbered themselves starting at 0. When I went to change the Tab Index number, I received a message "The value you used for the Tab Index property isn't valid. The correct values
 are from 0 through 28.</p>
<p>I also want to add that recently my department switched from running Access 2000 on Windows XP to running Access 2000 on Windows 7 and occasionally I get messages I have not seen before. I have also compressed the database in an effort to see if that could
 help.</p>
<p>Any insight would be appreciated. Can I set the tab order using VBA???</p>

<div>It sounds like the original form and/or some of the controls on it have become corrupted. &nbsp;Try creating a new empty database and importing all the objects from the old one. &nbsp;If that doesn't fix it, you might have to rebuild the form from scratch. &nbsp;Setting
 Tab Order should be a simple matter using the dialog.</div>

                    I am running windows 10 mobile 10.0.14393.693 and When creating a group message I add all the recipients and send the message in that group thread. When they reply to me it does not show up in the group thread, it shows up in there own thread and is not
 going to the group thread. is there a setting I can change to have group messages come back into that group thread?

<h2>            multiple svchost.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm just curious. Using procexp, I can see that I have around 70 svchost.exe processes running. I mean they are not a problem (no high cpu usage, or lots of memory) but when i compare with W 8.1 (12 processes) or W7 (14) it seems a little excessive.
 Can you confirm you have about the same thing ? And if not, where can I look up to solve this ?</p>

<p>Every recommendation listed in all of these threads and more. Unfortunately, I bought a Windows 10 Lumia 650 on Amazon, April 14th, after thinking that would solve this issue and my one drive sync&nbsp;issue and my FB messenger issue. It is due to arrive&nbsp;today.
 I hope it doesn't have the same problem. I am tired of wasting time trying all these fix methods that don't work., factory reset, soft reset, live id, etc....waste of time</p>

<p>I am suspecting that you are confusing the Find function with the general Find functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Find function is for finding a matching character (or string of characters) within a specific string. Normally used to test if a specific character or group of characters exist in a specific cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Find functionality is for finding something by searching the entire worksheet. For the find functionality, select the Home ribbon and then the Find &amp; Select (far right of the Home ribbon) and then select Find and enter the character or characters to
 be found in the Find what field. You can restrict the Find functionality to search only a specific range of the worksheet by selecting the range to be searched before selecting the Find &amp; Select.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does not answer your query then please provide more information about what you are attempting to do.</p>

                    Enforcement is terrible now since Xbox one quick to ban anymore to make a quick buck! Especially if you bought digital games that I suggest no one does! Because if you do they ban you for no reason and everything you spent is gone forever. If the smart
 people who do the homework on investing on a system Xbox Is not One people should. Buy a ps4 money well spent!

<p>
</p><p>Then I suggest you contact your email provider to determine what, if anything changed on the server side of things. Outlook uses the same connection process for any email provider based on the settings used. There would be nothing different from the Outlook
 side because it's AOL</p>

<p>
</p><p>I seriously doubt that this is an Outlook issue given that POP3 and Imap protocols are industry standards used by all email service providers. However, for sake of argument, let's presume it is an issue specific to/caused by Outlook '2007, unrelated to incorrect
 settings, hate to be the bearer of bad tidings but</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook '2007 general support ended Oct 9, 2012.</p>
<p>Outlook '2007 extended support for security updates ends April 11, 2017</p>
<p>Outlook '2007 extended <strong>"paid"</strong> support ends Oct 10, 2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a nutshell, you will need to contact MS Support directly with no guarantee of any resolution especially given that the only major change that is occurring is Yahoo/AOL email integration and what that means to AOL accounts. Yahoo accounts require you to
 specify how the account is to be accessed (POP3 or IMAP) and they may well have also implemented two factor authentication requiring the use of an APP password.</p>

<p>My AOL mail profile for Outlook 2007 finally went south on me.&nbsp; I've created a new one, but it's failing authentication to AOL as well.&nbsp; I've triple-checked my mail profile configuration against<a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/how-do-i-use-other-email-applications-to-send-and-receive-my-aol-mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 https://help.aol.com/articles/how-do-i-use-other-email-applications-to-send-and-receive-my-aol-mail</a> to ensure that it's correct, and I've also repaired my Office 2007 installation to ensure that Outlook 2007 isn't corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I've had other trouble with authentication to AOL for email:</p>
<p>
</p><p>• I had Outlook for Android on my hand-me-down Samsung smartphone.&nbsp; After working flawlessly for many months, it started failing authentication to AOL earlier this year due to some sort of certificate problem (I don't remember the exact message now), and
 has persisted to this day.&nbsp; I removed my AOL account and then tried to re-add it, but it couldn't complete the email setup process because of the same authentication failure due to the same certificate problem.&nbsp; I uninstalled/reinstalled Outlook for Android
 and then tried to add my AOL account, but it couldn't complete the process again because of the same authentication failure due to the same certificate problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• I installed Outlook for iOS on my hand-me-down iPhone 4S earlier this year (but after the aforementioned Outlook for Android trouble).&nbsp; I tried to add my AOL account, but I got the same authentication failure due to the same certificate problem.&nbsp; It offered
 to proceed without involving the certificate, but each time I selected to do so, it gave the same authentication failure due to the same certificate problem (as if it was stuck in a loop).&nbsp; I uninstalled/reinstalled Outlook for iOS and then tried to add my
 AOL account, but it couldn't complete the process again because of the same authentication failure due to the same certificate problem (as if stuck in a loop).&nbsp; Microsoft's Outlook for iOS support team tried to solve the problem for me, but its help consisted
 only of all of the tactics that I had already tried; it ended up giving up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking all of this into account, I'm wondering if something is going on - or if something is
<strong>not</strong> going on that <strong>should</strong> be going on - with AOL's mail servers behind the scenes, and AOL isn't telling the public...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The native mail apps in Android and iOS have done bad things with my email - that's why I switched to Outlook for Android.&nbsp; I'm desperate now, so I'm going to test-drive AOL's Alto app (<a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/aol-mail-mobile-mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://help.aol.com/articles/aol-mail-mobile-mail</a>)
 on both of my smartphones.</p>

<p>Last week, I tried to get my Microsoft account to extract my email from AOL - that process also failed to authenticate me to AOL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After swearing several years ago that I'd never do POP3 again, I broke down earlier today and reconfigured my Outlook mail profile for POP3 instead of IMAP.&nbsp; That configuration also failed to authenticate me to AOL.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I also have a Yahoo mailbox, and my Outlook is able to authenticate to it without incident.</p>

<p>I presume that my "current third party email application" is Outlook 2007.&nbsp; The help site URL is the previously mentioned&nbsp;<a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/how-do-i-use-other-email-applications-to-send-and-receive-my-aol-mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://help.aol.com/articles/how-do-i-use-other-email-applications-to-send-and-receive-my-aol-mail</a>,
 which got updated on October 7.&nbsp; (<strong>Note to AOL/Oath customers with verizon.net addresses</strong>: you should go to this page and read the special note near the top of the page that is intended for you.)&nbsp; I noticed immediately that Oath has changed
 its addresses and ports, as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Protocol</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Server Settings</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Port Settings</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>POP3</strong></td>
<td><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">Incoming mail server (POP3): pop.aol.com</span><br />
<br />
<td><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">POP3 - 995 - SSL</span><br />
<br />
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>IMAP</strong></td>
<td><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">Incoming mail server (IMAP): imap.aol.com</span><br />
<br />
<td><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">IMAP - 993 - SSL</span><br />
<br />
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I created a new AOL mail profile&nbsp;(which is for IMAP) as specified, then tried Test Account Settings and got the following responses:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>• Log onto incoming mail server (IMAP): Your server unexpectedly terminated the connection. Possible causes include server problems, network problems, or a long period of inactivity.</em><br />
<br />
<em>• Send test e-mail message: Outlook cannot connect to your outgoing (SMTP) e-mail server. If you continue to receive this message, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).</em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm still unable to access AOL email with Outlook 2007 despite the new settings.&nbsp; If anyone else gets resolution with the new settings, please reply to this thread and let me know.<br />

<h2>            Excel 2016 Exporting Issues</h2>
                    Hello, I am having trouble with Excel 2016 not exporting files from websites. When I open the file up it will show a blank grayed out excel sheet. I will have to go under properties of the excel sheet and unlock the file in order open it up. If I unlock
 the file some of the links and data from the original does not show up.

            <p><span>Hi Alan xD,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify the issue, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<span>1. What do you mean about “I am having trouble with Excel 2016 not exporting files from websites.”? Are there some messages popping up when a blank excel sheet is opened?
 About “I will have to go under properties of the excel sheet and unlock the file in order open it up.”, could you give us some detailed steps? It is appreciated if you can provide some related screenshots.</span><span><br />
2. If you encountered issues when exporting a list from a SharePoint site collection, check if the issue occurs to a specific list or a specific site collection. If yes, I suggest you do the following to see the result first.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
a. Exit all Office applications.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
b. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>User Accounts</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Credential Manager</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Windows Credentials</strong>.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
c. Remove all credentials there(This will remove your stored passwords.).</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
d. Run regedit as an administrator to open Registry Editor.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
e. From Registry Editor, browse to:<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity\Identities</strong>.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
f.&nbsp; Check to see if there are any folders listed under&nbsp;<strong>Identities</strong>. If yes, delete them.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
g. Restart computer and navigate to the SharePoint site collection to re-export the list.</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<p><span>What’s the version number of the Excel client? Office 2016 of what version are you using, the MSI version or the Click-to-run version? Which types and formats are the affected

 quadruple check it and it is correct, but no matter what, Outlook sends all messages to spam. I've tried plain text to ensure it's not something within the email itself. Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SPF:</p>
<p>
</p><p>v=spf1 a mx ip4:104.207.249.26 include:spf.protection.outlook.com ~all</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ip is the address of the server at the web host that send the mail. <strong>
We really need help as we can't have all our email to Outlook.com going to spam.</strong></p>

            Thank you, I will do this, but I've already checked a lot of blacklists and our domain wasn't listed anywhere. Also, in the testing I was just doing, it seems like only one of our emails, sales@ (aka the most important email!) has this issue. If I send
 from other emails on the same domain from 365 to Outlook they do not go to spam so I'm totally confused now... :/

<p>Then your Sales email address has been flagged as a spamming email. I'm afraid I don't know how to get off the spam list for just an email address.
</p>
<p>You might change that account to a new name and be sure in the future to not send out spam.</p>

            We don't send spam - sales@ email are from people ordering from us. I haven't heard of a single email address being flagged. We can use a different one for order emails but that's not ideal as we've been using sales@ for decades :/

<p>If I had a $1 for every company that claimed they didn't send spam I'd be able to retire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You, may believe you aren't sending spam, but I bet those on the receiving end of those emails have a different opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, I have a mortgage, and I receive emails from the bank about my mortgage. Great, I want those. But they also send me emails about opening a checking account or signing up for a credit card, I don't want those, can't turn those off, so you know what
 I do, I classify them as spam. I'm sure that bank would tell people "oh, we don't send out spam."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I've never heard of just a single address getting blocked so my advice to get around Microsoft's block is the one I'd go with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Excel SUMIFS with multiple criteria including date range</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to google this for 3 hours and I can't find anything that is working, I either get 0 or an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to work on my budget, and want to get a quarterly total. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My excel file has two sheets, one is the running account (named "2017", the other is supposed to be the quarterly earnings (named... "Quarterly Earnings").</p>
<p>Column E contains the payment amounts, Column D has a description of the transactions, Column C contains the dates each transaction posted to my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it would be SIMPLE. I used this formula in the cell that I want my total income between Jan 1 2017 and March 31 2017 to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIFS('2017'!E:E,'2017'!D:D,"Pay Check",'2017'!C:C,"DATE((&gt;=2017,1,1)(&lt;2017,4,1))")
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding that the Sum Rage should be the column where all my amounts are listed, criteria range one is where "pay checks" is listed since those are the only transactions I am adding up, and then criteria range 2 would be where all the transaction
 dates are listed, and that the criteria should be the range of dates I wanted to reflect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT want to select a range of cells in the column that contains the dates for 2 reasons:</p>
<p>1 - I sort the sheet using different headings frequently</p>
<p>2 - I want to know how to specify a range of dates </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am baffled by why this task is escaping me.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Deleting the last character in a string of text &#40;that is not always the same number of characters&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I'm using a combination of concatenate functions&nbsp;and IF statements to get a sting of text based on user input.&nbsp; I want to have each&nbsp;word separated by a comma except for the last word.&nbsp; I tried using replace and subsitute&nbsp;but the issue I'm having is that
 the number of characters change.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please see my example below:</p>
<p>Here is part of my formula:</p>
<p>CONCATENATE(IF('Input Sheet'!$D$53="YES","WC, ",""),"",IF('Input Sheet'!$D$54="YES","GL, ",""),"",IF('Input Sheet'!$D$55="YES","AL, ",""),.....it goes on and on</p>
<p>My results look like this:</p>
<p>WC, GL, AL,</p>
<p>or like</p>
<p>WC, AL, Crime, Inland,</p>
<p>I want to be able to delete the last comma, but depending on user selection my results will vary and the number of character vary.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Donna</p>

<p>If you prepend the commas (instead of appending them)...like this:<br />
CONCATENATE(IF('Input Sheet'!$D$53="YES",", WC ",""),"",IF('Input Sheet'!$D$54="YES",", GL",""),"",IF('Input Sheet'!$D$55="YES",", AL",""),.....<br />
<br />
Then your formula can be something like thisl:<br />
=MID(CONCATENATE(IF('Input Sheet'!$D$53="YES",", WC ",...etc...),3,255)<br />
<br />
Does that help?</p>

<br />
<br />Let's first try to check your MacBook's microphone. Please go to System Preferences &gt; Sound &gt; choose Input 
<br />
<br />You will see there "Internal Microphone". And under the "Settings for the selected device" you will see "Input level".
<br />
<br />When you say something, you should see the level sign changing with dark grey colors.

<br />Please write me back with the results.

    <title>Outlook.com Manage Rules&#58; Unable to delete Rules - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> digitalmediaenthusiast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com Manage Rules&#58; Unable to delete Rules</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the rules filtering in outlook.com for several years and they have worked well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, about a month ago, I seemingly lost my ability to add rules for filtering messages "on the fly" for no apparent reason. They just didn't work although seemingly added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to look in Manage Rules, where I found that I was unable to Add a rule because I had 500 already and that is an arbitrary limit set for rules.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought I'd delete rules no longer needed starting with cleaning up duplicates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting rules is almost impossible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Clicking delete may or may not work. Add to this the fact it takes 20-30 or more seconds of waiting after clicking the trash can to delete a rule. You cannot delete a rule, then attempt to delete another without waiting out the 20 or so seconds. Add to
 this you must refresh the page to know if it was deleted, Add to this it takes 20 or more seconds to wait for the screen to refresh. (Note: if you're using IE( Internet Explorer 11 on Win 7-64)&nbsp;- if you're using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, refresh is
 in 3-5 seconds.) After deleting a rule, it disappears while you wait out the 20-30 seconds. The screen then seemingly refreshes with the rule reappearing. I've not repeatedly deleted to see if it ever is gone. I'll try that next, since apparently Microsoft
 does not have any beta testers, they use us who have to look at ads paid for by their customers to use their "free" email software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 66 rules that delete messages after 10 days, all of which I have found can be executed with a single command, by adding to the rules for filter grouping them into the newsletter category, so if category is newsletter, delete older than 10 days. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent 2 hours this morning attempting to delete the 66 rules. I have deleted all 66 at least 5 times, but I now still have 54 rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to open the manage rules tab 10 times so I could delete 10 at a time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keyed in IE search "10 days"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the first 10, and by the time I found the 2nd, 3rd, 4th...10th occurrence, the first tab finally was done (presumably) clicked find 10 times, and clicked delete. I ran through these each to delete the 66.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to leave it for a few minutes and click refresh on the first tab. NOTE: IE search&nbsp;DOESN'T display the item searched unless you change the searched word and change it back. That's an IE problem. The subsequent search works properly in Chrome and
 Firefox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I decided to try the same thing in Chrome and Firefox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than the refresh and search being better in Chrome and Firefox, there is seemingly no difference in terms of whether or not a rule is deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I deleted a rule via Firefox and refresh showed it as deleted in Firefox but even a half hour later, the item still shows in IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I waited an hour,&nbsp;deleted history in both browsers, and again searched for the first entry, that I deleted via Firefox, that was not showing up in Firefox but not in IE, and it is now back in both. The count remains at 54.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I tried for another hour, deleting the first 3 rules in 3 tabs, the first rule in the first tab, 2nd in second, 3rd in 3rd. They all just coming back. (What I notice is if it doesn't delete, after the 30 or so seconds the dots run across the top
 edge, the entry reappears.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I upped it to 5 tabs. One of them deleted, from the 4th tab. But after yet another half hour.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried&nbsp; a different approach, I'll delete the same entry in each tab. I tried 3 times, The third time through, after clicking the trash icon on the second tab, I got the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>"We can't reorder your rules because they've been updated elsewhere."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked close and it reappeared. Then after another 30 seconds or so, it was finally gone from all 5 tabs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for now, my recommendation is to do what I'm doing, open 5 tabs, search for your entry to delete, delete it in each of the 5 tabs. After setup, it takes only a few more seconds than deleting one in one tab, and sitting there and with your fingers curling
 from the frustration,&nbsp;watching to see if it comes back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update. I decided to try it a few more times. It worked the second&nbsp;time through, but I still had to wait because you can click the tab, then click the trash can 5 times in far less than the 30 seconds&nbsp;you must wait for the scrolling dots to stop, so I decided
 to open 5 more tabs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked the first on my list 10 times and started editing this. I just checked and they area&nbsp;all still there, I 'll try again and report back.&nbsp;It "took"&nbsp;this time, in fact by the time I got back to the first tab, it was gone. I then tried the next entry.
 It reappeared, which I assume means it did not delete, however since it takes 30 seconds for each entry, if the tab it actually deleted from was the 9th or 10th, I may just have not waited long enough. I'll check again now. Nope. Still there. I'll now try
 deleting it again and report how long it takes from the first click of delete until I'm again reviewing the first tab. It took me 30 seconds to click on the 1st tab, and the dots stopped, and the entry was not on the list. I waited another a5 seconds and it
 did not re-appear. I'll now double check all tabs. It's gone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try the next. Unfortunately I am getting faster so when I clicked on 1 again, I was at 24 seconds. By 28 seconds it re-appeared. But because of the other factor, i.e., if the one that worked was the 10th, I need to give it another 30 seconds, from the
 last to know if it actually worked.&nbsp;I'll recheck since it took me far longer than &nbsp;30 seconds to do this unpaid beta testing for Microsoft. (excuse me, I'm not being paid, however Microsoft is, because their advertisers pay for this "free" software.) If I
 were an advertiser (Which I was until a few years ago) I'd be quite furious with Microsoft that they are getting&nbsp;ripped off in this way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: It did not delete. Trying again. This time it worked. I'm going to go do something else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft. It takes 10 to 20 times to delete an entry. Absurd. </p>
<p>
</p><p>YOU NEED TO FIX THIS!!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, couldn't walk away from my beta testing, because there is another problem recently as well. When attempting to modify or create rules, the following appears almost always:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There was a problem with the Outlook.com service (a temporary network connectivity issue that has nothing to do with your computer). Please try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may or may not be true. It is best to have the rules open in another tab, so you can check to see if it worked. If you don't check, you will likely create duplicates, that you'll then have to try deleting each from 10-20 times. I duplicated one 5 times
 with the above message in between and it then took me over 30 minutes to finally get rid of the duplicates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using Firefox and deleted the next entry. It took 6 times but deleted. I then checked IE but the entry was still there. I then attempted to delete the entry below the entry deleted in Firefox. After the 30 seconds and with refresh, the entry I deleted
 in Firefox was no longer there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then selected the 2nd tab and the entry deleted via Firefox still displayed. I clicked delete on it to see if I'd get the :</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We can't reorder your rules because they've been updated elsewhere."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not, but the entry disappeared after refresh. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did the same in Firefox with an entry deleted in IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not get the message but still had to wait the 30 seconds for the refresh without the entry. In other words, there is no advantage to trying this from different browsers, either simultaneously or&nbsp;alone.&nbsp;IE does however have the other two issues reported,
 the long initial&nbsp;wait for the rules to appear, the long wait for a refresh, &nbsp;&nbsp;and the search issue when an entry is deleted, i.e., you must delete at least a portion of your search and then change it back to get your search to refresh.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an entry I attempted to delete 40 times in Firefox. It would not delete. I decided to try deleting it in both IE and FF, and after another 50 attempts, it will not delete.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the entry Microsoft so you can look at it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">If sender address is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and is older than 10 days then move to Deleted</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it will be days, if not weeks before anyone from Microsoft even sees this, let alone does anything about it, so I kept trying, and after 80 or so attempts it finally is gone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have further found there is no advantage in speed of deletion with other browsers, although the time it takes to duplicate tabs is a huge improvement in Firefox or Chrome, simply because of how long it takes for the Manage Rules page to appear in IE. If
 you watch Firefox load the page, you'll see all the places it goes first, until it finally loads the list of Rules. No surprises but several of the sites it first visits are Ad sites.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this so called "free" email is paid for by advertisers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I now find it easiest to just open 20 tabs of the Manage Rules list. If your first tab has the search, in my case 10 days, pressing CTRL-F on the new tab will display the search and then you just press enter to execute it. I found scrolling the screen
 so the entry is on the first line of the browser makes subsequent clicks of delete a little less tedious. (As though clicking Delete 40 times, and waiting 30 seconds between tries isn't tedious)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another tip, sometimes your deletion will remove the entry from the list on the subsequent tab. I found it is best to go back to tab 1 to start with the next, because if you click the next entry to delete it, the tabs will be out of synch in terms of refresh,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't figured out if it is the tabs before or after that don't have the deletion. I assume it is the tabs before since the deletion occurs sometimes and I'm sequencing from tab 1 to 20 always.
</p>
<p>Update: Like the randomness of when deletions "take" it is inconsistent,&nbsp;therefore it is best to go back to tab 1, and choose the next.</p>
