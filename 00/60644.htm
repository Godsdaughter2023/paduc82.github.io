<h2>            Bluetooth peripheral device driver missing</h2>

<p>I am having the exact same issue with the Bose QuietComfort 35 II on a Windows 10 64-bit laptop. I am able to connect my headset over bluetooth and all bluetooth services are enabled. I can even choose the headset under the 'playback' and 'recording' devices
 but I don't hear a sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the device manager I can see the headset under 'bluetooth' and under the 'sound, video, and game controllers' node but there are 3 items under the 'Other devices' node for which I cannot install the drivers:</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is on a corporate laptop (brand is DELL) and I don't have local admin privileges. When I install the headset on my private laptop I have no problems at all. Could this be explained by the fact that the Microsoft Update servers are blocked and that Windows
 is trying to get the drivers from there?</p>

<p>hey dudes. n dudesses ))</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am not sure what i gonna to text isnt just cristall clear lol... so, of course nor giant mircrosoft (capitalistic, as worldleader ruling enterprise =&gt; hail to the shareholder value) nor giant sony are delivering solutions, who cares!!, ok it isnt a doomsday-problem,
 just a fuuucking ugly mess at the device manager. until today i was pretty pissed about the sound qualitiy of my new sony wh-ch700n headphones, while listening spotify on desktop version. after i bluescreened my notebook trying diverese given drivers, my device-manager
 is looking as you see at the attachements. but finally to the reason for my speach.... due to missing good desktop equalizer, i stear my sound quality over the iphone sony app while&nbsp; iam connected with the notebook and the i phone at the same time, now. it
 easily works as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. pearing/installing audio</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. pearing/installing this "LE-....." thing....</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. connect your phones with desktop first, with your mobile after... sony headphone-App is guiding you through the settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>MOBILEPHONE SOUND QUALITIY AT THE DESKTOP ALSO... HURRAYYYY LOL )))))) it pays off lil for the damn waisted time trying to find of
</p>
<p>the bad quality and test-managers at sony's headphone division...</p>
<p>maybe there is another dude as happy as i am about that... lol&nbsp;&nbsp; cheers n greets )))</p>

<h2>            Your Card will not be charged at this time.....yeah right</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a $30 prepaid visa debit card specifically to purchase The Orange Box for $29.95.</p>

<p>Went through the process of adding a new card etc, and it said your card wont be charged at this time.</p>

<p>Well it was charged $2 and now I can't buy the game. An explanation would be nice please.</p>

<p>TIA.</p>

<p>The support was a bit ordinary too. The woman said I should have known that its common practice to take an authorization fee, I'm 16 and just got my first paycheck, if I had of known about some auth I would have put $35 on it. I thought this would be the
 easiest way to buy stuff, oh well.</p>

<p>In the future, you may want to consider getting Microsoft Points from a retail store. Those can be used to purchase the games as well instead of putting a prepaid card on file or what not. Just an alternative way of doing things.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses guys, it was just a rant and I am better prepared for next time :)</p>
<p>I wasn't aware you could purchase games using MS points if the game shows a dollar price. Is there a rough guide on what a ms point converts to in aussie dollars? Thanks guys.</p>

====================================<br />
After the limited number of 5 changes...you cannot <br />
change it anymore.<br />
<br />
There are ways around this limitation but they may <br />
be illegal. A Google search for&nbsp; DVD Region&nbsp; may <br />
provide additional info.<br />
<br />
There's a chance that the freeware VLC Media Player <br />
would play your DVDs without changing the region code.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Store Issues on Xbox One X</h2>
                    Whenever I try to access a game or look to buy a game on the store it goes for a bit then times out with a 0x000007 error code.&nbsp; This has happened since I purchased a game during the e3 sale.&nbsp; I have restarted the console, removed and added my profile,
 performed a hard reset, did the alternate mac address trick and it didn't fix it.&nbsp; I also don't want to be told to use an app or website, the point of the store being on the console is to use the store.&nbsp; I appreciate any help I could get.

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. We recommend try a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a> of the console. While off unplug the console completely for 1 minute. When you boot the console back up make sure there are no updates, for the store or OS of the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 flickers and freezes using Windows 10 and MS Word when on battery</h2>
                    Hi there - I installed Windows 10 about two months ago on my Surface Pro 3, and for the past couple of weeks, it has developed this habit of flickering, briefly blacking out and then freezing whenever I'm on battery and using MS Word. It doesn't seem to
 be happening with any other program that I can discern. The only way I can find to deal with it is to close the keyboard to force a hibernation then re-open, but it is a temporary solution for about 5 minutes, at best. Likewise a forced restart doesn't fix
 it, and I will often lose my work when I do this. Has anyone else had this?

            <p>Hello Adrian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have Norton anti-virus installed in the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The screen flickering issue that we are experiencing after an upgrade to Windows 10 is mainly due to the Norton Antivirus program installed in the systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try the following steps&nbsp;to troubleshoot this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>a: Remove the Norton Antivirus with help of its <a href="https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?version=1&amp;product=home&amp;lg=english&amp;ct=united_states&amp;docid=kb20080710133834EN_EndUserProfile_en_us&amp;pvid=f-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>b: Update the display adapter and then try to restart the computer in Normal mode.</p>
<p>This should work in case of Screen Flickering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Thank you, that was one avenue I hadn't tried. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately that didn't fix it. It seems to be particularly an issue on battery and using MS Word and/or PowerPoint. When plugged into mains its very stable, and on battery using other apps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Checking for updates never ends&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to update my Asus Eee PC 1005HAB running Windows 7 32-bit SP1, but keeps "Checking For updates". I have searched for fixes online, but none of them fixed my issue. I have also tried Microsoft FixIt tools but it is unable to fix the issue.
 I have scanned my computer for corrupted or missing files, but says no issues have been found. Please help! I really want to update this PC to windows 10.</p>
<p>The errors I get when I use the FIxIt tool:</p>

            <p><span>There is nothing wrong with your computers!&nbsp; The problem is a hopelessly inadequate Windows Update service.&nbsp; Likely it is overwhelmed sending millions of 5 gigabyte Win10 unrequested files to unwilling Win7 computers, using the same equipment and network
 that normally services you and I.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is likely that you are going to have to be unbelievably patient.&nbsp; The Microsoft Windows Update facility is hopelessly under water.&nbsp; It can not deliver those millions of 5 gigabyte Win10 files that few people want AND deliver what you need.&nbsp; On top
 of that the Win10 malware download is much higher priority to Microsoft.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From Microsoft’s perspective, the updates you want are an extremely low priority.&nbsp; They do not want you updating Windows 7.&nbsp; They want you replacing it with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have seen cases where the green bar continued overnight and finally found the updates, then spent many more hours downloading those updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My advice:&nbsp; don't even bother until the September updates, or be very, very patient.&nbsp; Stop trying to fix your computer.&nbsp; You are likely to make a mess of it for no benefit.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Trying to fix your computer is pointless, when the problem is your supplier.&nbsp; Sort of like taking a part your car's engine because it does not start, when the problem is the gas tank is empty.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Same problem here on my Surface RT 2.</p>
<p>I played with the parental control last night and I don't know if it has something to do.</p>
<p>My daughter messed up with the tablet and I'm now logged/locked in the "guest" account.</p>
<p>Whenever I click the Power button, I have the default Seattle wallpaper and when I slide up, I quickly see "guest locked" and then end up on a screen I had never seen before.</p>
<p>It's called "Help+Advice" and has 6 big tiles I can browse and that present Windows 8.</p>
<p>Impossible to bring any side menu.</p>
<p>It's like a presentation with no way out.</p>
<p>Tried to hold the power button 30+ seconds.</p>
<p>But when I turn it on again, I go back directly to the guest locked account :(&nbsp;</p>

            Windows feedback hub is full of this error today. Happened to me with a game from the store. Said it wasn't accessible in my account and threw this error. I ended up uninstalling the game after other troubleshooting steps so I am sure I will lose all the
 progress in that game after this is fixed. I could not redownload the game from the store. Gave same error. Interestingly I can play Microsoft games I have installed.

                    <p>Im sure you are at least supposed to get three strikes on your account before a suspension but the only thing i said that was recent to anyone was "salty" and ill admit it wasn't&nbsp;something that i should have sent,&nbsp;&nbsp;but i was not saying any vulgarities&nbsp;out of all of the people that i have reported that message me and start calling me names making fun of my sexuality&nbsp; and cursing at me iv&nbsp;never gotten a notification that told me anything happened to them at all. and then i go and ask if someone is salty and i get an instant suspension.&nbsp;im very upset that i got suspended when i did not even curse at them when they were the ones being extremely toxic in the first place. and i want to know the reasoning behind my suspension ASAP just in case there is&nbsp;something that im missing&nbsp;</p>

            It's quite possible that the program doesn't work well in a vm. I'm afraid only the developer is going to be able to figure it out for you. I'm sorry I was unable to help you.

<h2>            Family Safety Child accounts can&#39;t view flash media</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I've set up Windows Family Safety for our two children. &nbsp;They each have their own Windows 7 pc (32bit). &nbsp;Everything seems to work fine except that they can't view flash content on allowed web sites.</p>
<p>I have a Windows Parent account on the same PCs which can view the content - no problem.</p>
<p>I have tried with both MS Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. &nbsp;Both have the Flash plugin enabled. &nbsp;When loading the page through IE, we see a message saying that Flash is needed. &nbsp;In Chrome, the page just remains blank. &nbsp;Chrome&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)">Version
 41.0.2272.118 m. &nbsp;Chrome Flash&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Version:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>17.0.0.134. &nbsp;MS IE 11.0.9600.17691 Flash 17.0.0.134.</span></p>
<p><span>I've looked in Family Safety to allow Flash as an application, but it isn't listed as either flash or shockwave.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm clearly missing something. &nbsp;Can anyone help?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable to play online games. I will try to help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the issue specific when you play online games?</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you get this error message when opening up any applications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1: </p>
<p>Sep 1: Could you check if the same issue occurs in safe mode?</p>
<p>Please follow the below link on how to boot the Computer in safe mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Perform clean boot to check whether it is a software conflict issue.</p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</p>
<p>Clean boot:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Note: After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state” in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on this check Event viewer.</p>
<p>Event Viewer is a tool that displays detailed information about significant events (for example, programs that don't start as expected or updates that are downloaded automatically) on your computer. Event Viewer can be helpful when troubleshooting problems
 and errors with Windows and other programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following article:</p>
<p>Understanding Event Viewer:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: For safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command.</p>
<p>Important:</p>
<p>•On some systems with slow floppy drives, Windows Memory Diagnostic may require more time to load before it can begin testing. The loading progress is represented by periods (.) displayed after the Loading message, which appears when Windows Memory Diagnostic
 starts. </p>
<p>•If Windows Memory Diagnostic reports errors on all memory modules, the motherboard may be failing. Contact the manufacturer of the motherboard.
</p>
<p>•Be aware that there may be problems with your RAM or other hardware that Windows Memory Diagnostic cannot detect. That is, if Windows Memory Diagnostic reports no errors, it is not proof that your hardware is working correctly.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that you can utilize to get the issue resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing back from you.</p>

    <title>explorer eating all memory -- - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> astara__  say:</h3>
<h2>            explorer eating all memory --</h2>
                    Starting about ~3+ weeks ago, my main desktop explorer process started behaving badly.<br />
<br />
had over 40GB in it's ACTIVE SET and now about once every day or two, it will do the same -- Twice I have been doing<br />
text related activities, so I didn't notice it until I got a message from Windows telling me it wanted to close explorer -- as I was<br />
getting close to being out of resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously if I was in any graphical app (photoshop, or such), I would wonder my computer was getting so sluggish...<br />
<br />
Step out and notice explorer usually in the upper 30's to low 40 GB range of *physical memory*......Yeah, ok,&nbsp; I start to notice<br />
that!<br />
<br />
Right now, I have a commit charge (whole system) of about 4.47GB, (this is after a restart of explorer) but&nbsp; my peak == limit (that's when explorer was using about 100GB of memory.&nbsp; peak=limit=104.07GB.&nbsp;&nbsp; (have about 50+G for SWAP on an SSD...).<br />
<br />
I can't figure out what the heck it is trying to do?&nbsp; It seems like it is caught in some infinite loop and has a serious memory leak.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;This seem to start after the last round of MS updates... so I'm more than a little bit thinking it had something to do with them, but<br />
really have no clue.<br />
<br />
I have MS-sec-essentials and have run full scans -- nothing shows up... When I restart it -- it doesn't start growing immediately -- it can go for many hours and be well behaved... What it seems to be doing is scanning files in my Net-mounted Docs directory.<br />
<br />
And it's using alot of bandwidth -- 25-40MB/s at times -- a large drain on a home network.<br />
<br />
So what the **** is it doing??... it looks like it is indexing files, but even search doesn't glob all of memory while it does searches...<br />
<br />
and even MS-essentials which can cover all the files on my network in a day, doesn't use that type of BW or memory!<br />
<br />
Clues about how to track this -- unfortunately MS has played the shell game too well and who the real 'requester' of the files is, is anyone's guess -- Usually I see files going through 'System', and all the I/O hiding there, but now something is really making
 use <br />
of explorer to do a scan every day or two...<br />
<br />
Very weird.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Where are you getting these readings from? Task Manager, Process Explorer or ????</p>
<p>Anything in Event Viewer?</p>
<p><span>Here are some notes about Event Viewer Reports which may help. When you have a lot of errors you need to concentrate on system errors and warnings, even
 if it is applications that are giving you grief. Sorting system problems first can make resolving application problems easier. Note the time the computer is last booted and deal with those at the beginning of the boot first. Correcting the earlier errors can
 resolve later ones.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors
 are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows
 Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see
 the latest Report at the top. </span></p>
<p><span>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy
 on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information
 but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues. </span></p>
<p><span>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point
 when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description
 is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</span></p>

            Nothing relevant in event viewer because as far as Explorer is concerned, there's.&nbsp; Getting my readings from Process Hacker -- it has graphs that work among lots of other things that&nbsp; the others don't.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It didn't run amok yesturday...wait,,, yes... but I caught it WAY early (it was only up to 5G, but I was running some higher-resource need apps and having ti take up 20-30MB/s of IO, got noticable...But nothing in the app, or sys logs under warnings/errrors,
 and in the info too many service start/stops to be useful -- normal behavior.&nbsp; Of course if I don't catch explorer before it eats all of memory, there will be an error report that my machine ran low on physical memory, but that's a no brainer.<br />
<br />
My system is usually up 24/7 -- these incidents don't cause a reboot if I catch them -- last one (one that I didn't catch till mem was full anyway) caused the worst damage in killing off about 3 other processes that out of memory when explorer had it all)...<br />
<br />
I think it is search related...because even though search doesn't search my network, other things do -- like media player and security scanner -- and they don't work efficiently with the normal search function begin disabled over networks.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I don't know
 what might have changed a month ago...other than last MS updates...<br />

<p>If I do tis I won't be able to reproduce the problem. you can't run most of window's functions in safe mode. Most of win7 doesn't run in safe mode, if the problem is in Win7, how does safe mode help?

<p>This won't work... it is completely impractical. I'm on 'Wednesday here', the last time this happened was Saturday night' -- 4 days ago. It happens at random 2-3 times/week in the past month, but 4 days is a record, so I don't know what the max time between
 problems is. </p>
<p>I can't disable half of my needed apps that are required to do work and sit around and wait for an indefinite period of time. Maybe explorer only does it when I am working in some other app -- or some other app is running.
</p>
<p>As I write this I see 68 processes -- and I know some of them can scan through my files as Explorer is appearing to do -- MsMpEng (Ms home security/anti-malware), the search/index function. But I turn those off and I lose .. well, their functions, the search
 function would be worse, since it's needed for the start menu to work in it's default mode.
</p>
<p>Turning those functions off for days (been 4 days now, and no repeat, but in some prior weeks it happened every day ~once/day.
</p>
<p>Now I might note... MS updates came out and I usually install those and one of those might have affected the problem -- reduced the frequence or fixed it. I don't know. So I could be waiting a long time for the problem to reproduce at each stage where they
 suggest I enable a few items at a time (or successive halves if doing a binary search)...

<p>I'll look at this, but find think it will be a waste, as My computer isn't normally slow (performance index scores: proc:7.7, mem:7.8, graphics, gaming graphics + hd: 7.9 (proc is 6-core 3.33GHz + mem is 1066Mhz -- latest gen stuff is a bit faster)). It
 does get a bit bogged down when explorer is using nearly 100GB of commit memory on a system that has a 104GB limit (and only 48GB physical) -- they only reason I don't notice it alot sooner is that my swap is on a RAID SSD... It's not until I literally run
 out of memory that I notice things often! I sorta doubt Mr. Fixit is designed to deal with those types of slow downs. But I'll check it out! ;-) (not gonna
</p>
<p>I was playing a game which uses 180% cpu and 100-160% of my GPU ( I have 2 GPU's, so max is 200), but with a 6 core processor that means explorer can use up 100% cpu on a core, and I wouldn't notice it until it ate all of memory -- and I didn't!... I was
 playing that game and got a beep and found myself on the desktop with the emergency message that I was out of memory and Windows wanted to kill the bad process 'explorer.exe'... It tried, it couldn't, I helped it, (click on explorer in process-hacker, and
 'restart'. Crisis averted (only a few processes were affected and had to be restarted (including the game I was in ;-( (it's not real stable anyway, so just looking at it funny can cause it to go belly-up)).
</p>
<p>One thing I did do -- I stopped running a ".net" process that was running in the background.. as I read on the net that ".net" processes can make windows unstable and could cause symptoms like I was seeing in Explorer.
</p>
<p>Thought it was a stretch, but since I turned that off, Explorer hasn't misbehaved. Coincidence? Maybe. Time will tell.
</p>
<p>That would be bad if it was something in the .Net libs, since more people are starting to use them, and that would mean a whole class of programs would be suspect.

<p>I have tested RAM recently -- not at issue. Besides, the computer has hardware checked memory (ECC), any uncorrectable errors would flag a fatal OS error (at least that's what happens on linux; maybe windows ignores fatal hardware problems -- but I would
 tend to doubt it.) </p>
<p>BUT - more important than that -- memory errors cause *random* problems -- they don't cause 1 program to do the same maladaptive behavior over and over. Windows randomizes the addresses at which programs are loaded -- so even if a particular memory cell
 failure was permanent and not transient -- it wouldn't cause the same symptom becaus explorer wouldn't be loaded at the same place in memory -- other programs would have failures. I'm not seeing that.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions... am hoping the .Net thing did the trick...but only half hoping, since that would be bad if that was the cause...</p>

            <p>You're describing a memory leak. A programme that, even when closed, does not return allocated memory for reuse. The only way to get memory back is to shut down the computer. Try Googling your programmes one by one coupled with "memory leak" and see if any
 generate a lot of responses. </p>
<p>Do you have any old programmes. A favoured old game could be the culprit.</p>

            heh.&nbsp; Be ironic if it was the game I mentioned, eh?&nbsp; Good idea, but doesn't fit the evidence.<br />
<br />
1)...<br />
The game I was 'playing' (as it is rather unstable, I put that in quotes and at times tell myself "I'm only 'testing' it..."... cuz it's hard to get into the mindspace of something when your world may drop out from under you at any moment and does multiple
 times a day (in various ways... graphical bugs -- need to quit,<br />
immediate exits to desktop (no "stopped working message", and the occasion and more rare (now), "it's stopped working, Windows will tell you when its fixed!)... Ha!...<br />
<br />
...But it's a 32-bit program that couldn't allocate more than 3GB for all it's worth!, but since it isn't large-memory aware, it won't go over 2GB (some&nbsp; people can run it with the LARGE_ADDRESS aware flag set, but when I tried it, I got no sound -- which would
 seem to indicate the sound drivers aren't large address capable -- butit's hard to see how a 32-bit prog would include a 32-bit sound driver on a 64-bit OS... but that's not an issue on my priority list at this point -- given other issues on my plate.<br />
<br />
2) It's *Explorer.exe* that's the culprit.&nbsp; My main desktop program -- not any sub explorers launch for folders.&nbsp; No way a 32-bit game or most any other prog should be affecting explorer except through it's programmed interfaces -- unless, it is a driver or
 a DLL that gets injected (like .Net DLL's), among others.<br />
<br />
3) It's only happened twice when I've been in game, other times -- had a few 'vi[m]' edit windows open and a console window and was doing script development on another machine (remote login)...and my desktop gets really slow... that I noticed well before it
 became critical.<br />
<br />
4) has happened when browsing internet (and that game isn't running cept when I am playing it -- it's too much of a resource pig; ;-))...<br />
<br />
5) This is an important one -- as it is building up memory -- explorer is also doing I/O (mentioned In my original) -- searching what looks to be my doc directory -- a network-located beast with 515GB in it.<br />
<br />
I can watch it with procmon -- or look at the network activity -- it's enumerating files and dirs, at a high rate of speed -- like doing a search.&nbsp; The<br />
'search' function is quiescent -- and usually you see the I/O attributed to it, not explorer (or to 'System')....<br />
<br />
It was doing easily 20-30MB/s I/O sustained in searching through my Docs over the net.&nbsp; While that's only 1/6th to 1/4th of my 1-way I/O bandwidth, it's still rather high considering it isn't doing LARGE read writes, but small ones -- so much higher latency
 and random reads...&nbsp; I might venture that something in it is doing a recursive search through my Docs dir and maybe getting lost or hitting a dirloop -- or it's trying to read in the contents of the 515G docs<br />
dir into its memory space...&nbsp; Yikes!&nbsp; Can't see why it would do either -- especially when I am not using explorer when it happens (not like I am doing searches in explorer, or similar... non-related programs, more often textual/tty related.&nbsp; The game is something
 I've gotten limping recently... ;-).<br />
<br />
I think it is usually one on or more of the shlwapi.dll!WrapperThreadProc threads (you can look at threads with process hacker or process explorer)<br />
that are doing the I/O.<br />
<br />
Right now -- it's been up ... well in 2 hours it'll be an even 4-days (96 hours) since it's last hiccup -- which is the longest stretch of no hiccups since it started happening earlier last month.<br />
<br />
In it's loaded modules list (only in process hacker -- not procmon), I can see a few modules that have no trust status at all and no signer -- that seem to be<br />
MS files, 2 that are 'untrusted', by windows, (foobar.dll to send songs to the music player, and 7-zip to handle 7z/zip file stuff.... it is a bit odd to see<br />
MS files unsigned.&nbsp;&nbsp; like apisetschema.dll, but if it was supposed to be signed and wasn't I'd think I'd see untrusted...?&nbsp; Maybe not.<br />
<br />
So no Nt processes loaded right now (verified by procmon -- which lists them out separately ...
<br />
<br />
I definitely wouldn't say for certain, but there's a bit of evidence stacked against .NET libraries right now -- as I shut down long running background .Net monitoring program the last time this happened. (saw someone else on google mention a probl with .net
 and memory probs...don't remember the particulars other than it ate up their memory (much faster -- but I think they were on a smaller machine with only 2 cores.<br />
<br />
Sooo.....If I had to guess now, I'd say there, but with only a 20% confidence.<br />
<br />
Fair analysis?&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Thanks though -- it got me looking into what dll's are loaded... that might be another avenue to check if and when it happens again (maybe it's time to load up that .Net-based monitor program again... ;-)...<br />
<br />
Me...glutton for punishment?&nbsp;&nbsp; ya'd think so!...<br />
<br />
<br />

            See original note for 32/64 and RAM and swap installed.<br />
----edit---<br />
Sorry, I realized my original note required some deduction:<br />
I said (of explorer)<br />
....had over 40GB in it's ACTIVE SET <br />
....<br />
Step out and notice explorer usually in the upper 30's to low 40 GB range of *physical memory*.....<br />
Right now, I have a commit charge (whole system) of about 4.47GB, (this is after a restart of explorer) but&nbsp; my peak == limit (that's when explorer was using about 100GB of memory.&nbsp; peak=limit=104.07GB. (have about 50+G for SWAP on an SSD...).<br />
-----------------------<br />
From the above, my peak = 104.07, explorer was taking ~100GB, <br />
I restart explorer and it grows up a bit...and I end up only 4.47GB used (almost 100 GB total free in swap &amp; physical)...&nbsp; -- about 50+ is in swap, so<br />
memory (physical is likely &lt;50, -- most likely 48GB -- which it is.<br />
<br />
With figures like that --&nbsp; it could only be Win7-64.<br />
<br />
===============end note==================<br />
<br />
I have Process Hacker setup in place of Task manager for a task function --<br />
<br />
Used to have procexplorer -- but it gave false readings would hang things --<br />
like it would be using 50% of system CPU (200%x4 at the time), and it would<br />
claim it was using '0'.... only through process hacker that I saw the real story.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you might be mis-understanding something -- maybe it is the display in task manager, not sure. I'm not looking at the cpu for all children.&nbsp; I'm looking at the cpu for 1 specific process.<br />
<br />
Just now -- caught it again.&nbsp; It had 5 threads going, the top 3 were consuming a total of 54% of 1 cpu (9% of 6).<br />
<br />
<br />
The children of a process don't work through the parent as a general rule -- they run independently -- granted they can make rpc calls to libraries hosted in explorer -- but ANY process can do that -- not just children.&nbsp; Children just lets you know what process
 was launched by what -- for your main desktop -- almost all of your processes will be launched by it normally -- such is not usually the case on my system, as I hve to restart it, when it runs amok, and then the parent is whatever program restarted it...
<br />
<br />
Right now I have about 10 unparented processes... and under explorer, I see only 'mmc' (eventviewer too see if there were any clues as to what it iwas doing), and a launch of my email client to find the last message pointer to this thead.&nbsp;&nbsp; The browser ISN'T
 a child of explorer or the email client because it was already running -- so it was passed a request from the email browser to launch this site.<br />
<br />
So whether or not something is a child of a process is really unrelated to whether or not it is using services of the parent -- since unrelated procs can use rpc resources (or COM/DCOM, OLE...etc), or children can as well -- but just as easily use resources
 or calls in unrelated process chains.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just now...I pulled I noted it scanning again and tried just pulling the it's OCR lib.&nbsp; (try doing that in taskmanager or procexp!)... It ran for about a minute longer before it died more than likely trying to call something in that DLL....<br />

(2nd &amp; 3rd traded places a few times, but didn't have time to get 3rd thread<br />
before my sabotage (unloading it's OCR lib) caused it to fail with:<br />

<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
Alsmost as if it is scanning -- doing OCR text recognition in this case from MSOHext.dll -- Microsoft Office.<br />
<br />
I did repair MS office about a month ago... it could be it is at fault.&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed it has gotten upgraded by recent updates -- and that SP2 for it has failed to install more than once.&nbsp; (I don't use it that often, so I haven't investigated - figuring it might
 eventually sort itself out)...<br />
<br />
But it give every appearance of doing that which microsoft has denied to consumers -- the ability to index and search through files on a network -- which is where all the files are that it is searching through.<br />
<br />
<br />
So tell me Gerry, can you think of why, when MS has told us that we can't have our computers remotely index our network drives (this is new after XP as XP could index networked drives, but Win7 requires the drives index themselves and it just queries)... Yet
 -- explorer gives every indication of going through each of my files doing field and character recognition -- much more thorough indexing than the indexing service requires... I mean if they really can't search our index drives, they why is explorer doing
 that?<br />
<br />
Am I&nbsp; jumping to conclusions in thinking that MS has lied to us (again)?<br />
<br />
This is strongly looking to be Office related at this point...about 60% confidence.<br />
<br />
(Have caught it twice in MSXML routines loaded from office that are implicated in the activity.<br />
<br />
I'm NOT running office nor is it running in any background processes...<br />
<br />
Very strange if not interesting...<br />

<p>^My system info. Here is what has been happening. I can access the internet completely, HOWEVER, i literally cannot access my router to manage it. I have figured out that i have missing winsock registry files, (if i said that wrong, that is what the troubleshooter
 said). I do not have a system restore point that i can go back to, i have attempted to fix this using the troubleshooter under the hidden windows admin, i have attempted to fix this by resetting winsock with the admin cmd, but nothing worked. I contacted customer
 support, and they sent me a link to FIX REGISTRY ON WINDOWS XP DEVICES IN 2003!!!! (i gave them my windows version and build number, man they are so smart...). I have not been able to access my router, or find any reliable way to fix the registry, any help
 would be appreciate. (For any microsoft support tech out there, i AM NOT paying you guys to remotely log onto my computer to fix this issue, like i was offered to by the customer support). I do apologize if i seem like i whine a lot, its just literally everything
 has been unhelpful for the very long time i have been searching for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tl;dr please help me restore my registry.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that inconvenience due to not being able to access your router to manage it and I will be happy to answer your query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to delete Winsock Registry And Reinstall TCP/IP</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><em><span><span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps
 carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in
 the Microsoft Knowledge Base: </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></span></a></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fhtse.kapilarya.com%2fW8K.png" />+ R</strong> and put<strong> regedit</strong> in
<strong>Run</strong> dialog box to open <em>Registry Editor</em></p>
<p>b. In the <em>left</em> pane of <em>Registry Editor</em>, navigate to following registry key:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2</strong></p>
<p>c. At this registry location, <span>right click</span> <strong>WinSock2</strong> key and select
<strong>Export</strong>. Save the backup of the registry entry to a suitable location. Then again do a right click&nbsp;on same registry key, and select
<strong>Delete</strong>. d. Perform <em>step 3</em> with <strong>WinSock</strong> (<em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock</em>) registry key as well. Close
<em>Registry Editor</em>. </p>
<p>e. Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> and navigate to <strong>Network and Internet</strong> &gt;<strong>Network Connections</strong>. Here, do a right click on your
<em>Local Area Connection</em> or <em>Ethernet connection</em> and select <strong>
Properties</strong>. </p>
<p>f. In the <em>Local Area Connection</em> or <em>Ethernet connection</em> property sheet, click
<strong>Install</strong>. </p>
<p>g. Next, select <strong>Protocol</strong> under <em>Select Network Feature Type</em> and click
<strong>Add</strong>. </p>
<p>h. Then click <strong>Have Disk</strong> in <em>Select Network Protocol</em> window.
</p>
<p>I. Moving on, in the <em>Install From Disk</em> window, type <strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 153, 102, 1)">C:</span>\Windows\inf</strong> for
<em>Copy manufacturer’s files from</em> section. Click <strong>OK</strong>. </p>
<p><em>*Substitute C: with your system root drive.</em> </p>
<p>j. Finally, in the <em>Select Network Protocol</em> window which populates list of
<em>Internet Protocols</em>, select <strong>Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) – Tunnels</strong>. Click
<strong>OK</strong>. Close <em>Network and Sharing Center</em>, restart your machine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this way, the registry configuration is re-created after reboot, which ultimately should solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>To access the administration console of your router, open any web browser and type your router's IP address into the address box. Press Enter, then enter the username and password of your router's administration console. This has nothing to do with the Windows
 registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are determined to edit the registry, I would suggest instead opening the window and tossing your computer out. You'll accomplish the same thing, but it's more entertaining to watch your PC disintegrate.</p>

            You misunderstand. When I type 10.0.0.1 it gives me an error. When I diagnose it, it says I am missing registry files.

            <p>Presuming that's the right address, it still has nothing to do with the Windows registry. And generic error messages are frequently misleading (unintentionally.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're simply inserting an IP address and asking it to resolve, just like any other web address. If that is the correct address, and you're seeing an error message, the people to ask are at your router's technical support.</p>

<h2>            please unsubscribe me from Skype for business</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I once subscribed Skype for business in September 2017. Which I paid for one month only. I did asked one of your staff about one month's subscription and he/she told me it was okay. Now , I just received an email informing me that Microsoft will debit from
 my credit card account for the month of November subscription. Please note that I'm no longer interested in the service. Please unsubscribe me. I am no longer in need of the service tand it was for an interview only., of which I did. I see no reason why my
 credit card will be debited. This is not right.</p>
<p>
