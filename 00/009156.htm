<h2>            Word 2011 for Mac OS X -- how well does it run on a MAC Air&#63;</h2>
                    I am setting up a Mac Air for my son, and wonder whether MS Word for MAC will run well on the Air. &nbsp;I know it works fine on my MacBook Pro laptop, but I'd like to have some assurance it will do the same on the Air before I buy it. &nbsp;Apple doesn't have much
 to say about any MS product, and the MS web site is silent on this topic except to say the computer must have an Intel processor. &nbsp; The Air has an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 2 GB of memory, and operates at 1.07 GHz.

<h2>            Alcatel Idol 4S Apps Won&#39;t Connect to Mobile Network</h2>
                    <p>This problem is going on Day 2 now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My device has an LTE signal and can receive and send calls, texts, etc. but it cannot access the internet unless connected to Wi-Fi. The only apps that work on my data connection are Facebook and Facebook Messenger. All other apps that require the internet
 to operate say that there is something wrong with my connection. Though once I connect to Wi-Fi, everything is fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solutions I have attempted so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have turned my device off and back on again with no result. </li><li>I reset my APN settings three times with no changes. </li><li>I uninstalled both Messenger and Facebook with no change. </li><li>I even reset my phone back to factory settings with no result. </li><li>I contacted my service provider to see if the problem was the service itself, only to find that, based on what they could see and tell me, everything on their end is fine (I have an LTE signal, almost full bars). They told me to contact the manufacturer,
 so I did, and they had absolutely no idea what to tell me other than to call my service provider again. I have yet to do so, since I feel they would just tell me what they already did before.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I've only had this phone a little over a month and I love it, but this issue is really upsetting me--mostly because I do not have constant access to Wi-Fi, and therefore cannot enjoy my device now. At this point, I feel it may be because of the system itself,
 but I'm not certain. No updates have been released between July 31st and today as of this moment that could have caused this, so I'm running out of possible reasons. Any help, ideas, and suggestions are extremely welcomed.</p>

<p>I appreciate the effort, and apologize about the image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was actually able to fix the problem today; I started to assume that the problem was with the SIM card, since I did a factory reset and that didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a new SIM card and everything works just fine now. Thank you all so much for your help, though!!</p>

    <title>Unknown Error message when checking sleep information in the Health - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmcs_54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown Error message when checking sleep information in the Health app - Band 2</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I've recently started getting an "An unknown error occurred with your Microsoft Band" message when I open the sleep information tab in the Microsoft Health app. If I tap OK the error message closes and the information is displayed and it is correct. I don't
 have any issues during syncing either with the phone or with the Microsoft Sync app on my computer. Since the information is there and correct this is more an annoyance than an issue but I would like to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed two sensor monitoring apps along with 2 other Band tool apps. I don't think they are the cause of the issue&nbsp;and think I ruled them out&nbsp;but&nbsp;I'm not certain. I did uninstall the apps and then un-register my band from the phone, uninstall
 the Health app, do a soft reset of the phone,&nbsp;re-install the Health app and re-register the Band. The issue still existed after this so I reinstalled the apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit to add information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found that past information for each category except sleep&nbsp;is present in the Health app on my phone. For example I scrolled through step data back to August and could have kept going. That is only available for last night. All of my history is available
 in the Dashboard online.&nbsp;When I tap history in the app menu I get the moving dots for a few seconds and then this message: We couldn't load the data. Please try again later. From where is it trying to get the data? Directly from the Band or the Dashboard data?
 Since I reset the Band and reinstalled the Health app the only place that should have historical data is the Dashboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to replace the data in the Health app with what is in the Dashboard? That should get the Health app corrected and hopefully resolve the error message.</p>
<p />

<h2>            Publisher Images go to next page when made &#39;inline&#39;</h2>
                    I had a problem with Publisher 2003 in that if I made an image 'inline' and 'not move with text' then very often the text would stop half way down the text box and the remaining text and the image would disappear off to the following page.<br />
I got so frustrated with this that I updated to Publisher 2010.&nbsp; But same problem.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what might be the problem?<br />

            <p>The reason to insert an image&nbsp;'inline' is to get the image to flow with the text.&nbsp;If you don't want the image to move then don't put it inline and let the text wrap around the image. Right click the image &gt; format picture &gt; layout tab and change position
 to 'exact' instead of 'inline' and then change then choose the wrapping options you prefer.</p>
<p>By the way there are advantages of having Publisher 2003 so if you have the installation media and key code you can do a custom install into its own folder and run both versions of Publisher. You may prefer Pub 2010...many don't.</p>

            DavidF<br />
thanks for your reply.<br />
I want the image to stay in the same position relative to a piece of text. So if I have in image at the end of a paragraph, if I expand the paragraph before the image then I want to image to remain at the end of the paragraph.<br />
That is why I choose 'inline'.<br />
But the problem is, as soon as I change an imported image (default position 'exact') to 'inline' and 'not move with text' then very often the text would stop half way down the text box (leaving a large blank space below) and the remaining text and the image
 would disappear off to linked text box on the following page.<br />
This happens about 50% of the time I convert 'exact' images to 'inline'; making Publisher almost unusable.<br />
<br />
I was hoping that someone else may have experienced this and be able to tell me the cause.<br />

            <p>If you opt for inline and 'not move with text' then you have to opt for&nbsp;either a&nbsp;'left or right horizontal alignment'. Assuming that you chose 'right' alignment then the image will shift to the right margin and depending on how tall the image is the X number
 of lines of text or space&nbsp;to the left of the image will move with the image down the text box as you add text above the image.</p>
<p>Eventually when you have pushed the image and the associated X lines of text or space&nbsp;down the page you run out of room for the image and when you push it one line too far then the image AND all the associated X lines of text or space&nbsp;will flow to the next
 page as a group, or more exactly to the next text box.&nbsp;That will leave a gap when there is no more room at the bottom of the text box to move the image down. It won't move just part of the image down into the next text box.</p>
<p>That is your dilemna. Even if you format the image to move with the text you are going to have gaps and the same thing happens when you reach the bottom of the text box. You can't have an image straddling two text boxes. This is the same way Word works except
 Word does not give you the left or right horizontal allignment option.</p>
<p>I would ask what behavior do you expect? What do you want to happen? </p>
<p>I don't see that you have any choice but&nbsp;to tweak&nbsp;your layout after you finish writing. You may be able to drag the image up or down or&nbsp;you may find that using exact and wrapping is the best choice when you are&nbsp;at the bottom of a text box and dealing with
 a gap.</p>

            <blockquote>DavidF, you write "Eventually when you have pushed the image and the associated X lines of text or space&nbsp;down the page you run out of room for the image and when you push it one line too far then the image AND all the associated
 X lines of text or space&nbsp;will flow to the next page as a group, or more exactly to the next text box.&nbsp;That will leave a gap when there is no more room at the bottom of the text box to move the image down. It won't move just part of the image down into the
 next text box."</blockquote>
I believe that you are correct but think that the key words that I am not understanding here is "all the associated text" - what is the associated text?<br />
When I convert an image from "exact" to "inline" then the image always jumps a few lines of text - dont know why. I then cannot drag the image back a few lines to where I want it without converting it back to "exact". There is no anchor symbol, even with the
 reverse P button selected, so I cannot see what text the image is associated with. Furthermore, the image, when selected, has an outer boundary which I dont understand and may influence where it is placed when inline.<br />
<br />
It seems that I need a much better understanding of Publishers logic when placing inline images. But the help system in Publisher 2010 I find far inferior to that in Publisher 2003 (it keeps giving me help with Office 2010 in general). Do you know of any source
 of detailed help with inline images?<br />

<blockquote>DavidF, you write "Eventually when you have pushed the image and the associated X lines of text or space&nbsp;down the page you run out of room for the image and when you push it one line too far then the image AND all the associated X lines of text
 or space&nbsp;will flow to the next page as a group, or more exactly to the next text box.&nbsp;That will leave a gap when there is no more room at the bottom of the text box to move the image down. It won't move just part of the image down into the next text box."</blockquote>
I believe that you are correct but think that the key words that I am not understanding here is "all the associated text" - what is the associated text?<br />
When I convert an image from "exact" to "inline" then the image always jumps a few lines of text - dont know why. I then cannot drag the image back a few lines to where I want it without converting it back to "exact". There is no anchor symbol, even with the
 reverse P button selected, so I cannot see what text the image is associated with. Furthermore, the image, when selected, has an outer boundary which I dont understand and may influence where it is placed when inline.<br />
<br />
It seems that I need a much better understanding of Publishers logic when placing inline images. But the help system in Publisher 2010 I find far inferior to that in Publisher 2003 (it keeps giving me help with Office 2010 in general). Do you know of any source
 of detailed help with inline images?<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I originally&nbsp;tried to reproduce your issue in Pub 2003&nbsp;by creating a text box with several paragraphs of text, inlcuding one extra long paragraph. I had an image already on my test page outside of the text box, so I dragged it into the middle of the long paragraph
 such that the text wrapped around the image. The long paragraph had more lines of text...was 'taller' than the image which meant that there were lines of text above and below the image. I then right clicked the image &gt; format picture and change from 'exact'
 to 'inline' and 'right alignment'. When I ok out the picture had shifted to the right margin, but still had lines of text above and below and the lines of text to the left of the image are what I called the 'associated text'.</p>
<p>To test behaviour I tried several things. I clicked into the text above the image, within the paragraph and started adding arbitrary lines of text. This started moving the image down the page and the 'associated lines of text' stayed with the image. Those
 lines of text and the image acted as a block or group. Eventually when I had added enough lines of additional text that the image had come to the bottom of the text box I found that if I added just one more line of text it 'bumped' the image and the 'associated
 lines of text' to the next text box and left the gap that you are trying to avoid.</p>
<p>I also tried just inserting the cursor above the paragraph with the image and simulated adding text by just hitting the enter key and watching the paragraph and the image move down the text box. Once again when I hit the bottom of the text box with the image
 it bumped the entire image and 'associated text' into the next text box and left a gap.</p>
<p>I then tried inserting the image at the end of a paragraph rather than in the middle and this left a gap or space to the left of the image with no text. And once again as you add text above that image it eventually bumps that image to the next text box.</p>
<p>My conclusions were that though you can move single lines of text into the next text box by entering additional lines of text above that bottom line of text, when you do the same with the image it moves the whole image to the next text box and you end up
 with the gap the height of the image, that&nbsp;you don't like. I think this is the case whether you have that image wrapped or inline and I don't see a workaround other than start with your images inline and then when you have finished writing your publication&nbsp;go
 back and change your image postitioning&nbsp;and if necessary switch to 'exact' and use&nbsp;the word wrap option in order to avoid the gaps at the bottom of the text boxes. You might also try Word. It can be a better choice for long documents but from my limited testing
 you still end up with the gaps.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot find much documentation on using the inline image option. Since Office 2003 MS has offered less and less Help and finally with Office 2010 there is very little. As you can tell from above I usually figure out Publisher behaviors and
 the "logic' as you put it via 'trial and terror'.&nbsp; Here is what I was able to find:</p>

I did not mean to give you so much work; but thanks for your experiments.<br />
In the spirit of your "learning by trial and error" I did some experiments too. And I seem to have discovered the cause of the problem; but maybe not the easy solution.<br />
<br />
The document I am writing is an illustrated road trip diary. As I am developing the diary I might add additional text or even photos to previous text; all of which causes the existing text to move around. Nevertheless, I need the trip photos to stay with the
 paragraph which describes the place visited. (I realise this might not be possible if there is insufficient space at the bottom of a page for the photo).<br />
<br />
So imagine a text box with the top quarter as text, the middle quarter an image, and the remaining half as text.
<br />
</span>The image and all the text below it is then pushed onto the following page - even though the image is too large for the identically-sized text box on that page. The image does though remain as 'inline'. The page which formally held the image then has
 text only in the top quarter.<br />
<br />
Altering the 'distance from text' of the image to zero does not allow the image to be the same width as the text box. Setting the image layout to 'inline/left alignment' does not position the image hard against the left side of the text box but a little to
 the right. So it seems that Publisher requires some space between an image and the edge of the text box. But I dont know how much or where this is set.<br />
<br />
So the solution seems to be to rescale images to have a width less than 1.5mm of their containing text box - not easy to judge when dragging a corner of an image.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            "So it seems that Publisher requires some space between an image and the edge of the text box. But I dont know how much or where this is set."<br />
<br />
I have found how. Select a text box then 'Format Text Box' then select the 'Text Box' tab. I reduced the margins to zero so I can now use images with the same width as a text box.<br />
<br />
To use the margin settings from an existing text box as the default settings for new text boxes
<div>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the text box that has the margins you want to use as defaults.</li><li>On the shortcut menu, click <b>Format Text Box</b>, and then click the
<b>Colors and Lines</b> tab. </li><li>Select the <b>Apply settings to new text boxes</b> check box.</li><li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li></ol>
<p>The next new text box that you create will use the settings from this text box.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t Windows Phone and Microsoft Sync for Ford Vehicles work together&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I hope Microsoft is working on this one.&nbsp; I just bought a new Ford Focus from a local dealer with Sync and My Ford Touch expecting that a Microsoft product would work with it.&nbsp; But alas, it does not.&nbsp; Sure I can connect via Bluetooth and have my text messages
 played aloud and a few other things.&nbsp; But the most important thing I wanted to do, play my music and be able to use the voice controls to select songs, artists, and albums, does not work.&nbsp; Disappointed in Microsoft Sync Team for not getting this one ironed
 out.&nbsp; How long has Windows Phone been available now, and is even had a major upgrade already.&nbsp; You would think they would be talking about this stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I want to play my music, I would have to get an Iphone.&nbsp; That Sucks!!!!</p>

<p>Even if there is an update released, you can update ONLY if its for YOUR device because the availability depends on Region / Product Code. Also if the phone is Network locked, then the update is possible only after an approval from the Operator.</p>
<p>OVI Suite will show you the one available for YOUR phone and you can ONLY update to that...</p>

<p>
</p><p>However it has still synced all my contacts. Why is this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also given that one can't delete contacts from within Skype on the windows phone it really sucks as I can't remove them.</p>
<p>I think it is really annoying that you can't keep your contact list in Skype just for Skype and stop your phone contacts from being imported.

</p><p>However it has still synced all my contacts. Why is this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also given that one can't delete contacts from within Skype on the windows phone it really sucks as I can't remove them.</p>
<p>I think it is really annoying that you can't keep your contact list in Skype just for Skype and stop your phone contacts from being imported

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you say Windows phone, are you in Windows 8 or 8.1 or upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile Technical Preview?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to install all the latest windows updates and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, try doing Soft Reset and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Soft Reset</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The soft reset is the same thing as pulling your battery (on devices where that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then press and hold the
<strong>volume down + power</strong> buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Example of situations where the soft reset should solve the problem</span></span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>•An app that usually starts won't start.</span></p>
<p><span>•The camera won't open.</span></p>
<p><span>•The device starts using too much battery.</span></p>
<p><span>•The device starts behaving oddly.</span></p>

On a PC, sign in to <a href="https://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://people.live.com/</a> , tap the S logo next to the sprocket upper right. Tap the Skype address book in the pane. Delete unwanted contacts.</p>
<p>

I hope it works now for you too?</p>

    <title>Not able to configure office 365 on iphone 6s plus with ios 9.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not able to configure office 365 on iphone 6s plus with ios 9.1</h2>
                    
<p>I have couple of problems from past 2 weeks which is making me really frustrating. I am office 365 for Buismess user and I am trying to configure my company email on my iphone 6s plus with ios 9.1</p>
<p>1. New phone. Trying to configure office 365 mail. Used default Mail client on iphone and selected Exchange and give valid usernam and password and finally received "Exchange Account Unable to verify account information"</p>
<p>2. Installed outlook app and tried same steps. It automatically redirects to Office 365 page as soon as I give my email address. Provided valid credentials there as well. Getting message "Unable to login The connection to your mail server timed out. Please
 contact your system administrator for support"</p>
<p>3. Even on my desktop browsers, I am facing intermittent sign-in issues from past 2 weeks. I get logged in and suddenly logged out without even seeing my mailbox. Immediate signout after login.</p>
<p>Please suggest some thing on this.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Pavan</p>

<p>Hi Pavan,</p>
<p>About&nbsp;the problem that you can’t configure Office 365 accounts in the mobile device, I suggest you use in-app support for expert help.</p>
<p>For the sign-in issue in the desktop browsers, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.Let the admin make sure the license has been assigned correctly.<br />
2.Does this issue happen on <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>,
<a href="https://portal.office365.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the portal </a>or both? <br />
3.If you try other browsers, will the issue persist?<br />
4.Do any other users encounter this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Zoey</p>

<h2>            W10 Mobile - update error 0x80070019</h2>

<p>
</p><p>For a few days, I cannot use People app. It simply opens a blank screen only. When I checked for a reason I found that there is an update available for this application that is hanging in a queue with an error message 0x80070019. The same for Network Services
 app. I tried to cancel the update and trigger it again, but with no success. I had also tried to do a soft reset recommended in other threads but, as probably most of the other users affected by similar issue, it did not help, too. I do not want to do a hard
 reset as I do not think it is a permanent resolution of the problem. Does anyone have any working solution?

            <p>Unfortunately, nothing has helped me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, the time settings were correct and I was unable to manually sync the Microsoft because the procedure described there did not work (holding the account label did not show any context menu that would allow me to sync). The cancelling the queue items,
 restarting and manual checking for updates I tried several times but with no success. I have all the detail correctly set in my account and only one device registered there.&nbsp; Some other applications were correctly updated in the meantime but not the People
 and Network Services (still the same 0x80070019 error).</p>

            <p>The both sim is LTE capable, however; it cannot set LTE at the same time. If you use LTE for sim1, the sim2 will be automatically registered to 2G and vice versa.

            The Sims are not capable of lte simultaneously. My question remains, is there an update to enable the use of both sims now that no 2g towers exist on att? I have contacted my provider and they play the same game, talk to manufacturer. The phone was purchased
 Jan16 and is now useless as a dual sim phone without manually swapping the sim to check text messages.

            It looks like the 950 XL is no longer a dual sim phone. Now what?

            Contrary to many reports, the timescale for the mobile rollout is 'weeks', if not months. We've been reporting on this over at AAWP if you're interested. Catch the latest few podcasts, for example.

    <title>Disappearing Pinned files from taskbar Program Icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petercollier_865  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disappearing Pinned files from taskbar Program Icon</h2>
                    With windows 10 and office 2016 I use excel, word, publisher and access. Previously with office 2007 I could pin a file to the relevant office program on the taskbar and always open that file by clicking on the pinned file. This is not the case with office
 2016. Access is the only program which will retain the pinned file after it has been opened and closed. On all the others the pinned file disappears upon the closing of the app. Can anyone please help?

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To save files and for Office to remember which files has been pinned and what not, it requires your Microsoft account to be signed in. To isolate the issue, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you currently signed in on Office 2016 with your Microsoft account?</li><li>Is this a standalone Office 2016? Or is it part of an Office 365 subscription?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hello Andreas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for going to the trouble of trying to help me, but please let me make this clear-I am not a newbie to computers, their operating systems or to microsoft office programs, and nor am I an idiot. Of course I know you have to right click on the icon,
 I know exactly what is supposed to be done to operate pinned taskbar programs.</p>
<p>To put it simply, the pinned program file within the taskbar program icon will open the file once, then when the file is closed the pinned program file disappears from within the program icon on the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens in Excel and Word, but operates properly in Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;(as you showed in your screenshot) I know exactly what "Recent" files are &nbsp;as they were evident in the pinned taskbar shortcuts in my previous Office program which incidentally was Office 2007 and which worked perfectly. Trust me when I say they are
 not existing in the taskbar shortcuts in this Office 2016 program I have just installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need if possible is for someone more knowledgeable than I to tell me if or how this fault in Office 2016 can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again.</p>

<h3> mordruu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 - Emails being delivered to unspecified Recipient Mailbox Folder.</h2>
                    
<p>I have 6 clients sending emails to each other. The emails are always delivered without issue, but sometimes a copy of these emails are delivered to a specific email account that has not been cc'd or bcc'd.&nbsp; Here are some details:</p>
<ol>
<li>this only affects 6 users </li><li>the emails can be plain text or with attachments(word or excel) </li><li>the emails are delivered to an account they all have full rights to. </li><li>the emails are always delivered to the mailbox folder and not the inbox folder.</li><li>there are no rules on the 6 users profile </li><li>there is no alternate recipient on the 6 users email accounts in Exchange </li><li>it appears but not verified that the emails that go to this account do not stay in the senders sent items folder</li></ol>
Any ideas on where to look to determine why these emails are going to this mailbox would be greatly appreciated

            man if they did this windows live would be killer. add live mesh into the mix and t would kick the ____ outta mobileme. and what do u mean by 'myphone is sync'ing fine with my touch hd, but i cant get anything to sync with myphone'? if its syncing fine
 than it wouldnt be having problems syncing...please explain what you mean here

            what i mean is the webpage "myphone" will pick up and sync with my mobile phone (touch hd) and therefore i have contacts on the myphone website. but i cannot get anything to connect to the myphone webpage, so i can't move my contacts from anywhere to the
 windows live contacts list, and vice-versa.<br />
<br />
i have email contacts on hotmail, and mobile details on my mobile phone. i want to join the two together.

            yeah, if they did that then half the complaints on this forum wouldnt be here LOL. a big problem with these services that msoft is offering lately is that none of them interact with each other even tho they all use the live account system. for instance,
 i have a 25 gig sky drive, 5 gig live mesh, and 200 mb myphone.....why they dont all interact is beyond me or why they all dont link to the same 25 gigs is also beyond me. it seems this would be a good idea, and would really help promote windows mobile, but
 its not to be in the near future im afraid.

<h3> bbqbryan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 MFA Service Settings Question</h2>
                    <p>In O365 MFA If I change the service settings options to no longer allow "Notification through mobile app" what happens to all the users that are already setup with MFA and have chosen to use this method? Does this affect them at all?&nbsp; Do they get prompted
 on the next sign-in to change their authentication method? or Is this just for new setups going forward?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it seems like it's all users or nothing, at least I have been unable to set it for just one user to test.</p>
<p>

            <p>Ok,&nbsp; a short while after the last post a small amount of water had splashed inside the usb, and as a result the samsung repair center said&nbsp; well,&nbsp; water damage&nbsp; we won't do anything about the problem.
</p>
<p>Was rather distraught,&nbsp;&nbsp; phone was pinging everynow and again ( between 2 - 10 secs )&nbsp; except if I took the charger off in a particular ( random ) way.</p>
<p>Wouldn't connect to Zune,&nbsp; usb not recognised,&nbsp; I was getting distraught,&nbsp; anyhow,&nbsp; after a while,&nbsp; zune started seeing the phone again,&nbsp;&nbsp; pinging slowed down and is not so common,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I bought a usb jig.&nbsp; 10 euros&nbsp;&nbsp; delivered next working day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plugged it in... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>download mode..&nbsp;&nbsp; patched with samsung update. </p>
<p>then&nbsp; zune updated... </p>
<p>now all up to date. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still pings a bit,&nbsp; but fairly sure that will sort itself out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so&nbsp; now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where is my mango :)</p>

            Make sure you have https at the beging of the URL. At the same time you can try opening the file directly from the sharepoint site and see if that allows to sign-in.

            <p>thanks for the reply, yes I have the HTTPS and the URL can be accessed directly from a browser, also, I have now been able to access the site via excel, but word and powerpoint are still returning the error, I've now tried removing office, and reinstalling,
 but the error persists with Word and Powerpoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Excel, I completely removed the existing connections and then was able add an additional sharepoint site to the default that was coming up, and it prompted me for individual credentials, however word and powerpoint don't do this, wiht the same sequence
 of troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>I've received this error as well. I had to delete my kerberos tickets via Keychain Access.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch Keychain Access (/Applications/Keychain Access.app/)</li><li>Click "Keychain Access" in the menu</li><li>Click "Ticket Viewer"</li><li>Delete any and all tickets listed</li><li>Restart the Office app and you should be good</li></ol>
<p>At least that's what solved mine and several others problems.</p>
