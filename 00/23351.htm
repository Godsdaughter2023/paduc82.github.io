<p>Word Online does not have a feature to create a new envelope from a template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create an envelope document in desktop Word and save it to OneDrive, where you can open it in Word Online and edit it as needed. You must put some mailing address into the original document, because Word Online can't show you the frame that holds
 the address if the frame is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my test, the envelope didn't print correctly -- the addresses were rotated 180 degrees from where they should appear, so the return address wasn't on the envelope at all, and only part of the mailing address printed upside-down at the bottom of the envelope.
 Since Word Online has nothing related to mailing at all, it also lacks the dialog to tell it which way the envelope should feed. If you're really determined to use Word Online for envelopes, you'll have to experiment with how it communicates with your printer.</p>

            I suspect the links are interpreted based on the language selected as the Windows default. But it's also bizarre that the link includes "en-us," which would lead one to expect an English title.

<h2>            Nokia 515 - Remove preinstall apps</h2>
                    <p>
Hello,</p>
<p>
im new in the forum. So i have a problem with Nokia 515. I know its an old phone but its my favorite and i dont like smartphones. Anyway i tried a lot of methods to get rid off preinstalled apps (facebook, whatsapp etc) and i couldnt remove them. I tried the
 method with BlueFTP and MiniComander. I tried with NSS (nokia software service) and with a lot of other programms in windows (MobiMB, phoenix etc) . Apps are in the firmware. I want to try to modify firmware but its too difficult to find a programm to do that.</p>
<p>
Anybody knows how to remove them or how to modify firmware?????</p>
<p>
Its not that they are bother me but some apps are connecting all the time to internet and my battery getting low all the time. Apart from this some of the apps cant be used anymore because they are not supported by the companies. I cant disable them and i cant
 stop them. Anyone knows anything?</p>
<p>
thanks</p>

    <title>Weird table behaviour in PPT - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Weird table behaviour in PPT</h2>
                    
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I found something weird in PPT 2010. When working with a presentation in compatibility mode and rotating text in tables by 90° this table is converted to a picture... Checking for issues provides the information can not be edited in earlier versions...</p>
<p>When changing the text direction to vertical (requires FarEast keyboard enabling) this is not happening...</p>
<p>On top of that the other (new) functions like 270° are grreyed out, like they are supposed to be in compatibility mode...</p>
<p>Is this a known bug?</p>
<p>Why is this opportunity not greyed out in compatibility mode?</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help!!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It is weird that Rotate all 270 and Stacked are disabled when you open a PPT in compatibility mode. You could convert it to PPTX which enabled those two again and then use those commands. Then you can save back to PPT.</p>

            Hi Shyam, Many thanks for your response, but I was under the impression that Office 2010 use compatibility mode to control the exchange of content between each program and its earlier version to ensure maximum quality for sharing content between different
 versions. My question is why are some features correctly "disabled" while others are not... When I do the round trip pptx, employ a feature which is not supported in 2003, then during a transition phase all 2003 users can not edit the content... A table should
 be editable...:-(

<h2>            Printing question re&#58; Pivot table report filter</h2>
                    <p>Hello all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to keep the report filter on a pivot table visible but prevent it from being part of the printout? I Know I could hide those rows that include the report filter lable but that would become tedious as I will be printing quite often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, there is no in-built option to prevent the report filters from being printed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you may follow the workaround given below and see if it helps:</p>
<p>Select the area that you need to print &gt; go to Page Layout tab &gt; Print Area &gt; Select Print Area. This will allow you to avoid the report filters while printing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, you might need a macro to hide the rows that include the report filter.</p>

    <title>Problems with line chart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macca28  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with line chart</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: left">
<p>(error with X and Y axis in earlier post now corrected)</p>
<p>I am trying to do a simple line chart to plot sales of apartments in 2 different apartment blocks (block D and block E)&nbsp;over the last 20 years or so on one chart with 2 lines - one each for D sales and one for E sales, over the time period.</p>
<p>I entered the data in a table as follows</p>
<p>column 1 "Block no. D or E"</p>
<p>column 2 "Date of sale"</p>
<p>column 3 "Sales price"</p>
<p>I then sorted the data by column 1 (so I have all the D and E sales data separately grouped) and column 2 (so sales are sorted chronologically within each apartment block)</p>
<p>The period over which sales were recorded is slightly different - the first sale in D was in 1994 and the last in 2015; however the first sale in E was in 1997 and the last in 2013.&nbsp; So the range of dates is different between each apartment block.</p>
<p>I tried to do a line chart showing sales in block E by selecting E sales as the series 1 data and plotted this against the date of sale on the horizontal X axis.&nbsp; The chart seems to be OK.
</p>
<p>Then I tried to do a similar but separate &nbsp;plot of sales in block D on the same chart using the&nbsp;D sales as the series 2 data and plotting this data against the date of sale on the same horizontal X axis.</p>
<p>A problem occurs here - the D sales figures do not accurately plot&nbsp;against the timeline - the D&nbsp;first sale, which should have been 1994 is actually showing as 1997, the date of the first sale in block E.</p>
<p>If I change things around and I plot D sales as series 1 (with first sale in 1994) , then E sales are shown incorrectly on the date axis - with the first sale (which should be 1997) showing as 1994.</p>
<p>It is as if the chart is ignoring the timeline altogether and is plotting all sales against whatever the timeline is for the series 1 data.</p>
<p>Appreciate it if you could advise on where I am going wrong.&nbsp; Or is it not possible in XL to chart 2 sets of data on the same chart if the datelines are different?</p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any software/hardware changes or any new updates installed after which the issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run Internet Explorer in No Add-Ons mode to determine whether the issue is caused by an add-on.</span></p>

<p><span>If the issue doesn’t persist in No Add-Ons mode then, use the Manage Add-ons tool in Internet Explorer to individually disable each add-on to determine

            Hi Nicolai,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if there are any pending updates or if the pro pen is not properly calibrated. I understand how annoying it is when things do not work as expected. Follow the articles below and check. Refer to "What can I do to fix the pen if it stops

                    <p>I can't get any video on the latest version of skype and there are no tools or files that you could go thru in the older version, the thing is there was no box to select the latest version or stay with the old, it just opened with the latest version and
 I have no video or a tools box to try and fix it. if something is not broke it should be left alone</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>What do you use Skype on? (tablet, laptop, smart phone, etc.)</span></li><li><span>What is its operating system?

<p>You are more than likely using the Skype App. Below is what I do to view my version and get to my settings in the Skype App.&nbsp; As you can see I am using Skype 12.13.257.0, which is currently the latest Skype App release. I am also running the latest Windows
 10 release which is the Fall Creators Update - Version 1709 (16299.xxx). If you find you are running Skype 8.x that appears somewhat similar to this version, then your Windows 10 is severely outdated.</p>

<h2>            Action Buttons copied from one form to another do not take event code, only the button.</h2>
                    
<p>I am teaching a year 11 GCSE class.&nbsp; I have an administrator account on our network, the class have pupil accounts.</p>
<p>When I create a new form and add a button using the wizard to close the form for example, I can copy and paste this button to another form and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>When the class do this, the button is pasted into the new form but there is no event detail associated with it when I check the event properties of the button.</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp; They are following the exact same procedure to create the button and then copy and paste it but with different results.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>Assuming that by event procedures you're talking VBA&nbsp;code, I've never known any version of Access that copied the code with the controls.&nbsp;However, if you're&nbsp;using embedded macros, then it should work as you desire.</p>

<h2>            OneNote 2010 - reporting and managing permissions</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have 2 questions regarding one note</p>
<p><br />
1st question:</p>
<p>I am storing emails in onenote to create an archive. I have them stored on a weekly basis. I want to produce some kind of reports. For examples based on subject line, time/date received and sent. Is this possible through onenote 2010. Can i export data somehow
 to an excel?</p>

<p>2nd question:</p>
<p>I know you can passwd protect sections in onenote. Is it possible to hide sections like you can hide sheets in excell? For example control what the other user sees, incase we are sharing the same notebook? And is it possible to make certain sections, read
 only? For instance i just want the users to open templates but not make any changes or delete them?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Please let me know how i can acheive this.</p>
<p>TH</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<p>Hi SSJRAYDEN,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the OneNote 2010, here are the answers:</p>
<p><br />
1st question:</p>
<p>It is not feasible to export data or reports from OneNote 2010 to an Excel file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd question:</p>
<p>We can't hide the sections directly or set any certain sections in Read-only mode.
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are two articles for your reference:</p>
<p>1.<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-notebooks-in-OneNote-2010-b40c89c5-abf5-4976-8616-0168cac104ed?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Share notebooks in OneNote 2010</span></a></p>
<p>2.<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/830047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to import and export information in OneNote</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have any further queries about the Office 2010 client usability, we suggest you post a new thread on
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?forum=officeitproprevious%2Cofficesetupdeployprevious&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=onenote+2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>These apps aren't written by MS but by third parties. In the case of the Apps you're talking about it might be worth emailing those companies telling them you want a Windows Mobile App from them. Alaskaair as an example have written and published their own
 app.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 - Auto changing an email Salutation of a Name to email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjhokie13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Auto changing an email Salutation of a Name to email address</h2>
                    My company just forced an Office 365 2016 update. &nbsp;Since then, when I begin to write an email and start with a name greeting (ex: Jason, or John,) it brings up a list and autocorrects this to an email address or numerous email address in the body of the
 email, and then includes those emails in the TO line. &nbsp;I believe this is a glitch with the useless @mentions function. &nbsp;I am NOT starting any emails with @, just a name. &nbsp;And it is extremely cumbersome to delete 3 or 4 times before it stops trying to auto
 change it. &nbsp;Especially with a common name such as "John". &nbsp;I will type just that first name, and suddenly &nbsp;it changes to 15 email addresses in the body and then adds all those unwanted recipients to the TO line. &nbsp; Help please! &nbsp;I have been able to find any
 legit answers to this issue anywhere on the web or these forums.

<h2>            Nokia 2730 Classic - downloading to PC</h2>
                    
<p>I have just bought a USB cable so that I can downoad images from my wife's Nokia 2730 Classic. When I plugged in the phone to the computer Windows apparently installed the appropriate driver, but the phone didn't appear in Vista's My Computer as I expected.
 What am I doing wrong?</p>

<h2>            Justified Text Problem in Publisher2010</h2>
                    Publishing a 24 page document and importing text from Word by copy and paste.<br />
<br />
Using 3 columns of justified text on A4 size document.<br />
<br />
From time to time I need to change spacing between paragraphs.&nbsp; When I use 'Enter' command to increase spacing between paragraphs, the previous paragraph's last line correct spacing is corrupted.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />

<b>Before spacing is adjusted</b>:&nbsp; (approx - can't exactly 'justify' here)<br />

            Sadly, no.<br />
<br />
It is alittle bit more complicated than that.<br />
<br />
I have tried changing to all the other alignments, 'Left', 'Right' 'Centred' and so on - all to no avail.&nbsp; When I go back to 'Justified' the error remains.<br />

            <p>If I hit just Enter at the end of the paragraph&nbsp;then the text does not try to justify across the entire width of the text box. It remains left justified.&nbsp;I can replicate your issue&nbsp;by using Shift + Enter at the end of the paragraph with the text formatted
 to justify. Those few words will stretch out to fill the width of the text box. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again I don't understand why can't just use&nbsp;Enter instead of Shift + Enter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have some good reason for using Shift + Enter at the end of a paragraph, then the one work around is to select that justified text on that line and left justify it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might want to show special characters Ctrl + Shift + Y and you will be able to see the paragraph and 'soft return' symbols which might make it easier to format.</p>

            Remember when I select 'Enter' the paragraph is properly 'justified'.<br />
<br />
If I attempt to select just the last line and 'left align' it, the whole paragraph goes into left alignment so that will not work.<br />
<br />
It does not matter whether I select 'Shift+ Enter' or just 'Enter' the symptoms described remain exactly the same.<br />
<br />
Ctrl+shift+Y allows no further or corrective control.<br />

Looks like one for Microsoft ....<br />

Sorry then, I get different results than you. If all the text in the paragraph is formatted to "justify' then I can simply key Enter at the end of the paragraph and the text on that line will remain left justified. If I hit Shift + Enter then the words 'justify'
 across the text box. You apparently get different results...I don't know why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck...maybe someone else will have a different answer.</p>

<h2>            What if your free activation dies&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I participated in the Windows 10 Insider program from the beginning using VirtualBox on my Mac. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thrilled when it came out that Insiders would automatically get the final version and it would be activated. &nbsp;That successfully happened and I enjoyed the release version of Windows 10 for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I had a hard drive problem and the drive image became corrupted... &nbsp;I was under the impression from something I heard on Windows Weekly that my activation was stored with my Microsoft account. &nbsp;So I downloaded the final version and signed in with my
 credentials, but that didn't work, I still need a number to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a lifelong Mac user and this was the first version of Windows I ever owned. &nbsp;So I take it that my only option now to have Windows 10 would be to purchase it... correct? &nbsp;</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>I participated in the Windows 10 Insider program from the beginning using VirtualBox on my Mac. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thrilled when it came out that Insiders would automatically get the final version and it would be activated. &nbsp;That successfully happened and I enjoyed the release version of Windows 10 for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I had a hard drive problem and the drive image became corrupted... &nbsp;I was under the impression from something I heard on Windows Weekly that my activation was stored with my Microsoft account. &nbsp;So I downloaded the final version and signed in with my
 credentials, but that didn't work, I still need a number to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a lifelong Mac user and this was the first version of Windows I ever owned. &nbsp;So I take it that my only option now to have Windows 10 would be to purchase it... correct? &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Insiders</strong> <em>must also have a qualifying upgrade OS installed for a free Win10 license</em>--or--maintain an unbroken activation in the Insider program.&nbsp; If you don't have a qualifying OS, and your Win10 license activates because you are
 in the Insiders program, then if you <em>lose your activation for any reason</em> (drive failure, reinstall, etc.) you *do
<em>not</em> have a permanent Win10 license* sitting on a Microsoft activation server and will be unable to activate.&nbsp; You only get a permanent license if and when you upgrade from a
<em>qualifying OS installation (Win7/8.1) to a<strong> like license in Win10</strong></em>--ie 32-bit Win7/8.1 gets you 32-bit Win10; an OEM Win7/8 license gets you gets you an OEM Win10 license--a retail Win7/8 install allows you to upgrade to a *retail* license
 of Win10, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I'm pretty sure I read that a vbox install of Windows 7/8 does <em>
*not*</em> qualify as an upgradable OS, but I am not 100% sure on that point.&nbsp; (Lots of people used vboxes during the pre-release Win10 Insider Preview period as a means of installing and testing Win10, but as of build 10130 or so everything changed as per
 activation particulars.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To receive the Microsoft license sitting on Microsoft's activation servers for RTM or later you must:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1)</strong> Install an upgradable version of Win7/8.1, <strong>activate it</strong>, then install the free Windows 10 upgrade on top of your activated Win7/8.1 install, which automatically builds an internal license key from your upgrade OS activation,
 and that in turn sits on Microsoft's activation servers and activates you during the Win10 upgrade process.&nbsp; (Win10 activation uses the
<em>upgrade OS activation</em> to build the internal activation key for Win10, and only Microsoft has this Win10 activation key on their servers.&nbsp; If you do not activate your key on the<em> OS you are upgrading, prior to upgrading to Win10,
</em>you will <em>not</em> receive your free Win10 license until this requirement is met.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2)</strong> After you have completed (1) above and <em>Windows 10</em> is activated,
<strong>then, and only then</strong>, can you <em>clean install a new copy of Win10
</em>which will activate automatically from Microsoft's activation servers (into a virgin drive partition or else into a virgin vbox--<em>if that's allowed</em>.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again., you must have a <em>qualifying OS installed to upgrade to Win10</em> whether you are in the Insiders program or you're not--makes no difference.&nbsp; Microsoft never intended to create a situation in which all one had to do to get Win10 free was to join
 the Insider's Preview...;)&nbsp; The benefits people get by remaining in the Insider program at present are earlier looks at builds &amp; features long before they make it to retail product distribution through Win Update.&nbsp; For some people that is no perk at all...for
 others it's the Holy Grail...:D</p>

<em>*not*</em> qualify as an upgradable OS, but I am not 100% sure on that point.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A qualifying OS in a vm is an upgradable OS.&nbsp; There is a problem that prevents Windows 8 from being upgraded to 8.1 if it is running in a vm (8.1 must be clean installed in a vm), but that does not apply to upgrading a vm from 8.1 once 8.1 is there.&nbsp; My
 8.1 vm has got the GWX app in the notification area but I don't plan to make the reservation because I want to stay in touch with 8.1 for a while longer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some interesting issues with <em>device activation </em>(Windows 10) versus
<em>software activation </em>(pre-Windows 10 versions of Windows).&nbsp; For example, we can now multi-boot without needing separate licenses for each instance of Windows 10.&nbsp; But that raises interesting scenarios, such as what happens if you are multi-booting Home
 and decide to upgrade to Pro?&nbsp; Will all instances of Windows on the same device have to be the same edition?&nbsp; Who knows so far?&nbsp; But Home and Pro have different generic product keys under the GWX program so the answer is "probably."&nbsp; Upgrading from Home to
 Pro is done through Add Windows Features so how will that work in a multi-boot scenario?&nbsp; And that is just the beginning.&nbsp; I doubt that Microsoft has tested these scenarios because they don't generally think in terms of multi-booting at MSFT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are still bugs in the installation that prevent bypassing the product key page (something that has been available since Windows XP SP3).&nbsp; When I set up my dual boot setup I clean installed the second instance of Windows 10 Pro on my test box which
 is already running a fully qualified and activated Windows 10 Pro on the primary partition.&nbsp; I should have been able to do the clean install without entering a product key, but the bug prevented it.&nbsp; I had to enter the generic key just to get the installation
 to proceed and then contact Support to get the second instance of Windows 10 Pro activated.&nbsp; I had to go through a couple of levels of support to get a tech who could do it, but I got activated without any hassle at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose I could have x64 on the
 primary and x86 on the secondary, as long as I used the same edition.</p>

            <p>As I said, I had a fully activated final version of Windows 10. &nbsp;It activated just a few days prior to the general release date, just as everyone else was experiencing in the Insider program. &nbsp;It was no longer a preview build. &nbsp;It behaved exactly as every
 news source widely said it would. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as leaving the Insider program, I have not, but I see no way back in. &nbsp;I can find no links to preview builds any more, there is just the link to the general release version which requires activation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At the general release the only way to become fully activated was to upgrade from the preview 10240 to the final was to do an upgrade using the Media Creation tool on July 29.</p>
<p>Right click start, Command Prompt (Admin), enter slmgr /xpr and hit enter.&nbsp; Mine says my computer is permanently activated.</p>
<p>You have to have upgraded from the technical preview Which may have said activated to the final to get this full activation even though the build is the same number.&nbsp; When fully activated there was no watermark showing the build number.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That's the central problem with "well reported" information on the Internet.&nbsp; Often it is wrong/bad info that gets recirculated&nbsp; a thousand times--but it was just as wrong the one-thousandth repeat as it was the first time...;)&nbsp; "Well reported" often does
 not mean "true," unfortunately.&nbsp; (Which is why unless it comes from the horse's mouth it is wiser to be a skeptic as opposed to a believer.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gabe A. made a statement which was ripped from the context in which he made it and
<em>seemed</em> to say that if you had joined the Insiders Preview then you got a free license to Win10 in perpetuity, simply for having been in the preview program.&nbsp; I read the quote, and I do sympathize somewhat with the people who misread it as it was not
 a very precise statement, actually.&nbsp; However, Gabe A. very quickly restored the context to his quote and clarified it, oh, maybe a half-dozen times after the initial misquote was "widely circulated,"&nbsp; through his public blog and public Tweets.&nbsp; He hadn't considered
 the fact that anyone who wasn't already running Win7/8.1 would be the slightest bit interested in the Win10 Preview program--and his assumption was entirely logical, imo.&nbsp; He immediately clarified and qualified the former quote, as I say, several times...but
 it didn't do that much good because the people who misheard "Join the Preview and get a free license" have insisted that is what he said, notwithstanding the half-dozen or so times he corrected the misapprehension
<em>since</em>.&nbsp; It's a great lesson in human nature and how <em>people very often hear only what they want to hear
</em>and tune out the rest of it...;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>No reflection on you...I also believed as you did <em>up to and until</em> Gabe A. clarified the initial statement several times. Being in the Insider Preview program as you were, it isn't apparent you were actually reading Gabe A.'s public Insider blogs
 or his public tweets because if you had been you'd have seen your initial misapprehension corrected more than once--the corrections were also "well reported"--just not well-believed, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like a "fleeting gift" only because it was never actually a gift in the first place...what it has always been is a
<em>free upgrade</em> from Win7/8.1.&nbsp; Not having owned Win7 or Win8.1, it was never going to be free for you in the first place.&nbsp; Entirely understandable, but you heard only what you wanted to hear...;)</p>

<h2>            How to imprve RAM availability in Nokia E72 &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using Nokia E 72 now for more than 2 years but have been having frequent problems with a message saying "Memory Full, Please close some applications and try again" . When I check RAM it tells me that 110 MB of the 120 MB RAM installed in this
 phone is always occupied by phone's own system processes which run in the background. Is there any way the RAM either can be increased or improved so that it is free for applications ? Any idea ?</p>

<p>After a reboot, you should have roughly 40 MB of free ram.&nbsp; If not, which of your programs run automatically at startup?&nbsp; If you manually quit everything you can find (with just the Home and Menu icons remaining on the "Open Apps" list), are you still left
 with ~10 MB free?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, then I think something is still running.&nbsp; Install a copy of NetQin's Mobile Guard from
<a href="http://www.netqin.com/en/guard/symbian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.netqin.com/en/guard/symbian/</a>﻿ .&nbsp; This is a free collection of phone utilities, one of which is "Boot Manager", which lets you disable the auto-start portion of programs.&nbsp; (BTW,
 Mobile Guard also includes a number of "helper" functions, so don't be alarmed if you start seeing pop-up messages during downloads, when installing or removing programs, etc.&nbsp; Most of these can be disabled, or just remove Mobile Guard when you're finished.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other thing I can think of that might eat into your free ram is if you had 10,000 (?) contacts...or some enormous number.&nbsp; Oh, also see if the free ram changes dramatically with the memory card removed.&nbsp; Worst case scenario is that you would need
 to back up your data and hard reset the phone, but let's not be hasty.&nbsp; I hope that helps!</p>

            No, I don't think Contacts is your problem. What you describe certainly shouldn't eat 30 MB. That comment was a guess, but I'd like to think some part of Contacts stays loaded to aid in fast searches, i.e. for caller id on incoming calls. Concentrate on
 finding programs that start automatically.

            Friends, Thank you so much at the outset ! I wish to share some of the measures that I had taken before sharing my problem ! 1. I have Netquin Mgard on my phone and have disabled all autostart programs except Whatsapp ! I keep closing all applications
 at times to see if RAM could be freed but only 20 MB of the 120 MB was found to be free. 2. I have 1600 contacts in my phone and none of them has any image attached to it ! 3. All my messages use SD Card as their memory. My total messages including all folders
 may be above 2000. Could this be the reason ? Is it that these are brought to RAM when I am browsing message folders ? 4. All my applications are also stored in SD Card. 5. All my galary items are also stored in SD Card. Yes I have not cleared the privacy
 data from the web data that I will do ! But my hunch feeling is that internal symbian processes are taking a very high amount of RAM when the phone is operative ! Nonetheless - I am open to all solutions and would be thankful to you all ! N

<p>First, major kudos to you for testing some things first. :)&nbsp; If you reboot your phone, manually quit Whatsapp, then check free ram, how much is there?&nbsp; Still around 20 MB?&nbsp; With all your programs and data stored on the memory card, have you tested removing
 the card, rebooting, and then checking again?&nbsp; (In this case, you will need to briefly install PhoNetInfo to the phone itself.)&nbsp; This seems like a good way to eliminate many items as the cause.&nbsp; You should have close to 40 MB free after a reboot.&nbsp; If the ram
 is suddenly reclaimed, then the cause could be a rogue program or a large database associated with your SMS messages, Gallery files, etc.&nbsp; I would like to think that Symbian loads certain databases into ram to make searches faster...but I really don't know,
 sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem remains, then you know it's caused by something still on the phone.&nbsp; If I were you, I might (very gently) back up my contacts (and back them up
<em>several times</em>, if you want to be totally safe), remove all contacts, and then reboot and check free ram again.&nbsp; When you solve the problem, please post your findings! :)</p>

    <title>Syncing Outlook with Windows Mobile Device Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a33bob33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing Outlook with Windows Mobile Device Center</h2>
                    
<p>Please help.&nbsp; It's probably been asked and answered many times, but this is my first exposure to this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Dell PDA and a new desktop PC running Windows Vista.&nbsp; I want to synch my Outlook calendar, mail, and contacts with the PDA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I lost all my outlook data when the old PC crashed and burned (running ActiveSync with XP on desktop).&nbsp; However, I have most of the data on the PDA, so now I want to push it to the new desktop PC, and stay synced from here on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just installed Outlook on the desktop.&nbsp; It is connected to my gmail account.&nbsp; I can see emails.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I sync with WMDC, the file syncing works great.&nbsp; Not true with the Outlook stuff.&nbsp; I still see contacts, calendar and so forth on the PDA, but nothing in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get my Outlook data from the PDA to the new Outlook, and stay synced from this point forward?</p>

<p>Try removing the partnership on both the device and PC.&nbsp; Soft reset the device, reboot the PC then connect and establish a new partnership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would make a backup of the PIM.VOL on your device just to be safe.</p>
