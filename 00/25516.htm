<h2>            In regards to Bing rewards, can I have two accounts feed points into one account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a rewards account with good number of points.&nbsp; However, I want to do something differently and want to open a new account and have the new account feed points into my current account.&nbsp; The reason is I am trying to avoid all of the online tracking
 as it relates to advertising.&nbsp; My new account has the name "TemporaryUser 01" or similar.&nbsp; There is no name associated with this account and I want to keep it that way.&nbsp; I am an older citizen and could care less about advertising and am not interested in having
 anything I do tracked online.&nbsp; It is not that I have anything to hide, but totally relates to all of the pop up ads that are now impossible to stop and all ads period - I DO NOT WANT advertising&nbsp; tracking me!&nbsp; I want to be as invisible as possible while still
 reaping rewards that are available.&nbsp; So, why give up all of the points I already have and stop adding to those points when I should be able to by behind the scenes having Bing marry the points of the two accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that if I am told this cannot be done, there will be 1,000 people asking another question which is:&nbsp; "Why not?&nbsp; They are our points we earned so why can't you feed points from one or more accounts into one account as it is or should be
 an easy matter to do this and it serves your customers best interests and in term of customer focus, you should be doing everything possible to make your customers happy which is the whole point of customer focus and it certainly is possible to do what is
 requested whether you are presently set up to do it or not.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">To answer your query, the points that you earn in Bing Rewards can only be accumulated and redeemed per account. If you signed up for a new Microsoft Account, you need to redeem your points from your old account and opt out from
 Bing Rewards so you can continue earning points on the new account.</p>

            <p>Sorry and I do not mean to be critical or hard but apparently you did not read my entire message.&nbsp; I am referring to the following paragraph:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Please understand that if I am told this cannot be done, there will be 1,000 people asking another question which is:&nbsp; "Why not?&nbsp; They are our points we earned so why can't you feed points from one or more accounts into one account as it is or should be
 an easy matter to do this and it serves your customers best interests and in term of customer focus, you should be doing everything possible to make your customers happy which is the whole point of customer focus and it certainly is possible to do what is
 requested whether you are presently set up to do it or not.&nbsp; Thank you!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a matter of policy and not programming for I know it can be programmed but is not and to date there has been, apparently, a policy against this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, would you, or someone else please explain why the system cannot be changed, i.e., the policy changed to allow users to combine the points we have earned from different accounts.&nbsp; There are a good number of reasons for having more than one account.&nbsp;
 Why should I lose the points I have accumulated since Day 1 in Bing Rewards because I have a new account when it can be programmed to combine 2 or more account points into one other account?&nbsp; It is a matter of first changing the policy and then secondly, changing
 the programming and should not be all that complicated.&nbsp; All you have to do is create an option in settings to "Combine Points from Various Accounts" and once we click on that, there would be a space following "List the first account from which you want to
 move points."&nbsp; After we list that account, the next link would be one of these two:</p>
<p>Do you have other accounts from which you wish to combine points?&nbsp; If the person clicks yes, the same page comes up again only with the spaces blank.&nbsp; IF they answer NO, then a page could come up with a single question, "What account do you want your points
 combined into?" and of course following that, we would enter the account name.&nbsp; The last question would be simply, "Are you finished combining points?" and when we answer YES, then "bam, bam, thank you - The Bing Wizard has combined your points as requested.&nbsp;
 Click here to see your total points in your combined account."&nbsp; And upon clicking the link we would be taken to a page showing the proper account name with the total of our combined accounts.&nbsp; Hard?&nbsp; Hardly think so!&nbsp; Think the hardest thing will be the policy
 change and often, research has shown, it is not a matter of being a difficult task, but rather it is a difficult matter of changing management's mind even when there is no reasoning for not doing the suggested changes.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when a company really has "Customer
 focus" as a goal, then satisfying customers is the Number 1 goal and NOTHING EVER gets in the way of satisfying that goal and thus if you are making a change to make customers happy and you are customer focused, it is then just a matter of doing the work to
 make the programming changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, again, I ask, how soon can my accounts be combined?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, perhaps I should ask whether or not, Microsoft&nbsp;as it relates to the product called "Bing" is a Customer Focused company?&nbsp; If the answer is "YES", then the question simply becomes:&nbsp; How soon can the accounts be combined?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Loraine, in all sincerity, why exactly would I want to go to Bing Ads Support for answers to the questions about Bing Rewards accounts being combined?&nbsp; You completely lost me with your response and as I said in my earlier reply:&nbsp; "Sorry but I do not mean
 to be critical or hard, . . . " and I really did not intend to upset you but I gather from your response that you were highly upset when you answered me.&nbsp; I know what you tried to tell me in your first response, but again, you dealt with policy and I am asking
 about a logical change to the Bing Rewards system that would enable folks to use ALL of their points regardless of whether one has one account or for whatever reasons, a multitude of accounts.&nbsp; Suppose, for an example, using Bing rewards, I could obtain a
 new Ford Taurus SHO vehicle.&nbsp; I do not have enough points in anyone of my several accounts but by combining all of the accounts and thus, ALL of the points I have legitimately earned, I could get the vehicle so explain please why Bing would even want to refuse
 to allow us to combine all of our points to obtain a reward when there are insufficient points in any one accounts but sufficient points in multiple accounts by combining points and again, I understand how the program was initially setup but from time to time,
 all companies must address how they first established their business and make changes to those policies and etc. to better address the needs of customers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, are you just telling us all that no matter what the customer needs are, the rules are the rules and no matter what, Bing refuses to address anything that would make matters better for the customer without harming Bing?&nbsp; Frankly I would find it extremely
 difficult to believe that Bing/Microsoft would be so hard set that they would flat refuse to address customer needs when meeting those needs would only mean a change in present policy without any added costs to the company.&nbsp; IF that is true, that would be
 a very sad situation and I just do not believe that Bill Gates would establish any company with that type of narrow minded outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement#14eiii_BingRewards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>These accounts are you and any member living in your household; not 5 accounts for you only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is your daily allotted points and this is per person:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earn up to 150 points per month, 5 points per hour, for actively browsing with Microsoft Edge. Counter updates daily.</p>
<p>Earn up to 150 points per day, 5 points per search on PC. Start with US news.</p>
<p>Earn up to 100 points per day, 5 points per search on mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use two accounts you are cheating and the additional credits are above the daily allowance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As Lorraine stated earlier, you may Redeem the credits in the Old Account then close the account in order to begin accumulating points in the new account. If you don't follow these steps, you stand a chance of having your account(s) closed.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I apologize to all but it seems to me that the two of you so far have assumed I am trying to defeat or cheat the system which is absolutely untrue.&nbsp; So, again, for clarity, let me state the situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a Bing rewards account since it, the program,&nbsp;&nbsp;was first introduced.&nbsp; I have just obtained a new computer and I do not wish to be lead to products thru a scheme developed presumably by Google and now used by many advertisers on the net to attempt
 to get me to buy certain specific products.&nbsp; I will buy what I want to buy from whomever I decide to purchase from and do not wish to receive popup ads from anyone.&nbsp; As such, with my new computer, I set the user up under a different name.&nbsp; I intend now to
 use that name whenever I am on line to help avoid advertising.&nbsp; Please also let me state here and now that my new system as well as the old system were set up to avoid being tracked by anyone for any reason.&nbsp; This has NOTHING to do with law enforcement and
 they may check my system, if they have reason, whenever they wish but in regards to advertising, I do not want it.&nbsp; I set my systems up to block pop up ads but now some genius has developed a method to "provide" (very poor choice of words) pop up ads even
 when the user is set up to block pop up ads.&nbsp; IF they do not know what sites I go to, they don't know what to advertise to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, in addition to the new system, I also am having to encounter all new software so that I am not only learning the system but the software and as of yet, even after nearly two months do not have my new system set up with a file saving basis I wish to
 have as again I am still learning not only Windows 10 but also Office 365 which includes both Excel 2016 and Word 2016.&nbsp; At the point where I believe I know enough I will move on by establishing my filing system for all of my files hopefully in the most efficient
 manner possible.&nbsp; At that time, I will either use the new name I have chosen or adopt yet another name which will again require signing that name up for Bing rewards.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point in time for reasons too long that prevent me from going into them I am going online under one of two names, both of which are registered for Bing rewards.&nbsp; At a point in time in the future, I will decide upon using either my original name registered
 with Bing under to earn Bing rewards or a the name I am now using or even yet another name which will result in either 2 or three different accounts under which I have legally gathered points in the bing reward system.&nbsp; At that point in time, I will wish to
 combine all of my points into one single account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is wrong with my doing what I am doing aside from the fact that Bing may view it as a violation of the rules, which honestly I did not know existed in regards to how many accounts can gather points registered to one person.&nbsp; I am not doing this to avoid
 a rule which again I did not know existed that prevents one form earning too many points in one day or total (not clear on that at this point) and it is unlikely that on any one day I will go online under more than one name that is earning Bing rewards so
 in truth I will not from that standpoint, earn too many points or in excess of what the rules say I can earn.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But let me ask this if I might and I am sure everyone reading this dissertation is now wondering the same, what is wrong with earning more than points that any certain number or why was the rule created in the first place unless it was to avoid people logging
 in and off repeatedly in order to earn points.&nbsp; So what if I earn 5,000 points in one given day as long as I am legitimately doing my business of going online and searching for information.&nbsp; I am a person who loves to learn and I often go online and do research
 on specific topics from time to time and when I am doing so, I will always copy and paste the information either into Excel or Word so that I may have a permanent copy of the information.&nbsp; IF that is all I am doing and I happen to earn a whole slew of points
 today, why does Bing care in the first place?&nbsp; And in addition, once I determine which name I am going to use to go online, why does Bing have a problem with combine the points from my various accounts that I have legitimately earned while doing my business
 which I have outlined herein?&nbsp; Why does bing care how many points anyone earns?&nbsp; I just do not understand this policy at all and further I am not sure the two of you recognize that any policy is but a guideline and not an engraved in stone rule!&nbsp; There is
 nothing anywhere which says a policy is a rule and they should never be confused as being one in the same as any student of business should know and readily recognize and therefore if the policy says you cannot earn points on Tuesdays, there is
</p>
<p>nothing that says that policy cannot be changed and therefore what is the problem with reviewing a policy of the rewards program and discussing changing of said policy if it makes your customers happier, which after all should be the goal of your entire
 being in regards to Bing?&nbsp; Or in other words, there seems to be a huge amount of concern over the request to combine legitimately earned points from legitimate accounts into one single account and I for one, simply do not understand that at all and am therefore
 just asking for clarification and not attempting to start a war or anything else.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, I am a legitimate account holder that some time after beginning, found a need to develop a new user name and therefore open a new account which earns points and since I have earned some points in my original account and now have need to have
 a different account, what is wrong with taking my points from the first or original account and putting them into the account I now intend to use?&nbsp; That is all I am asking for is clarification on what is wrong with that request, rules/policies aside, or please
 tell me from the standpoint outside of the rules and/or policies what is wrong with combining my points?&nbsp; I am simply asking for too much?&nbsp; Or is it that no one today has an answer for the question and therefore you wish to avoid the question by using some
 vague rule or policy?&nbsp; I know I am getting under you skin but I sincerely do not wish to do so but just wish to get an answer to the question.&nbsp; IF you do not believe me, look at my history which you can easily do and you will see I am not here to cause problems
 but just to learn and understand and if I cannot get an answer to my question which I persistently have been seeking, I cannot understand which is like having an open sore to me.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
With regard to your concern you may check your emails in your deleted folders, if emails are not there please follow the steps below to recover your emails:<br />
<br />
<span>1. In the left pane of the Hotmail window, click the
<b>Deleted </b>folder, scroll to the bottom of the window<br />
2. Then click recover <b>deleted messages</b>.<br />
3. Hotmail will recover as many messages as possible and put them in your <b>
Deleted</b> folder. If you don't see the deleted messages that you wanted, it means they are permanently lost.<br />
<br />
When the recovered messages are back in your <b>Deleted</b> folder, you should move the important ones back to your inbox or personal folders because the
<b>Deleted</b> folder gets cleaned out periodically.<br />
<br />

    <title>Default language issues with 365 Business - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom rennell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default language issues with 365 Business</h2>
                    <p>I have seen this problem occur for a number of other users and the easiest opption for fixing it seems to be coming here to try and get someones attention so they can fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, when the company office 365 account was first set-up it was set-up in Chinese. This means that it automatically becomes the default language for everything and it is impossible to change. The whole account needs to be started again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can one of the Microsoft Admin people please contact me about this? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are attempting to test 365 with a view to potentially moving our compay over to it, but so far the experience has not been good at all, and the support awful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I welcome any help someone can give me to fix what should be an easily fixable issue.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>After involving more resource, the automated mail, app language, site language should be handled by different settings. We normally suggest our customers to post one issue in each thread, so that our support engineers can help to further investigate a specific
 issue and provide assistance. This will benefit the community members if they're looking for answers based on the title. Since the issue you're encountering is happening on different places, we will focus on the language on automated emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post a new thread for Project language issue and Office Online apps language. The reason is that the two other issue might have a different root cause. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>For the automated email language, we just want to confirm again whether the automated mail issue persists after you followed our steps above on changing the Preferred Language. Because, based on our test, we can change the language of automated emails by
 doing so. We tried to reset a user's password and send the details via email and that email is on the language that we selected as expected. You can see from the screenshot below that Microsoft sends all communications to your organization based on the language
 selected.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<h3> jerryherbert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text disappears from email when Paragraph Marks hidden</h2>
                    <p>I have had several emails sent as new or replied to, and when the recipients get my email, only the signature appears. &nbsp;By default, my email &nbsp;compose / reply window (HTML format which I need) appears with the Show/Hide formatting showing the paragraph marks.
 &nbsp;If I compose here, all the text appears with some type of dotted appearance as this screenshot shows.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe5dc5e5-e76e-4329-9387-2a9b115457c3" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If i hide the formatting, the whole text disappears. &nbsp;If I try to create or reply to email and first turn off the formatting, it once in a while will appear but most times it will not show the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send it, the recipient does not see the text. &nbsp;Based on other posts, accelerated graphics is not on (was never on), the text color is automatic, the font type was changed to something else and back again, and I am a full admin to my PC. &nbsp;I cannot
 find anything on point where this occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a brand new PC running 64-bit Windows 8.1 fully patched on 5/19/2015 and no pending updates showing as of now. &nbsp;I have the entire Office 2013 Professional Plus suite installed with updates downloaded and installed automatically. &nbsp;Office reports Version
 15.0.4719.1002, and Outlook reports:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f64956c5-97a0-4eb6-9bc9-bd1575cdeaaf" /></p>
<p>There is plenty of memory available (16GB+ free), and I have the reply to pop out to a separate window automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If anyone has encountered this, or can point me to something on-point that my searching has failed to locate, I would greatly appreciate your help!</span></p>

    <title>Strange clicking happening in OneNote. Problem with tablet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Strange clicking happening in OneNote. Problem with tablet&#63;</h2>
                    I have a tablet installed on my computer to take notes on OneNote. However, when I have my tablet plugged in as my laptop booted up, OneNote seems to hold a left-click and begins selecting an area when I click somewhere on the note area with my USB mouse.
 Currently my only fix is to restart OneNote. Does anyone know what's going on here?

No, I'm not running it under compatibility mode. What do you mean by repairing?

    <title>Office Pro Plus 2013 Activation Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rachellxy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Pro Plus 2013 Activation Issue</h2>
                    <p>I have been struggling to activate my Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 the past few days. I was supposed to have a call with a higher technician to deal with this issue today at 3pm Singapore time (GMT +8) but the call did not come (Service request:
 1303071279).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89afdb27-ade0-4f48-9fa9-e8818f4d902b" /></p>
<p>This activation wizard keeps popping out whenever I open an Office product (Word, Powerpoint, Excel) and counting down the number of days I have left. It started about a week or two ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3b2abba-c9d0-466a-8247-b204c74ee0f2" /></p>
<p>I found it weird that every time I go to the 'Account' page after I click 'File', there will be a clickable link telling me that my product is activated and a yellow box below telling me that my product is not activated. When I try to type in my product
 key, the pop out box (for me to type the product key) disappears and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to search the Internet for solutions again. I found something that showed me how to check the last 5 characters of my product key (just to check if the product I bought has a phony product key).</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30687273-7b87-4493-9b0a-892895308cd4" /></p>
<p>I realised that I have 2/3 Microsoft Office Pro Plus O_O. The first one in this command prompt window shows the last 5 characters of the product key that comes with my online purchase and it says that it is licensed already. The other two are not. I have
 no idea where they came from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office was already installed in my computer and I did not reinstall when I first keyed in the product key from my Office Pro Plus 2013 online purchase. So I would think that this was the issue. However, my brother did not have the same problem
 even though we have the same model of laptop and we used the same product key (we can key in the product key 3 times).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to ask if my assessment that "I do not need to try to activate my Office Pro Plus anymore as &nbsp;I have already done so" is correct? I need to use Office for my school assignments and presentations in the next few weeks so this is quite urgent. Please
 help, thank you!</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
How do you know you have trojans?<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

                    <p>Why with every new build does my fully functioning Realtek High Definition Audio Driver (Digitally signed) get replaced by the non properly functioning Windows High Definition Audio driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens with the latest build (15019) also. I install the Realtek driver and it installed but no sound. Ran troubleshooter but that did not fix problem I then Stopped the Windows Audio and Windows Audio Endstop services and restarted them. Audio now
 working.</p>

            <p>No error messages on screen. I haven't looked elsewhere for any logs at the moment. I have&nbsp;now used the Feedback to report the problem.
</p>
<p>When I run the Realtek installer all appears install OK and at the end of the procedure it asks to do a re-start. After the restart Windows once again installs it's own High Definition Audio Driver. I go to Device Manager/Sound video and game controllers,
 click on the High Definition Audio and then click on Update driver software/Browse my computer for driver software/Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer. The installed Realtek driver is not on that list so I untick the Show compatible hardware
 box and scroll down to the Realtek driver which is now showing and click on the Next button and a warning appears which I ignore and go ahead anyway. The driver now installs and all is well again.</p>

<p>the requestBY: and requestTO: fields are pre-filtered combo/list boxes with the names of the projectTeam (so you cant submit a request for a project to someone who isnt part of the project...) requestBy:&nbsp;is the current user and the requestTO: field is restricted
 to managers(JobID 1).</p>
<p>ive been playing around with it for a while, and i think i have all the realtionships and such set up in a good way, but im not exactly sure how to take advantage of them to get the form to do what i want.</p>
<p>Do i need a query? if so, how sould i set that up? if i can do it by just calling on the appropriate tables how do i work that into the form? (if its vba, where do i put the code? in the request changes button in the project form or on the OnLoad of the
 request form?)</p>
<p>sory its alot in one question, i know what i want it to do im just not sure how to get it to do that.</p>

<div>Hi jacie,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can use the OpenArgs argument of the DoCmd.OpenForm method to pass arguments to the form as you open it. Then write code in the form's Open event to populate the controls you want prepopulated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>DoCmd.OpenForm "myform", , , , , , CStr(Me!txtProjectID) &amp; "|" &amp; CStr(Me!txtCurrentUser)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Notice that&nbsp;the OpenArgs argument must be a string value, so I wrapped the ProjectID in CStr() to convert it to a string. Notive also that I dlineated the two values by using the pipe character. This allows us to extract each
 value at the other end.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now, in the form's Open event, use code similar to this:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If Len(Me.OpenArgs) &gt; 0 Then</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'OpenArgs exist</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me!txtProjectID = Left(Me.OpenArgs, Instr(1, Me.OpenArgs, "|") - 1)</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me!txtCurrentUser = Mid(Me.OpenArgs, Instr(1, Me.OpenArgs, "|")&nbsp;+ 1)</div>
<div>Else</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No OpenArgs exist</div>
<div>End If</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To prepopulate your combos, you just give them a valid RowSource like you would with any combo.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Does this serve your purposes?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Hi jacie,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Well I just tested it again myself, and it works fine, so the problem must lie elsewhere. Let's do three things:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Firstly, what happens when you&nbsp;type the following into the Immediate Window and press enter:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?Left("abc",2)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Secondly, do you have a control on your form called "txtProjectID"? If not, then change "txtProjectID" to the name of the control containing the project ID. While you're at it, do the same for "txtCurrentUser ".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thirdly, show me the DoCmd.OpenForm line.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Hi jacie,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since your using only a single OpenArgs argument, you need to change the code as follows:</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(Me.OpenArgs) &gt; 0 Then</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'OpenArgs exist</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me!txtProjectID = Me.OpenArgs</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No OpenArgs exist</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</div>

<p>ah, thanks, yes, PID is a primary key, that code worked.</p>
<p>So for the Current user, do i put that GetUserName code into a module and call on it in the open-form? if so..how do i direct it to the txtbox i want it to pre-fill?</p>
<p>also, for the combo-box in the requestTO field, i tried fiiltering to managers by project, but it just gives me everyone who is on any project... Obvioulsly im not filtering correctly.</p>
<p>For the username stuff, do i need to add a field to the employee table matching the username with the employee?</p>

    <title>Setting up tabs for radio drama - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alpha leonis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up tabs for radio drama</h2>
                    I am trying to set Word 2010 up to write a radio drama script, and need to start on L hand side with the name of the character, but then have their speech running in a separate column from a tab stop point around 5.5 cm across the page. I set the tab stops,
 but on the second line of speech it returns to the normal beginning of the line on the left-hand side of the page. Any ideas about how I can set a tab so that I can write speech in a block &nbsp;on one side of the page, while still having the flexibility to put
 the character's names on the L? Do I need to use two columns?
<div>I can't use a scriptwriting package, as this is for the OU and it's not allowed.</div>
<div>All ideas gratefully received, as this is driving me mad! Thank you very much!</div>

            <p>You could create a table with one row and&nbsp;two columns: a narrow left-hand column for the name and a wider right-hand column for the text.</p>
<p>Enter a name in the first cell, then press Tab.</p>
<p>Enter the speech in the second cell. You can create as many paragraphs as you like.</p>
<p>To move to the next character, press Tab again. This will create a new row to enter the name etc. etc.</p>
<p>You can make the table borderless, so that you won't see that there is a table when you print the document.</p>

            <p>While you could use a table as Hans suggests, this is just as easily done with a hanging indent. You can create the indent by dragging the Hanging Indent marker on the ruler or by setting a specific indent in the Paragraph dialog (right-click, choose Paragraph,
 and then choose Hanging under Special in the dialog). Or you can press Ctrl+T once or twice to move the hanging indent to the built-in default tab stops (watch the ruler to see what happens when you do this).</p>
<p>Ideally, you should define a style that has this formatting and apply it to the dialogue, using a different style for stage directions, scene numbers, etc. The List series of built-in styles have hanging indents; you would need to increase the indent amount,
 however, as it is just 0.25" for each level.</p>

<h2>            N95 problem after problem after problem</h2>
                    I decided to get the N95 last december as a little xmas treat for myself little did i know that this phone has been the baine of my life ever since then its broke once already, apperantly i broke the solder points on the board, surley if there weak then
 there not fit for purpose, i took this up with my provider in the end i paid to get this repaired only for it to go again, i've not bothered getting it done since then, then to put the cherry on the top of my love affair with this phone it kept powering down
 and then staying off, i bought a new battery, a new charger but it never stopped it then it switched itself off and wouldnt switch on i took it to my local care centre to be told it has to be sent off but you'll get it repaired for free or a replacement as
 it happens all the time with these i waited for two weeks, called today and was procedded to be told that nokia will not repair it under warranty as its something to do with the board being warped and fualty and thats my fault.Plus the fact i have to pay £20
 to get my phone back how crazy :-(<br />
<br />
After choosing the N95 i wished i had not and i can say that i shall never get another nokia in my life ever, I've spent three hours on line triyng to find contact details and email address of customer care and complaint people but all i find is a generic contact
 us email form.<br />
<br />
I hold no hope for this situation to be sorted and have the possiblity now of a lengthly and costly legal battle over a N95 repair, which i believe should of been done as i believe all parties concerned have broken the<br />
<br />
The Sale and Supply of Goods to Consumers Regulations 2002<br />
<br />
anyway enough of my rant.

            I've got to wait for upto five days to have a response off them before i can take the action further, thats to give them chance to chase the already long chain of paper work raised after that i then can proced with the proposed legal action if i have to.
 Luckly for me and perhaps unlucky for 3 they have a idependant company thats supposed to help in these cases its called otelo so i've been on the phone to them to see if they want to take the case on they aggreded that in some aspects i've not been treated
 as i should. I wil give Nokia there due they have been pretty quick in returning the email i sent the other day and the person who sent it seemed to a least care on whats go on.

            Regardless of the outcome of this mess I hope you do understand that what you've had is just bad luck and possibly bad faith on the part of your network operator. There are many, many satisfied users of N95 handsets&nbsp;− I think they're about the most popular
 handset in the UK now&nbsp;− because it really is an amazing piece of kit.<br />
<br />
Don't let this experience dampen your enthusiasm for the brand as a whole. You could have had equally bad luck with any brand. I still think that Nokia handsets are easiest to use, feature-packed and very well-built on the whole (except when circuit boards
 are warped...)<br />
<br />
Also bear in mind that most people posting to forums like this one are, like you, people who have had problems, so don't let the fact that there are very few
<i>positive</i> postings extolling the virtues of Nokia phones lead you to believe that nobody likes them!

<h2>            Convert Access file developed with Access 2010 in Access 2013 formats&#63;</h2>
                    I recently installed Access 2013 and am having trouble converting my Access files developed with an Access 2010 program to 2013 versions.&nbsp; If I open one of these files using the "Open with" option and select Access 2013 it functions perfectly.&nbsp; However,
 when I save it, the file is saved, with the new data, in the 2010 format.&nbsp; How can I convert the existing Access files from the 2010 format to the 2013 format?

 I will continue using that method since the file browser still cannot find the 2013 Excel program.&nbsp; Thanks Again

 the file with another name or to another location."&nbsp; This is not acceptable.&nbsp; What could the problem be?&nbsp; I used to hit the Save button and the edit was immediately saved without a problem.&nbsp; Thanks for any help.<br />

            Problem solved!&nbsp; I found when I highlight the downloaded photos, then click on Properties, I can unclick Read Only.&nbsp; Then after an edit I can save the change with no problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Now all I have to do is figure out how to avoid having Read Only selected at the time I download.&nbsp; It appears that when I connect my camera to the computer, and select the option to "Open device to view files using Windows Explorer," and then drag the files
 onto the computer, they are automatically set as Read Only.&nbsp; If instead, I select "Import pictures and videos using Windows," then the Read Only option is NOT automatically selected.<br />

<h2>            Proofing and readability - HELP</h2>
                    <p>My Office365 Word 2016 proofing tools are not working as expected. I have two main issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Proofing tools (icons) only show options to check the whole document. Even if only one paragraph or sentence is selected, it checks the entire document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Readability statistics do not show. Yes, the option is ticked in proofing options. They only show when checking the whole document (again the issue above), and only after addressing any grammar/spelling issues (I know it is checking the whole document
 because the issues highlighted are outside of the selected text). If I copy paste the selected text to a new document with no grammar/spelling issues. There is no way to get the readability statistics to show.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Erica,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my test, I can’t reproduce the issues you mentioned in my environment. From your description, it seems that the issue happens in one specific file. Could you confirm it? Meanwhile,
 I’d like you to confirm whether you are using the latest version of the Office 2016 applications. If no, update the version first, restart the computer and then do a test to see the result. Please also upload a full screenshot of the Account page in the Word
 2016 application you are using for our reference.</span></p>
<p><span>Note; Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To address and clarify the issues in your environment more clearly, I’d like you to record a video showing the issue in your environment. I’d like to confirm the detailed reproducing steps

<h3> kmes_7  say:</h3>
<h2>            encoding problem using SQL Server and MS Access &#40;greek-english&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;am using an ODBC connection to link&nbsp;tables from&nbsp;SQL server with&nbsp;MS Access.</p>
<p>The problem is that i use both greek and english characters but the MS Access shows ???? instead of greek characters.</p>
<p>The opposite happens when i am updating the table from MS Access where the characters are displayed from the SQL Server as symbols.</p>
<p>I tried encoding in utf8 and also greek but nothing worked.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>I believe I can fix this problem if UTF-8 encoding is used as I have come accross this before when Japanese characters were used. Hopefully this solution will be of some use to you. This is a common problem when using UTF-8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, ensure that all of your HTML or PHP files are saved in UTF-8 format without BOM (byte order mark)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also have to make sure that your server is sending a UTF-8 header in the response headers.&nbsp; I think (not sure) that ASO's default setup does that, but you will want to examine your response headers either in your browser (use Firefox Inspector if you
 are using Firefox) to make sure you are or verify using a web header viewer.&nbsp; The response header character set declaration is much more important than doing it in the HTML (it is a good idea to do both).&nbsp; If you are not sending a UTF-8 character encoding
 in the response header, you can do that using PHP's header() function or in htaccess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set header character set using PHP header:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p><span><strong>header</strong></span><span><strong>(</strong></span><span><strong>'Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8'</strong></span><span><strong>);</strong></span></p><p /></pre>
<p>Set character set using .htaccess:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p><span><strong>AddDefaultCharset</strong></span><span><strong> UTF</strong></span><span><strong>-</strong></span><span><strong>8</strong></span></p><p /></pre>
<p>Make sure your MySQL server connection collation is set to UTF-8 (I think it should be by default on ASO).&nbsp; Then for every text field inside your database tables ensure the collation/chacter set is set to UTF-8.&nbsp; If you have mangled text inside your database,
 you will have mangled output.&nbsp; Take a quick look at it using phpMyAdmin and see if you have character problems.&nbsp; If you do, you may have to re-import your data or find a way to convert it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that we got that out of the way, make sure you run a "SET NAMES" query <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
before</span> you run any other queries (not tested). </p>
<p>
</p><pre><p><span><strong>mysql_query</strong></span><span><strong>(</strong></span><span><strong>'SET NAMES utf8'</strong></span><span><strong>)</strong></span></p><p /></pre>
<p>PHP recommends using the mysql_set_charset() function to set the character set instead of a SET NAMES query, but since you are doing things the old way it really doesn't matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That last step running the SET NAMES query you may want to try first if you know you are doing everything else mentioned above.</p>

<h2>            Synchronization problem when adding contacts to an existing contact group.  Office Outlook 2010 with Wndowa 10</h2>
                    My problem is adding additional contacts (already in my Outlook 2010 contacts and adress book data) to an established and functional contacts&nbsp;group. &nbsp;When I try to save the updated contac group, I get the following message:&nbsp; "This Contact Group contains
 contacts that have not yet been sent to the server.&nbsp; Press F9 to synchronize your new contacts and then save the Contact Group."&nbsp; The problem is that nothing happens when I press F9 even though I am online, no synchronization takes place.&nbsp; I have also had
 problems synchronizing my Outlook contacts list with my new or updated online Outlook.com e-mail program.&nbsp; It apparentlly does not recognize all of my contacts.&nbsp; How can I correct this problem?
