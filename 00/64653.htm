<h2>            why is there a little green check mark attached to some of my desktop icons in win 8</h2>
                    I recently did a system restore today on my laptop as a quick way of getting rid of all the toolbar addons and **** that has been sneeking past me for the past month or so. Now I have this little green circle with a white check mark in the middle of it
 that has attached itself to a bunch of my desktop icons, and the troubleshooting I've done so far says that these programs/apps are not working properly, why?

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common reason for the check marks (overlay icons) you are describing is that they are used to identify files that have been backed up to an online backup service such as the following.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span>These check marks could also be associated with the Microsoft&nbsp;Skydrive online file service. When a file is placed on your Skydrive space, the check mark is placed on the file.</span></font></p>

<h2>            Xbox one, today is suddenly pixelated</h2>
                    We've been playing games on our xbox one for a couple of years now with great satisfaction, now suddenly today at boot up everything is all pixelated. Its so bad we cannot make out any text to try to adjust settings. We did a hard reboot, we changed the
 HDMI port, to no avail. Has my New XBOX ONE taken the equivalent&nbsp; of the old RED EYE OF DEATH of the Xbox 360 systems.... AAAAGGGGG&nbsp; &nbsp;PLEASE TELL MRE IT AINT SOOOOOO!

<p>Hey Hary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out! We suggest you try a factory reset on your console. Make sure to select the option that allows you to keep your games and apps. I see you are unable to navigate the menus, so try accessing the troubleshooting menu by doing the
 following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.
</li><li>
Wait 30 seconds, and then plug the power cord back in.</li><li>
Press and hold the <strong>BIND</strong> button and the <strong>EJECT</strong> button, and then press the
<strong>Xbox</strong> button on the console. </li><li>
Continue holding the <strong>BIND</strong> and <strong>EJECT</strong> buttons for 10-15 seconds.
</li><li>
Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the <strong>
BIND</strong> and <strong>EJECT</strong> buttons after the second power-up tone.</li><li>
The console should power up and take you directly to the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps! :D</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen on Startup on Vista  request current password____</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Laptop computer Vista OS. In system BIOS password settings I entered a password. It was different password than my logon password into windows. After i shut down and rebooted my computer a blue screen appears with "enter your current password".
 I enter my password and then it immediately goes to same screen again. I enter password again and then it beeps and then computer shuts off. I cant log onto BIOS by pressing f12 or boot f2? How can I solve this problem? I cant access my computer.

    <title>Will I get banned for having custom gamer pictures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arae entity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will I get banned for having custom gamer pictures</h2>
                    <p> There is many videos surfacing of people able to make custom gamer pics through xbox's website. They take the picture url of a normal one you may choose and inspect element, gathering a different picture from any other microsoft websites. Such as xbox music and movies. Then copying that url into inspect of the old gamerpic. I see many of my friends hoping on this. I think its cool? Can I do it, and will I get banned if so? Since its only microsoft based websites and pictures, you can't get any 18+ if you get my drift.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade failed, stuck at blue flashing screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterwaskiewicz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade failed, stuck at blue flashing screen</h2>
                    <p>My father attempted an upgrade from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 on his Dell Latitude E6400 using the Windows Update method. &nbsp;It went through the reboot cycles after loading all the OS files, and now he's stuck on a blue screen with the spinning dots.
 &nbsp;I unfortunately don't have physical access to the computer right now, but he describes it as the screen (see attached) has the dots spinning, then the whole screen flashes, clears it self, and goes back to the same attached screen with the spinning dots.
 &nbsp;He's let it run for hours, while the hard drive activity light is pretty much solid the whole time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've tried booting to the installation media via USB and attempted booting into Safe Mode. &nbsp;There is no option for Safe Mode since the installation media indicates the upgrade is still in progress. &nbsp;We've tried the "Repair my computer" options, and it tries
 and then promptly says nothing can be repaired. &nbsp;He even tried doing a "Reset this computer" and asking to retain personal files, but that failed at 1% saying it couldn't perform the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I've exhausted everything I can think of. &nbsp;We did attempt to disable the biometric reader (clear TPM) in BIOS, and he's tried hooking up an external monitor and cycling through to use the monitor. &nbsp;Nothing is working or indicating what is
 failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions is highly appreciated. &nbsp;If anyone needs additional information, please don't hesitate to ask.</p>

            Did you ever get this resolved.&nbsp; I have 2 Dell Latitude E6530 that this is happening to.&nbsp; I'm trying to avoid a clean install as I with my situation to preserve data it would be best to upgrade.&nbsp; My test machine will boot into safe mode with no issues
 so I'm assuming some sort of driver/service issue but I can't pinpoint which one.&nbsp; I've disabled a lot of services via safe mode but can't find the correct one and I'm getting down to the bare bones.

    <title>PC crashing into BSOD frequently when playing games - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PC crashing into BSOD frequently when playing games</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(41, 47, 52, 1)">
So I built my PC already like 2 years ago. For the first year everything was completely fine and I had no issues with it, however about a year ago I started to have a problem in Fortnite where sometimes (and by sometimes I mean once a day of playing fortnite
 maybe) it would just crash into BSOD and then I had to restart it. I originally wanted to fix it then but I stopped playing fortnite after a while and the issue never happened in any other games, so I sort of forgot about it. I did put the motherboard on warranty
 and they gave me a new one (the one I have now) but that's about it. Now about 2 months ago this issue started resurfacing again, but this time it's way worse. If I play any graphically intense games, be it Rust or Resident Evil 2 it just crashes a LOT. It
 warries day to day and sometimes it crashes into BSOD every 15 minutes, other times I can play for 2 hours before it happens. Sometimes it even happens when I don't play any games and just browse chrome and the whole PC just crashes into BSOD. Here are some
 of the BSOD stop codes that show up after crashes:<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 47, 52, 1)">
MEMORY_MANAGEMENT (happened 3 times)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 47, 52, 1)">
FAULTY_HARDWARE_CORRUPTED_PAGE (happened 3 times)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 47, 52, 1)">
KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 47, 52, 1)">
SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (What failed: Ntfs.sys)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 47, 52, 1)">

SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (What failed: win32kfull.sys)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 47, 52, 1)">
These are pretty random so I really have no idea which components might be the problem. I can't really put all of my parts up for warranty since I don't want to be without my computer for a month or two and because I bough the different components from different
 shops and it would be a pain in the **** to put them all for warranty, especially when I don't know if the component is even faulty or not.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 47, 52, 1)">
</p>

Previously I got a new MB under warranty, I reinstalled windows completely (twice), I got a new power supply recently (but the same issue was happening with the previous one) and I also upgraded my aging HDD to a new SSD recently (also didn't fix anything).
 Tried reinstalling drivers, tried upgrading BIOS and resetting it to default values, I pretty much tried everything. I also tried each of my RAM sticks individually to see if one of them might be causing the issue but it was crashing anyway with either ones.
 I did however notice that one of my motherboard RAM slots maybe isn't working? I didn't try it further but it loaded the RAM in BIOS normally but then it didn't show up in Windows. I don't know, might just be a windows issue since I switched slots or something.</p>

            Hi Hackis
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your motherboard?
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>

            My motherboard is ASROCK AB350 PRO4, I tried reinstalling windows and I also tried reinstalling drivers several times, even trying older versions of drivers. I'm pretty sure it's a hardware issue, and I would like to know which components are at fault
 from the windows error codes I'm getting.

            I forgot to ask, could you post a screenshot of the system summary window?
<br />
<br />I would try installing an older version of Windows 10 to see if it remains stable.
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1709 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1709 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi Hackis,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Technically there is no tool to detect a motherboard failure.Let us test the other components.
<br />
<br />I suggest you to  Run memory test for at least 8 passes, prefarably Overnight.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14201-memtest86-test-ram.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14201-memte...</a>
<br />If you have a DDR4 RAM, use MemTest86 rather than MemTest86+
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.memtest86.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.memtest86.com/</a>
<br />
<br />When the test completes post back the Image(You can use your phone's camera).
<br />
<br />
<br />Also share crash dumps.
<br />
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance about posting dump files.

</p><p>Here is the system summary window. It's in czech since I didn't figure out how to switch the language without installing a full new system language but I translated some things so hopefully it can help. Also I tried previous windows versions, even tried
 Windows 7 and it did not help unfortunately.</p>

<h2>            0x80070005 on all Monthly Patch Tuesday Security Monthly Quality Rollups</h2>
                    <p>Good evening Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop running Microsoft Windows 7 Professional with Service Pack 1 (64-bit) and ever since Microsoft changed to rollups instead of individual updates, my computer has been unable to install any of them. For example, Microsoft's June rollup (KB4022719),
 May rollup (KB4019264), and so on and so forth back to November, when the rollups first started, have been unable to install on my PC. I have tried flushing out the Windows cache and several other tricks, but nothing seems to be working. Other updates, including
 those for Office or other programs seem to work flawlessly, but the Windows rollups are the only one that choke up my system. I would love to fix this problem and get my PC secured, but I would rather not do something as drastic as reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,<br />
Matthew</p>

            Thank you so much for your help, but I decided to go with the nuclear option and do a repair install of Windows 7. I think that not having security patches for 10 months is enough. After receiving errors about winload.exe and SFC.exe not going beyond 24%
 or being unable to check for file inconsistencies, I knew there was something very wrong with my system. Things are all well now, and I am going back to installing Windows Updates like normal.

<p>I just got my 3rd replacement and this one is doing the same exact thing but it doesn't tell me it is disconnecting. I just stops responding to mouse moves and key inputs for a few seconds. Very annoying.</p>

            Try cleaning the contacts. Mine started doing this after a few months, and I thought the unit had been damaged somehow. I instead wiped the contacts and blew into the recessed data port on the clipboard. Some dust came out. After that it worked perfectly.

    <title>cumulative updates all fail to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nkosi henry  say:</h3>
<h2>            cumulative updates all fail to install</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10, only the first cumulative update since July 29th 2015 has installed successfully. After that, every cumulative update that has been pushed has failed to install. I get the message to reboot and then it goes to 30% and than
 says update failed and undoes the installation. That cycle continued on till i eventually got the tool to hide the update. I've check the knowledge base and even tried the manual installs for the updates which have all also failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had uninstalled flash from my machine as well immediately after the upgrade to Win10 so the flash updates that were pushed recently also failed and have since had to hide those updates as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance with this matter will be greatly appreciated as these updates have been pestering me to restart almost every day till I have to hide them using 'wushowhide.diagcab' Troubleshooting pack cab</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the list of updates that have failed since Oct 01 2015 as that is as far as my log history shows.
</p>
<p>Each one of these have failed to install multiple times before being hidden.</p>
<p>

            <p>Firstly, thanks for the replay and advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Tried Method 1: Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p>Troubleshooter indicated that "service registration is missing or corrupt". it then indicated that it fixed the issue. Tried windows update again and update failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted and ran Trouble shooter again and got the same message as before but this time it said it could not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Tried Method 2. Reset Windows Update components.</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p>So I then moved on to trying method 2. Followed all the steps and tried the update again. No luck. It asked me to restart to apply the updates. It went past 30% all the way to 100% then showed undoing changes and proceeded to restart machine 2 more times
 before allowing me to sign back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ReportingEvents.log indicates the following:</p>
<p>• Security Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3105216) - Error 0x800f0922</p>
<p>• Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3105210) - Error 0x800f0922</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have again hidden these updates till a fix can be found.</p>

<p>The problem is not with the windows update program as it does install all other updates except for cumulative updates,</p>

            <p>I found Henry's description of the problem almost identical to my own situation, except his computer is quite different to my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the Trouble-shooters and tricks I've been able to find on the web (sfc /scannow etc) and even downloaded the standalone versions to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had some support chat sessions but they repeat the same procedures I've already tried, by the time you get up to the restart required you're almost sure to lose contact with your technician. I wish somebody would take a look at the logs and tell me
 what's causing this to fail. It's been going on for at least a couple of months so it is beginning to try my patience sorry to say.

            I have this exact problem with cumulative updates. The windows update troubleshooter reports that the services registry is missing or corrupt, but that it has been fixed. However the same "unable to install updates" occurs.

 failed. &nbsp;Someone please fix this...it's downright silly.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is similar to error 80240020 but not the same.&nbsp; Clearing corrupt files and resetting update will help.<br />
Running Microsoft tools Method 1 and Method 2 will not work all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even running commands from Admin Command Prompt will not stop Services sometimes.&nbsp; If Service can not be stopped the corrupted files can not be removed or cleared.&nbsp; Running process
 can not be deleted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cumulative update seem to a different from other app updates (Microsoft Store).&nbsp; If the first update fails,&nbsp; updates after that fail also.&nbsp; Update needs previous repair before it will proceed.&nbsp; This happened in Windows 7 also with critical updates (Selecting
 critical update manually out of order caused failure).<br />
<br />
Might be a failed or skipped critical update in Windows 7 before upgrade to windows 10 also.</p>

    <title>&#34;Oops&#34; message while editing photos with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janeseidel  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Oops&#34; message while editing photos with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>"Oops! We can't save that one."&nbsp; I edit a lot of photos on my laptop.&nbsp; Since Windows 10 was installed and I lost the old Win 8 Photo Manager, I get a lot of the "Oops! We can't save that one" messages after cropping a photo.&nbsp; I can always save it as a copy
 but that gets cumbersome.&nbsp; I'd say at least 1/3 of my photos get the "Oops!" message.&nbsp; All are shot with the same camera and loaded to my laptop in the same way.&nbsp; All get the same editing: a little cropping and perhaps a little lighting enhancement.&nbsp; Nothing
 extreme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as we are talking, I really REALLY miss the old Windows 8 Photo Manager.&nbsp;

            I'll have to try to follow those solutions again.&nbsp; So far, following their instructions hasn't fixed the problem. &nbsp;I continue to get a message every 3rd or 4th save that says "Oops! We can't save that one."&nbsp; Annoying.

            Thanks for asking but no, the solution posted above hasn't worked for me.&nbsp; Every 3rd or 4th save, after I have finished editing a photo, creates the "Oops! We can't save that one" message.&nbsp; Not doing anything special.&nbsp; A little cropping and maybe enhancing
 the lighting, then save.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just worried about the error since I think it is related to system and kernel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1, everything was extremely good and this is the first time i got the BSOD in Windows 10, I just want to know if it is a serious damage to computer or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case, I do not think that it is involved with driver since i updated everything, I even upgrade the driver for Windows 10 from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a kind of overclock damage that leads to BSOD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted to Xbox forum and I am looking forward to receiving answers asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this query on Microsoft Community I hope to &nbsp;get an answer soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi!&nbsp; I, too, am experiencing this issue.&nbsp; I only have Intel HD 4600 graphics.&nbsp; I've installed the latest Intel drivers.&nbsp; I only experience this issue when Windows performs an update.&nbsp; If you search for video_scheduler_internal_error, you'll see that others
 are having this issue as well.&nbsp; Is there a more definitive answer/solution than getting the latest drivers?&nbsp; That hasn't been helping.&nbsp; Thanks!

<p>Do yourself a favor and get a linux box. Windows 10 is not an OS but a platform. Not only does Microsoft have unrestricted access to everything on your PC but settings never stick for long (once update is released), constant blue screening, accessing items
 keeps changing or are removed entirely, forced bloatware installed to your PC, glitches, driver incompatabilities, using your system as an update server via peer to peer connections across the internet, etc. The list really goes on and on. I was a technician
 of windows based machines for the last 17 years and I had to leave my job due to this complete utter garbage that they call windows 10. If it is the last OS they are releasing then I wasn't going to stay ripping my hair out trying to solve problem after problem
 after problem. Most reoccurring even after running build updates. I had one client who had 29 computers. We built all new fresh windows 10 PCs and the problems started from the get go, not to mention all the bloatware thrown in that users couldn't keep their
 hands off. Configuring GPOs for this and that to control environment was insane and client was getting sick of paying for it (can't blame them). Not to mention the Xbox tie in and all this other crap not work related in a suppossed windows business version
 of 10! Over them. They will never see a penny from me, my family or friends again. everyone I ever talk to will always hear don't go with windows. That is all that matters. Unless of coarse you don't mind a back door into your PC that Microsoft and who knows
 who all else, has access and can take whatever they want. Maybe to the typical end user who doesn't know any better thinks this is OK but it really isn't. If everyone can understand what MS is doing here, you wouldn't want a 10 PC either. I came upon this
 post for a family member one of the last with a 10 PC and as always no answers. MS never has resolutions to 10 problems, they simply hope the next update will resolve, of coarse it always crashes something else. Good luck with your issue, I am telling my family
 member MS has no fix and they need to move on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as a side note, MS has had problems with video adapter drivers since day one, they will probably never solve it as long as money keeps racking in or you buy some stupidly expensive card you don't need. They always suggest driver updates but they are
 typically update automatically and downgrade / upgrades rarely resolve the issue and it usually ends up returning</p>

 keeps changing or are removed entirely, forced bloatware installed to your PC, glitches, driver incompatabilities, using your system as an update server via peer to peer connections across the internet, etc. The list really goes on and on. I was a technician
 of windows based machines for the last 17 years and I had to leave my job due to this complete utter garbage that they call windows 10. If it is the last OS they are releasing then I wasn't going to stay ripping my hair out trying to solve problem after problem
 after problem. Most reoccurring even after running build updates. I had one client who had 29 computers. We built all new fresh windows 10 PCs and the problems started from the get go, not to mention all the bloatware thrown in that users couldn't keep their
 hands off. Configuring GPOs for this and that to control environment was insane and client was getting sick of paying for it (can't blame them). Not to mention the Xbox tie in and all this other crap not work related in a suppossed windows business version
 of 10! Over them. They will never see a penny from me, my family or friends again. everyone I ever talk to will always hear don't go with windows. That is all that matters. Unless of coarse you don't mind a back door into your PC that Microsoft and who knows
 who all else, has access and can take whatever they want. Maybe to the typical end user who doesn't know any better thinks this is OK but it really isn't. If everyone can understand what MS is doing here, you wouldn't want a 10 PC either. I came upon this
 post for a family member one of the last with a 10 PC and as always no answers. MS never has resolutions to 10 problems, they simply hope the next update will resolve, of coarse it always crashes something else. Good luck with your issue, I am telling my family
 member MS has no fix and they need to move on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as a side note, MS has had problems with video adapter drivers since day one, they will probably never solve it as long as money keeps racking in or you buy some stupidly expensive card you don't need. They always suggest driver updates but they are
 typically update automatically and downgrade / upgrades rarely resolve the issue and it usually ends up returning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To tell you the truth my friend Linux OS is a Platform also BUT Linux is use mainly for business not for a home user plus Linux is not a user-friendly Platform and it is not set up for gamming and not all Windows programs will not run on Linux unless you
 are using Windows Virtual mode or Windows extension which you can get those same errors.</p>
<p>Yes, Linux is an open source Platform OS BUT they do have error and bugs just like everything else also the error(s) in Linux does not always gets reported and yes, I have use Linux also I build upgrade and repair PC’s most users do not like using Linux
 because it is not user-friendly AND you have to write your own codes and also a lot of hardware vendors do not always have drivers for Linux OS so before you start bashing Microsoft about their Windows begin buggy or having issues remember not all PC’s are
 not created equal so you will have errors time to time most of these error are trial and error it’s also the same thing with Linux and it is also human error too</p>

<p>! "Its millions of more of these "failed to install"&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I think this has something to do with my hard disk because a year ago my hard disk got corrupted and destroyed and "dead"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pc is also making loud fan robotic noise. AND when i lift my PC the fan makes a sound that is hard to explain. OK, let me explain the sound&gt; I think the fan is loose and is hitting some sort of thing inside? When i lift the PC it makes a sound like the
 voice of the league of legends character called Blitzcrank. But the voice is at same level and constant "brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting these errors can be caused by a number of factors, such as software conflicts, driver issues, and corrupted files. One undetected or unresolved error can actually create conflicts one after another, resulting in a major effect to your PC's performance
 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We highly suggest that you use the System Checker tool detect and resolve corruptions in Windows system files. If this didn't help, you can also run the DISM tool. Check this detailed

<p>Dear Microsoft,<br />
</p>
<p>I factor reset my PC. Fortunately, every error, third party programs and auto downloaded Japanese apps are deleted! Now my windows defender is all good and troubleshooter is finally working! My troubleshooter fixed some things in my drive and all. I think
 some third party programs was the cause of update failures and errors. But all good now. Even my command prompt works now...finally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, only problem is the buzzing sound in my PC. I believe its coming from my fan. I am not a mechanical so its hard for me to understand what actually is going on. The sound only happens when i try to life the computer or press down slightly around it.
 &nbsp;As i said, the sound is the sound a bee makes, bzzzzzzzz. However, it also gets overheated easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want a picture of it, let me know.</p>
<p>

<h3> balikian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center PVR&#47;DVR alternatives for Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I'm pretty ticked off that Windows Media Center is gone and there is no alternative in its place. &nbsp;I use it to record TV shows. &nbsp;I don't use it to play DVDs, so I'm not interested in this "DVD Player" for Windows 10. &nbsp;I've tried NextPVR and the interface
 is pretty brutal. &nbsp;I've set up Kodi (previously XBMC) to work as a NextPVR client and that interface is slightly less brutal, but still horrible. &nbsp;I mean searching for a show on there is PAINFUL. &nbsp;PAINFUL.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to pay for the software. &nbsp;I just am hoping to find a PVR software package that is well designed and works well. &nbsp;Any suggestions?

            WMC is useless in Win 8 as well as it no longer pulls the TV guide information, so a program that has the same functionality is needed.&nbsp; I've been swearing at Media Portal all afternoon.&nbsp; After figuring out how to get it to see the tuner cards, I can't
 get the TV info to load.&nbsp; Now I have two useless programs on my computer...

<p>To use WMC will have to boot up in Windows 7 (8).&nbsp; Until a good program comes along there's not much of an option.&nbsp; There's no programs out there I can think of which can handle DRM, so recording certain TV channels&nbsp;is out of the question and will miss out
 on some of the favorite shows.&nbsp; Willing to pay $9.99 as an optional download from Microsoft just as in Windows 8, but they no longer offer this in Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi all - just tried this, and the MSI launches ok, I get the validation prompt, then part way through the install I get an error:</p>
<p>'The installer encountered an unexpected error installing the package. This may indicate a problem with the package. The error code is 2356'</p>
<p>Any ideas much appreciated - I would be very happy to get this working...</p>

<p>Done some more looking around on this, the 2356 error means 'Could not locate cabinet in stream'</p>
<p>Other people who have posted problems with this found that the MSI was corrupt, so I downloaded steadystate.msi from another (non-MS)&nbsp;site - same outcome.</p>
<p>It looks as if the MSI I am downloading is becoming corrupt during the download process but I haven't had problems with this before... still at a loss.</p>

<h3> weeemmab  say:</h3>
<h2>            folder options</h2>
                    Can anybody help?<br />
It may be simple.... How do i alter the options to display my files as FILES and not as PICTURES?<br />
<br />
I need to be able to use the option to show files with their details (eg type, date modified, etc etc)<br />
<br />
At the moment whenever I open a folder in a window the files are displayed as PICTURE files even thought they re not and so when I click the "Show details" option at the top nothing happens-
<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP!! Its very annoying!!

            never Mind!! I've done it!<br />
<br />
I clicked on the tab "view"- (NOT to be confused with views-which is BELOW view) then clicked the tab customize folder-
<br />
<br />
(i had already tried this and kept on trying to change it to documents but nothing was happening)<br />
<br />
- ANYWAY....... instead i clicked <u>use this folder type as a template</u> and just changed it to "All files"<br />
<br />
this seemed to work!! Hurray-<br />
<br />
Iv posted a reply to my own Q- in case its helpful to anyone else!<br />
