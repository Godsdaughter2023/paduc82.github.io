    <title>How can I track the location of a stolen laptop, windows 10 installed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. n. m. nasimunnabi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I track the location of a stolen laptop, windows 10 installed on it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series, N7537 laptop has been stolen (robed actually). I was searching a way to find it out. But, I am shocked that nothing could help me. Every solution was telling about a per-installed app. But, the thief will be formatting my
 hard-disk for sure, if he wants to use it. Is there any way to find the location of the Windows 10 Laptops? At least history. I can see, my laptop is listed in my device list of my Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any sort of help to find the location of my laptop (at-least history of the location) is appreciated.&nbsp; Please don't suggest any Pre-installed software. You already know, I have no option to install it on my laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Microsoft should have such applications. As windows 10 has location service and world is moving so fast. It is very disappointing !

            <p>If you want that feature you'll have to buy a MacBook with OS X! But, you can still run Windows 10 on it ;)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, anti-theft tracking is only available if the computer manufacturer supports such a function. &nbsp;You can't really expect an Operating System Developer alone to provide such a service, or Microsoft to take responsibility for tracking every windows
 laptop in the world without charging for such a service. &nbsp;Besides, too many people are already complaining about being 'watched' by Microsoft, can you imagine what the reaction would be if they introduced automated computer tracking (he said, donning his tinfoil
 helmet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as mobile phones are concerned that is undertaken by your service contract provider and it's the usage they track so that the phone contract can be remotely disabled. You have to pay an insurance premium if you want your phone covered against theft/loss.</p>

</p><p>So, how 3rd party software like Prey works? I agree with you, some people&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;would be complaining about the service as you mentioned - 'watched' by Microsoft.
 Still, there should be option for the user whether he is interested of being&nbsp;monitored&nbsp;or&nbsp;not? Only for the security purpose, I have no problem if it is &nbsp;being&nbsp;monitored, not my data only the physical location and to access that, there some security system
 can be developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

            i totally agree with no tracking or built in devices serve this. altern&nbsp; i would buy a mini device the size of a credit card/smaller sizes and hide it inside any device i need tracked.&nbsp; If this was invented and given at a low cost or free , imagine the
 receiving stolen property<br />
arrest will be up. Even if the track inventor received a 2% recovery fee in the free Tracker program. I always say 'a solution is out there.&nbsp;

<h2>            Registration key</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased more than a dozen computers over the years, but never before has there been no apparent windows registration key, and the computer will not fully function without it. Other than a small fold out pamphlet, nothing came with the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell computer, purchased at Costco. It's unclear who I need to contact to solve this problem, and your site is particularly unhelpful. Ordinary people offering ideas is a nonsensical waste of time. Ready to return computer than deal with this BS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you want to protect your product, but, aside from the continual (baffling) move toward making your system work more like mac (totally useless) this requirement to enter a registration key and then not provide one, is beyond frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone from Microsoft happens to see this and cares to explain themselves, get back to me.</p>

            Hi Alex
<br />
<br />I am not from Microsoft, but if I may, I will try to help.
<br />
<br />New Windows 10 PC's do not come with a product Key, the key is retained on a chip on your motherboard
<br />
<br />When you purchase a PC, and put that on the Internet, Windows 10 will activate and a digital entitlement is stored on the Microsoft Activation servers. So should you ever need to re-install Windows 10, as long as you re-install the same edition (Home, Pro . . . etc.) then when that PC is put on the Internet, it should re-activate sutomatically
<br />
<br />
<br />If you need to find your Product Key, click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />If you are having some problem with Windows Activation, please explain what this problem is . . .

            Hi, the registration key is linked to your account once you enter it on the activation form. If you have purchased your computer with a Windows 10 license, it has to be on your case or on the installation DVD.
<br />If that's not the case and on your first start of Windows 10, it was unactived, then you have to contact your dealer and ask for your activation code.

            Hi,
<br />large brand manufacturers do not put a sticker with a product key now, they write this key into BIOS. This does not affect how Windows work.
<br />Please, describe your problem in details. And please show the result of slmgr /dlv command.

<h2>            how do i get my display settings back to the way they were&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay so the computer went on hibernate while it was plugged into our TV so I don't kno if this affected the laptop or not but its getting on my last nerve. See all the display settings changed. For instance&nbsp;the taskbar and borders on the windows are no longer
 transparent like they used to be. Also&nbsp;the pinned icons on the taskbar have changed b/c before when i'd hover over them&nbsp;it would display all the screens that i had open with that particular program but now it just lists them. Arggh! i dont know how else to
 explain it. Also before when i used to hover over windows media player it would show the exact screen but just a tinier version attached to the taskbar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ARGH THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to computers so if something is wrong with it it messes up my entire day and those around me. PLEASE HELP ME TO SOLVE THIS :) thank you.</p>

 tried using Add/Remove Windows features, full offline installer, Powershell, and Dism. All methods produce the same error. I have also tried running the appropriate Dism flags to restore health, nothing fixes this issue. Short of reinstalling or removing the
 system from the domain, is there a fix for this issue? I would assume there may be some registry entry that might need to be adjusted or removed, but I have no idea what those entries may be.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

                    I removed the hard drive from my old computer and installed it in a&nbsp; USB connected hard drive case but when I try to access the data files (mostly graphics) I do not see them on the HD.&nbsp; Both are running Windows Vista Home Premium. How can I see what is
 on my old HD aside from the apps and programs?

<p>If you mean "encrypt" then I recommend you check out the links posted by the other respondents.

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />I'm a newly qualified Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />If you use Windows 7 Pro , Windows 8 Pro, Windows 10 Pro and have a TPM chip then just use BitLocker because the performance is fast enough that you won’t notice, it is built into Windows, and it is free.
<br />
<br />Below are a couple of guides on how to enable Bitlocker for removable drives,
<br /><a href="https://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-use-bitlocker-for-encryption-on-removable-drives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-sys...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://m.windowscentral.com/how-use-bitlocker-encryption-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://m.windowscentral.com/how-use-bitlocker-...</a>
<br />
<br />Encrypting a removable drive such as a USB memory stick doesn’t take long in Windows 10, and it involves fewer steps than encrypting the operating system drive. After the encryption process ends, each time you plug your device into a Windows computer, File Explorer shows the device with a lock icon, which signals that the device is encrypted. To access its content, you must enter the password set during the encryption process.
<br />
<br />Below are is an overview of bitlocker on windows.
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/securi...</a>

<br />
<br />Hope that works for you. 
<br />
<br />If that is not the case, please kindly attach a screen-shot of the issue so we could work towards resolving it.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Lee

<p>Indeed. But lots of people ignore the need to have a backup copy of their files (encrypted or unencrypted) until they suffer a major disaster and come here, begging for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I little while ago I replied to a question from a poster who was using BitLocker as a crack-proof encryption tool. He lost the key and got very angry at Microsoft for not having built a back-door into BitLocker. He refused to accept that "crack-proof" and
 "back-door" are mutually exclusive. If there is a back-door then the encryption is crackable.</p>

                    While I was trying to get my Samsung 2333HD monitor to display in 1920x1080 (through VGA), I installed the driver from samsung, which seems to replace/rename my generic nonPnP monitor driver of win7. I then tried to remove the driver but it appears to
 remove the generic-nonPnP monitor driver as well. Is it possible to reinstall the generic-nonPnP driver? Thanks!

<p><span><span><strong>Hi sgfrdlng,<br />
</strong>1. Are you able to set the display to 1920x1080?</span></span><strong><br />
</strong><span>2. Do you have any issue using generic drivers?<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong><br />
Uninstall the driver installed from the manufacturer (Samsung) and reboot the computer, windows should install the generic drivers automatically.<br />
a. Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.<br />
b. Expand Monitor.<br />
c. Look for the appropriate monitor driver.<br />
d. Right click on it and select uninstall.<br />
e. On reboot, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.<br />
<strong>Update drivers: recommended links: </strong><br />

<strong>Step 2: </strong><br />
You may also install the drivers through Windows Update.<br />

<h2>            iPhone Recognition</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8 will not recognize my iPhone and I am at a loss of what to do. When I open iTunes it recognizes my iphone and I can work with it in iTunes. But I would like to get my other stuff off my phone such as photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into devices and printers my iphone is not there. It does however say Apple mobile device USB driver under unspecified. When I try to update the driver it is grayed out and will not do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to have no problems. I have done a system restore and that did not work. Also, perhaps related or not, my webcam stopped working around the same time I have been unsuccessful and making that work again also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            It sounds like the USB ports on your computer are going bad. You might want to contact your computer's manufacturer for repair options.

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days back we had a power break down causing my laptop to shut down since it was plugged in directly with no battery. On restarting later I came across certain issues. My internet connectivity was limited and I could not browse any thing. Running the
 troubleshooter gave me that Diagnostic Policy server was not running. My fire wall is also off and would not start and so is the base filtering engine as shown in the services. I have applied the Microsoft Fix It and also have modified the registry as stated
 in some earlier posts but to no avail. After I posted the following command in cmd my internet started working but the rest of the services are still not working.</p>

<p>Even after following instructions at many other Microsoft sites to fix these issues such as&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/943996/some-services-do-not-start-in-windows-vista-and-windows-7 I was still not able to get DPS running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per the suggestion of a user over on&nbsp;https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/492217c2-b92f-4e24-a12f-cccdd986a43f/solution-for-diagnostic-policy-service-access-denied-2008-r2?forum=winservergen&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to restore WIndows Firewall and other services by using Microsoft's Process Explorer app to see what registry keys the services were having trouble accessing and granting to those permissions to the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not take notes as I tried the fixes so here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Process Explorer captures A LOT of data so you need to setup a filter where "RESULT" contains "denied"</p>
<p>Have an elevated Command Prompt ready with "net start DPS" which attempts to start the DPS service</p>
<p>Start Process Explorer capturing</p>
<p>I would try to start the DPS Service by going to the CMD prompt and hitting enter</p>
<p>As soon I saw the Error 5 Starting DPS "Access Denied" I would stop Process Explorer</p>
<p>It tells you what registry key DPS is trying to access but can't - in my case it was&nbsp;HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\WDI\Config</p>
<p>Navigate to the key in regedit</p>
<p>Grant those permissions to "NT SERVICE\DPS" (it helps to have a functional machine with the same version of Windows to copy from)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After figuring this out I was able to apply the same tactic to Windows Firewall aka "mpssvc" and get it running as well.</p>

 Money doesn't grow on trees, and $532 is a lot to lose for a product we never received.

<h3> zerin sakech  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Windows 7 Paint has tiny flaw, or feature that bugs me. The Selection tool isn&#39;t that accurate, can it be fixed&#63;</h2>
                    For Example, I edit photos on my pc all the time.&nbsp;I recently&nbsp;upgraded 7 from my xp. On the old Win Xp Paint, you could select the area with your select tool and move it somewhere else. With me so far? and to unselect, you would click anywhere else that
 wasn't in the selected area and the slection feature would turn off and you could continue.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; However, in the new paint, if you try to select something, move it around, then unselecting somewhere else (nearby), would EXPAND IT! instead of letting it go. That bugs, me. I never had to use the undo feature so many times. The old one would never do that!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Although, I admit this Paint was improved that the last, I just ask that Microsoft.&nbsp; fix this error when they have the time. If anyone know what I am talking about then you understand, and don't tell me to get a third party picture editor, i like Paint, it's
 free. Sort of, and I felt like pointing this out.

<p><span><span><span>This not a bug, we verified in our computer, selecting and unselecting works fine without

<strong>Command&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span>Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the<span>&nbsp;
</span>password, or click <strong>Allow</strong>. </span></span></p>

<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I have encountered the same issue. I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.</p>
<p>With Paint in Windows 7, the resize boxes around the selection respond to clicks and drags that are not directly over the box. An intended click that is near, but not on, a resize box will act as if the nearby box was clicked, and if the intended click was
 actually a drag, the selection will be resized. I have seen this when the pointer appears to be about two pointer-lengths away from the selection, well outside the area that would have been affected with previous versions of Windows. This means that a user
 must click well clear of the selection to clear it.</p>
<p>With XP, one had to place the mouse directly over the border of the selection, similarly to resizing a window. As soon as the pointer is no longer directly over the border, the pointer reverts to a normal mouse pointer rather than a double-headed resize
 pointer.</p>
<p>If the Microsoft responder had understood the original poster, or for that matter, the moderator who marked the response as an answer, they would have realized that this is due to the program design, and certainly not anything corrupted in the user profile.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Step 1: To check the text and font size follow the below steps.
<br />
<br />1.       Go to settings.
<br />2.       Click on “system”, under the display option click on “advanced display settings”.
<br />3.       Then click on “advanced sizing of text and items” and check whether the text and font size settings.
<br />
<br />Step 2:  To check the color contrast follow the below steps and check.
<br />
<br />1.       Press “Windows+X” and go to “control panel”.
<br />2.       Click on “Ease of access center” and click on “Choose high contrast theme”.
<br />3.       Under “High contrast themes” check whether any option is selected, if selected then I suggest you to select any option under “Windows Default themes”.

<br />Windows Key+CTRL+SHIFT+B
<br />
<br />2. Windows Key+i &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Color filters &gt; Set Turn on color filter to OFF 
<br />
<br />3. Otherwise, Windows Key+i &gt; Personalization &gt; Themes &gt; Experiment with various themes
<br />

            I'm Bradford, an Independent Advisor and I would like to contribute to resolving your issue. 
<br />First, if present- you can click the gear located in your Windows 10 menu to access settings. Or click the notification icon in your taskbar to bring up the Windows 10 notification area and click the gear there. 
<br />Next, please navigate the control group named "Ease of Access", there you must check these two areas 
<br />1. Magnifier ( does also provide the option to set "invert colors" to a keyboard shortcut). 
<br />2. Color Filters (also provides an option to invert screen colors) 
<br />
<br />Finally, I am not sure if I saw it mentioned, but if you're using a Laptop, the "invert colors" features might be tied also to a "Function Key" ("fn"+ "something") or an All-in-one desktop please double check the user manual to see if the "invert colors" settings is attached to a keyboard shortcut. 
<br />
<br />If the problem or questions still exists after following the above steps please let me know.

            Hi Capo_86 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Once a contact is deleted, you can't retrieve it. There is no recycle bin in Skype.
<br />
<br />You will need to search for that person on the basis of name or Skype ID or Mail ID. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>If the new laptop does not have Windows 10 installed (usually they do), and the Windows 8 you bought is a retail licence rather than an OEM licence, then yes, you can transfer your Windows 10 licence to your new laptop.

<p>Yes, you are entitled to a one time transfer because you originally upgraded from a retail Windows 8 license. You will need to use chat support to reactivate Windows 10 on the new laptop using your Windows 8 product key. Learn more:</p>

            Hi I'm Peter an independent advisor sounds like the flex cable connecting the monitor to the motherboard is lose/faulty or embedded graphics card is at faulty.  Best way to rule out the graphics is to connect an external monitor to see if the ghosting is still there

            <p>An account suspension completely blocks the affected account from being able to sign in to the Xbox Live service for the duration of the suspension.

            <p>Are you saying that someone from Microsoft actually reviewed evidence and then made a decision, based on evidence, to ban him for behavior? &nbsp;How would they verify verbal behavior? &nbsp;Why would he act inappropriately a third time to someone who can clearly ban him? &nbsp;My son has 1 xbox live account and values his accrued points and&nbsp;experience contained within that avatar. &nbsp;The person who is banning him has many accounts and seems far more advanced. &nbsp;In addition there is no lag. &nbsp;He is banned within 24 hours of reinstatement.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Installation freezes during expanding files</h2>
                    I have been trying to upgrade my PC to Windows 7 Professional, from Vista Business.&nbsp; I wanted to go from 32 bit, to 64 bit, so I have been booting from the Windows 7 DVD, and it hangs when it is trying to expand the files.<br />
I ran the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, and it said everything was okay for the upgrade.&nbsp; My PC just freezes every time I try to do the install, and it does not provide any useful information to tell me why it is hanging.&nbsp; I assumed that by running the Windows
 7 Upgrade Advisor before doing the install I would be okay, but that does not appear to be the case.&nbsp; It hangs between 0% and 14%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions on what I might try?&nbsp;

            Other than the "Disconnect all external USB devices" I mentioned earlier there is one or two&nbsp;things you can try.<br />
<br />
1) Check BIOS settings for Video card, look for options like "PEG" and if it's not set to "PEG" (PCI-E card) do so.<br />
<br />
2) Your Monitor may have an Analog input, if so use the DVI to Analog adaptor to connect the card to the monitor.<br />

<h2>            PC won&#39;t load pass the dell logo and I can only hit F12.</h2>
                    <p>I recently decided &nbsp;to reset my pc, when I was going through the process It said something like "Windows can't reset" as far as I can remember. Now my pc will only load the dell logo, then it goes black screen and reloads the dell logo again and so forth.
 The only thing I can access is F12 but I don't understand it and need help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jayden,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. I suggest you to please access another computer, download the ISO file and perform
<strong>Automatic Repair</strong> using Windows 10 installation media. Drivers, conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory can all cause startup problems. Automatic repair can detect and fix problems that prevent your PC from starting. If you don’t
 have an installation media. I request you to download and create an installation media of Windows 10 from the below link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Download Windows 10</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the steps below to perform an
<strong>Automatic Repair</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
Insert the installation USB media and boot.</li><li>
In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘<strong>Time and currency format’</strong> and the ‘<strong>keyboard or input method’</strong> and click on ‘next’.</li><li>
Click on ‘<strong>Repair your computer’ </strong>and select ‘<strong>Troubleshoot’</strong>.</li><li>
Select ‘<strong>Automatic Repair’ </strong>and select the operating system.</li><li>
You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option <strong>
Troubleshoot </strong>and select <strong>advanced options</strong>.</li><li>
You may choose <strong>Automatic Repair </strong>from Advanced boot option.</li><li>
Follow the instructions.</li></ul>
