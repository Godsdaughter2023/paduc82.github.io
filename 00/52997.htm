            Your current Windows Vista installation does not have the necessary drivers installed for your new motherboard &amp; CPU.<br />
You need to perform a "clean install" of Windows Vista.

    <title>Multiple monitors won&#39;t duplicate display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paripurnata  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple monitors won&#39;t duplicate display</h2>
                    I'm setting up a Sony Vaio with Windows 7 via a Targus docking port. My second monitor is a Dell U2211H Ultra Sharp monitor. Everything was working fine with the ddisplay showing on both monitors. Right in the middle of some web browsing, my Dell screen
 went dark. The monitor says it's not getting an input from my computer. All cables are secure. When I go to the dsplay setting in the control panel, I get these choices in the display drop-down: 2)Display 2=Digital Flat Palne, 1920 x 1080, 1) Dell U211H. My
 only choices for the multiple displays drop down are Dispaly on 1 only display on 2 only, or extend. If I select extend, I can see things on both laptops. That works. If I show only on Desktop 1 (the Dell), that works; my laptop goes dark. If I show only on
 Desktop 1 (my laptop), that works; the Dell goes dark. So...the question is: what happened to Duplicate displays? I want to see the same thing on both monitors. It was there...not poof, it's gone! Thanks in advance for the help.

<p>You can also right click and select properties, that will open the graphics chip and some clues may be in the monitor settings or display.</p>

<h2>            Changing name of system folder &#40;2 same system forlders&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Somehow my system folder in basic folder called: My computer, changed itÂ´s name. Now I have got two same folders called: Desktop. Before one of them has been named: Documents. If I want to change content of one of them, both will change. They behave lake
 one folder. In a fact this folders are just something like a shorcuts. Before, each of them has different name and the worked independently, but now I cannot change their links without changing each other. Also if I try to change properties of one of them
 it changes both. As I told above, it looks like my computer recognize them as one folder, because they have got the same name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I need to change the name of one of them but I donÂ´t know how to change the name of the system folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hopeless, I donÂ´t want to put my computer into fabric settings, neither lost any personal data nor applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your soon answer.</p>

<p>Thanks for providing answers to our questions. Since you mentioned that you're not able to change the names of the folders, we would like to confirm if there were any error messages that showed up when you attempted to change the name of the folder? Also,
 we would like to request a screenshot of the folders that you saw which has the same name if possible?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend to change the target location of the said folders. Let's troubleshoot the issue by performing the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on your <em><strong>Desktop </strong></em>folder in <strong>File Explorer</strong>, then go to
<strong><em>Location </em></strong>tab.</p>
<p>2. Click on the <em><strong>Restore Default</strong></em> button or you can navigate to its appropriate location by clicking the
<em><strong>Move </strong></em>button:</p>
<p>C:/Users/YourUserName/Desktop.</p>
<p>3. Click <em><strong>OK </strong></em>and click <strong><em>Apply </em></strong>to save changes.</p>
<p>4. You can repeat the steps 1 - 3 and apply it to your <strong><em>Documents </em>
</strong>folder if its required.</p>
<p>5. Reboot your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I tried everything above except rebooting my computer because I donÂ´t know how. And I donÂ´t want to delete anything from my computer neither cause more problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As I said before, if I change place on which the file is linked to, both of them change, also their names, usually&nbsp; according to their linked folder.</p>
<p>Restore default button also doesnÂ´t work.</p>
<p>I need them to stop behaving like one folder.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. Rebooting is simply the same with restarting your device. Furthermore, this issue may need further troubleshooting that requires modification in the Registry Editor. We recommend that you check the steps suggested by
<strong>RazvanT </strong>in this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/i-accidentally-merged-the-downloads-folder-and-the/c448f784-cd1f-4060-9ff6-b63bde4d39db?auth=1">thread</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The method to fix the issue will have Registry modification. Before you modify the Registry, make sure to back it up and understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. Please refer to this link:

            <p>Hello Frederik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I put Windows 7 Professional on an usb stick. Then, I set up the BIOS, so as to boot from my flash drive and turned on my PC. The message which I mentioned was the first one&nbsp;that appeared on the screen after the "starting windows" message. It says:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""</p>
<p>Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Language to install: English</p>
<p>Time and currency format: English (United States)</p>
<p>Keyboard or input methods: US</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter your language and other preferences and click "Next" to continue.</p>
<p>"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""</p>
<p>After I have clicked on "next", there is another message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""</p>
<p>Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install now</p>

</p><p>Then, the system asks me to select the drive which Windows will be installed to. Normally,&nbsp;I&nbsp;do what I am asked to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completing installation</p>

</p><p>If there is no other solution, I will try what you suggest. The computer&nbsp; is not mine, so it will be quite tricky to remove the internal storage. As for the external devices, I had disabled them, before I started the process.</p>

</p><blockquote>Firstly, I put Windows 7 Professional on an usb stick.</blockquote>
<p>Your detailed report immediately raises the next question: What exactly did you put on the flash disk. Windows 7 usually comes on a DVD disk. Just copying the contents of a DVD to a flash disk will not create a valid installation medium.<br />

            <p>In such puzzling cases I apply a process of elimination. Unfortunately it requires some spare hardware. I would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab a spare laptop.</li><li>Remove the internal disk.</li><li>Install a spare disk.</li><li>Try the installation on this laptop.</li></ol>
<p>If it works then you know that the other laptop has a problem.</p>
<p>If it fails then you know that your installation medium is flawed.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 black screen after boot right after installing intel hd - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hasanpk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 black screen after boot right after installing intel hd graphics 4000 drivers</h2>
                    Today after I installed latest drivers for Intel HD Graphics 4000 for windows 8 x64, I got a black blinking screen right after boot with only the mouse pointer after I was prompted to restart my pc to let the drivers take effect. Ever since I have been
 unable to get the windows to start. I tried to restore to the latest restore point which I created right before installing the culprit driver in the advanced recovery menu but the system restore was unable to detect any restore points on my PC. I then tried
 the automatic repair. All it did was to stop the blinking screen. The display was still blank. So, I tried to boot in to safe mode but it still got stuck at the black screen. I then tried every option in the Start up settings but none of them was able to get
 past the black screen. I tried to run the task manager by pressing ctrl+alt+del but that didn't work out either. My pc previously ran on windows 7 ultimate x64 after which I upgraded to windows 8 x64 through a digital updater which rules out the possibility
 of "PC refresh" as it requires an installation disc while I have the updater saved on the same pc. I have loads of data due to which recovery is not an option. Can anybody please help me to get windows working via System restore or anything else? I am in a
 fix and really need an urgent solution.<br />
My PC specs are:<br />
HP Pavilion G6 Core i5-2.5 GHz<br />
AMD Radeon HD Graphics 7xxx - series<br />
Intel HD Graphics 4000<br />
Windows 8 x64<br />

            <p>Hi Hasan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to backup the data using Command prompt from Windows Recovery environment. Refer to the link for details:</p>
<p><b>How to create installation media for a PC refresh or reset</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also contact the computer manufacturer for assistance with backing up data and restoring Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it is helpful.</p>

<p><br />
Since you can do that you could use Command mode to investigate what your symptom means.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if it is a driver crashing it may show up in the logs.&nbsp;&nbsp; But you may be lucky and find that it is only showing you the second screen of an extended display in which
 case you would try changing that, e.g. press Win-P, CursorUp, Enter (as if you could see the Second Screen dialog come up and use it that way &lt;w&gt;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Good luck</p>

            Thanks a lot Rohit and Robert for getting back with a reply. Windows 8 has been throwing issues the day I updated from Win 7. It has crashed and recovered 3 times. The display drivers have not been working properly. I spend an entire day fixing an issue
 and the very next day 2 more issues come up. So, I finally rolled back to Win 7 after backing up my data through HP Recovery manager. I won't update now till stable drivers are released by MS and HP for this OS. It has been over a year since Win 8 was released.
 It is a pity not being able to get it to work. I hope HP focuses more on their existing consumers more than releasing new gadgets to tempt the new ones.

<h2>            Windows 10 Menu - Text Scrambled&#47;Missing and can&#39;t wake up from standby.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having 2 problems with Windows 10 Pro Version&nbsp;10.0.10240 Build 10240 at the moment:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1] Sometimes the text in the menu get's scrambled or is just simply gone:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1f0fa8a-37d1-4e15-8e34-ad50d4d1a94c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens after the PC wakes up from standby/sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2] The PC doesn't always wake up from standby/sleep mode. It just keeps on sleep mode even after pressed numerous keys, moved and clicked mouse buttons etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already run a sfc/scannow in CMD but didn't find any integrity violations. All my drivers are up to date including my BIOS version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does someone knows how to fix this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1<span>:</span></span></strong><span> <strong>Deployment Image Service and Management Tool command (DISM)</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>By running this command we can retrieve or modify information within an image. To run the
<strong>DISM</strong> command please follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Press â<strong>Windows Logo</strong>â + â<strong>X</strong>â keys on the keyboard and select â<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>â from the list.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Type â<strong>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong>â and press â<strong>Enter</strong>â.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Wait for the command to execute which might take around 30 minutes.</span></span></li><li><span><span>After the command is executed, restart the computer and check if the issue persist.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to run the&nbsp;<strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;troubleshooter and check if the issue persists:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>.</span></li><li><span><span>Click on <strong>Control Panel</strong> and click on&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the new window, click&nbsp;<strong>View all</strong>&nbsp;on the left pane.</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the list of options, click on&nbsp;<strong>Power</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Reset and restore the power plans to default</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I </span></span><span><span>suggest you to reset the power settings and check if it helps. Follow the steps to restore the power settings:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Choose <strong>command prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the command prompt, type&nbsp;<strong>powercfg ârestoredefaultschemes</strong>&nbsp;and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Exit command prompt.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Check if issue persists.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;This would reset the power plan settings to default. Any customized power plans are would be removed.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, weâll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

<h2>            error in acct sign-in on console</h2>
                    A few weeks ago I turned on my Xbox slim/elite and an update appeared. " system update required for all Xbox live accounts to sign in." I downloaded the update and found my profile to be corrupted. All corrupted files were deleted. With in the entire process
 of fixing this problem, all Xbox profiles were deleted except for two, when I tried to redownload the update all profiles were gone. I had to retrieve my profile once the problem was fixed.the process fried my hard drive so now I'm on a usb drive. Two days
 ago I dashboarded out of a movie and I was just signed out of my profile and it completely disappereared from the Xbox. I was not notified of being signed out either. I could not retrieve my profile at all. So I signed into my brothers profile and played for
 the rest of the day. Yesterday when I woke up, I tried to retrieve my profile and it was there when I turned on my console. But then the black ops 2 update was required so I dashboarded again and went into the game to download

<h2>            Update history empty and installed updates nearly empty</h2>
                    Hi all, using windows 10 my PC suddenly shut down without warning and no messages as if I had shut it down myself. I tried to start up but after posting OK and showing the normal mobo screen it then went to a black screen with a couple of dots as if that
 circular dots thing that shows it is working had frozen. I turned off and waited 10 minutes before trying again and it booted into windows normally except a bit slow.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I thought maybe there was an update that shut it down so I went to update history but it is completely empty so I went to the screen that shows you installed updates and there are a couple of Visual C one adobe acrobat and only two Microsoft security updates
 showing and I know there have been more than that since the last major update. Where has all the info gone and surely there are more updates than that.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help or advice.

            <p>A "Baseline" is a reference or strating point.&nbsp; For instance performing a fresh install of Windows and then creating an Image Backup.&nbsp; The Image Backup is your "Baseline" backup as it represents Windows before any applications or changes are made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restoring Windows to its baseline state is important when testing new build of software applications for bugs. After the next build has incorporated all the bug fixes, you return Windows to its "Baseline" state and use to test the next build of the software.</p>

<h2>            Ms Splosion Man Pinball FX2</h2>
                    
<p>Apologies if already posted, it seems that not only are we getting a Ms Splosion Man game this week for a nice 800msp but also later in the summer we are getting a Ms Splosion Man Pinball FX2 table
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-2.gif" /> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.twistedpixelgames.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link to their news page</a></p>
<p>Can't wait, I will be picking up Ms Splosion Man and am glad to see it not priced at 1200msp, also if their previous excellent tables are anything to go by I'm sure the Pinball version will be just as much fun.</p>

<p>[/quote] I think that's a fair price for Ms Splosion Man tbh, the first one was the same price and worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would think when the FX2 table is released it'll be 200 points or so like the other tables.</p>

<p>Yep Philip is correct the arcade game Ms Splosion Man is out this week for 800msp and then later in the summer the Pinball FX2 game will have a Ms Splosion Man table released.As Lord K1llz mentions, I would imagine it will be around the 250msp price.</p>
<p>I'm guessing there isn't much love for Splosion Man then?? I thought it was a fun game although difficult and a definate controller breaker lol.</p>

<p>I'll definitely be getting the Pinball table as I pretty much pick all of them up when they get released (reckon it'll be 240MS as the more recent ones seem to be priced slightly higher)</p>
<p>Think i'm more likely to wait for Ms Splosion Man to hit the DotW though. Played the Beta a bit and whilst it was ok &nbsp;it didn't totally blow me away so I can wait for it. Nice touch having a crossover game though

<p>WTF is up with this website?!?! I just wrote quite a lengthy reply to your question and it's appeared as a totally blank message?!?! I tried replying earlier while I was at work and suffered the old disappearing Reply button routine. I'd stick a frowny face
 in here if this ruddy site would let me grrrrrr!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll do a shorter version of what I just wrote a moment ago. Basically if you loved the original Splosion Man chances are you'll love Ms Splosion Man ... they're very similar in style and handling. I didn't really get chance to try out the MP side
 of things as my mates who applied to get on the beta didn't get selected and I think I got sidetracked by the Gears XP event that was running at the time (and I forgot I had it truth be told)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully you like the song 'All the single ladies' as you'll hear that a lot though there was quite an impressive boss battle in there too. I don't think you'll be disappointed tbh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myself, well I enjoyed the first Splosion Man ... didn't totally love it though, Comic Jumper annoyed the HELL outta me (Contra for retards and I paid the full 1200MS for it so felt slightly stung tbh)</p>
<p>Being as I've got such a ridiculous backlog of stuff to play at the moment I can happily wait for Ms Splosion Man to hit the dotw. I did notice that Boulderdash is also out this week so I may be tempted by that being a big fan of the Spectrum original</p>

<h2>            Windows detects PS2 keybaord not working properly. In windows 7 64 bit..</h2>
                    I have had a problem for sometime now. With this error message. Windows detects that PS 2 keyboard is not working properly. Code 24. This device is not present, is not working properly, or does not have all its drivers installed properly. I have updated
 the driver. it tells me the driver is up to date. Any ideas, what I can do to correct this problem...?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Error code 24</span></strong><span> in Windows 7 is basically related to hardware devices not getting recognized, not working properly or all the drivers are not installed for a particular device.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Uninstall the keyboard completely from Device Manager and reinstall it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a. Click on start and then type devmgmt.msc in the start search box and press enter.<br />
b. Expand keyboard.<br />
c. Select your PS2 keyboard, right click on the device and select uninstall.<br />
d. Restart the computer.<br />
e. Open Device Manager again.<br />
f. Right click on the keyboard and select âscan for hardware changesâ.</span></p>

<h3> robebcan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 fails to install security update kb931906</h2>
                    Beginning one month ago, my Win 10 reported unable to install Security Update for CAPICOM KB931906, and it fails on every day's attempt since then. I have had the computer for about two months, with no update issues. My McAfee subscription ran out awhile
 ago, maybe about the time this problem started, but I can't be sure. I'm using MSE now. How to fix this, please ?

            <p>Thank you for advising that I don't need CAPICOM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system update log shows the multiple attempts to install this security update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concerned that Win10 attempts to install this file almost daily, for the past 6 weeks and always fails. What caused it to start attempting installation, and how can I stop it ? Will the McAfee removal tool "fix" this useless install sub-routine ? I
 don't want to use a tool that I don't know the purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, and Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>Don't know if this will help, it's a copy and paste from support search results:</p>
<p>"Canât Retrieve Information from Xbox LIVE, Status Code 80072746</p>
<p>There was a problem transferring the file to your console due to a network timeout. This issue is usually related to service availability or file size and interrupts all pending Cloud Game Save transfers.</p>
<p>To resolve this error, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Try syncing again later when network loads might be lighter.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Move large files out of Cloud Game Saves. Some larger files that are not required for your game experience can be stored on a local storage device or deleted. For more information, see Copy, move, or delete Xbox 360 content.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note Deletion from Xbox LIVE Cloud Storage is final. Do not delete files that you need for your game save or other items.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Use a locally stored copy of the game save if you have one. For more information, see âHow to copy and move items between storage devicesâ in Copy, move, or delete Xbox content.</p>
<p>Microsoft is aware of this issue, and we are working on additional solutions."</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update 1 error 80073712.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: As ussual, Update 1 error </p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As other people, April 4th I tried to install Update 1. I had Windows 8.1 and I tried to apply Update 1. At this time my nightmare started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an error applying this update and I started to find a solution in google. There were a lot of people with the same problem.
</p>
<p>I tried all the solutions that I found. The error persist.</p>
<p>At this point, I phoned Microsoft support. Bad idea. People that I found in support have a few skills and it's very difficult to explain my error.</p>
<p>At the end, they escalate my&nbsp;problem and I received a remote assistant. The worker tried the same steps that I found&nbsp;using google. No more. The same.</p>
<p>My logs are collected and sent to Microsoft. In my opinion, they were completely lost.</p>
<p>Twelve days later and after five calls to support, I received a call with a solution get it by Development team. Three lines of Powershell. No solution. The error persists. The update is not applied.</p>
<p>Today, I have received a new call from Microsoft support. A new solution from Development team. In this opportunity, the magic poison is a zip file wit an exe call clearcompressionflag.exe. New remote assistance and we applied this medicine. The error persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is very clear. The component store is corrupt. Error 80073712.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the Microsoft support for this error.</p>
<p>it's very difficult to understand that&nbsp;is better to buy a software license by the support.</p>
<p>A lot of people with the same error and Microsoft is applying poor workarounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any new idea with this error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything new to try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm really upset with Microsoft response</p>

            <p>Hi PranavMishra5582,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, your answer is the same answer that I have received from Microsoft Support (I have a support case opend without solution).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this issues for a thoudand of times. Microsoft Support tried at least 5 times with any combination that you can imagine (new Administrator user, starting in&nbsp;safe mode,....).</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</p><p /><p>The component store is repairable.<br />The operation completed successfully.</p><p /><p>and</p></pre>
<pre><p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</p><p /><p>The restore operation failed. Either the repair source was not found or the component store cannot be repaired.</p><p>Error: 0x800f081f</p><p>DISM failed. No operation was performed.<br />For more information, review the log file.</p><p>The DISM log file can be found at C:\WINDOWS\Logs\DISM\dism.log</p><p /></pre>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this method with Microsoft Support for two times. One at the first call and the second, last time</p>
<p>I have spoken with Microsoft support. They run in my computer a new tool released by Windows Development Team called clearcompressionflag.exe (At least, they told me that) and we restart my computer in safe mode. This tool didn't fix my error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, </p>
<p>1.- I don't have the update 1 installed.</p>
<p>2.-&nbsp;Update 1 (KB2919355) doesn't appear when I check for updates&nbsp;in Windows Update.</p>
<p>3.- I have downloaded KB2919355 and tried to install with same error (This step assisted by Microsoft Support).</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Is this issue specific to Windows 8.1 Update?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Yes, until this update I didn't have any problem with Windows Updates.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Which steps have you or the Microsoft Support Team have tried to fix the issue?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A lot of. All the steps you can Imagine. My support case id is: 1242492102.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Do you have any third party security software installed on your computer?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Yes. I have Bitdefender Antivirus.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Are you able to boot to desktop?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I don't understand this question. I boot to metro and I click on desktop tile.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks</span></li><li>

            Javier as you have surmised there are serious problems with this update which affect many users. Other than the proposed fixes and solutions which have been posted here since the day of the update there is not much you can do other to wait for Microsoft
 to hopefully figure out what the problem is and fix it. In the meantime you can continue to try all the suggestions in all the threads (which have been posted numerous times in numerous threads and sometimes even numerous times in the same thread) which may
 or may not work for you. You and others have support cases pending but support seems unable to fix the problem either. This will undoubtedly take some engineering from Microsoft. At this time, for many users there really is no fix yet.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the best way to explain, "I am just fed up with this!" I agree with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of threads about&nbsp;errors and&nbsp;Microsoft <span>
Support Engineers</span> only answer the same&nbsp;obviously&nbsp;steps again and again and after, you don't hear about them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, I didn't buy a Surface and I&nbsp;will buy an iPad for this reason and next, I'm thinking to move to Linux or Mac OS for the same reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't forget that today is 29th April. 25 days since errors and there's no solution or official answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>

<p><span><strong><span>1. Which operating system is installed on your computer?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>You may perform a system restore to an earlier point when the
 issue was not present. </span></strong></span></span><span><span><span><span>The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system
 files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Note: When you use System restore to restore the computer to a previous
 state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>To do this, there must be a System Restore point at which the logon was successful.</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>You may refer to the below links for assistance on performing a system restore -<br />

            Hi EszterBirck-Wilson,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />What happens when you try to open the Skype App? Do you get an error code? It is possible that Skype or your phone is not upto-date, so manually updating them is worth trying.

            Hi Eszter,
<br />seems you were lucky to use Skype till now.
<br />According <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/skype-on-lumia-950/592bc86b-97b2-4a72-a60a-7d67c32def78">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a> 
<br />Lumia 950 XL can no longer use Skype due to Skype system requirements.

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>Background: have been calling my mother back in Europe daily for ever, using Skype International plan. Recently when I try to dial her number, Skype just shuts down. Even after rebooting the phone and of course logging off and back again to Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be Lumina 950 related as the desk version would work (have no headset as I didn't need one).<br />
At any rate, I am sharing this info with you so you have more facts. I was about to purchase a new phone. Windows phone have been a failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            This does indeed sound like a bug... I would strongly suggest that you report it so that the develeopers are atleast aware of it:-
<br />
<br />1) Launch Skype
<br />2) Click on your round profile picture at the top left hand corner of the screen.
<br />3) Scroll down to 'Help &amp; Feedback' and Select it 
<br />4) Scroll down and Select 'Report a Problem'
<br />
<br />If this does not happen with other contacts, could you try to delete and re-add your mother as a contact. Alternatively, although it sounds silly, uninstalling and reinstalling is worth trying. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, you could use Skype for Web on your phone, and see if it is any better:-

<p>The Lumia 650 and 950 XL and non-XL (single SIM) versions support the latest/last build of Windows 10 Mobile (Fall Creators Update). As long as you have the phone updated, it is still currently supported. My Lumia 650 continues to function on Windows 10
 Mobile&nbsp;10.0.15254.547 running Skype 12.1815.210.1000. If the application fails, all you can do is uninstall and reinstall the App or try to update it, if it is not up to date. To address any other problems, you could always back up any data that is currently
 not backed up or synced, reset the phone to factory, then re-update the OS and the Skype App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be aware that Windows 10 Mobile is near End of Life as mainstream support/updates end on December 10, 2019.</p>

<p>Based on the system requirements that should not be the case, I have a similar issue and I have checked the system requirements. I have the latest build of Windows 10 Mobile 1709(10.0.15254.547) and the latest Skype 12.1815.210.0. based on this information
 we should still have support and at the very least should have been seeing some sort message warning of the changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would Skype stop supporting calling on their platform and not notify users of the changes. I have searched for something official from Microsoft and or Skype it does not exist.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 not recognizing any usb wifi devices.</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, even though I have a usb router conntected to my computer, it's showing that no adaptors are connected (the ethernet icon with the red circle and X). I know this device works, tried using my phone's hotspot, messing with drivers, using the
 "network reset", and also tried plugging in at different ports. But nothing seems to work, and I couldnt seem to find an answer anywhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi Tupe.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17****&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 Update, if it's too late to roll it back  I can help you shrink C by about 50gb in Disk mgmt to do a test Install to the shrink space, which will configure a Dual Boot you can sign into to set up to see if the problem goes away.  If so I'll then help you move into the new install and eventually delete the old one and recover its space.  Steps here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            thanks for the reply, sadly i've already tried most of what you suggested, and didnt work. my issue is also with a desktop PC, not a laptop, so I dont think theres any way to apply those solutions. The icon i'm seeing is the ethernet cable but with an
 x, indicating that no network adaptors are connected, and there are no options to select a network, despite that i have a usb network adaptor connected.

            All the steps I gave will work for desktops too.  You wrote in your original post that you had a USB router which means nothing, so I gave you the whole list of everything that works so at least something would work.
<br />
<br />Now that you clarified that you have a USB wireless adapter, does it work in another PC?  If not then I'd replace it with an inexpensive nano adapter Like the one I linked which has worked for everyone I've suggested it and so far no one has reported it failed.  
<br />
<br />The steps also take longer than 30 minutes to perform, so when you get a chance I'd actually complete them because at least one of them always works for countless thousands of people I've shared the list with.

<p>I can confirm that the adaptor itself is working on different computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I guess I'll try to re-itirate: I've already tried searching for an answer via google, and almost everything you have suggested were things that I already attempted in the past 2 or so hours, which is what has led me to ask here.</p>

            So how would we know what you'd tried already if you didn't tell us.  Merely telling us that you've tried everything you found on the web tells us nothing.  We still don't know if you've tried a single one of the steps we have to offer, until we offer them.  
<br />
<br />Please read what it says below my post.  Good luck.

<p>I'll try to say what happens with each one of the tips you've offered then:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. the icon that shows up is the "no internet adaptors are connected" icon. (The ethernet icon but with a red circle and an X)</p>
<p>2. using the troubleshooting tools gives a "troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem"</p>
<p>3. there is no option to toggle WI-FI on either my keyboard or the settings</p>
<p>4/5. I have previously attempted, and although wi fi was restored to other devices, my computer at some point gained the issue i'm having now.</p>
<p>6. Tried each one provided by the link, none of it appears to have affected.</p>
<p>7. although there doesnt seem to have been a driver update recently, the most recent one I was able to find did not fix it.</p>
<p>8. The option to roll back drivers is greyed out, my best guess is that windows already removed previous driver versions.</p>
<p>9. I am fairly certain this isn't an issue with the internet providers, as other devices are working fine.</p>
<p>10. If attempting to use a hotspot did not work, I doubt another adaptor would work.</p>
<p>11. Unfortuntly the router is a floor down from my computer, so ethernet does not seem like a viable option.</p>
<p>12. I tried uninstalling the two updates which were installed today, although only one of them was able to uninstall, it didnt seem to make a difference.</p>
<p>13. Ive made the mistake of never setting up a restore point.</p>
<p>14. This issue started today, not at that update.</p>
