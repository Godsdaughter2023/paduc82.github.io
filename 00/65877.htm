<h2>            USB Composite Device</h2>
                    I am trying to hook up a Brother Scanner ADS2000. &nbsp;It should be recognized by Windows 8 automatically, but it wasn't. &nbsp;I then tried to load the driver, but when I plug in the scanner, it reads it as a USB Composite Device. &nbsp;How do I get Windows 8 to recognize
 it?

            <p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try installing the latest chipset drivers and then check if the Scanner is recognized by Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also running a System File Checker Scan in elevated mode might help.</p>
<p>- In the Search Charms, type Command Prompt and right click on it and select Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>- Type SFC /SCANNOW and press.</p>
<p>- Wait till the process completes and restart the computer try to plug in the scanner and check if it is recognized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

    <title>Can the rubber strips on the underside be replaced&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon skeet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can the rubber strips on the underside be replaced&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For quite a while, the grey rubber strip on the underside of my Surface Book (the edge closest to you when typing) has been coming off periodically - and now it's gone entirely. (It's possible it's on a plane...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are replacements available? I really don't want the hassle of the whole base going in for servicing when it's&nbsp;<em>just</em> a rubber strip with double-sided adhesive that's required. I'd be perfectly happy to pay for the replacement (although judging by
 comments I've seen elsewhere, this isn't an uncommon issue), but it's unclear what the first step would be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had experience of this?</p>

<p>Don't bother! I really like this laptop but Microsoft has to fix some support issues. I will tell you what I did to solve the problem but allow me to get something off my chest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the nearest Microsoft store at the Natick Mall in MA and called the indicated number on the website. The voice menu was reminiscent of the grand inquisition but in the end, I managed to speak with a woman. She got my name and found my record and
 told me that my laptop is a few months over the warranty period and I would have to pay out of warranty service fee of $799! I asked if she was insane to even to offer this option to me to but a couple of 50 cents strips. Then I asked if she was a Natic store
 employee and she said, with a decided Asian accent, no she was not! I asked to be connected to the store she said she would but I "got disconnected". I dialed the same number once more and after another round of inquisition I spoke with another woman and asked
 if she worked at the Natic mall, she said no she was in New York! Microsoft, if you put a phone number for a store allow the customer to talk to someone at that store. Then she put me on hold and checked with someone. When returned she said that she found
 out they don't make them anymore! Do the new Surface Book laptops have a different set of pads underneath?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I bought a tube of Krazy Glue with the intention of putting a few drops on the strip and fixing it that way. Then, I had an idea and bought a bag of rubber bands. A couple of them were long enough to do the job and I picked one and simply put the
 rubber band around as seen in the attached pictures. It keeps the original strip in place and will probably provide a little extra friction to boot (no pun intended.) If I could find slightly wider bands I will replace this one but for the time being, my problem
 is fixed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Microsoft, you need to pay attention to QC and provide better support and service.
</p>

            Microsoft, I have the same problem. DO you really want your super expensive machines going around looking like that? NOBODY will want to buy Microsoft laptops when these images go viral. Let's just wait for Apple to get out a commercial on not buying a
 Microsoft laptop if you don't want it to look like a zombie.&nbsp; Actually, we've been asking for a solution for years now, so I don't mind if I suddenly do see Apply use this to their advantage so you guys would wake up!

<h2>            How do I add&#47;install a new font to Windows 10 Mail&#63;</h2>
                    I have successfully added/installed a new font in Windows 10. &nbsp;I know I did because It now appears in Windows 10's font applet. &nbsp;However, when using Windows 10 Mail, that new font does not appear there. Is this a bug or by design? &nbsp;Is there some other
 way to add fonts to Windows 10 Mail that I am not aware of?

    <title>The Temp Folder keeps filling up my C drive, PLEASE HELP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The Temp Folder keeps filling up my C drive, PLEASE HELP</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>The problem started when I updated my Windows 10 to the latest version (I think 1803) and then after one day my C drive was almost full (my drive is 190Gb and I always try to keep at least 100 GB free), I ran disk clean up but it just could free around 100Mb
 then I start by uninstalling some application and it kept getting full again, Then I installed WinDirStat to see where the problem is, then I noticed that TEMP folder is around 90-95 GB!!!!! After that I checked to see if it is ok to delete the&nbsp;folder contents,
 they said it is safe, so I deleted them. After few days the same problem occurred again. and it keeps filling up my drive, the speed is unbelievable around 1000 files in 10 minutes. I even tried deleting the folder content in safe mode, but as soon as I restart
 my computer it started to make these files again!<br />
</p>
<p>The image below shows my temp folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

    <title>Cannot access Help files in Strat-O-Matic games - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot access Help files in Strat-O-Matic games</h2>
                    <p>I play Strat-O-Matic baseball and football and am unable to open their help files. When I was using Windows 7 it worked but not in Windows 8.1 and not in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked with the game company's tech people and they said I would have to wait for Microsoft to release a patch for Windows 10 to fix the problem. The SOM community forum did not have a slolution either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what happens. When I try to enter Help files I am taken to Microsoft Support page and the following message is at the top:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Error opening Help in Windows-based programs: "Feature not included" or "Help not supported" "</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using Windows 8.1 I was not able to get the patch to fix the problem. Now&nbsp;that I am using&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;10 there is not even a patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am speaking on behalf of my fathers laptop,&nbsp;with windows 10 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok he somehow managed to completely be unable to use this laptop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>every option available (for dummies) has led to no possible solution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>He made an image, or system restore usb and still nothing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>any one with a help full suggestion.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Start your Fathers Laptop, then just after the Manufacturers logo disappears and Windows 10 tries to boot, press and hold the power button down for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down<br />
<br />
<strong>Do this Twice</strong><br />
<br />
On the third boot attempt, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment, from there you can access Startup Recovery, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to see if your father has a restore point you can revert the laptop to:</p>
<p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - System Restore</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no restore point, try Startup Repair</p>
<p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Startup Repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that fails, try booting into Safe Mode</p>
<p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Startup Settings, click Restart.</p>
<p>When the laptop restarts, press 4 to boot into Safe Mode</p>
<p>If you can get into Safe Mode, backup your fathers data at this point</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the first 2 options failed and you were able to boot into Safe Mode and backup your fathers data, your best option now is to reset the laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC</p>
<p>Choose to keep Files and Apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hope this Helps!</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2011 will not send e-mails</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows Live Mail 2011 and have recently upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;I use AVG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until last week I had no problem sending and receiving e-mails with Windows Live Mail 2011. &nbsp;On Wednesday 25/5 or Thursday 26/5 I stared having problems as the program would receive but not send e-mails. &nbsp;The settings are exactly the same as they were
 when I first set up Windows Live Mail in 2011 or 2012. &nbsp;The message I get is &nbsp;"Your SMTP server has not responded in 60 seconds. &nbsp;Would you like to wait another 60 seconds for the server to respond?" &nbsp;Then I get a choice of Wait or Stop. &nbsp;If I click on Stop
 it will stop trying to send e-mails and go on to receive e-mails (which It appears to do correctly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked with my provider who tells me that there is no problem with my account (as I am able to access the webmail and send and receive e-mails from there) and that the problem appears to be with Windows Live Mail 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone as far as to disable my Internet Security to check whether an update to AVG may have been causing a conflict, but it makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps I also get the following: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject "</p>
<p>Server Error: 421</p>
<p>Server Response: 421 4.7.0 mta1.gibtelecom.net closing connection</p>
<p>Server: 'mail.gibtelecom.net'</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC67</p>
<p>Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 25</p>
<p>Secure(SSL): Yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p>

    <title>Smaller taskbar&#63; &#40;Vertical Alignment&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shethblade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Smaller taskbar&#63;  &#40;Vertical Alignment&#41;</h2>
                    It's sort of like a bug that I've come to like as a feature.&nbsp; Ordinarily, there's a limit to how much you can reduce the taskbar by clicking and dragging the border back, about 60 pixels on my 1280 x 800 laptop.&nbsp; However, sometimes, after coming back from
 sleep or shutdown, the bar will have shrunk without my input to about 45 pixels, eliminating much of the space on both sides of the start button.&nbsp; I personally like it, so I'm wondering if there's a way to trigger this size on my own.&nbsp; I run 64 bit win7 pro.&nbsp;
 Here's a picture of the way it looks: <a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v64/falconliger/?action=view&amp;current=smallerbar.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I too have noticed occasional&nbsp;subtle changes in the metrics that define the sizes of things related to the Taskbar.&nbsp; In my case the button sizes change a little after I host a remote RAdmin session and the system switches out of / into Aero.</p>
<p>In the image above, it appears you are using large icons, however.&nbsp; Have you tried setting them to small?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <strong>Right-click</strong> on the <strong>Taskbar</strong> in an empty place and choose
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp; Check the Taskbar tab.&nbsp; Is the <strong>[ ] Use small icons</strong> setting checked?<br />
3.&nbsp; If not, try checking it and see if the size shrinks.</p>
<p>I have no personal experience with side-mounted Taskbars, so I'm not sure this will do the job, but it's worth a try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't work, it could be the clock that's making it&nbsp;stay that wide.&nbsp; What does the clock look like in the cases where you're seeing it a little smaller?&nbsp; Just smaller text?</p>

<p>-Small icons is the first thing that came to mind, too.&nbsp; Surprisingly, it's not related.&nbsp; But, you did make me realize.&nbsp; The DATE does not show with the smaller setup!&nbsp; And for whatever reason, that shrinking is related mostly to sleep mode and restarts,
 so I wonder if perhaps that time display has some very unusual side-effect on the taskbar GUI as a whole?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's certainly very unusual.</p>

<h2>            Win 8.1 - Special Pool Detected Memory Corruption error - Stuck in a never ending loop.</h2>
                    <p>Well, I never thought the vacation time I took off work over the holidays would end up with me this frustrated...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer had been running fine then all of&nbsp;a sudden I noticed while playing COD: Advanced Warfare that I was hearing windows sounds (to be exact - the two sounds you hear when you unplug then plug in a USB device). The mouse would slightly stutter and
 the keyboard would also...for a split second. I wrote this off as being an issue with the game but error message soon appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read the board and tried all the solutions people have offered up. The PC works fine in safe mode but that's about it. My error occurs right after you log in. I've tried downloading (on another computer) all the updated drivers for my PC but it doesn't
 seem to matter. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped. Any chance someone could take a peek at my .dmp and msinfo file?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Prem,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Catalyst Control Center is the host application software for your graphic driver by AMD.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to run <b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b> for any spyware or malware infection:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: The <b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b> expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again. Any data files that
 are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>If you are using AMD graphics card, I would suggest you to update the driver by downloading it from the manufacturer’s website:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. If you have any further issues on the computer, please post your question regarding Windows and we will be happy to help you.</p>

            I've this same problem since the last couple of days after trying to configure the "Switchable Graphics" option for a game. &nbsp;The steps I've taken are as follows:
<div><br />
<div>1. Ran scans with Malwarebytes - nothing reported</div>
<div>2. Tried to 'repair' Catalyst via the Setup.exe in the "C:/AMD/Support/13-9_mobility_win7_win8_64_dd_ccc_whql" folder - did not fix the problem</div>
<div>3. Un-installed and reinstalled Catalyst Control Centre - it installed BUT with some unspecified failure and seemingly without the video card driver(?) because there was no information on the driver I was using (in Device Manager - it only had yellow exclamation
 marks) and I had very limited graphics and display related options and games that worked before failed to run any longer.</div>
<div>4. Repeated step 3. and this time CCC installed properly, but, again seemingly without the graphics driver present.</div>
<div>5. Downloaded latest driver from AMD site and repeated above step(s) - no joy - still no graphics / display options beyond resolution change.</div>
<div>6. Was about to download from the Dell website (Alienware laptop), but the driver was the same one I already had on an external HDD - didn't bother</div>
<div>7. Went through a System Restore to a point a few days earlier (critical Windows update) - CCC still crashing but the drivers seem to be intact (i.e., graphics intensive games work and have suite of display / resolution options).</div>
<div>8. System Restored once again to an earlier point where DirectX was installed (*had this already at that point, so it must have been done superfluously during a game install) - CCC still crashing upon attempting to open it, but drivers still running.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Specs:</div>
<div>Graphics - AMD Radeon HD 7970 (2GB)</div>
<div>Driver - 8.14.1.6278&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I cannot open CCC and therefore cannot configure any games or applications (that haven't already been configured) to run using the dedicated graphics card, as they all default to Intel Integrated Graphics upon installation.</div>

            Update on my problem:&nbsp;<b>SOLVED.</b>
<div>Cause:<b>&nbsp;CORRUPT WINDOWS USER PROFILE.</b>
<div><br />
<div>My solution was to transfer my data to a new administrator profile ― i.e., make a new, clean profile. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is done by creating TWO new user Windows profiles (though I only used one new one) and copy-pasting the entire contents of Local Disk C: / Users
 / [username] <b><u>EXCEPT FOR ntuser.dat, ntuser.dat.LOG and ntuser.ini</u></b>&nbsp;to the same location in the new profile. &nbsp;To view all these "hidden" &nbsp;files, you must remove the "Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)" parameter&nbsp;―&nbsp;ALT &gt; Tools &gt;
 Folder options... &gt; View &gt; uncheck the applicable box &gt; Apply (*in the aforementioned user directory).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The method advised here - <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a>&nbsp;- is to create
<u>THREE</u> profiles, using one as an intermediary to transfer between the 'old' (corrupted) profile and the new, clean one. &nbsp;I forgot and simply copied from old to new, but it's been fine ever since.</div>

<p>I've searched through the forum topics and suggestions here and elsewhere, and still can't resolve this problem.&nbsp; I have an Xbox 360 S 4GB, to which I've added an additional 250 GB drive.&nbsp; I borrowed a copy of the original Halo Combat Evolved because I'm
 want to work my way though the entire game series.&nbsp; Placed the disc in the drive and got an error telling me to redownload the game.&nbsp; Odd, since I was trying to play from the disc.&nbsp; Did everything suggested in all the forums, but no luck.&nbsp; Could not install
 the game on either HD, either.&nbsp; The native 4GB drive is more or less empty, too, so there's plenty of room there.</p>
<p>So, I paid the $$$ to download the game from Xbox game center/live.&nbsp; Took a looooong time (I only have a DSL connection).&nbsp; When finished, still got the same message.&nbsp; More digging around revealed I might not have an
<strong><em>officially licensed</em></strong> 250 GB drive (Microsoft, I love you so much).&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; Transferred the downloaded game/files to the native/4 GB SSD in the Slim.&nbsp; Cleared the cache (and restarted) before and after the transfer.&nbsp; Tried to play the
 game, got the same error message.</p>
<p>Finally, if I truly can't play this game (even though MS says it's supported on my machine, and Live verified this before I downloaded it), is there any way to get my $$$ back?

<p>The Xbox original titles require an official Microsoft hard drive and will not work with the onboard 4GB flash memory or USB storage. This is because all the emulation files are contained on a partition of the Microsoft hard drives only. The only way to
 play these games on a 360 is to have an official Microsoft hard drive installed.

    <title>Windows Installer trying to install Ad-Aware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windlegends  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Installer trying to install Ad-Aware</h2>
                    My granddaughter thought she was helping me by putting Ad-Aware on my computer without asking me. I went into Control Panel and deleted the program then did a search for Lavasoft and Ad-Aware and manually got rid over everything I could find. Windows Installer
 keeps trying to install it. Each time I go into Task Manager or try to rename a file or play a download, I get the Windows Installer window. I cancel out of it but it keeps popping up every time. It's more annoying than my ex-MIL's tuna casserole. Can anyone
 help me get rid of this thing? I'm not all that computer savvy but I can follow simple instructions. Please HELP!

<p>There are some that will hide your files/folders so that you cannot see them normally. I would highly suggest running a scan of your computer with your antivirus/antimalware software. If you need it, you can also use the Microsoft Safety Scanner, it's free:</p>

            I am using Windows 8.1 so the SysRescue isn't an option.
SysRescue is not able to clean detected threats in Windows Vista 64-bit, and Windows 8/8.1
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Due to the file-system architecture of these operating systems, ESET SysRescue Live cannot clean threats detected during scanning. An updated version of SysRescue Live with the ability to remove threats on these operating systems will be available soon.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I already had show hidden files clicked in my Folder Options.</p>

<p>Not if you do the repair install following the instructions on the link I gave you above. All your documents and other personal files should remain intact. Only if you reformat the hard drive will you loose your data. I would also like to invite you to my
 personal computer support forum which is completely free. It's a new forum created last week.</p>

<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recently my girlfriend was in a rush to get access a file from her laptop. When she turned it on, Windows was configuring updates. She got impatient and forced a shutdown during the configuration (held the power button until the laptop turned off).
 She turned it on again and got to the vista loading screen where the bars were scrolling. But the problem was that they just kept scrolling and would not load the OS even after 10-15 minutes. She did a force shut down and turned the laptop on again. This time
 a screen came up telling her to start windows normally or to do a startup repair. She did the repair but it didn't work. I came over and tried to do a system recovery to a previous date, but the "catastrophic failure (0x8000FFFF)" error message came up and
 said that it was not able to be repaired. The computer still works in safe mode. Am I going to have to reformat her computer? Or is there something else I can do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>She is using a Compaq laptop and is running VISTA.</strong></p>

<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />
<br />
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span></p>

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<h2>            How to change default &#34;Save As&#34; &#34;File Type&#34; in MS Paint w Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a need to change the default "file type" when "saving as" to .jpg from .png. &nbsp;I need to do group batches of images that were extracted from video on an iphone. &nbsp;I do this on a regular basis, shooting video, and then grabbing images from them. &nbsp;Now
 I need to change them after import to my PC to .jpg files, to be able to tag them. &nbsp;My photo editing software doesn't recognize .pngs for tagging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so a quick way to change that default so it will save me like a million clicks switching back and forth everytime would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change that default file type in MS Paint?</p>
                </div>

<p>I just did find another way to do this as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charmes Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Change PC Settings &gt; Network &gt; Connections &gt; click on the wireless network that's currently active &gt; Switch between public and private. (This option is only available if the wireless connection is connected.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, the need to have to go through all those steps instead of just right mouse clicking on the network icon is beond me....?</p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Yeah you will need Skype for Business, with regular Skype the client can share the screen but cannot give you the control of his computer.
<br />
<br />And yeah both will need Skype for Business.
<br />
<br />Refer to this article to know exactly how it works.

<h2>            Stuck with a black screen with white circle of dots</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having trouble with my laptop.&nbsp; When I power up I get&nbsp;a black screen with white circle of dots.&nbsp; I've searched the internet for answers and nothing has fixed it.&nbsp; Here is a list of what I've done in the Windows Recovery Environment:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced Options&gt;Startup Repair</li><li>Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced Options&gt;Startup Settings&gt;Option 4: Enable Safe Mode</li><li>Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced Options&gt;System Restore
<ul>
<li>There were three restore points; none of them worked</li></ul>
</li><li>Troubleshoot&gt;Reset this PC
<ul>
<li>This didn’t work; I get a message that says “There was a problem resetting your PC.&nbsp; No changes were made.”</li></ul>
</li><li>Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced Options&gt;Command Prompt
<ul>
<li>Execute the command:&nbsp; sfc /scannow</li><li>I get the message “Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.”</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm kind of at a loss at this point.&nbsp; I saw where someone said unplug any USB dongles but I don't have any.&nbsp; Everything is backed up so I'm not too concerned about losing data.&nbsp; I just need my laptop back.&nbsp; There was an update that ran a few days ago.&nbsp; I'm
 pretty sure it didn't install correctly and that's whats causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

<p>Thank you for providing those details. We suggest creating Windows 10 installation media to help you with the issue that you are experiencing. To do that, please check this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>. Download the Media Installer of Windows 10 and perform a boot. Choose
<strong>Repair this PC</strong> then <strong>Startup repair</strong>. This method is quite different from the one that you’ve already performed using the Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, we suggest using the <strong>System Update Readiness tool (DISM)</strong> to help you fix Windows update errors. This will fix corruption errors that happen due to fail installation of Windows updates and service packs. Please refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">article</a></strong> made by one of our MVP
<em>ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)</em> and follow the steps on how to perform <strong>DISM</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If you need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.</span></span></p>
