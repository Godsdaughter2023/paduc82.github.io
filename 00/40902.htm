<h3> r-cube  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard &#38; Number pad</h2>
                    <p>My sculpt ergonomic keyboards and number pads changed performance recently.&nbsp; I suspect some change in Windows 10.</p>
<p>Number keys stopped working regardless of Num Lock state.&nbsp; Calculator, / *, - + buttons work as expected.</p>
<p>On keyboard, the first character typed does not always ppear ==&gt; appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updated drivers, changed batteries, rebooted computer and usb transceiver -- no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Dell Precision 5520, Win10 -- two months old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboard and number pad worked until a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 sculpt keyboards and number pads, one at each desk location. Two connect via docking stations, the via USB hub.&nbsp;
<strong>All three systems exhibit same issues, so I don't think it is computer HW or the devices.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise next action.</p>

<p>Hello Greg --</p>
<p>Thank you for the feedback.&nbsp; I had tried all things you suggested except changing computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did stumble on to this seemingly unrelated switch in the Mouse settings page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Use mouse keys when Num Lock is on"</p>
<p>This was in "on" position.</p>
<p>When I switched "off" number keys in the keypad began working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had turned the Num Lock on and off attempting to fix the problem before, but it did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The description of what this switch&nbsp;does is&nbsp;unclear -- especially in how it relates to the Sculpt 3-piece system.&nbsp; But my issue is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the missing first keystroke, my co-worker has noticed similar performance on a different keyboard.&nbsp; We're still troubleshooting this.&nbsp; Maybe computer related, but seems unlikely.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your help.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>When will Skype for Mac update to improve its headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            When will Skype for Mac update to improve its headset compatibility&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Updated to the new Skype for Mac and found the new version has absolutely terrible audio quality for the outgoing sound with Bose QuietComfort 35 headset (Bluetooth connection).&nbsp; There is considerable distortion and time delay on the sound and the person
 listening is lucky to be able to figure out 1 word in 5.&nbsp; It's completely dysfunctional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incoming sound is fine.&nbsp; The headset works perfectly with all other audio applications, and with the previous version of Skype (which is being affected by the Skype dropped calls issue that is current on Microsoft's problems page).&nbsp; I've tried Discord, the
 Skype alternative, and the audio quality is perfect with my headphones.&nbsp; It's only with the new update to Skype for Mac where it becomes impossible to communicate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a forum post (quoted below), it looks like the new Skype for Mac is only working with Logitech headphones?&nbsp; Is there any plan to update the software again and make it compatible with other headphones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to stay with Skype.&nbsp; But if the upgrades are going to make it dysfunctional, I'm afraid we're going to be forced into alternatives like Discord or Viber, which work.</p>
<p>

<h2>            USB Device Not Detected By Windows 7 DVD&#47;USB Tool</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am rying to make a backup disk for Windows 7 and i am using the Windows 7 DVD/USB Tool to burn the ISO into a flash drive and I had bought a SanDisk Cruzer Blade 8GB drive just for this. I run the tool and it says that no compatible devices were found.
 I even partitioned it into 4GB drives and it still doesn't detect what? What should I do??</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're not going to believe this... I spent about an hour trying to run the Windows 7 DVD/USB Tool
</p>
<p>ON WIN&nbsp;7 PRO. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just happened to have a brand new SanDisk 8GB Cruzer Glide, and thought I would try and resolve this issue... And I did... but not in a satisfactory way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received the same error as you... nothing I did worked even though the drive itself was working perfectly...</p>
<p>I then tried a bulk MicroCenter 4GB Flash Drive... and it worked 1st try.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the SanDisk Cruzer was listed a "FIXED DISK", but the MicroCenter was listed as "REMOVABLE"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the process of doing a search to try and find a way to change the FIXED classification to REMOVEABLE,
</p>
<p>I found the source of the problem. The USB Drive needs to be "REMOVABLE" for the tool to work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new SanDisk drives are intentionally set to show up as FIXED as the result of a Microsoft requirement for Win 8 !!! This makes them somewhat useless as a&nbsp;bootable USB Flash...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix for your problem is to buy something other than a new SanDisk... an old one would probably work.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just found out about this&nbsp;also, while I was looking into your problem....</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that to be Win 8 compatible, Flash Drives are required to recognized by Windows 8 as a Fixed Disk, and not Removable.... I saw USB_HDD mentioned...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That has nothing to do with the Safely Remove Hardware though... that's a bit different.</p>
<p>My SATA hard drives show up there also, when the BIOS is set to AHCI...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make a bootable drive out of your new SanDisk... I was able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The catch is that you CAN'T make a bootable Win 7 installation drive with it...</p>
<p>The Tool itself, and others,&nbsp;only recognize a "Removable Drive"... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I though that there was a way to select what type of drive it would be listed as, but apparently not.</p>

<p>Hey mate, did you also try deleting the marketplace data? If not check to make sure there isn't a partial download of the game on your HDD and delete the marketplace data and try to re-download again.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Delete the Marketplace System Data file</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 console also stores temporary files for the Xbox Games store. You may be able to resolve this issue if you delete the Marketplace System Data file.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>To delete the Marketplace System Data file, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1.On your console, go to Settings, and then select System. </p>
<p>2.Select Storage and then select your primary storage device. </p>
<p>3.Select System Items. </p>
<p>4.Select Marketplace System Data. </p>
<p>5.Select Delete. </p>
<p>6.Restart your console. </p>
<p>7.Try to buy or download the item again.</p>

<p>I see how much later my reply is... anyway, a similar thing happened to me. I bought CoD: BO2 from the marketplace. It was $60, and it has a no refunds policy. I began the download, and it gave me the infamous, "Can't Download CoD: Black Ops 2" message.
 I downloaded it again about 10 times, and each time it gave the same message. What can I do?</p>

            Hi Amardeep,
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:

            The only possibility is that you are not using right account to login. This has been the cause in almost all cases like this.

<p>I would try the troubleshooting guide steps on xbox support website ie clear cache etc. If problem persists your xbox wont work online ever again as new update checks if the seal on your xbox has been broken by an unauthorised micrsoft technician and if
 it has you now have an expensive dvd player. My console was serviced by a reputable and major UK retailer and now it wont update because they are not authorised MS tech. I believe there are 10's of thousands in the uk who will be affected by this, and many
 who dont use Live wont even know. Its a disgusting way to treat your customers, but it the only way MS know how to treat there customers apparently</p>

<p>You keep saying Unauthorized ok so... how are we the consumer supposed to know who is authorized and who is not a retalior can sell you a xbox all day but the same retalior cant service it ? OK........yeah that seems right... Microsoft has basically shut
 down any way for there to &nbsp; be a fair market.. They have cornered the market Produced a product &nbsp;that has(and there aweare of) a HIGH failure rate, give you no option but to use them to fix said product. Sounds like a Monopoly to me something that Microsoft
 is known for Right..................Just because something is legal dont make it right in Alabama it's LEGAL to marry your 1st cousin But that dont make it right!</p>

<p>No Xbox live member can help you with this its between you and Microsoft I'm afraid. If you've never had the Xbox opened or repaired by anyone else other than Microsoft and they say otherwise I can only suggest you contact consumer rights or something, no-one
 on this forum can sort this out for you.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Black Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe.4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Black Screen</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 4 that is potentially suffering from the "black screen of death". The keyboard lights up, the light on the back camera is on, it appears to be charging, but the screen is totally black. I've tried all of the DYI solutions: holding
 power button for thirty seconds, powering off and power button + volume up key for 15 seconds, volume +/- three times in under 2 seconds, letting the battery drain, attaching to an external monitor, using windows+P, windows+ctrl+shift+B. I have a bootable
 USB but can't use it without the monitor functioning....Nothing works. This is REALLY frustrating given the price of the device.... Does anyone have alternate ideas that don't require me to pay $480 for an exchange?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks!!

<p>
</p><p>Did you ever set up Remote Desktop connection for that machine? &nbsp; Otherwise, looks like you haven't tried using Narrator, though unfortunately you won't be able to use that unless you are at least getting a Lock Screen to start from.</p>

<p>Thanks Robert. I haven't tried remote desktop because the screen isn't on. Perhaps there is a way I'm not aware of to use remote access without the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried using the display port to hook to an external monitor without any success.</p>

</p><p>Different Joe?&nbsp; Do you have an external monitor you can try too?&nbsp; Otherwise a possible explanation for your symptom would be that the external monitor is primary and if that is where the default audio was you wouldn't be able to see or hear what was going
 on.&nbsp; However, if the Narrator command had managed to get you past the Lock screen then you could try&nbsp; Win+P, CursorUP, Enter&nbsp; to change the Display configuration.&nbsp; E.g. under the hypothesis you would be in either Second Screen Only or Extend (depending on
 what "black" looks like) so CursorUp, Enter&nbsp; would switch to Extend or Duplicate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the above would not explain not being able to get into the UEFI settings, e.g. to change the boot device order in order to try the bootable media in the USB port.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of for not being able to see anything there would be to
 have another machine that was working properly and then exactly simulate the steps that you would need to use to get into it and use it blindly.&nbsp; If you had some lights in your USB drive you would know that that had been successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

<p>Hi Purple Drink,</p>
<p>As you upgraded from Windows Vista to Windows 7 I feel updating the display drivers should possibly fix the issue. Update the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>Also refer the links below for more details on updating drivers:</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong></p>

<p>You might also want to contact <strong>MMORPG</strong> and see if they have any updates on the issue.</p>

<p><span>Hi dfahle,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>To help resolve your issue better I would like to ask few questions regarding the issue,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>May I know the exact error message you get?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get this error message when trying to launch Windows Install cleanup utility?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Or do you get this error message when you are trying to remove any program using Windows Install cleanup utility?</span></p>
<p><span>Suggestion:-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You get this error message if you had made any change to a program, which sometimes results in missing .dll file if the changes have not been done properly.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you did make any software program changes in your computer I would suggest you to perform a System Restore on your computer and then try to make the changes
 you want to.</span></p>

</span></span></span><strong><span>Perform SFC scan on your computer</span></strong><span>, which

    <title>Unacceptable&#58; Critical Error Start Menu Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bubeaucoup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unacceptable&#58; Critical Error Start Menu Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>It is completely unacceptable that this error with the Windows 10 start menu still has not been solved. All the proposed 'fixes' either do not work at all, or just temporarily. To me it is clear that corruption of user profiles is causing this issue, but
 the way in which a corrupted user profile should be fixed leaves a lot to be desired (and for me it doesn't even work). Can't Microsoft provide a user profile fixing utility?</p>
<p>To expect your customers to go into the registry is ridiculous. The last resort, a clean re-installation of Windows 10, is just as unacceptable in view of the feeble support of keeping your installed programs and settings. I've re-installed Windows 10 numerous
 times only to still get the Critical Error ("we'll try to fix it the next time you sign in" --- ha, ha) back again after some time.</p>

            <p>Hi Jayant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any answer that offers different solutions from the chewed-out ones already out there. Ultimately they all lead to reinstalling windows all over again with, if you are lucky, all your documents intact and all your installed programs gone.</p>
<p>This is not a desired answer. All the Powershell stuff, creating another account (programs gone) etc. do not work. I want to be able to use my PC and not constantly having to repair it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The least Microsoft could do is to automate all the Powershell stuff so that it would be a one-click exercise for the end user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Bubeaucoup</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. On the affected PC the event viewer constantly shows:</p>
<p>Error User Profile Service</p>
<p>Event ID 1542</p>
<p>Windows cannot load classes registry file</p>
<p>DETAIL - Access is denied</p>

            You don't mention what version of Windows 10 you're using (you can check via running "winver"), but the 10586 (Fall update) version should significantly improve Start Menu reliability.

            In stead of fiddling around with user profiles, reinstalling packages, etc. I would advise everyone with this issue to perform a Repair Installation with an in-place upgrade as described on
<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html</a>. It takes a long time, but it did fix the problem without losing application installation and/or data.

            <p>Even the restore work around only works temporary. The problem will return!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the restore in December 2015 after trying all known fixes without result.
</p>
<p>The restore resolved the problem for one and a half month. Out of the blue the problem returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen countles postings on this issue and it seems root cause and solution are still unknown after a few years....</p>

<p>
</p><p>My Start Menu, Action Center etc. disappeared earlier today. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After several hours of investigation etc. (including most of the suggestions given on many threads that deal with this issue) I have had some form of success using the temporary fix described
<a href="https://thespecter.net/blog/technology/workaround-for-the-critical-error-your-start-menu-isnt-working-error-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>(*). That fix suggests that the hive can in fact be loaded by manually loading it, which immediately restores the Start Menu and Action Center on my PC (noting that I haven't tested much to see if it's all working). This suggests the root cause of the
 Start Menu and related problems is whatever causes the hive to fail to laod.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a hack to make the "fix" permanent that I will try next (as well as keeping an eye out to see how well things work with the fix in place). However the hack offends my sensibilities as it in effect persists a registry key and hive that the User Profile
 Service is supposed to transiently create/load respectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this leads someone at Microsoft to figure out why the User Profile Service thinks it can't load the offending hive, when regedit running under an ordinary administrative account seems to be able to. It may be that the logged event does not accurately
 describe the root cause of the failure to load by the Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(*) In my version of regedit, where the instructions say "File - Connect Hive" I must do "File | Load Hive..."</p>

<h2>            AMD Radeon HD 8400 and Windows 10</h2>
                    I just did a computer check to test my computers compatibility with Windows 10, and the only problem it found was with AMD Radeon HD 8400. It says that it will have issues with display. What exactly does that mean and how bad will the issues be? Will I
 be unable to upgrade to Windows 10?

            <blockquote>I have the same question except I have an AMD Radeon HD 8650G. My drivers are up to date. Will they fix this before the roll out?
</blockquote>
<p>It is best to ask AMD this isn't really a Windows question. Which is why I gave the link to the AMD website where they can check your PC or Laptop or whatever for you using the "The AMD Driver Autodetect tool which is designed to detect the model of graphics
 card and version of operating system installed in your computer. Our Autodetect tool can only be used on systems running the Microsoft® Windows operating system and/or AMD RadeonTM graphics. It does not work on Linux® systems, Apple Boot Camp systems or AMD
 FireProTM graphics products. "<br />
<br />
It updated mine and I had installed all the updates that Windows offered including one for this. Then, when I ran an update check with Windows they wanted to roll back the Update AMD had just downloaded to my device so I hid that update rollback from Windows
 and am going with AMD for now.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's the link to the AMD site: <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said all that...remember that once you have reserved your Windows 10 Upgrade Microsoft will begin downloading various updates to your device between now and the end of July with the idea of making the actual installation go much faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These updates and tweaks and jiggery-pokery will be going on in the background and you probably won't notice them in the slightest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now don't go paranoid on me...all of this is so Windows 10 will work BEST for you. (And for me).<br />

                    <p>I have a non-admin account.&nbsp; I click on Change UAC.&nbsp; I get a prompt for an administor password. I give the password. But in change UAC dialog box I get the message "You must be logged on as an Administrator to on this computer to select this setting" when
 I choose a lower setting, one that I need to test with.</p>
<p>I am not surprised an non-admin needs and admin password to change UAC.&nbsp; I am surprised given &nbsp;an Admin password still does not let you change it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Since I can't change it when logged on as non-admin, is there a way for an admin account to change another account's UAC settings?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you haven't tried to run an SFC scan,&nbsp; I would try that.&nbsp; Does this happen on another standard user account?&nbsp; If you don't have another account, I would create one and see if you can duplicate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would also try this.&nbsp; Give the standard account admin rights, then see if you can change the settings.&nbsp; Then take away the admin rights just to see if that will let you change the settings.</p>
<p>SFC:</p>

<p>
</p><p>can do control-alt-delete and come up with those functions, but nothing to get me to anyplace useful!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task manager says no apps running!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can look at network connections and says connected, but doesn't do any good, since we can't get to anything!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like another pain in the butt WINDOWS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't even find anyplace to get help on this junk!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really afraid to try it on all my other computers running&nbsp; Win 7 Ultimate if it doesn't work on Windows 8!</p>

<em>Ashampoo </em>is the culprit. Many complainants here did NOT clean up their PCs or use any computer utility.</span></p>

            Hi Dave
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I noticed you are on the older Windows 10 1803 release, which has since been succeeded by the newer versions 1809 and 1903. I would recommend you try upgrading the system to 1903 to see if it corrects this issue. 
<br />
<br />Go to the following page then click 'Update Now'
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists I might suggest to capture a user mode dump of the crash which will give more information on the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as dump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time dllhost.exe crashes&nbsp;should
 be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\</strong></em><em><strong>dllhost.exe</strong></em><em><strong>]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
After&nbsp;Com Surrrogate&nbsp;(dllhost.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via a public folder on&nbsp;OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>More info on collecting user-mode dumps:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787181(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787181(VS.85).aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To stop the creation of the user mode dump files run the following registry file:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\</strong></em><em><strong>dllhost.exe</strong></em><em><strong>]</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can delete the C:\CrashDumps folder anytime.</p>

    <title>Cannot retrieve account email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pouffyjupiter60  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot retrieve account email</h2>
                    
<p>So long story short I need to get my email on the account (I made the account so long ago I forgot which email I used) Anyways, I had the account on my xbox but I removed it from my xbox because I tried to add my xbox live to it and somehow I accidently
 created the account in Belgium and I am from the united states and usa codes wont work on foreign accounts. I made the account in 2008-2009 so my phone number is different now and the only way to get your email through xbox support is to provide verification
 with those items. What can I do? I have my information, and same console it was created on.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi CassieGEE,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question on Windows Vista Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will recommend you to try the following steps to fix the issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Start and then right click on Computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Manage.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Device manager on the left hand side of the computer management window.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the right hand side, expand USB Controllers.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click on each USB controller and click on uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>NOTE:</span></span></strong><span>
 Make sure you do not have any USB devices attached to the machine.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>In my Windows Live Photo Gallery 2011 it was editing some pictures and I accidentally hit the x on the fix pane, which closed the fix pane. &nbsp;I can't figure out how to put the fix pane back on when I double click a picture.</p>

<p>Ok Microsoft this is completely stupid and will be *** a lot of your fans. My fiance and I have 2 xbox's so we picked the family plan so our Gold is under 1 membership. Now you want us to go back and pay for seperate accounts? It's stupid. "Xbox one will
 only need one member with Gold access on a console." So?! Me and my fiance love playing CoD together and we will have 2 seperate xbox ones so again you are
<strong>[MOD REMOVED]</strong> your loyal fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

You can read about any sort of changes being made to your&nbsp;<span>family</span>&nbsp;pack&nbsp;account in regards to the conversion to individual memberships by visiting&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/parental-controls/family-pack-convert-individual-member-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this

You will be given time remaining on the&nbsp;<span>family</span>&nbsp;<span>gold</span>&nbsp;pack plus 3 months for each&nbsp;<span>family</span>&nbsp;member that is split into an individual account. After that time is up if those accounts with

<p>Please provide support,</p>
<p>I have a Xbox 360, and had a family plan. My wife and I were playing online with another couple who also had a Xbox 360, and a family plan.</p>
<p>When you killed the family plans, my account reverted to Gold and my wife's reverted silver.</p>
<p>Now when we attempt to play online with the other couple, the games states that the wives require their own Gold accounts.</p>
<p>Please provide support as we would very much like to finish these games as a group.</p>

<p>Hello DoG Cryo DL &amp; Koby1Kanoby,</p>
<p>It is correct what hassassinade said, the family pack subscription which is now in the past, will stay in the past. But you should have been given a 12 Month membership for the primary account holder and the other 3 family pack members. Not quite sure if
 it including an extra 3 bonus months on each family member.</p>
<p>The best advice I can give is go to <a href="http://support.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com</a> enter in support chat and stress the situation with the agents. They can look in to this and see what was given out in regards to the cancellation of the Family Pack.</p>
<p>If they also can see that you haven't been given what you're owed they can escalate it to higher support who will be able to investigate and resolve the situation.</p>
<p>Please let me know how you get on.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<p>Well the advice you receive is the advice you should take naturally right? Who knows I might get someone advising me to get a PS4 while I still have a 360 and Xbox one, so I did. and I never even played it once as I was disgusted by the feel of the controller.
 It got sold after about 3 months of not using it.</p>
<p>I'm not going to try convince you to stay as I believe people will make their own choices. But it does to be blunt at the same time non-offensive (advisded me to do the same. Lookings like we won't be finishing our xbox games/he asked me to jump and i asked
 how high?) do what ever makes you happy.</p>
<p>Although as far as loyalty is concerned you're considering leaving the Xbox LIVE service because you cannot be bothered to ait a few days for a resolution you apparently seem to be entitled to. That's picture perfect loyalty right there. You know, if I was
 in your situation I would do the complete opposite to what you're considering. I've almost been a member for 6 years and there has been times where I've been aggravated through a few problems and escalations, but I stuck with Xbox LIVE. And I wouldn't have
 it any other way.</p>
<p>I hope you find new enjoyment in the Sony PlayStation Network. At the end of the day it's just a preference, and if you've been a member on Xbox LIVE for a while, there may be some features you will be missing out on upon switching.</p>
<p>Goodluck Koby!</p>

<p>Thanks Daniel for your honesty.</p>
<p>After inquiring, the resolution to restoring the services I (and apparently many others) was happily paying for would increase to an unacceptable dollar amount. Note that this does not even include a resolution for my two kids’ accounts that I have not mentioned
 previously.</p>
<p>I’m bewildered as to why Microsoft is discontinuing this awesome service (not just for me, but in general), when it clearly inspired loyalty and the online “Jump in” community that reached beyond the hard core gamers.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s stubbornness and arrogance around the release of the One console contributes to my specific situation as coming across as yet another stubborn and arrogant money grab.</p>
<p>Even if Microsoft back pedals on the Family Plans too, the damage has already been done to my small online community.</p>

<p>I was a part of that disconinued service that ended last year as well. Each family member got 12+3months of gold and I also got the same for the account holder.I was very annoyed too as I didn't want the service to end, and I agree with some aspects that
 you are typing. But fact of the matter is there is nothing that can be done about the service at all. Everyone acts differently in situations your situation is seemingly to give up with Microsoft and its servies, mine isn't. I enjoy the service and the features
 of being gold rather than what subscription I have. If you are really going to leave this Xbox LIVE service I hope you find enjoyment elsehwere. Take care.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<p>I tried to work with MSFT support to simply have the remaining 9 months of my account (that I don't use and was simply set up to manage my son) over to my son's account and MSFT told me no and all I can do is cancel and pay full price for his subscription
 and the 9 months remaining would be lost.</p>
<p>The MSFT customer service is very poor - I was considering getting an Xbox ONE for Xmas and upgrading but after this experience and how unwilling they are to work with me just shows how out of touch MIcrosoft is.</p>
<p>Very disappointed customer.</p>

<p>Man Microsoft is doing a GREAT job of convincing people to buy the Play Station instead of XBox One. &nbsp;The family plan was their one edge, with that gone. &nbsp;Were on the fence with upgrading our oldest son's system this Christmas, PS it is now. &nbsp;Just ordered
 the PS4, no more paying for his subscription. &nbsp;Our youngest will be without the Gold Live and we will pay one last for our middle, his PS4 will be next Christmas. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            expat support</h2>
                    
<p>I'm English living in France. Although my MS account region is France, I've setup my Xbox One to be English language and region UK (because I can't choose France as a region when the language is English - thanks a lot Microsoft). The big question is what
 support is there in games for multiple languages ? This information is NEVER shown on the packaging of an in-store game disk. The best you get in France is "jeu en français" (game in french), but that doesn't mean the disk doesn't
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">also</span> have the english language version on it. If you see what I mean. Trouble is, I can't tell by reading the packaging and 70€ is an expensive experiment.</p>
<p>If I buy and download a game from the French online Market Place will I be able to play it in English (after switching my Xbox One language &amp; region back to English) ? AC4 especially. If I buy a game in a french store, will the disk load in English ?</p>
<p>Many thanks for help. Would love to buy and download stuff locally, but will only do so if I can actually play in English.</p>

<p>It sounds like your hard drive is failing. I'm assuming that D:\ is a hard drive or a hard drive partition and not a CD/DVD drive.</p>
<p>Test the hard drive with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the drive mftr.'s website or use Seagate's SeaTools For DOS. You will create a bootable CD with the file you download. You will need third-party burning software to do this such as Roxio, Nero,
 or the free ImgBurn. Burn as an image, not as data.<br />

Boot with the CD you made and do a thorough test of the drive. If it fails any physical tests, replace it.</p>
