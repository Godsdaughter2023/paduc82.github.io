<p>I could find nothing useful about that specific error message (some information on what it means, but nothing helpful about how to fix it). And the full backup problem may be related (it just may be manifesting the problem in a different way.&nbsp; Are you using
 the same types of disks (not using a CD+RW in a device not designed for such disks or anything like that)?&nbsp; You can't send pictures to disks, but can you send data to disks?&nbsp; Check out the following articles and see if any of them help:</p>

I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, I would try to exchange the drive for another one that you know works fine (maybe from a friend's computer or another computer you have) and see if the problem goes away.&nbsp; Then try the drive in the other computer and see if the problem
 starts happening there.&nbsp; That will pretty much narrow down the cause to the drive or the computer.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Shadow Copy Fail. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomtalk24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Shadow Copy Fail.</h2>
                    <p>Thought I had this fixed but I dont. My backups have been failing since Windows 8. This is a clean install of windows.
</p>
<p>The VSS service is working fine, check disk has given no errors. I have done everything MS support tell people to in other posts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>VSS error: Unexpected error CreateFileW(\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy74\,0x80000000,0x00000003,...). hr = 0x80070001, Incorrect function</p>
<p>Operation: Processing PreFinalCommitSnapshot</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant view any hidden folders that may relate, Shadow Volume etc in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works for the first few backups, on that last attempt it was one 1GB folder to test. RestorePoints are no longer working either. I know this is a common problem. I need a better backup than FileHistory and need to send a MagicPacket to wake to server
 up so FileHistory is not ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>We can try, I have now setup Rsync but would love it if my OS could do the backup (kinda why I brought it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is while the backup is creating the "Shadow Copy".&nbsp;In this installation of the OS it happens at 9% every time.
</p>
<p>No changes, this was a fresh install. I had backed up to a remote HDD 3 times in an hour to test if it would work. The 4th this happens again.
</p>
<p>Not connected to a domain. My home network is basic.</p>
<p>Not with any Windows based image backup software. I have had to resort to Linux RSync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I have extended the "System Reserve" disk to 450mb. Before this I could perform 1 backup before I got the same error as this Windows installation. Each time in the last month while working on a solution, I have re installed Windows once the
 backups started failing. Each time prior to the System Reserve drive extension it would do 1 System Image backup, after then as I said it would fail. So would System Restore Points.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is helpful information. </p>

    <title>Microsoft Pen Protocol - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ariannacjw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Pen Protocol</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I am currently looking for a pen to use with my Surface 2 RT and i stumbled across the Adonit Ink Stylus.
</p>
<p>I contacted their customer service to ask if the pen is compatible with my surface, they said it is if the surface supports Microsoft Pen Protocol.
</p>
<p>Does anyone know if the Surface RT supports Microsoft Pen Protocol, or if there are any good pens for my Surface?
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>There are two types of pens, active and capacitive. Active pens require a battery, some capacitive pens require a battery but most do not.</p>
<p>The RT only supports capacitive pens and does not support the Microsoft Pen Protocol. &nbsp;All the Adonit ink stylus pins I see are active pens which are not supported on the RT.</p>
<p>There are fine point capacitive pens available.</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to me, I figured out a work around. Or at least I beleive it is.. Instead of having the audio set to HDMI I changed it to Stereo and it worked again. IT might be the setting it should be, even if it is set to output sound through
 an HDMI cabel to the stereo.</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33; Can&#39;t get rid of partition on SSD&#33;</h2>
                    <div>Here's the story. I bought this new Samsung 840 250GB SSD.</div>
<div>I first did a clean install of windows 7 on it and it worked fine. Windows installed without much problem and everything. Then something didn't look right about the partitions. It looked like because I had all my HDDs connected while installing windows
 on the SSD the windows created the system reserve on the old HDD rather than the SSD. So I went back and decided to start from scratch with all the HDDs except for the SSD disconnected. I tried reinstalling windows on it but this time it didn't work. I tried
 formatting the SSD and it just gave me an error saying windows couldn't install on a GPT disk. I went into bios, made sure the PC was booting from the UEFI DVD drive and it still kept giving me the same error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I then booted up my old HDD. I tried formatting my SSD and now I can't delete the partition!</div>
<div>This is what my disk set up looks like:</div>
<div>[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/xnVE2HB.jpg[/IMG]</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I click "extend volume" on the "New Volume (G:)" disk, it says "there is not enough space on the disk(s) to complete this operation".</div>
<div>If I try to create a "new simple volume" on the "unallocated" partition, it says the same...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Have I destroyed my new SSD now?! I just want it to work like a new clean disk... :(</div>
                </div>

            <p>I would suggest that you remove the 3rd disk to avoid any confusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the Run box and enter <strong>Diskpart</strong> and click OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Confirm the UAC dialogue and a DOS style box will open with a "DISKPART" prompt. Diskpart is a drive and partition management command line utility which has extended functions beyond what is possible in disk manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type <strong>list disk</strong> , it should show your SSD as Disk 1 but check from the size info in the response</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type <strong>Select Disk 1</strong> (if that is the SSD) It will respond "Disk 1 is now the selected disk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type <strong>detail disk</strong> it will list the volumes of that disk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each volume (should only be one) type <strong>select volume=</strong><em>?</em> for each and then
<strong>delete volume </strong>in each volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type <strong>select disk 1</strong> (same as above) to refocus on the SSD drive as a whole and then
<strong>convert basic</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally <strong>exit</strong> to close diskpart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now find in Disk Manager the whole drive is unallocated and is a Basic disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are certain you are unlikely to use bitlocker or use multiboot you can block the creation of the System Reserved partition by creating a partition occupying the whole drive whilst it is&nbsp; connected to the alternative O/S. Reconnect with the SSD as
 the only drive and install as normal, Windows 7 does not need to have the system reserved created.</p>

That -- a&nbsp;<b>clean</b>&nbsp;disk -- is exactly what it takes to convert GPT to MBR (or vice versa) with&nbsp;<b>diskpart</b>:

<div>Without&nbsp;<b>clean</b>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<b>convert</b>&nbsp;<b>mbr</b>&nbsp;won't work, and without&nbsp;<b>convert</b>&nbsp;you're stuck with GPT. &nbsp;And if I recall it correctly Windows 7 does not like to boot from a GPT disk, unless it's a 64bit version on a box with UEFI (or similar.)

    <title>I want to be able to Play Gears again - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> o5hjt theninja  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to be able to Play Gears again</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. My name is Nicholas and I have run into a strange occurrence. A few weeks ago, when I was about to Play Gears of War 2, I was presented instead with a message. A message which says roughly, that I had some kind of setting on that prevented me from
 play games online. I found this to be very troubling. I knew that my gold membership wasn't supposed to expire until sometime in October, so why was Gears of War 2 telling me this? I recalled that I had play Gears of War 2 earlier in the week for sure. I remember
 it wasn't a particularly hardy controversial match really. I was playing Guardian game type under Social Matchmaking. One of the other team's players seemed to have host and I fared admirably for going up against the opposing team of which had host, as I have
 already stated. I didn't make any grand remarks at the end of the game. I was talking to one teammate during the game though; but as I said, I believe the opposing team had host. So I concluded that it was not likely the last game I played online. What I did
 was go through various settings, try changing one or two things and then going back - but when I did go to multiplayer in the main menu of Gears of War 2 it brought me to Local game and any attempt to switch it to play online would meet with the same message
 as before. So after looking through the videos of Xbox 101 and getting nowhere, I decided to try another game. I picked Halo: Reach. I went to the Multiplayer lobby and nothing seemed a-miss. I got into a game and there was no problem - and in fact it was
 not only my first time playing Halo: Reach in a long time, but I ended up with the highest score on both teams. So I feel compelled to think that I have been banned from Gears of War 2. Here is something interesting: I tried Gears of War [1] and I was able
 to play online with no problem. So I think: I think that I have been banned from Gears of War 2 and Gears of War 3 and Not Gears of War [1] because Gears of War [1] was released much beforehand to whatever my offense is. --- But there is the possibility that
 the developer: Epic Games has did things differently for Gears of War 2 and 3 to where my settings did for some reason change and I can't play.<br />
So skip forward to&nbsp;<span>September 20</span>: I go to a midnight release of Gears of War 3. I come home with a Limited Edition that I did have trouble acquiring at the last moments. I spent the extra money, because
 the Gears of War series is one of my favorites and I have been looking forward to Gears of War 3 for a long while now. But, as I suspected, I was greeted with a similar message to before, when I tried to play online with Gears of War 2. My setting didn't allow
 for me to play online. But I haven't changed any setting - Because I just bought my game. So I do feel that I have been banned for sure. It turns out that I am not the only one who got banned (or whatever the case is). The other members of my clan have also
 been banned.<br />
My Xbox Live Friend, associate and clan member told me to email a specific email address at Epic Games; but I have yet to hear back from them. I tried calling a number I found at their website but after following the instructions, they told me to go to&nbsp;<a href="http://microsoft.com/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>microsoft.com/games</span></a>.
 Very strange to me since I am only banned [seemingly] from two of their games.</p>
<p>I emailed the support section of Microsoft and they responded and told me I was banned from Gears of War 2 for one or more violations of the Xbox Live Terms of Use. They didn't tell me what I did though, I am supposed to know what I did &amp; I don't. So that
 does not help my feeling of being wrongfully banned.</p>
<p>Two of our clan members have been banned from Gears of War 2 before and while, I do not know if they received the same message as me, I know that it has happened to my friends before.<br />
Today however, one of the two clan members I just mentioned told me he was unbanned. He told me to come here and to write what has happened here. SO:<br />
My current situation is that I am using my second account to play gears online. I had to use extra money I shouldn't have to spend to play a game I spent extra money on for all the extra content that I don't get to use. Or I could use the Season Pass and other
 content such as the Adam Fenix Multiplayer Character, but it would be on my second account. I don't have the money to spend on putting such valuable content - both in monetary value and availability - on my second account. I bought it for my primary account.
 The one I play all my games on. So to be put in a situation where, I am sitting on content I paid for that I can't use, &amp; having to pay for Gold Membership on a second account to play 1 game b/c I was banned on my primary account for reasons that have not
 been made entirely clear to me feels very unfair. And I would like to appeal against my ban. Since this seems to be the way to do it: I am here.</p>
<p>I do not need to be un-banned from Gears of War 2, necessarily - I assume that being banned from Gears of War 2 is what Got me banned from Gears of War 3 by the time I put it in my Xbox, so it would be nice to know more and even be un-banned from it - but
 I firmly protest being banned from a game on a GamerTag that I have not even gotten to play said game on. It seems like a travesty. Especially since - if the community was so much against my playing Gears of War, that it would show when I play on my second
 account.<br />
I am told that my fellow clans' member got un-banned by posting on this forum (I believe), so I await a response in the near future.</p>

<p>Well it may look that way but I was referred to come to here and put forward what I have to say about the predicament I am in. It does look as though we posted one after another, but that is not the point. Apparently they were not told why they were banned
 either. All I know is that I apparently have a violation of one or more counts of the Xbox Live Terms of Use. Or so they say. Why that would only affect my being able to play Gears of War 2 and/or Gears of War 3 - I don't know: But not telling us doesn't help
 us as individuals get passed whatever it is we are accused of doing. And I would be really interested in hearing if we are doing something wrong as a group of people - but there has not been adequate explanation as to why we are banned.</p>

                    <p>About two weeks or so&nbsp;ago, I was able to play music on my Xbox 360 from my phone. But after starting it up today, it will recognize my phone as a portable device, but for some reason it will say "No songs found" despite it working in the past. Is there a reason for this? Is it possible there's too much music on my phone for it to work??</p>

<h2>            Mouse and keyboard stopped working in Windows XP Media Center edition</h2>
                    I moved my Gigabyte Media Center and on boot the mouse and keyboard suddenly stopped working. Works fine to access BIOS and F8 key to get to safe mode -
<u>which also has no mouse or keybpard functionality</u>. So with any form of Windows I have no input control. It is not a fault with the keyboard as it works in boot up mode. Tried alternative USB mice and keyboards all to no avail. There are no PS2 ports
 on the machine. I've found a few examples of this fault on the web but no real answers. Seems like the windows drivers for mouse and keyboard are corrupt? But how do I get in to reinstall - machine is from now defunct Evesham, I do not have a recovery disk
 or serial number. Any help woudl be gratefully accepted!<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I work in a business with 1800+ machines. Since the May 2017 Security &amp; Critical patches, the Microsoft LifeCam VX-2000 has stopped working in hangouts on Google. The camera performs fine with all other application but this. We have a huge number of people
 who use the camera for meeting etc. This only happens with PCs/Laptops that have an integrated camera. The workaround is to disable the integrated camera but users have restricted access as any other business and are not able to do this. We have tried all
 troubleshooting like any other IT department (uninstalling reinstalling drivers trying old drivers new drivers) but in vain. Just wondering if this is a known issue or anyone else has reported it. &nbsp;BTW we use Windows 7 Enterprise in our company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Applications made by third party services sometimes caused by incompatibility concerns with the device with a different manufacturer. Skype offers calls, messages, video, and sharing convenience with Microsoft product users. It would be best that you use
 Microsoft LiveCam VX-2000 with Skype since they are compatible with each other. </p>

    <title>Exiting screensaver problem Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Exiting screensaver problem Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever my PC's display changes to the screensaver, in order to exit the screensaver and get back to i.e. an open tab, app etc... I have to press both the "Control" and "ESC" buttons simultaneously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an easier way of doing this, such as just tapping the "Space Bar", or something with my mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Safe to set Maximum Processor State to 99&#37;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tennousu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Safe to set Maximum Processor State to 99&#37;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, just recently bought a Dell G7 15 Gaming Laptop (Intel i7 8750H with Nividia Geforce GTX 1060 with Max-Q) from the Memorial Day Sales.
<br />
</p>
<p>During extended gaming sessions I'm getting close to around 90 C according to HWMonitor on the CPU (GPU seems fine, peaking around 70-75 C ). I've been looking online for possible solutions. One solution I found is to go into the battery/power settings and
 change the Maximum Processor State while plugged in from 100% to 99% (Minimum Processor State is untouched). This seems to help immensely, bringing my CPU temperatures down to a more reasonable 60-65 C.&nbsp; I'm not very tech literate, and I'm not sure what exactly
 this is doing to my laptop. Is this safe to do, and will it harm or damage my laptop in the long term?
</p>

            Hey Tennousu,
<br />
<br />This is quite safe, I did this with my MacBook Pro. In fact, it's safer to reduce the maximum state rather than to increase it, as heat can be quite an issue. Not only it reduces the life of your fan bearings (like the intake and exhaust fans in your laptop) and motor, it's also not so healthy for the CPU (and even the GPU) to be hot all the time, it also ages rather rapidly. Keep it at lower temperatures and you should be golden, you probably should invest in a cooling pad to further accomplish this.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any additional questions about this, but I hope this helps.

<br />
<br />That's fine and totally understandable, I had the same anxieties with my rMBP when I first got it... but once you do it, you'll figure it's nothing to fear.

<h2>            Apps Won&#39;t Work Anymore.</h2>
                    None of my apps will work anymore. Not even the app store. Netflix, Hulu, Kindle, none of my apps will work anymore. I am on Windows 8.1, and i don't if the update to 8.1 broke them or not. I can't remember the last time they worked. Whenever I open up
 an app, i get a message saying "There seems to be trouble with you network connection right now, please try again later. Error Code:B1-N102." My network connection is full bars, and nothing else internet related is affected at all. Any help would be really
 appreciated. <br />

            <p>Hi Aidan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven’t already run the apps troubleshooter, here is a link to download it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the troubleshooter didn’t detect any issues, I would suggest you to make sure that the ‘All Application packages’ item has full permissions. Refer to the section “permissions’ in this article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/askperf/archive/2013/10/11/what-to-do-if-your-windows-8-modern-app-fails-to-start.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/b/askperf/archive/2013/10/11/what-to-do-if-your-windows-8-modern-app-fails-to-start.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Though this article is for Windows 8, the steps suggested in the “permissions’ section apply for Windows 8.1 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if the issue occurs. This will help us determine if the issue is user profile related. Refer to this article for more information on creating a new user account:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try these steps and let us know the results.</p>

            I had the same problem, even after refreshing my PC, so I contacted Windows 8 Technical Support. After paying their service fee, they determined that my Surface Pro was infected by viruses, which were causing my computer to malfunction. They then repaired
 the computer and it is working normally now.

<h2>            Keep getting disconnected from xbox live parties&#47;games</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Starting about a month ago,&nbsp;I can play online BF3 for maybe 30 minutes or an hour before i get disconnected from the server and (if im in a party) my party. Other people in my party do not get disconnected from the game. Sometimes
 I only get kicked from the party, however. This problem occurs no matter what game my friend and i are playing. (Ex: last night i kept getting kicked from the party while i was playing Mass effect 2 and he was playing arkham city). Also, this never happens
 to them when playing with people other than me. It usually says "Gamertag has left your party" followed by "Can't connect to party." although sometimes it will throw me right back into the party without me having to initiate it. Any help would be appreciated,
 thanks.</p>

<p>Hey there Biscuits (and Tim)! I understand you are having some issues with disconnecting from parties and game servers. Just to clarify, are you ever disconnected from LIVE in general, or just the game server and party? As far as the game server goes, does
 this happen in multiple games, or just BF3? If it is just this game, have you checked with their support to see if this is a known issue?<br />
<br />
Regarding the party issue, I'd recommend checking out <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/26.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Forum 10 - Social/Communicatio</a>n for more help on that. To start out though, sometimes this can be caused by a strict or moderate NAT. Please check out
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/26/t/34069.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the NAT Guide</a> for more information on setting that up properly. Try that out, let me know how it goes, and we'll go from there. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, I never get disconnected from LIVE in general, only game and party. Usually in BF3 it will lag badly a few seconds before I get disconnected from the party. Sometimes I maintain connection with the game, sometimes not. As far as other games go, the only
 other online game I've played since this problem started is FIFA 12, which I played online against my brother. And again, it would lag badly right before I got kicked from the party. But the lag would stop and the game would continue after that. Other than
 right before I get disconnected, I have no problems with lag. &nbsp;Also, my NAT is/has been open</p>

<p>Thanks for the response! You mention playing with your brother. Is he connecting at the same location, or are any other devices (mobile, computers, etc) connecting on your network? Try disconnecting these other devices and try again. Can you also check your
 router settings to see if UPnP is enabled and let me know.<br />
<br />
Finally, just to cover all of the bases, please go to <a href="http://speedtest.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I am getting kicked from xbox live continuously. I try and play MW3 and stay connected for about 20 minutes. Then i get kick off. I can reconnect right away but it does it again in about 20 minutes or less. when i return to home i reconnect right way. It
 also lets me down load updates with out problems. My &nbsp;router is in the same room as my xbox and i have tried wired and wireless. its the same for both. I have also tried a static ip address and all that good stuff. Still does it. Any suggestions??</p>

    <title>Windows 10 black screen with cursor after desktop displays and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russfromefland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 black screen with cursor after desktop displays and dissappears</h2>
                    <p>Over the past weekend, I upgraded my Dell Inspiron N5110 from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 using the automatic on-line method.&nbsp; The install seems to have succeeded, but when I first logged in and the desktop appeared, it only appeared for a 20 seconds
 or so.&nbsp; Then a black screen with cursor.&nbsp; CNTL-ALT-DEL allowed me to restart, so I did that.&nbsp; Upon restart and log-in, now it goes directly to black screen with cursor.&nbsp; CNTL-ALT-DEL also allows me to start task manager, so I did that.&nbsp; It looks like Windows
 10 is running, but explorer.exe is not in the list of Windows processes.&nbsp; I tried to restart explorer.exe using the File - Run New Task option, but it never starts up.&nbsp; Then I downloaded the Windows 10 ISO, burned it to a DVD, and tried booting from that.&nbsp;
 It looked like some updates were applied, but still the same disappearing desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon further investigation, I found that the Intel HD Graphics / HD Graphics 3000 driver that came with the laptop does not support Windows 10.&nbsp; I don't know if the driver was updated during the W10 install.&nbsp; The desktop will not stay up long enough for
 me to find out.&nbsp; I can open a command prompt from the task manager and I have verified that I have the newer A11 bios installed (Laptop came with A10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another clue is that when I restart and log in, I get the black screen right away.&nbsp; A cold boot (shutdown, start from power button) gives me the desktop for a short time after log-in.&nbsp; But not for long enough to get anything done.&nbsp; I've tried using a second
 monitor, but the desktop disappears from that just like on the laptop screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like all I can work from is the command prompt.&nbsp; Is there a way to revert back to Windows 7 from the command prompt?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that the old Windows 7 is stored on c:\Windows.old, and I understand it has a 30-day lifetime.&nbsp; I tried making a copy to a 32 GB flash drive, but it can't access all folders even when running command prompt as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My final question is "why did the install function not see that this Dell N5110 was not ready to take Windows 10 in the first place?"</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Venkatesh, but my desktop also disappears after only a few seconds when I log in to Windows 10 using Safe Mode with Networking.&nbsp; So as I said before, whatever solutions I may find may have to be performed using the command prompt.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me the best thing to do is to roll back to the previous OS (Windows 7 Home Premium).&nbsp; I followed the link you provided, but the instructions for "Go back to your previous version of Windows" or any other option on that page are useless to me
 since my desktop disappears before I can execute those instructions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to roll back to my previous OS by clicking <strong>Go back to the previous build</strong> instead of
<strong>Startup Settings</strong> in step 4 of your Method 1 above.&nbsp; The result has me very concerned!&nbsp; It says "Your PC ran into a problem and has to restart" and there is something at the end of the message about a WDF_VIOLATION.&nbsp; Of course when it restarts,
 it is back to the same situation where no matter how I boot the laptop and sign in, the desktop disappears in a few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even considered a complete system rebuild with Windows 7 Home Premium from the ISOs offered on the Microsoft web site, but when I type in the Windows 7 authorization code from the back of my laptop, it says I have to go to Dell for it.&nbsp; Guess what, Dell
 does not supply one for laptops that are out of warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if Microsoft cannot provide a way to roll back to my previous OS from the command prompt, this Windows 10 upgrade seems to have ruined my laptop.&nbsp; Please elevate this issue to the necessary level to find a solution!</p>

</p><p>I finally got Windows 10 rolled back to Windows 7 by using a copy of the Windows 10 ISO that I burned to a DVD, but only after trying repairs and roll backs a number of times.&nbsp; I don't know for sure why it finally worked, but I suspect Microsoft set things
 up so that you have to try to repair Windows 10 a certain number of times before it will let you roll it back to the previous OS.&nbsp; Even the roll back was screwy.&nbsp; It sat there for hours saying "restarting your PC", but it never did restart.&nbsp; I finally pushed
 and held the power button to shut the laptop down.&nbsp; Upon powering it back on, it automatically started restoring the previous operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I did finally get a roll back, but I found Windows 7 was corrupted after the roll back.&nbsp; Many others have reported the same problem.&nbsp; The Windows 7 Task Scheduler is total FUBAR after the roll back.&nbsp; At this point I'm so tired of this Windows 10 fiasco,
 I have not yet tried to use some of the Task Scheduler fixes that I have found on the web.&nbsp; But I will not be upgrading any of my other PCs to Windows 10 any time soon!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has totally dropped the ball on this one!</p>

            When i get to update and recovery I click on it and it will not load before the computer locks up. I have been trying to get into my wifes computer now for almost 2 weeks. Every time i re start the same thing happens. If i hit f8 to restore it just bypasses
 it and loads the computer. I click on start, settings ,updates and recovery and it freezes again. This is very frustrating. My HP laptop upgraded with no issues.

            What do you mean by "it won't read it?" Are you referring to Autorun, or it wont read the disk at all? Have you tried using Windows Explorer to navigate to the CD/DVD drive and start the install by double clicking the setup file?<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Troubleshoot Compatibility:</strong> <br />
<br />
When you install it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"<br />
Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next windows click "Start the Program" to install it. After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in windows 7.<br />
<br />

            the Software won't open up, it says there's an ERROR and shuts the Program down before opening it up completely. I also changed the version on my laptop from Windows 7 to XP s 2, it opened up the software then so i continued and activated the Software.
 BUT, when i was connecting the USB port to my laptop and to my Cricut, my laptop completely shut down. Either i was trying it over and over or it just wouldn't work. I had to reboot my new laptop and my Cricut Design Studio wouldn't work thereafter. Now i
 can't make the change and the software won't open. <br />
<br />
When it shut down yesterday evening, it said there was a driver error. (i think it was talking about the USB port that i was trying to connect both machines)

            Go to the website of Cricut Design Studio and see if they have any updated software/drivers for the program. If they do uninstall the program, restart the computer,&nbsp; then reinstall using the updates.<br />

            It does have an update...its called Filmware...but, the software has to be installed first. The option is on the HELP menu in the program. So i can't even get into it. It's complicated. On Cricut.com the updates aren't available. the software needs to
 be connected and then updated by NET thereafter. <br />
<br />
Another question: My new laptop comes with Windows 7, its a 30 day Free Trial period, and if i don't want to keep it, i was told it will roll back to the next latest which would be Windows Vista. Is that true?

You will need to ask the computer manufacturer about that, they are the ones who set it up. But I have never heard of that before - did you buy the computer used? Will it "roll back" automatically?<br />

            Activation Check - Is Windows 7 Activated<br />
<br />
1) Click on the Start Menu---&gt;right click on Computer---&gt;click Properties.<br />
In the windows that pops up scroll down to the bottom - it will say if it's activated, or how many days you have to activate.<br />
<br />
2) If it says it's activated you are fine and should not have a 30 day limit.<br />
<br />
3) If it says how many days you have left to activate:<br />
See if there is a 25 character key on a sticker on your computer for Windows 7, or see if it's for Vista.
<br />
If the key is for Windows 7 use that key to activate Windows.<br />
If the key is for Vista contact the computer manufacturer and ask them about your situation.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify">No. The extract tab isn't there in File explorer. And it doesn't appear even if a valid .rar file is there. You can unzip a file without any third-party application only and only if a file is supported by Windows by default, and
 .rar is not an extension which can be&nbsp;accessed by Windows. &nbsp;.zip, .cab are the files which can be handled by Windows itself.

<h2>            Xbox live Gold membership payment with account money</h2>
                    
<p>I was recently trying to use my account balance to purchase a three month Xbox live gold account. To my dismay, I could not use my account balance. I did some research on the subject and i fount out that account money cannot be used to purchase gold, but
 it may be later. Can I get a possible date to when this feature will be added?</p>

<p>Hiya,<br />
<br />
Sorry, Microsoft hasn't given any sort of time table on this at all. That's why they stated it "may" be possible. They don't like to give dates on things before it's available to do. I'm sure they are looking into all areas for letting customers purchase gold
 memberships, however, at this time it's not possible to use your Microsoft Account balance to purchase a gold membership.<br />
<br />
You'll have to stick to subscription cards and digital payments via Xbox.com/Xbox 360.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            User files in the wrong path</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I just recently completed my PC and wanted to set it up. Windows is booting on an SSD but data is stored on a HDD. I wanted to move my user files around to free some space on the SSD but actually did something wrong. All user files are in the
 good path except the ''Pictures'' one. I change the path to D:\... As of now, I can't change it back cause it doesn't allow me to move a parent folder into a child folder (obviously). Tried to restore it to default without succes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else got this problem before and if so, how can it be fixed..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, heard that it's gonna change location to default when i'll update Windows (from D back to C) is that true?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help, really appreciated ^^</p>
<p>

            Hi Julien.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You should be following this tutorial to move User folders:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>
<br />
<br />They're idea to move to the hard drive since programs are affected by the speed differential but files are not. 
<br />
<br />If you moved a User folder into the wrong folder or a whole drive, then move it back to default from the Location Tab on the User folder as shown here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-resto...</a>
<br />
<br />BUT do not tell it to move the files too.  Say NO to moving them and instead copy them back manually or it will dump all the files from the drive into the restored default User folder. 
<br />
<br />If a User folder ever disappears, it shows in Option Two how to recreate it.  They are never lost, always can be recreated.  It just takes patience. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi julien,
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Navigate to this Key:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />Double click My Pictures
<br />
<br />Set its value to:
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%\Pictures
<br />
<br />Click OK, close the registry Editor and restart your PC
<br />
<br />Your Pictures library will be back in its original location!
<br />
<br />You may have to manually move files back into that folder
<br />
<br />If you want to move that Pictures folder again:
<br />
<br />Right click it, choose Properties
<br />
<br />On the location Tab, in the Location Box, type this:
<br />
<br />D:\Pictures
<br />
<br />That way you are specifying a folder rather than the D Drive . ..

                    I want to have say 1- 2 apps in the foreground that don't disappear unless I close them and the rest in background - applications like IE or Word or GIMP is my scenario.<br />
<br />
Is there a "bring to front" option ?<br />
Is there a "lock at the front" option?<br />
<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post in Microsoft Community<br />
In subject of IE and MS office cant take it Always on TOP.There is no such command or option has been added ,Windows does not offer a native feature for this task<br />
But some of player like WMP,VLC,that option will available that you can bring to front always<br />
However third party software can do that::Example-<br />
OnTopReplica
<p><br />
</p>
<p>OnTopReplica uses the DWM Desktop Composition found in Windows Vista and Windows 7 to clone a window and run it in a small thumbnail that always stays on top. This is perfect for keeping only the video frame of a video player on top. OnTopReplica requires
 .NET Framework 2.0 and a Windows Aero theme.</p>

                    Hey!
<div>I have a HP Compaq laptop. I've been using this laptop for the last 4 years. I have 4 local disks.&nbsp;</div>

<div>2)Local Disk:D</div>
<div>3)New Volume:E</div>
<div>4)Presario_RP:F</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, today, I open My Computer, and I see that my Local Disk:D is empty. It had all my files in it. But now it is empty. When I click it, it asks me whether I want to format it. I click cancel. When I right-click it, the computer doesn't respond. Then after
 some time, it does. When I saw its properties, it said that the Used Space and Free Space are 0 bytes. Since then, my computer has been really slow. Sometimes, it gets stuck.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I want to know how to get back all my files and how to speed up my computer. Please help. Thanks in advance. Here are my specifications:</div>

            <p>To speed up your computer, defrag the disk and open disk cleaner and clean out the unessesary files, then right click on the disk icon and open properties. Click on the hardware tab select your drive type and click properties. Click change settings and go
 to the driver tab and click uninstall. Restart your computer if neccesary. Then depending on what&nbsp; version of windows you have it will either install the driver automaticly or you will have to go online, download and install it. Restart if needed and your
 files should be back on there.</p>

 so I don't think i need an intel adapter. The adapter isn't in the device manager either. Please help.

<br />Did the motherboard specification say the WiFi is inbuilt or you bought a separate USB WiFi adapter?
<br />
<br />Secondly, What is the make and model of the motherboard?

            Hi Nikolas.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 Update, if it's too late to roll it back  I can help you shrink C by about 50gb in Disk mgmt to do a test Install to the shrink space, which will configure a Dual Boot you can sign into to set up to see if the problem goes away.  If so I'll then help you move into the new install and eventually delete the old one and recover its space.  Steps here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I presume you are using a Laptop's Touchpad. First, you need to check whether the Laptop Manufacturer has released any Windows 10 Driver Updates.

            Thanks a lot for your answer. I contacted the laptop manufacturer support, Lenovo as my laptop is Lenovo X! Carbon and still have no answer. &nbsp;the issue (Stretching to Zoom on display) is still not solved in Windows 10. I hope Microsoft comes fix it tools
 for windows 10 to solve such an issue. Thanks.
