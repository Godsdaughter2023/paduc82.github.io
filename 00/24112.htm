<h2>            Fix Publisher 2013 docs after removing duplicate fonts from computer</h2>
                    <p>Somehow my computers have a lot of duplicate fonts. For example arial.ttf and arial_0.ttf. I tried using a tool to remove all the _0 duplicates. But when I opened Publisher 2013 it complained about being unable to find arial_0 font. I have hundreds of Publisher
 files that I would like to fix. For now I had to put all the duplicates back before my users came after me with tar and feathers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some automated way to scan all the Publisher files for _0 fonts and changed them so they use the original font name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brian</p>

            <p>The first font oddity link is a good description of how we got into this mess. The second describes the mess well. But neither addresses how to clean up after this mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have arial.ttf, arial_0.ttf and arial_1.ttf, I understand that _1 is the most recently installed. Should I remove arial_0.ttf and arial_1.ttf? Or should I remove arial.ttf and arial_1.ttf?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of that, our problem is with Publisher files. These files seem to remember exactly which ttf file was used for a font. If I use the Arial font while arial_1.ttf is installed, that .pub file remembers that I used the Arial_1. If I remove Arial_1.ttf,
 Publisher complains that it cannot find Arial_1. Other .pub file were last modified when Arial_0 was the newest and others when Arial was unique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have hundreds of .pub files with many combinations and permutations of the duplicated fonts. Is there an easy or automated way to update all these .pub files after I remove the duplicate fonts?</p>

            <p>Many thanks Joe Men,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The only way around it I've found is to set up a new folder on your phone's photo section, then go into all your photos on OneDrive, select the ones you want and move them across into the new folder you created. What's app sees that new folder and you can
 select them from there.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook not working after windows 10 update and still not working after 7 restore</h2>
                    <p>I updated to windows 10 and gradually my outlook email slowed, became non responsive and then just lost an entire email folder and then quite recieving or sending emails. I restored to windows 7 and outlook opened and was a little faster but it looks like
 the damage is done. I've looked all over and have tried several scans to detect and repair but nothing has been effective except it looks like my outlook 2010 is damaged. &nbsp;Nothing else seems to be slow. &nbsp;Just outlook 2010. I am curious if windows 10 update
 requires outlook update also in order for the outlook to operate efficiently. &nbsp;In the meantime no email. &nbsp;Any idea as to how to handle this?</p>

            <p>Howdy,</p>
<p>I have two email addresses set up in Outlook 2010. One is Yahoo &amp; the other a website email. Both are POP and I've sent the test and both tested successful of course I received the email saying the test worked on my iphone but not in outlook.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by exchange but I assume that's Yahoo &amp; the website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If understand you right Windows 7 or 10 have nothing to do with MS Office 2010 and thus my nonresponsive Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried some disk scan and repair file steps and I'll show my results so far and perhaps it will give a better idea of what the next step should be.</p>
<p>If any of the below looks familiar please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Outlook closed. When I followed a scan direction SCANPST the result was "Failed. Couldn't Scan. Unexpected error prevented access to file. Use a disk error checking program to check disk and try again".</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Outlook closed. &nbsp;Another error code I got was Error code: 0x80040116<br />
</p>
<p>Outlook open. Here is the message I get when I try to open my email folder.<br />

    <title>How Can Windows 10 Help Me With This Use Case&#63; Describe Yours&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Can Windows 10 Help Me With This Use Case&#63;  Describe Yours&#33;</h2>
                    <p>There are many strong opinions here, most backed with experience, about whether Windows 10 is GOOD or BAD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm here to say that they're mostly meaningless, since the <strong>details matter</strong> about just HOW people need to use computing hardware to accomplish their goals.&nbsp; The disagreement is in the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That there IS so much debate may say, in a big-picture&nbsp;way, that Windows 10 doesn't appear to be succeeding (so far) in becoming a "Jack Of All Trades" (one Windows to run on everything).&nbsp; But it doesn't say much else, besides that
<strong>people care</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put succinctly, a casual&nbsp;user wanting to do frivolous things won't need Windows to provide ANYWHERE NEAR the same things as a sophisticated content creator - and that's not even mentioning that they may want to use entirely different hardware.&nbsp; But we aren't
 hearing why, except anecdotally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Post YOUR use case - <strong>i.e., SPECIFICALLY what&nbsp;you need Windows to do for you&nbsp;and how well you perceive the current preview build will do for that

</p><p>The option to use <strong>c</strong><strong>ompact view </strong>is no longer available with the new Skype. If you wish to still get this option, we strongly advise you to utilize the classic Skype version instead.

<p>Thank you for the proposed solutions but I think that it would be pretty obvious that the pure split would be the preferred option. Why? Because the Hub and the Tabbed could be a potential security risk in terms of shoulder surfing. Especially if you are
 dealing with confidential information with a client or a colleagues. I would definitely not approve my team to use Skype whenever they are outside the office as they might divulge information around.</p>

<h2>            My One Drive files aren&#39;t in their Macbook folder</h2>
                    I have a Macbook and I have One Drive. I can see all the files I have stored in One Drive on my iPad and online on the website. But when I check my Macbook folder it is empty. And the Macbook One Drive app says everything is synced up, but nothing is there.
 What is going on?

            Also, if Office XP truly doesn't include the font, it's possible it was installed by another application (perhaps an earlier version of Office that had been upgraded). If so, it might be possible to extract the font file from the install disc of that application.

<h2>            Deleted Outlook.com account still receiving calendar notification emails.</h2>
                    <p>I had a custom email address with hotmail and then outlook.com which is still receiving calendar notifications despite the fact it has been deleted. At least I thought the account was deleted. I discovered I was still able to login so eventually I simply
 the merged the account with a standard outlook.com account. I'm aware I can block these emails but I would prefer the problem to be resolved. I don't know how a calendar can still be sending me emails when it no longer exists. Would appreciate any help.</p>

<h2>            How to fix stuttering in Bluetooth with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been beating myself senseless with this one, but finally and accidentally found out the cause: &nbsp;INSUFFICIENT TIME ALLOWED FOR INSTALLATION.</p>
<p>Here's what to do: &nbsp;remove your troubled connection completely, start again. &nbsp;When "ready to pair", start that operation AND DON'T MOVE TO OTHER STEPS QUITE YET. &nbsp;The pairing will take only a few momemts, but NOTICE that the accelerator bar is not complete,
 so WAIT A FEW SECONDS.</p>
<p>When accelerator bar restarts and moves to completion, NOW you are fully installed and the stuttering will no longer appear. &nbsp;The problem was the long delay between initial install (mostly functional) and a fully-functional complete install. &nbsp;Try it - this
 is THE SOURCE of the problem.<br />

<h2>            Install 32 bit or 64 bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to&nbsp;install the Windows 10 technical preview.&nbsp; Here is my setup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Manufacture: Toshiba</p>
<p>Model: Satellite L755</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Pentium CPU B950@2.10GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 4 GB</p>
<p>System Type: 64-bit</p>
<p>Windows: Windows 7 Home Premium w/Service Pack 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having some trouble installing through windows update, so I was thinking about downloading the ISO. Should I download the x64 or, since I have an Intel chip, would the x86 be better?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

The Windows Insider Program already 2 million testers evaluating the Windows 10 Previews since October of 2014. With Microsoft planning a promotional upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 and the intention to provide a direct upgrade path from the preview to the final release, users are taking the plunge earlier. This does not exempt the fact that Windows 10 is still under heavy development and we are still in the early days before we are anywhere near the final code. With that said, users who are willing to give the Preview a spin early might be encountering issues getting Windows 10 to successfully install on their PC. This Wiki Article takes a look at some of the solutions you can try if setup fails.">How
 to: 10 things to do if Windows 10 Setup fails.</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of testing Windows 10 on a physical&nbsp;partition&nbsp;or hard disk&nbsp;versus a Virtual Machine include full access to the hardware, which includes memory, graphics and input/output performance of the local disk in addition to the ability to fully experience
 all features of the operating system that are not accessible in a virtual environment. The biggest benefit is, you don't lose your production installation of Windows and you can reboot into it at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to consider before:</strong></p>
<p>Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making signifcant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> recommended! See links to resources about backing up by clicking the link for the respective version of Windows you are running:

<h2>            Problems with exporting data from Access to SQL Server</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium<br />
SQL Server 2008 R2 Express<br />
Microsoft Office Access 2007 SP2 - 32 bit version</p>
<p><br />
This post was originally put on SQL Server Tools newsgroup, but somebody there suggested my problem is more Access related, so I should post here instead.&nbsp; I had also asked questions about this is on the SQL Server Forum but my query got deleted so I went back
 to newsgroups.</p>
<p>I am trying to use the 32-bit SQL Import and Export Wizard to transfer my Access data to a new SQL Server database.</p>
<p>On choosing the Data Source option -</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 12.0 Database Access Engine OLE DB Provider and clicking on <br />
Next&gt;, I receive the error -</p>
<p>TITLE: SQL Server Import and Export Wizard<br />
------------------------------</p>
<p>The operation could not be completed.</p>
<p>------------------------------<br />
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>No error message available, result code: DB_SEC_E_AUTH_FAILED(0x80040E4D). <br />
(System.Data)</p>
<p>------------------------------<br />
BUTTONS:</p>
<p>OK<br />
------------------------------</p>
<p>I have searched Help and found that this has something to do with permissions, so I have gone into Server Management Studio and set my permissions to the highest possible on everything.&nbsp; At the moment I am just doing this work on my home PC.&nbsp; I have then
 retried and still get the error.</p>
<p>The file permissions on the Access side are also the most open (highest) possible.</p>
<p>One person on SQL Tools suggested I could also approach the data transfer from another side. As Access can link to SQL Server tables, I could do the data transfer within Access.</p>
<p>I have decided to try this approach of sending the data from Access.&nbsp; I have though hit a snag, as I am just not sure of terminology etcetera; I've always been apps not systems, and this is getting very hard for me - to be frank I am nearly in tears, because
 I have been held up with this problem for 6 months, and even bought a new computer along the way to try to get things working, as my SQL didn't even seem to be working properly on my old XP machine.</p>
<p>I have used SQL Server Management Studio to define the database and, for now, I have added just one table.</p>
<p>I have then gone into Access and sought to Export the data of one table from there to SQL, but I have not been able to do so, as I am just not able to work out what I need to answer along the way.&nbsp; This why I wish the Wizard would work for me, but as that
 route seems blocked to me, I have to find a way through this maze.</p>
<p>Under Export I have chosen</p>
<p>ODBC Database<br />
Export selected object to an ODBC database, such as SQL Server.</p>
<p>That takes me to a screen that is asking for a DSN Name.&nbsp; The annotation on the screen says -</p>
<p>Select the file data source that describes the driver that you wish to connect to.&nbsp; You can use any file source that refers to an ODBC driver which is installed on your machine.</p>
<p>I do not even know what a DSN is.&nbsp; I have been unable to find any file with the extension dsn on my PC.</p>
<p>Any suggestions as to what I should be setting, where I should be looking etc. would be welcome.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>With grateful thanks in anticipation.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>First of all I need to mention that the SQL Data Transfer function is very sensitive re data types, so if you have a date in the wrong format the whole import will fail and not specifically point you to what exactly the problem is.</p>
<p>Just on the information you provided it would probably be easier to simply open your access database, link the SQL table and do a straight copy&gt;paste. Doing it this way is a whole lot easier and also will point to exactly where problems are encountered.
 So, I am assuming the table has already been created in SQL (make sure the fields are exactly the same and also in the same order).</p>
<p>You need to set up an ODBC link first, so let's go do that: from the start button simply type ODBC and you should&nbsp;see at the top of the list of available applications something called Data Sources (ODBC). Select that - it will open a screen with a few tabs:
 User DSN, System DSN, etc. You can either use a system or a user DSN - for the purposes of this link it shouldn't matter because it's a once-off issue. So, on the system DSN, select Add and on the following screen go right to the bottom and select SQL server.
 You need to know the name of your SQL server as well as the database name - just follow the wizard to setup a system DSN called "mydb" or something to that effect.</p>
<p>Then open your db in Access, and from the ribbon at the top select external data, more, odbc database. Then select link as you simply want to link the table(s) and not import the data. On clicking OK it will then go to the Select Data Source screen, select
 machine data source and select the data source you set up as above... Follow the wizard once again to select which table you want to link - and voila!</p>
<p>You now have the SQL table linked into access, so whatever data you add will automatically be available in SQL server...</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>W</p>

<h2>            OneNote NoteBook Section Won&#39;t Sync&#47;Update - Won&#39;t update past a particular page</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a peculiar problem with OneNote. One particular section of my notebook just won't sync and update. The notebook status is continuously showing 'syncing', which is odd in itself. That one section just won't sync and update. Moreover, it seems to get
 stuck at one particular page. I have left it for more than a week, but there has been no change to this section. All other notebooks and sections are fine - they sync and update OK.&nbsp;Online OneNote is fine, I can see all the pages, it's just my local OneNote
 that is experiencing this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote is up to date and I tried repairing it. I also tried closing the notebook and re-opening it. Neither worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or help would much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Microsoft must fix disparity in tile appearance on Start Screen&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil5927  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft must fix disparity in tile appearance on Start Screen&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Win 10 users who choose to use Tablet Mode (or elect to work from the Start Screen instead of the Desktop) are getting a hodge-podge of tiles, compared to Win 8.1.&nbsp; To begin with, the Win 10 Medium tiles are larger than the Win 8.1 Medium tiles, and so eat
 up too much screen space.&nbsp; That wouldn't be a problem if the identifying text or icon in many Win 10 tiles were not so small.&nbsp; For those tiles, resizing&nbsp;them to Small&nbsp;renders them very difficult to identify.&nbsp; Case in point are the Office 2016 Preview tiles,
 the Document tile, the Control Panel tile and so on.&nbsp; Others, like Mail, Sports, Finance and Settings do not have this problem.&nbsp; Their graphics are large enough to be easily viewed, even in a Small tile.&nbsp; As an example, consider the following screenshot.&nbsp;
 The four undistinguishable&nbsp;small tiles at the lower left are for Control Panel, My PC, Documents and One Drive - but you would need a magnifying glass to recognize that fact.&nbsp; On the right side, notice what happened to&nbsp; the tile for Word when I changed it
 from Medium to Small.&nbsp; Imagine all of the Office tiles in Small size - and trying to remember which is which.&nbsp; But it doesn't have to be this way.&nbsp; Look at the tiles at the top of the screen.&nbsp; The graphics and/or text are all large enough to be easily identifiable
 even when resized to Small.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please fix this so that all tiles can be resized to Small and still have easy identification!</p>

            <p>Lawrence,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right; I should have phrased this as a question, rather than a statement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one who is experiencing this problem in arranging their Start Screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about you? &nbsp;Have you found a way to re-size all the tiles on the Start Screen to Small so that their contents are clearly visible? &nbsp;If so, how did you do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            <p>Scott, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion.&nbsp; I can see where this could work OK if you are using a desktop monitor.&nbsp; But I am working with a laptop screen, and own both an 8" Windows tablet and a Windows phone - and I am thinking ahead.&nbsp; Others may have 10" or 11.6"&nbsp;two-in-ones
 / convertibles.&nbsp; In these cases it will not be as easy to use Large or even Medium tiles (especially since at least the Medium tiles are larger than the Medium tiles used in Win 8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice from your screenshot that you have some Small tiles with miniscule identifying graphics, as I do.&nbsp; If you can tell which is which, you either have excellent eyesight or an excellent memory.&nbsp; Either way, good for you!&nbsp; But compare their appearance
 to the similarly-sized tiles for Note, Settings, and Wi-Fi.&nbsp; Why wouldn't you prefer the larger, more-visible graphics in those tiles for all your Small tiles?&nbsp; And that, as far as I know, is only something that Microsoft can fix.&nbsp; Hopefully, they will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phil&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Lawrence,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for explaining how you have worked around the visibility concerns I wrote about.&nbsp; It sounds as though this works well for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Win 8 &amp; 8.1 for two years, and have a clean desktop (no shortcuts) and a Start screen filled with tiles for various programs &amp; apps.&nbsp; By and large, I have been able to use Small tiles because the identifying graphics have been large enough
 within the tile to allow easy identification.&nbsp; But even in those cases where I found Medium tiles easier to distinguish, the Medium tiles in Win 8.1 are smaller than the Medium tiles in Win 10.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;this allowed me to display all my&nbsp;desired programs and apps&nbsp;on
 a laptop&nbsp;or tablet Start screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand - and find frustrating - is why Microsoft elected to change tile formats that worked well in Win 8.1. (and that users are familiar with) to something less useful in Win 10.&nbsp; Hopefully, someone at Microsoft will ask the same question
 before launch and go back to the Win 8,1 tile formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phil</p>

            <p>Hey Phil</p>
<p>&nbsp;Well my memory and eye sight is not that good but I do know what all the Tiles are that are
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">use often</span></strong> or at least
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">regularly</span></strong> and my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>"Live Tiles". </strong></span>The Apps / programs and stuff I only use rarely I leave Pinned to the main menu! (See Below)&nbsp;FYI Hamburger Button top&nbsp;left corner of start. see red arrow on pic!&nbsp;You may well already know all this but I know when I first
 started using Windows 8 it took me awhile to learn to turn my machine off! I feel silly now but I think as people we are resentment to learn new things. With10 as with 8 I have found it better to find the ways it best works for myself and not the ways I think
 it should work! But hey that's me I know I am not as smart as I might like to think!! Good luck and have fun!!</p>

            <p>In build 10130: When resizing a tile from medium to small, the icon on the tile is being made much smaller; which defeats the purpose of making a tile small.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was working fine in Win8.1. Thus, it is a programming-error/glitch/bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In essence: </p>
<ul>
<li>The tiles are too large in Medium and Small and the icons on it are too small.&nbsp;</li><li>Those tiles in Win build&nbsp;10130 work only with native apps from Win8.&nbsp;</li><li>As Phil already said: Selection of multiple tiles (i.e. with Ctrl-key, as in Win8, is missing).&nbsp;</li><li>Also: Why can one not simply resize tiles by pulling at its corners (as one would on a desktop-window); rather then having to use three clicks via context-menue?</li></ul>

<h2>            Issue with Group edit of a Word document in One Drive</h2>
                    
<p>&gt; i created a word document on my computer.</p>
<p>&gt; i saved the word doc and uploaded it to my one drive.</p>
<p>&gt; i then shared the file with several people so they could read it and edit where necessary.</p>
<p>&gt; there is no button called "edit." &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c8f382a4-08db-4638-86b6-7c979e15c7b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc8f382a4-08db-4638-86b6-7c979e15c7b8" /></a></p>

<p>&gt; when i double-click the file, one drive downloads the file to my computer.</p>
<p><strong>my question:</strong> is it possible to live-edit a word file in one drive without it automatically downloading to your computer? i would like everyone to make edits to the same file, and have it stay on the one drive.</p>

            Sorry - no real answers just questions I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
Why can't you access the files?<br />
<br />
Do you mean you can't transfer them to the computer from the phone?<br />
<br />
Is there a reason why you need to format the memory card?<br />
<br />
Have you tried moving all your files from the card to the phone memory?<br />
<br />
What phone do you have?

    <title>Outlook doesn&#39;t print to default tray - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevtheace  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook doesn&#39;t print to default tray</h2>
                    Network printer (HP 4250dtn) has 3 trays. Try 2 is loaded with plain paper, tray 3 pre-printed headed paper. I have setup printing shortcuts within Printing Properties so that everything defaults to tray 2. But when printing from Outlook (2007 and 2010)
 it always prints tray 3. I have to go into Outlook Print&gt;Page Setup&gt;Paper then change the source from "default paper tray" to "tray 2" to get it to work. All other software defaults to tray 2 - so wy doesn't Outlook?

            Ensure all the drivers are installed for the printer to work with the different versions of Outlook. You may contact the Printer Manufacturer for more help on this.

<h2>            Network Location and Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 9926 looking great, two issues I've found since installing the new build:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When resuming from hibernate or sleep the WiFi refuses to connect, disabling then enabling the Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 in Device Manager brings it back to life</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My network locations all seem to be set to Public and I can't for the life of me find where to change them to Home/Private.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Emal with excel macro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anwaee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emal with excel macro</h2>
                    Is there a way to email a workbook through a macro that would work on any mail app? I have a workbook that will be on several different computers with different email programs. &nbsp;I need to have the workbook sent to me each time another user closes their
 workbook. &nbsp;Each of their workbooks will have a different file name. If this is not possible, could we have the code set to Outlook and at the finish return to each person's email app?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried every code I have found so far but none seems to work on all of the most popular email apps(Outlook, Applemail, and etc.) for us. I have tried tweeking them to no avail. It seems to be a problem with activeX. I would need to have the email
 be totally automatic on closing. Set recipient, subject, message and their workbook and then send. All of our programs seem to be up to date, Excel 2010 or 2011. I will be writing the code on Excell for Mac but the program seems to work fine on Windows version
 also.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is the code i am trying to use:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Sub Email_Workbook()</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Application.EnableEvents = False</span></p>

<h2>            Updated to IE11, now have issues when I close down the browser</h2>
                    <p>I noticed that after I upgraded to IE11 that if I want to close the browser and hit the red X in the upper right corner I will get a popup window afterwards saying that IE closed unexpectedly!&nbsp;&nbsp; I meant to close it.&nbsp; The same thing will happen if I close
 that only tab open but clicking on the X in that tab window.&nbsp; I really never had a problem like this with IE10. Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; Baffles me.... I am using Win 7 PRO and the 64bit version of IE11 with only the security update installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an entire
 other issue when I run the cumulative update for IE11!&nbsp;&nbsp; Any time I try a search the browser will bomb and lock up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I understand what is wrong with the first issue I will try the cumulative upgrade again!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have dropped back to IE10 several times
 and upgraded to IE11 twice and both times with the same issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, tried the No addins option, and it made absolutely no difference in this problem.</p>

</p><p>If it does not help, then use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Please use suggestions provided in this Microsoft help article and check the issue.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Internet Explorer opens, flashes, and then closes immediately when you start it</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967896</a><br />
(Also applies to Internet explorer 11)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you
 note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
You may also check your Internet connection. A slow Internet connection can be caused by many things, like the type of connection you have, the presence of spyware, viruses, and other programs, or outside factors, like heavy traffic on a website.</p>

            <p>To answer first question: I had Google as my default search provider and Google as my default home page.&nbsp; When the final IE11 cumulative update was completed (the machine XPS-700 with dual core 2.8 GHz processor and 8 GB of system ram with cable modem),
 and the machine was rebooted.&nbsp; Once booted up and I would go open IE11 it looked normal, but when I would starting typing in the Google search box, after a few characters then IE11 would stop working and get a box that said there was a problem and the program
 must close.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did all the stuff most everyone suggested, running no addins etc., dropping back to IE10 and starting the upgrade to IE11.&nbsp; Everything seemed to work ok until I did the final cumulative upgrade and then same thing all over again.&nbsp; Three times
 I went through this process with the same results each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally last evening I decided to allow the computer to do the Bing search upgrade and the Bing desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp; I changed the home page to MS Community forum support.&nbsp;(Bing is now default search provider!)&nbsp;Walla, everything now works, but get a popup box
 every time I close a&nbsp;popup window opens saying&nbsp;browser closed unexpectedly and then another that says IE must close. I should never get a message like this.&nbsp; I even ran your MS Fix it to speed up the IE11 and check and fix any errors and it still gets this
 unnecessary popup box.</p>

            <p>Hello Miller,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is good to&nbsp;know that the Bing Search upgrade and the Bing desktop helped you get the Internet Explorer operable. However, as you still get the pop-up message, I would suggest you to run Internet Explorer without add-ons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, open <strong>All Programs</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Accessories</strong> and then expand <strong>System Tools</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>More on Add-ons:</p>
