<h2>            Cannot Rollback to Windows 8.1 from Insider Preview, 10240 HP Stream 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed build 10240 on HP Stream 7 less than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However now that Windows 10 is being released I have attempted to roll-back to my previous Windows 8.1 Connected (with Bing) operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a windows.old folder and have never performed a systems cleanup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a Windows Rollback available in default operating systems. I do not have a Rollback available in Update &amp; Recovery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initiating rollback in Advanced Startup Recovery nets the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous build. Try resetting your current build instead (Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC)".</p>
<p>
One big issue from this is that because HP Stream 7 is a Windows Connected device I have lost my windows license and am unable to reinstall using standard 8.1 media due to rollback not functioning.<br /></p>

            <p>If your Windows 10 shows permanently activated, you may not have anything left to do from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Administrator Command Prompt, run slmgr /xpr -- if it shows Permanent activation you may be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do want to upgrade from Windows 8.1, I would install 8.1 on another disk partition and preserve your existing Windows 10 as-is.&nbsp; You can easily shrink your C: drive using Disk Management by about 20GB and install Windows 8.1 there to upgrade it, but
 there may be nothing different than what you have now unless the Product Key changes.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously retrieved the windows license key using Nirsoft Keyviewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that Windows 8 retail will not install with a retail disc when using a Windows Connected key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore another issue is that I cannot get the windows 8 installer, launched from within Windows 10, to accept any of my valid windows keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"this product key did not work windows 8.1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And even with the ei.cfg change it gives some sort of error about a license key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply but the issue is not retrieving the license key.</p>

            I'm not interested in running insider builds on this device. I would like to roll back to the old version and legitimately activate upgrade to windows 10 so that there are no future headaches.

            <p>If this is the only way then i am very disappointes with microsoft. Plenty of people out there with legit 7 and 8 and running insider builds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its really bad that these people that have helped microsoft test there product have more of an issue upgrading to the release than your average punter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ubuntu looking good if thats the case.</p>

            <p>I don't have a windows 7 license for this tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a tablet that came with Windows 8.1 embedded aka Windows 8.1 with bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I wrote earlier: Windows 8 retail will not install with a retail disc when using a Windows Connected key.</p>

            <p>The solution is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to a website called The Pirate Bay, searched for "Windows 8.1 with Bing".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does not offer this download, HP wants $40 for it (the tablet is $75). This is a third party build, it is untrusted and should not be installed. Luckily its being upgraded with a clean install straight to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded X19-57134_SW_DVD9_NTRL_Win_with_Bing_8.1_32BIT_English_OEM.img</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used a program called Rufus to image the USB drive. Important to select MBR Partition Scheme with UEFI and Format with
<strong>Fat32 </strong>or it doesn't show in boot menu. Booted from attached USB and performed clean install. Did not need to enter product key, checked key and it was identical to the one from before. Installed wireless drivers and it activated instantly.</p>
<ul>
<li>I had secure boot disabled and bitlocker off.</li><li>Keyboard is necessary.</li></ul>
<p>After dealing with this whole thing I'm not pleased with this experience. The rollback feature failed as much as the official windows support and there was no documented or legit solution for such an issue.</p>

                    <p>My PC was supplied with Microsoft Office Professional 2010. I responded to the invitation to upgrade to 2013 for free.</p>
<p>I have recently had to reinstall Windows 8.1 (having made the mistake of upgrading to Windows 10). I have reinstalled Office 2010, but cannot restore the 2013 upgrade. Is there a way that I can reinstall the free upgrade?</p>

            You need the 2013 key and the original install media, However if during the original 2013 upgrade it was associated with an MS Account, you log on to that MS Account to reinstall<br />

            <p>Thanks for your reply Palcouk.</p>
<p>MS Office 2010 was already installed on my machine from new; there was no original media disk supplied. The activation key was 'embedded' and I had to access that (thank heavens for the net to find out how!) in order to reinstall Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Are you suggesting that in order to get to MS Office 2013, I have to re-install 8.1 via Microsoft, using my MS account details. (I have an account, but it's just a password, with no financial implications).</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>No, if you responded to an offer to upgrade to 2013, you would have been provided with a 2013 key and the installation media</p>
<p>In most instances a 2013 installation is associated with an MS Account, so check your MS Account to see if it shows Office 2013, if it doesn't and you dont have a record of the 2013 Key (which is not the same as any 2010 key) then you cannot reinstall Office
 2013</p>

            You have to bring the phone to a Nokia Care Point to have the software of the phone re-installed.

            Talking about any specific application named 'my family' or asking in general??? Or talking about the message which comes if you are considered minor as per the region of your choice... Generally below 18 is considered minor.

<p>
</p><p>As much as i know, this is legacy code to copy table from Excel to third party application.</p>

<h2>            Two phone, two Outlook accounts...can Ovi sync&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just got two 5530's for my wife and I.&nbsp; We have two different Outlook profiles.&nbsp; I synced her phone first - contacts and calendar went fine.&nbsp; However, when I tried to sync mine (reset the mail profile to mine and restarted Ovi), I had to delete her contacts
 out of Ovi first.&nbsp; Then when I synced it load my contacts.&nbsp; Is there any other way to sync the data?</p>

<p>Hi fishboy1, I would recommend using two Windows user accounts, one for you, one for your wife in this case. This way contents of your devices are separated into separate databases in Nokia Ovi Suite and both you can sync your content to different Outlook
 accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers, Samuli </p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply.&nbsp; Is there any other suggestion?&nbsp; I've had issues using 2 windows accounts with other software (e.g. Quicken).&nbsp; Is there any way to for Ovi to manage 2 accounts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a last resort, I'm thinking we can just merge our data into one Outlook account...but then she'll have my work contacts on her phone and via versa.&nbsp; Calendar's no big deal because we need to coordinate each others schedule anyways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            And what about the situation: I have two phones&nbsp;(different nokia models), one is a private phone, the other is company's mobile. I need to connect both of them to my laptop&nbsp;(to the same windows profile)&nbsp;but I don't want to have the same contacts in every
 phone which I connect to my Ovi - I don't want to have in&nbsp;the company's&nbsp;phone my private contacts, and it happened. Am I doing something wrong? Is it possible to configure Ovi to have two phones without intersection. Thanks.

<p>This is the obvious question. How do I do that? My situation is 2 phones, 1 outlook, 1 ovi suite. i want to keep the data seperate. In outlook they can go into 2 contact folders or even one as long as personal contacts go to phone 1 and business contacts
 to phone 2...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any solution?</p>

    <title>Apps &#40;mail, news, weather and others&#41; crashing in Build 16281 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Apps &#40;mail, news, weather and others&#41; crashing in Build 16281</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble opening apps in Build 16281. If I open an app (mail, news, weather, and some others that I downloaded---Hindi English Dictionary and another Hindi learning app), it will attempt to open for a few seconds and then close.&nbsp; This started
 in the previous build. I have ran the Store app trouble shooter, reset the apps, and deleted and reinstalled those apps that can be reinstalled and deleted. The trouble shooter identified the fact that apps were crashing and suggested resetting them, which
 I did. I continued running the trouble shooter and it suggested that the problem was fixed. This, however, is not the case. This particular build did, however, RESET almost my entire PC, moving my files, clearing passwords, clearing my Edge settings, etc.
 and I am wondering if this has anything to do with the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insights or suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A factor why your applications crashes is due to corrupted system files on your computer. We recommend that you run the System File Checker. System File Check<span>&nbsp;</span><span>is&nbsp;a utility available in Windows 10 that checks for system
 file corruption. If the issue isn't resolved by performing the SFC, kindly use DISM. DISM is used to troubleshoot errors that SFC can't resolve.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>See this article:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026529/windows-using-system-file-checker-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Using System File Checker in Windows 10</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and
 follow the on-screen instructions. In the event that SFC wasn't able to resolve the issue, click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>More info on System File Checker</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and go to DISM on the thread for the steps.</span></p>

<p>After running DISM.exe, I was able to use the vast majority of the apps that were not operational. There were a couple that I downloaded from the store that continued to open briefly and then close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HAVE, HOWEVER, BEEN EXPERIENCING A BIGGER PROBLEMS WITH THE WINDOWS INSIDER UPDATE! As mentioned in my post above, my entire PC was RESET. This has occurred in 3 of 4 updates (16275, 16281 AND NOW 16288). Before taking the time to put the files back into
 place, download deleted apps, etc. I did take some screenshots of what my PC looks like after THIS UPDATE (16288)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of what occurred:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. File Explorer "RESET" with NONE of my old files transferred into the "new" file explorer. Instead they are found under Users, where I find a number of files containing the files that SHOULD have stayed in place during the update. Notice in the screenshot
 the variations on my Computer's name attached to these files. This, of course, also means that my lock screen and background photos did not display after the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My OneDrive files are intact, but will have to be MOVED to the new file explorer in order to avoid having them sync to the new location, once I RESTART OneDrive. I learned this the hard way after my pc was reset with Build 16275.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. ALL Apps and webpages have been unpinned from my taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Start Menu RESET.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Microsoft EDGE has been RESET&nbsp; (including start pages) and the extensions had to be reactivated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Some minor problems restarted my Office Applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Had to "verify" my account as if this were a new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp; Other minor problems, BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT THE UPDATES ARE NOT LEAVING MY PC IN THE STATE IT WAS IN BEFORE THE UPDATE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also happened with the computer, I maintain for my mother. I am on the fast ring and I keep hers on the slow ring. BUILD 16278 TOTALLY reset her computer and I ended up having to put all files back in place, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what the underlying problem is, but am hoping to get some helpful feedback. The attached screenshots show how my computer looks right now. I wanted to wait for a new build with the hopes that it would go smoothly without this type of disruption,
 but decided that if it occurred again, I would send screenshots, before putting everything back into place. Overall, with the exception of the few apps that I could not get to function, my PC functions well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also failed to mention that my PC is a Dell OptiPlex 760 (4 GB Ram--I need more! LOL, 1TB hard drive, dual core), Windows 10 64bit Pro). My other PC is a Dell OptiPlex 780 (4 GB Ram, 250 GB Hard Drive, Windows 10 64-Bit Pro).&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Edge browser has been total reset. Notice "You have a new extension." Furthermore, I don't have "My Feed" set for any news. Had to reset my start page and will later have to re-enter the pages that I have open when I open the Edge Browser.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Start Menu totally RESET! Software for my network printer had to be updated for some reason.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Desktop is reset. I NEVER have these on my desktop, opting to use the desktop shortcut on the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2c7f10e-2c9d-4705-9c29-312d6d75c8a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2c7f10e-2c9d-4705-9c29-312d6d75c8a3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I had to "verify" my account with my password. This did not occur during the two previous disruptive updates.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/515c8068-3f0a-4c8f-ab68-bb293fc0a3b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/515c8068-3f0a-4c8f-ab68-bb293fc0a3b4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>File Explore has, once again, been RESET. MY Files are safe on the PC, BUT NOT in the new File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have been an Insider since June 2015 with no problems and continue to enjoy the program. Just curious about the sudden disruptive updates for my PC. I have not read or heard of any other Insiders with this problem. I hope the screenshots
 will help some of you guys gain some insight into what may be happening.</span></p>
<p><span>I generally format my PC's twice per year and do a clean Windows Install. I am thinking that I may have to do one soon. LOL! Thank you for your assistance in advance.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;I just read through this thread and didn't see anything about backup. &nbsp;So I'll just point out the very important need to back up anything you have on that system that you don't want to lose ASAP because with the strange things you're seeing, something possibly
 could make your system become totally unusable. &nbsp;I hope that doesn't happen, but you know what they say about that ounce of prevention. &nbsp;Two programs I've used a lot are Macrium Reflect and Easeus Todo Backup, both of which have free versions for non-commercial
 use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Good luck!</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind response. I certainly going to take your suggestions and see if any of them might work. If not, I am overdue for the formatting and clean installation of Windows 10. I probably will wait until I can get an IPO for the public release
 of the Fall Creators Update. I think this is necessary because I believe some errors can compound after multiple updates with new builds! Thank you very much for taking the time to provide some helpful comments!</p>

<p>&nbsp;I just read through this thread and didn't see anything about backup. &nbsp;So I'll just point out the very important need to back up anything you have on that system that you don't want to lose ASAP because with the strange things you're seeing, something possibly
 could make your system become totally unusable. &nbsp;I hope that doesn't happen, but you know what they say about that ounce of prevention. &nbsp;Two programs I've used a lot are Macrium Reflect and Easeus Todo Backup, both of which have free versions for non-commercial
 use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Good luck!</p>

<p>Thank you Hula_Baloo for the awesome feedback and suggestions. I am actually pretty good with computers and took for granted that most Insiders would know to back up their PC's. LOL! I have everything backed up and will probably just do a clean install once
 the Public ISOs are available for the Fall Creators Update. I generally do a clean install twice a year, which always gets rid of these quirks. I am, however, wondering if this is more a Window's problem since the computer I maintain for my mother on the slow
 ring experienced exactly the same problems when it was updated to build 16278. Thank you for some great backup sources. The more backups the better. Thank you again!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A factor why your applications crashes is due to corrupted system files on your computer. We recommend that you run the System File Checker. System File Check<span>&nbsp;</span><span>is&nbsp;a utility available in Windows 10 that checks for system file corruption.
 If the issue isn't resolved by performing the SFC, kindly use DISM. DISM is used to troubleshoot errors that SFC can't resolve.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Until Build 16275, I had no problems with updates on TWO Windows 10 PCs, as described in other parts of this thread. I have one on the FAST RING and one on the SLOW RING. On YESTERDAY, the PC on the SLOW RING updated to BUILD 16288 WITH THE EXACT SAME OUTCOME
 THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE. I cannot imagine that both, otherwise very diligently maintained PCs, could have the SAME OUTCOME UNLESS there is something going on with the BUILDS themselves. I noticed that there has been no KNOWN ISSUES shown with any of
 these updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, there is no need to post screenshots because the PC on the SLOW RING LOOKS EXACTLY as my FAST RING PC looked after numerous updates. The other problem that emerged with the PC on the SLOW RING is the cachepurge error with the Windows Store,
 so none of your store apps are functioning and, from what I've researched, there is no way to repair this without reinstalling the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run SFC /scannow and DISM.exe, which do not show any problems, which probably is true because, once I put the files back where they belong, the PCs function beautifully (I should not, however, have to do this after every new build), BUT these updates
 RESET every aspect of my PCs. Perhaps this is not a widespread enough problem to address, BUT as an Insider for over 2 years, I did expect a more thorough investigation of what I reported, some possible reasons (other than file corruption), and some possible
 solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recommendation to you all is that you RELEASE an ISO for every new build on the day that the build is released. Furthermore, with EACH build, we are given the option in Windows Update to allow the build to download and update or PCs as usual or to allow
 us to download the ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a final troubleshooting step, I called Verizon and had them do a check of my DSL line AND my modem. No problems were found. I, therefore, believe there is a problem, which may not have impacted most Insiders, but is nevertheless a problem with these builds.
 In 2 years, I have NEVER had this level of disruption with the installation of new builds.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> cheech313  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restoring an email account</h2>
                    <p>Several days ago it became impossible to log in to my Outlook account with a password that I'm quote *sure* was valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I called Microsoft they gave me a tiny url link to speak with a chat specialist; through that, we set up a temporary alias account and in the course of things, was given links to verify my account. I was given a 25 character code as verification, which
 should have been the end of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some 23 emails from Microsoft and 12 verification codes on my cell phone later, still the account is blocked. I've received subsequent emails saying my account is temporarily suspended. keep being told that they'll get back to me in 24 hours with more details
 and help. It's a continuous loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now I'm suspicious that I've been hacked, as nothing is working, and I keep being asked to fill out verification forms asking for personal information. Answers back say things like "you've not given us enough information" and more [see below] included
 among the lines is credit card info, which of course I'd never fill out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been getting emails from an address that is hard to verify as being microsoft. When I check it, Safari cannot find anything. &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">@css.one.microsoft.com

<p>Hi Harry,</p>
<p>I assume that the event you mentioned is EX43992, which was resolved at 19th March. After that, we haven’t received any reports regarding the issue yet.</p>
<p>We suggest you use another admin to grant the delegation permissions.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t work, please check whether PowerShell works for you.</p>
<p>1.Use admin credentials to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a></p>
<p>2. Refer to the following article to grant mailbox permission.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The option to change the font size is not possible in the new Skype version, you can install the classic Skype version 7.41 to change the font size. To install the classic Skype, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click this link: <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
</li><li>Click the <strong>v</strong> button and select <strong>Get classic Skype.</strong></li></ol>
<p>After installing the classic Skype, follow the steps below to change the font size:</p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong>
</p><ol>
<li>
In the menu bar, select <strong>
Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>
Options</strong>.</li><li>
Click <strong>
IM &amp; SMS</strong> and select <strong>
IM appearance</strong>.</li><li>
Click <strong>
Change font</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In the new Skype for Windows desktop, Mac and Linux or Windows 10 (UWP), there's no option to change the actual font size. However, you can use the zoom in-out option to enlarge the text. For more information, you may refer to this FAQ:

<h3> kcm-fcc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Online - 2 Issues &#40;undo and menu&#41;</h2>
                    <p>We collaborate a multi worksheet excel file.&nbsp; If more than 1 person is editing the sheet at the same time the undo function only works for the last person who entered data.&nbsp; Ex.&nbsp; If Jane enters info in cell A1 and B1 and then John enters data in cell E12
 and D2 - Jane cannot undo anything (undo is grey) and John can undo his items AND the items Jane entered.&nbsp;<strong> Is there a way to limit the undo function on a shared worksheet to only undo data entered by the person clicking undo?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We like the right-click worksheet menu function (Activate) in the desktop application.&nbsp; Is there a way to make this work in Excel online?</p>

<p>Hi KCM-FCC,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I replicated your concern and the results were the same as what you have observed. The reason behind is the limitation of the online Excel app. Advanced options are available on the desktop version of Excel. The right click menu function
 is also one of the limitations of the online app. If you need further information about the undo function, you click this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/undo-redo-or-repeat-an-action-84bdb9bc-4e23-4f06-ba78-f7b893eb2d28#ID0EAABAAA=Online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take note that here in Microsoft, we value everyone’s ideas. We don’t want to miss an idea that can be useful in the future. I strongly suggest to post this concern to our
<strong><a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/search?query=excel+online+undo+button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel UserVoice</a></strong> team, so that our engineers and software developers can see your post. If it gets enough votes, it will be added
 on the next update.</p>

I would very much want to change the sound Skype makes when I get a call or message. Unfortunately...<br />

</p><p>&gt;&gt;<span>This app will also recognize the native settings of your device</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>No. The sound that Skype makes does not even resemble any of my device's "native" sounds, even less so the one I set as default for notifications. If it at least used my default sound for notifications, that would be a great start.</span></p>

<p>This is unfortunate because the Skype default notification sound is not able to be heard by my wife when her phone is in her handbag or elderly relatives who use Skype to phone us (and vice versa). Hopefully the megacompany that is Microsoft will soon be
 able to tweak this minor failure so the user can change the ringtone with their own sounds to fix this.</p>

            We have been asking for this for a few years now and still we can't get this. the Skype chat sound on android and IOS sucks cuz you can bearly hear it. If we can set our own custom notifications, then that'll be good. my gf also has&nbsp; Skype on e a blue
 studio advance android, and she don't get messages most of the time on Skype when she's out of the app. Skype&nbsp; for me is not getting better, but worse. I remember when I use to be on a Skype call for like&nbsp; days. and it&nbsp; wouldn't cut off. but now ever so often
 it does cut off. anyway, I hope this can get resolved with the notifications.

            The only way to change notification sound and/or volume is by manual change/edit the m4a file into APK.<br />
Steps:<br />
1. google how to download skype_ver_x.xx.x.apk file<br />
2. google how to explode .apk file (if still valid [URL="https://blog.bramp.net/post/2015/08/01/decompile-and-recompile-android-apk/"]click here[/URL])<br />
3. the file you must change is into skype\res\raw\skype_notification.m4a.<br />
3.1 download the .mp3, .wav, .any sound format you like as notification for your skype<br />
3.2 optional but i suggest you to use a sound editor to increase the volume of that file<br />
3.3 google convert .mp3 or .wav or whatever you found into .m4a<br />
3.4 rename your notification file into skype_notification.m4a<br />
3.5 replace with the one into: skype\res\raw\skype_notification.m4a.<br />
4. repack the skype <br />
5. sign it<br />
6. zipalign it<br />
7. copy into your phone download folder or sent it via email or whatever<br />
8. install it through your phone and BINGO!<br />

<p>TonySoprano - this is an excellent solution but rather complicated and I suspect will also need to be repeated every time Skype is updated.</p>
<p>My solution is to tell people to contact me on Messenger or WhatsApp as I cannot guarantee that I will hear the notification on my Android phone. Many of my friends have migrated away from Skype for the same reason and only use Skype for prescheduled voice
 calls. It's a shame when a good and highly popular application like Skype kills itself by being non-standard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems to me that there would be a lot of people at Microsoft who could do this and get a loud notification when a new text arrived just like 1000 other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it must be that Microsoft don't want to support and encourage Skype lite even though it is a great product and seems to work reliably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one problem- the notification sound is low and not customizable- probably less than 1 basis point of Microsoft's profit to fix.</p>

                    Greetings!<br />
I regularly need to switch between Print Layout and Outline View when working with Word. In Word 2013, the Status Bar no longer includes Outline View as one of the three options (Read Mode, Print Layout, and Web Layout). It does not appear that these three
 options can be changed from the Customize Status Bar option menu. And having to navigate to the View tab in the Ribbon in order to switch to Outline View is not as efficient has being able to click on an icon in the Status Bar. Is there a way to add Outline
 View to the Status Bar in Word 2013?<br />
Thanks!<br />

            You can use built-in shortcut keys: Alt+Ctrl+O switches to Outline view and Alt+Ctrl+P switches to Print Layout view. (To be specific, Alt+Ctrl+O runs the ViewOutline command and Alt+Ctrl+P runs the ViewPage command; you can assign different shortcuts
 if you want to.)

            As Rohn says, you can't add it to the status bar, but you can add it to the QAT quite easily (no macro needed). On the View tab, right-click on the Outline button and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Contact the website you are trying to access...this may be a programming error from the website you are trying to access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is a computer on a company network contact the Help Desk.... they may be blocking access to Facebook....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the fb connect library is computer code that facebook distributes to web sites, that allows the website to communicate with facebook to retrieve your details from them to be used by that website....</p>
<p>typically websites use this information to 'log' you into their website without the need for you to fill in additional forms with your details or to use new passwords and email addresses. Normally only your email address is required, but carefully read the
 facebook login prompt which discloses exactly what information the website is requesting from facebook (fb).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally scripting errors (the type of error you are describing) are hidden from users as they are technical in nature and do not impart any misfunctionality....</p>
<p>To turn off scripting errors go Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced tab, uncheck "Display notification about every script error"</p>
<p>When asking a question in this forum it is helpful if you can provide the address of the website that you are having problems with.</p>

            I've had several issues with my Nokia Lumia 1520 with the Windows Insider programme and the best thing you can do is simply wait for the next announced build, then (usually) the problem will be fixed and you can enjoy your consumer build for the mean time,
 honestly as I gave away my Nokia Lumia 1520 and mainly use my Microsoft Nokia Lumia 930
<em>I bought a really cheap</em> Microsoft Lumia 532 to install Windows Insider builds on so if your main motivation is to test out new builds you can always buy a Microsoft Lumia 532, Microsoft Lumia 532 Dual S.I.M., Microsoft Lumia 430, Microsoft Lumia 430
 Dual S.I.M., Microsoft Lumia 435, or Microsoft Lumia 435 Dual S.I.M. to try out new builds on.

We are getting a pop up message like "We can't connect to Outlook right now. Please try again later"<br />

We have found that IE was causing the issue, then we have degraded and checked, No luck.<br />

Checked with Firefox and thunderbird, mails were sending and receive the mails without any pop up error. But after few days, the issue started rising again.<br />

Can anyone gives any idea to fix this issue permanently?<br />

<p>Hi Aimee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand based on your description, the user who has been removed from the distribution group(DG) can still receive the emails sent to this DG.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given this situation, I’d like to confirm how long you removed the user. If you delete a member from a group, the system takes about 24-48 hours to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can also run the following PowerShell command as an admin role to get the DG list:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p><em>Get-DistributionGroupMember -Identity "Technical Support"</em></p>
<p>This example returns the existing distribution group members for the distribution group named Technical Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check whether the user was actually removed from the DG list. If not, you can refer to the following steps to remove him:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log into <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Admin Center</a> &gt; <strong>recipients</strong> &gt; <strong>groups</strong> &gt; double click on the distribution group &gt;
<strong>membership</strong> &gt; remove this user &gt; <strong>save</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can also run the following PowerShell command to remove users from DG:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p><em>Remove-DistributionGroupMember -Identity "Technical Support" -Member "Jan Dryml"</em></p>
<p>This example removes Jan Dryml from the distribution group named Technical Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I suggest you try <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200712%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
to run a message trace</a> and check if the message was forwarded to the user. Message trace shows what actions were taken on the message before it reached its final status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>
