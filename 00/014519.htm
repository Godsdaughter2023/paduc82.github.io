<h2>            Reset Protection Recovery Key</h2>
                    <p>I reset my phone and I did not know it has the reset protection. I do not have the phone on my account anymore and do not have the reset protection recovery key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried calling Microsoft, but they never answer, I am just given options and then "thanks for calling Microsoft" and disconnected. It is so stressful</p>

<p>Hello Kim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>Reset Protection</strong> feature is an added layer of protection for your Windows Phone to help you protect the data on it and can't be easily reset or reused. The recovery key is sent to the email address associated with your Microsoft account
 and can be turned off during the phone set up.</p>

    <title>Vertical Scrolling in Subform Datasheet View - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronaldoonenil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vertical Scrolling in Subform Datasheet View</h2>
                    I have a Subform that displays in datasheet view. I am using a mouse up event to trap a click on the record selector so that I can "process" the record I have clicked. The problem I have is that when the datasheet view only has a few records there is a
 whole area below the last record that can still be clicked. I want this area to be inactive. The other problem is when I have several records, the vertical scroll bar appears but scrolls too far. It always scrolls so that the last record is at the top of the
 subform view leaving the whole blank area below which can again be clicked.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, can the blank area below the last record be deactivated, and can the scroll bar scroll so that the last record is at the bottom of the display so that no blank area is visible ?</div>
                </div>

            When you click on a RecordSelector you trigger the On Click event (or Double Click) of the form (in this case the subform). So I would put your code there, not the mouse up event.
<div><br />
<div>So the first thing you do is:</div>
<div><br />
<div>If IsNull(me.keycontrol) Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Sub</div>
<div>End If</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the user then clicks on a new or blank record, the click will be ignored.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Check what code you have in the subform. Generally, when a user selects or enters a subform focus is on the first record.&nbsp;</div>

            Thanks for the reply but it does not do what I want.
<div><br />
<div>The reason I used mouse up is so that I can detect a right click and also the position of the click so I know whether I clicked the record selector or anywhere else on the datasheet view subform.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My datasheet displays with the first record selected so if I use the on click event &nbsp;and click a column header or a record selector beyond the last record my keycontrol is not null.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My aim is to only allow the record selector to be right clicked.</div>

            Doesn't matter now. I have changed it so that I check for a double click on the key control in the datasheet view.

            <p>That can't be done. If you connect your phone to a WiFi/mobile data it will connect to the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a smartphone and one if it's feature is to connect to the internet. Why do you want to block the internet acces on your phone? Do you want to stop syncing or implement a child account?<br />

<h3> wald15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Send mail with an alias as sender on a shared mailbox</h2>
                    <div>Hi</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a shared mailbox that multiple users in my company have access to: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It has the following aliases: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have made rules that when an email is sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, the mail goes in a folder under inbox called shared1 and the same with shared2 and shared3</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A user are responsible for each own subfolder, and I would like that when a user answers an email in his/her subfolder. For example, shared1, the sender's email address will be *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>By default the primary SMTP address: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is used as From address when replying mails, and if I change the From field to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, then it comes with an error and says: the message can not be sent.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas for how to send From an alias</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The reason i ask is that the company I'm employed at have 500+ shared mailboxes (for 270 employees) and many users have access to a lot of shared mailboxes, some have more than 20, and it's really bad for performance.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hope you can help</div>

            While using one alias per shared mailbox is generally the recommended method, since you already have a lot of shared mailboxes you can try using a utility - there are quite a few that can do this. I have a list at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/exchange/shared-mailboxes-and-the-default-send-from-account/#tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/exchange/shared-mailb...</a> 
<br />
<br />Test the utility on one mailbox to see if it works correctly with shared mailboxes. (I've used several of them, but only with a licensed mailbox.)

<h2>            Printing Multiple Pages Per Sheet Double Sided on Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>I am using Microsoft Word 2013 and trying to manually print double sided with multiple pages per sheet. I am printing on a Epson Stylus NX420 printer. Not sure if the problem is due to the printer or Word, but here's what it does:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can print multiple pages per sheet when I select this option by itself.</p>
<p>I can manually print double sided when I select this option by itself.</p>
<p>But when I select both printing multiple pages per sheet double sided, it defaults to printing 1 page per sheet double sided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to be printing a lot of paper in the coming months, so if anyone has dealt with this and knows of a solution, it would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            You're at the mercy of the quality of print driver as written by Epson. You can try updating the driver to see if a newer version may have fixed this bug. Here's a Microsoft page on the subject:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-and-install-printer-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find
 and Install Printer Drivers</a>&nbsp;Here's the Epson page for your printer:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=151211&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=OSF_W_7-32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Epson Driver Downloads</a>&nbsp;Unfortunately,
 since it's an older printer, the newest driver is from 2011.

            <p>A work around would be to download the free PrimoPDF converter that will install itself as a printer and use it to print the document two pages per sheet to a pdf file and then print the pdf from Adobe Reader using the duplexing facility of either Adobe
 Reader, or of the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that Adobe Reader has a booklet printing capability that you may be able to make use of.</p>

<h2>            IMAP email problems</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to set up IMAP email on my windows 7 Laptop. I am getting an error message in Live Mail and outlook (2002): 'the server has issued an unrecognized greeting' with details as the following:</p>
<p>K Hello there.</p>
<p>Configuration:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Account: Pathlesstrodden (alison)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Server: rotherham.webhosting.uk.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; User name: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Protocol: IMAP<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Port: 995<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure(SSL): 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code: 80004005</p>
<p>I have been through technical support with my service provider and all of my settings are correct. I have tried using both outlook and Live Mail on this computer with the same result as well as different port settings (143/993/995 etc as well as with/without
 SSL).&nbsp;I have also tried those settings on a vista computer in outlook on the same network and they work perfectly. POP3 connections work fine on this computer although GMAIL IMAP does not. From this I guessed it might be a firewall issue but I have turned
 off the norton and windows firewalls and this makes no difference.</p>
<p>I am completely at a loss, can anyone help?</p>
<p>Alison</p>

<p>Live Mail doesn't allow IMAP connections so trying the same account settings for it is pointless and explains why you get "the same result" when you try.&nbsp; You must use either a POP account or an Outlook Connector account to access Live.</p>
<p>Gmail IMAP access must be enabled on the gmail side before Outlook will allowed to connect with an IMAP account.</p>
<p>You should have only one firewall.&nbsp; Having both the Windows and the Norton firewalls enabled will lead to problems.</p>
<p>The fact that you mention a Symantec product leads me to suggest this article:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You receive the "0x80004005 : The operation failed" error message when you receive new e-mail messages in Outlook</a>.</p>

<p>I have tried on Outlook 2002 with two seperate email accounts. One is my domain - I followed their instructions to the letter, the other is Gmail which is set up for IMAP access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only have one firewall enabled.</p>
<p>I read the article&nbsp;you suggested. Norton 360 does not have script blocking. However, I have just retested this with Norton&nbsp;completely disabled on my machine and it still&nbsp;does not work. I get the following errors:</p>
<p>Task 'Alison at plt: Folder:Inbox Check for new mail.' reported error (0x800CCC0E) : 'Could not fetch new headers in the folder Inbox for Account Alison at plt. Error:Unable to connect to the server..'&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute as to why you're not able to open any sections in a OneNote notebook that was password protected on an Android phone. One possible reason is that there are data files in the application that got corrupted.
 For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any error messages that showed up when you attempted to open the password protected sections of the notebook on a different device?</li><li>Have you attempted to use a different Android device to open the password protected sections of the notebook and verify if the same issue occurs?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you completed?</li><li>What is the exact version number of the OneNote application installed on your Android phone?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>
        </p>

<p>No error message popped up. Used another Android phone with the OneNote app already installed, and still cannot open. The version on both Android phones is 16.0.8528.2502.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had to create a new notebook to resolve the problem with a different password. Did this on the PC.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You haven't said what kinds of things you do with your computer and how you like to do them or what things you wished you could do or do better. &nbsp;So no one here has any idea whether you should get Windows 10 or not.</p>

            <p>If ya are happy with what you have, and not concerned about the eventual end of life of the OS and driver support, then why are you asking for people to convince you to upgrade. &nbsp;I say if you like what you got, stick with it... If not, give Win10 a try and
 see if it's any better for you... Just make sure that you take a good backup image of your current installation first, so that you can go right back to how you were in case it doesn't work out for you. &nbsp;Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good one!</p>

            <p>With no knowledge about what you have, how you use it, what age and condition your laptops are&nbsp;and what you expect from these laptops no one can really tell you why you should stay where you are or move to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have till July 2016 to avail yourself of the free upgrade. In that time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Win 10 will get better,</li><li>Win 7 and 8.1 will get progressively more out-of-date but still will "work&nbsp;fine" and be supported by MS,</li><li>Drivers and devices will be tweaked to work better with Win 10,</li><li>Software, especially utilities and Universal apps, will&nbsp;be&nbsp;updated or&nbsp;created with Win 10 more in mind,</li><li>Support people (in work, on line and within your friends and family networks) will know more about how to get the most out of Win 10.</li></ul>
<p>Win 10 is, in my experience with my computers, faster but it may not be on older or less capable computers. It is more secure than older versions.&nbsp;The new Start menu is&nbsp;more flexible and customisable than&nbsp;old Win 7 version - but there are annoyances such
 as sort order in the all apps is fixed with no option to sort by folder then program. For all except pure tablets it is better than Win 8.1 because it loses the horrible charms and it is no longer a schizophrenic OS - the Desktop has supremacy and the Metro
 / Universal apps are just as if they are another program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that the July release is going to be updated this month, I would wait till that occurs, then look at your needs, the critical software you use, the devices they are connected to and then make up your own mind. With a more specific question based on
 this analysis, people may be able to help you.</p>

            <p>It is not noticeably faster than 8.1 but that is like talking about two thorobreds when it comes to discussing performance. &nbsp;The best speed results following a clean installation (fewer services running) so if you upgrade consider doing that second. &nbsp;If
 the computer has been accumulating "stuff" for a couple of years it will make a difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft continues to add and improve security concepts coded into the OS so yes, it is technically safer than 8.1 and a lot safer than 7. &nbsp;There is always some kind of performance hit from security but Windows 10 does a good job with it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Defender has become a very competitive anti-virus program and I would rely on that at least for a few weeks until you know your way around the system. &nbsp;Some AV programs slow the system noticeably so I am waiting for reviews to accumulate before considering
 doing anything else. &nbsp;Microsoft updates Defender virus definitions several times a day. &nbsp;Watch your download sites like a hawk. &nbsp;There are a lot of browser hijackers lurking in them there woods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge is not a mature browser yet but one thing I do like about it is its time to load a web page. &nbsp;The drawback with Edge for a lot of users is that there are no extensions yet and a lot more can be done with its features. &nbsp;The public release this week completes
 the first phase of deployment for Widows 10 and Micorosft is going to focus on a new phase involving a lot more new features between now and July, including extensions for Edge. &nbsp;Performance-wise I like it a lot better than IE11, but right now there are things
 that Edge just doesn't do yet. &nbsp;Microsoft has gone as far as they can go with IE11 and a whole new browser takes years to do. &nbsp;They are about in the middle of that stream right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't load up with your favorite third-party utilities for a few weeks because they all run services and the over-all performance hit is noticeable. &nbsp;Wait until you see how the streamlined system runs first and have a chance to find all of the built in maintenance
 apps that may save using third-party equivalents altogether.</p>

            <p>The chances of picking up a virus is lessened if you know what sites you are surfing,&nbsp; Also most of the virus and Malware are picked up by clicking on links in e-mails from people that you do not know. and not looking at the address of the sender of the
 Email even though they look like a legitimate company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last 3 month I have reported over 6 Phishing e-mails that said the were telling me the my mail box was full and to tell them what the password I was using.&nbsp; Checking where they came from I could see that they were not legitimate for the company.&nbsp;
 3 were from my service provider and they have an address where you can report the phishing where they can do something about it.</p>

            <p>You can simply connect your phone to your computer (using the USB cable that came with your phone). The open Windows Explorer and the phone will appear as a device and you can simply drag and drop the files back and forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An even easier way might be to download the official Windows Phone app from the Windows Store:</p>

            1. Windows Key+I &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera &gt; Make sure that Let apps use my camera hardware is ON
<br />Also down below Choose apps that can use your camera is ON for Skype
<br />
<br />2. To isolate the issue, can you make call using either Web Skype or Classic Skype (Download)
<br />
<br />Web Skype - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Download and install Classic Skype - <a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.
<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work - Share with me your DirectX Diagnostic report
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type dxdiag and Enter &gt; Save All information (down button) to a Text file &gt; Upload text file to Onedrive and share the link here

<h2>            office 2013 activation issues&#58; Is there any way we can get the office.com account changed so it will take all 50 lisences&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I encountered following issue from my customer: </p>
<p>

</p><p><em><span>I have been working with a client who purchased
<strong><span>50 office 2013 home and business lisences</span></strong>, instead of a 50 seat MAK.</span></em></p>

<p><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></p>

<p><em><span>The software has now been installed on the machines but we found out a little to late that the
<span><strong>office.com accounts can only hold 20 lisences</strong></span> before it kicks out the oldest lisences.</span></em></p>
<span><strong>office.com accounts can only hold 20 lisences</strong></span> before it kicks out the oldest lisences.</span></em></p>

<p><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em>Is there any way we can get the office.com account changed so it will take all 50 lisences?</em></strong><em>
<strong>If not can some of the lisences keys be moved to another office.com account?</strong>
</em></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried following ways:</p>
<p><strong>1). Phone call</strong></p>
<p><strong>2). Chat with us</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6a86cb0-8746-4c20-9f87-53cea89b5c94" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>However didn't get any suggestions till now. The issue was&nbsp;passed from department to department.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone encountered this kind of issue? Really appreciate any sharing or suggestions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

            <p>Yes, many people have encountered this issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>No, there is no fix.&nbsp; MS is strongly discouraging using generic accounts, they won't help make the problem worse. All you can do is used additional generic IDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, you should contact the vendor they bought the licences from and or MS to see if you can get a credit on purchase of "proper" 365 business licenses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use real employee ID's to do the install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter how you do it, generic ID's or unique ID's, make sure you create a document / spreadsheet to associated the product keys to email IDs. You will need this info inf future to transfer installations.&nbsp; MS will NOT provide you with this info!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has done a really carpy job of communicating how to deal with the new licensing schemes.</p>

<strong>DIY Process for Managing Office 2013/365 licenses</strong>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/62a46d97-d0eb-4153-bd48-6bbfc40b27be?threadId=b7ecaf66-b16e-4dc9-9b31-b24fb3eb25b1">Read this reply</a> on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>For those visiting this thread in 2015 (or later):</p>
<p><strong>UNOFFICIAL "OFFICE 2013 FOR BUSINESS" MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE:</strong></p>
<p>I ran into the issues discussed in this thread with Microsoft Office 2013 for Business as well; I support multiple companies as a tech consultant &amp; had to create a manual workflow for this. &nbsp;It is not a professional move by Microsoft at all, but I'd imagine
 that it is by design: they want you to buy a monthly 365 subscription, so they're providing the minimum level of effort required to manage anything other than a bulk open-license KMS/MAK mass-activation service. &nbsp;The bottom line is that you have to manage
 the license key list manually yourself, sorted by order of activation - otherwise you are screwed. &nbsp;If you're already past that point, then you're in for a research project, which is annoying, but only has to be done once. &nbsp;This is what you need to know:</p>
<p>1. For the 2013 Home &amp; Business version, Microsoft requires an Office license key to be activated against an MS Live account. &nbsp;See #2 &amp; #3 below.</p>
<p>2. Although that email address is required for activation, that account can be de-coupled within an Office program after installation (it will default over to say the local domain account you're logged into), so you don't have to worry about having to manage
 your Microsoft activation "admin" account email address on every single computer (ex. Word: File &gt; Account &gt; "Sign out"). &nbsp;The sign-out is a one-time requirement &amp; enables the computer to be "standalone".</p>
<p>3. The MS Live account can be based on any email address, so you can do *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to have an in-house "admin account for managing the license keys.</p>
<p>4. You can only activate 30 products (2013 Office family products, that is) per Live account (Office, Project, etc.). &nbsp;You can, of course, have multiple accounts since accounts are simply tied to a unique email address - so just make more email addresses.</p>
<p>5. I create a generic email address at each company I support (ex. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***). &nbsp;If they have more than 30 accounts, I created a second account (ex. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***). &nbsp;Technically they should be going with a MAK or KMS solution for a larger quantity of installations,,
 but I support many businesses with less than 300 users who don't have the infrastructure or buying workflow to setup app servers or who don't want to buy in bulk. &nbsp;A lot of smaller companies buy computers on an as-needed basis &amp; have no interest in buying
 licenses in bulk, especially since the cost for an open license is nearly twice as much as a single one-off license from a reseller like Amazon.</p>
<p>6. The keys are numbered based on the date &amp; time when you registered them at <a href="http://office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>office.com/setup</span></a> - but Microsoft does not track the order for you, and the order listed in your account has no relevance to the actual order. &nbsp;The information is hidden in a Microsoft database &amp; it not visible in your account. &nbsp;Thus, it is
 YOUR JOB to track them manually. &nbsp;I use a simple Excel spreadsheet (or if the company doesn't have much in the way of email, just setup a Gmail account to pair the Live account to, then use a Google Docs spreadsheet). &nbsp;I have the following column headers:</p>
<p>1) Live account email address (if they're planning on having more than 30 keys, since the email address must be different for the second group of 30 keys)</p>
<p>2) Activation number (1 through 30)</p>
<p>3) The license number itself</p>
<p>4) A computer identified (asset ID, username, workstation name, anything to know which computer it was installed on)</p>
<p>If the company has more than 30 keys, I create a new sheet in the Excel workbook to track the additional licenses. &nbsp;Regarding licenses, you have 3 choices:</p>
<p>1. OEM (comes with the computer, say a Dell computer pre-loaded with Digital Delivery or a keycard)</p>
<p>2. Physical keycard (the ones in the small box)</p>
<p>3. Digital key delivery</p>
<p>Amazon has digital key delivery, which lets you buy a key instantly. &nbsp;It's nice to have instant delivery, but that Amazon account has to be tied to an email address &amp; managed by somebody, so it may be easier to have physical product keycards. &nbsp;Price is typically
 the same as the download version.</p>
<p>7. If you pick the wrong number when activating Office, you can reset it by going into Programs &amp; Features, right-clicking on the Office program, clicking Change, and selecting Online Repair. &nbsp;This resets it to asking you to sign into to activate again (the
 old command-line re-arm commands don't work like previous versions of Office). &nbsp;However, this takes a LONG TIME. &nbsp;It's MUCH faster to simply un-install &amp; reinstall Office. &nbsp;Speaking of that, you can download an image of the installer from your Live account.
 &nbsp;Find a Microsoft Office listing under My Account, then go to&nbsp;Install from a disc &gt; I want to burn a disc &gt; Download (green button). &nbsp;It will download an IMG file, which you can either burn to a disc with something like ImgBurn, or mount with something like
 Pismo File Mount (install, then right-click and select "Quick Mount" to temporarily convert it to a read-only folder).</p>
<p>I drag out the installation folder &amp; just use that, either off the company's file server, or off my personal USB stick. &nbsp;This is the fastest way to install &amp; re-install; otherwise you have to stream the installation from the Internet, which can take a super
 long time. &nbsp;If you need to reinstall or transfer the license to new hardware, but get an error that the key was already activated, you can call in using the number on the Microsoft activation</p>
<p>8. I activate all keys by registering them on the Live account first, rather than when doing setup on the computer. &nbsp;That way, on the local computer, I just install Office for Business from the folder off my USB stick, sign in with the email account, select
 the number I want to use, and it's ready to go. &nbsp;To do that, first login to your Live account:</p>
<p><a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://login.live.com/</span></a></p>
<p>Once you are logged in, type in your key code here:</p>
<p><a href="https://officesetup.getmicrosoftkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://officesetup.getmicrosoftkey.com/</span></a></p>
<p>Then write it down in your personal license tracking spreadsheet - which email address you used (the Live account), which computer it's going on, which number it is, and what the license number is. &nbsp;This lets you easily reference it later.</p>
<p>9. If you need to transfer the license (or have changed hardware &amp; it freaks out), install it &amp; select the number from the list, then call them to reactivate it. &nbsp;When it asks you how many computers you've installed it on, say "one", then it walk you through
 activating it on the new computer or replacement hardware.</p>
<p>All of this could be solved if Microsoft would simply provide you with a numbered list based the date you registered the key in your Live account. &nbsp;It's also ridiculous that they limit each account to 30 products, and further ridiculous that they require
 an email address simply to register a standard piece of software. &nbsp;Fortunately, these workarounds DO work. &nbsp;You can de-couple your Live account after Office is installed &amp; activated. &nbsp;You can create a second email account for the next batch of 30 licenses.
 &nbsp;You can track the licenses &amp; associated information manually in a spreadsheet. &nbsp;It's just extremely annoying.</p>
<p>I did not realize all of this the first time I did it. &nbsp;I had already installed 19 keys, and needed to reinstall Office on a computer that had the original hard drive fail. &nbsp;Boy, what a nightmare that was! &nbsp;To add more salt to the wound, you can't just pull
 a key out using a key finder - the best you can do is find the last 5 digits or so of the key, because of the way Microsoft requires online activation now - it doesn't actually store the installed key on the computer in an accessible manner (not that it would
 matter - you'd still have to know what number it corresponds to in your Live account anyway, so you HAVE to keep track of it in a personal spreadsheet regardless).</p>
<p>TL;DR: Microsoft makes you register an email for Live account to activate Office &amp; store your license keys in. &nbsp;Each account can hold 30 license keys, and you can add more accounts by creating a different email address (doesn't have to be a Microsoft email).
 &nbsp;However - and this is the core problem identified by this thread - they don't track the order, so you have to do that yourself - #1, #2, #3, #4, etc. - because when you install Office, it asks you for which number it is, not what license key it is (which
 is horribly stupid). &nbsp;This is based on the time &amp; date activated, so #1 would be the one you registered on Live last week, #2 would be the one you registered 3 days ago, and #3 would be the one you registered today. &nbsp;They do not make that information visible,
 so it's easy to create a big mess if you don't track it.</p>

            Thank you for the info, but I know about changing the font within messages.&nbsp; I want to change the font style for&nbsp;other Outlook functions, e.g., my list of folders, the huge Subject line, etc.&nbsp; I don't like&nbsp;the font for&nbsp;all the surrounding Outlook features
 because when I adjust font size or page size, the static areas of the page are very difficult to adjust to reading easily...they are either way too large&nbsp;or way too small. How can I change this?&nbsp;

            Once the update is ready to be delivered to your phone, you'll see a message on the phone screen indicating that the update is ready and advising you to connect your phone to the computer and get the Zune desktop software running.&nbsp;

            We don't know. It will be as much of a surprise to us as to you. Individual devices, carriers, etc, schedules have not been published. Only official word has been early 2013, but it appears some updates in some venues are showing up. I can only suggest
 patience.

<h2>            Upload Center Cache Needs Repair Error</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I had to acquire two Microsoft accounts (home and business), my computer constantly receives the same error when attempting to open any Microsoft software application. &nbsp;"The Microsoft Office Upload Center found a problem while accessing the Microsoft
 Office Document Cache and needs to repair it before it can continue. &nbsp;As par t of the repair a copy of the cache will be saved as a backup and a new cache will be created"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found this same error on the Microsoft Community to perform a clean boot and then open the upload center and clear the cache; however, when I do these steps then open the upload center, this error pops up and the Upload Center will not allow me to clear
 the cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this problem?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Upload Center gives the status of the files you're uploading to a server via one location. When you upload a file to a web server, it will first save that file locally to the Office Document Cache before it starts the upload, which means that
 you can save changes and immediately continue working even when you are offline or have a bad network connection. To fix this issue, we suggest that you follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Find the <em>2016 upload center</em> in the list. Right-click on the <strong>
Upload Center</strong> and click for the details.</li><li>You’ll see all the processes that are using the <em>Upload center</em> right now. Make sure you end them all.</li><li>Go to <strong>%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\</strong>. </li><li>You'll find a directory named <strong>OfficeFileName</strong>. Rename it to<strong> OLD_OfficeFileName</strong>. Do not delete it yet.</li><li>Now restart your computer. The Upload Center will recreate this directory.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know if the steps provided above works for you.</span></span><span>
<br />

    <title>Microsoft Excel - Pivot Table - Filters - Missing Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> filterguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Excel - Pivot Table - Filters - Missing Data</h2>
                    <p>In my Microsoft Excel pivot table, I have a field with approximately one thousand items, which is below the 10,000 item limit for a drop down list or filter field.&nbsp; When I place the item in the "filter" section, some of the items are missing from the drop
 down list!&nbsp; When I move the field from the "Filter" section to the "Rows" section, then all the items appear - the missing items have mysteriously re-appeared.&nbsp; When I move the field back from "Rows" to "Filter" the same items are again missing from the filter
 drop-down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't all the items show up in the "Filter" drop down list?&nbsp; How do I get them to show up so I can select them for filtering my report? Thank you for taking a look at this.</p>

<p>My issue is not learning how to use Excel filters within pivot tables, but I suspect that&nbsp;the issue is that Excel Pivot Tables are not working properly - I think that maybe Excel is exhibiting a bug or erratic behavior. I know that is arrogant to say but
 I have been using Excel Pivot Tables for a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did an experiment and the troublesome behavior goes away if I drastically reduce the amount of data in the pivot table. Then then mysterious pieces of data that are somehow excluded from showing up in the filter drop down start appearing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table of data 13 columns across and around 3,000 rows down. This should not be any problem.&nbsp; But when I create a pivot table, some small percentage of items are excluded from showing up in the filter drop downs.&nbsp; To experiment, I deleted half the
<p>
</p><p>So I think there is a memory issue. It is odd that Excel would not give an error message but instead starts excluding data from the pivot table filter drop-down.&nbsp; I have 8 MB RAM and the RAM usage is typically around 35%.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also&nbsp;see a feature called "Unshare Workbook" which is grayed out, meaning I cannot select whether or not to use the SHARE feature. I&nbsp;have read&nbsp;that the Share Workbook feature is very problematic and reduces a pivot table's capacity.&nbsp; It concerns me that
 "Share Workbook" is not what is showing, but instead "Unshare Workbook" is showing but it is grayed out so I cannot adjust its status. I wonder if the problem is related to this?</p>

There is a view at the top right side of the screen but that is limited to three calender options an agenda and tasks.&nbsp;

Is there a way to combine the views such as monthly calender and tasks??<br />

<p>1. &nbsp;I am refering to Outlook 2016 - Office 365</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;I am not aware of making any changes...what sort of changes might have done this?</p>

            Got that. Has any new software or hardware been added recently? Did you also change any settings on your email prior to this issue? Have you also tried removing and re-adding the email account?

            There has been no new software or hardware. &nbsp;Uninstalling and re-installing has given me some grief in the past...likely due to my challenged knowledge of how things work. &nbsp;I have not changed any settings...sometimes I do change font size or style...but
 not recently. &nbsp; &nbsp;You are suggesting I uninstall Office 365 and re-install it?

    <title>Office cannot read Excel Data Source&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office cannot read Excel Data Source&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I am trying to make labels for a mass mailing my company would like to do and I am encountering a problem I don't understand.
<br />
For background, I have made labels before using Office/Excel 2007 on a windows and now I am using Office/Excel 2011 on a mac.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I made my excel sheet with four columns for First Name, Last Name, Address and City/State/Zip Code. I have the top row labeled as such. I don't know if I need to do anything else, normally I would have to select the data and create a group for them, but
 when I try to do the same thing now by hitting Group under the Data Tab it asks if I want to do it by rows or columns, I choose columns and then it makes a grey little bar appear over the columns, but it doesn't ask me to give the data a name or anything.
 So I saved it (.xlsx) and started mail merge manager in Word. When I choose get list -&gt;&nbsp; open data source and select my .xlsx file with the saved data, it brings up a Convert File box which asks 'Convert File From:' and then has a bunch of selections to choose
 from. It always wants to do unicode text, but if I choose that one its just a mass of random symbols. I've tried every single conversion including Excel Workbook, which is what the file is, and it either gives me 'There was an error opening the file'.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that for some reason Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac can't read Excel 2011 for Mac files, which makes no sense. If you could help that would be great, and any walkthrough that exists for creating labels that is for Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac and
 INCLUDES how to create the Excel spreadsheet would help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I have also tried saving the excel file as .xls and it could not read it either. It can read .CSV, but when input placeholders, it only imputs the first row of the data, the First Name, Last Name, Address, and City/State/Zip Code row and updates that for every
 label, it doesn't imput any of the actual data.<br />

Still when I try to open data source it gives me a choice of convert data and if I choose excel workbook or recover text from any file it gives me 'There was an error opening the file'<br />

            For a similar problem, Cody suggested copying the data from your existing Excel workbook and pasting special &gt; paste text into a new workbook. Save the new workbook and try using that as the data source.

<h2>            Can not open Word 2016 on Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm experiencing since a couple of days some serious issues with Office 2016 for Mac (Word, Excel, Powerpoint). The programs crash or simply do not open.</p>
<p>This happens both on iPad on a Macbook Air.</p>
<p>I'm each time requested to login with my Microsoft account (which seems to work) but subsequently the programs just crash. Has this to do with accessing the same account on different devices (iPad &amp; laptop) ?</p>
<p>Tx in advance for your help.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>For my work I am required to make/produce dashboards. I use Excel to do this but i know there are softwares such as Tableau or Kipfolio that make dashboards automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the difference between Excel spreadsheet program and other dashboard program such as Tableau/Kipfolio?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please explain this to me as i am a bit confused.</p>

            <p>I can only give you my opinion/viewpoint as one person who has used Excel and Tableau (no experience with Kipfolio);</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR: Excel is cheaper, and can do most of what most companies need/want. Tableau is much more expensive, there will be a learning curve, but interactive data visualization can change how your leaders absorb and understand the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Excel: Reports can be packaged (subsets of data put in mirror copies of a workbook) if the data is confidential and has to be shared with specific target audiences (but after that you don't have control over where it goes). Easy to produce static reports
 (PDF, etc.). Easy to manipulate data <em>while looking at it</em> with formulas. VBA is the biggest thing that keeps me from switching to any other spreadsheet software- automating the loading of data in the back end, automating the production of reports,
 etc. Only a one-time cost for the (desktop) license. Slow when handling/analyzing very large data sets. I haven't tried to do this in the latest versions, but "drill-through" capability was historically weak/difficult to set up, at least graphically (click
 on a slice of a pie chart and have a time series chart update to only show that clicked subset from the pie chart; click on the time series chart to get a table of line item details, etc.). I've seen some examples where Excel scorecards have been integrated
 into SharePoint (including examples from MS eating their own dog food), but I don't have experience in that area so I can't speak to the additional capabilities that brings to your scorecarding efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tableau: license is much more expensive per seat (and I don't recall if that is one-time, or annual fee...); many companies also buy a Tableau server license so reports can be made broadly available to internal audiences without having to get an individual
 license for each person who needs to access the dashboards (which also requires someone to admin the server, but is the only good way to distribute non-public reports within a company; your report developers will still have to have individual licenses as well).
 It is very good at connecting to multiple large data sources and different types of sources for data, and has more of a drag &amp; drop interface for building out data visualizations. You can write formulas and do bulk data manipulation, but there is a learning
 curve. It has lots of cool features, but when learning I found myself getting stuck in a couple of places, where it would have taken me seconds to do the same thing in Excel. Good data design is extra important so that your inputs allow you to build the types
 of data visualizations that are important to you. Once a dashboard is set up, the ability to drill through your data is a game changer. You can invest more time and mimic that in Excel, I've never achieved the same level of user-friendliness that is inherent
 in software designed from the ground up for this purpose. Prior to Tableau, I'd see monthly operating reviews where a leader would ask a subordinate to explain some variation in the data, and the answer was "I'll find out and get back to you" and they'd go
 dig through P&amp;L reports, OT reports, etc. With a properly designed dashboard, they can drill down on the spot to get a lot more information about what is going on right there in the meeting. For example, when reviewing a general uptick in expenses among subordinates,
 a leader clicks around a Tableau dashboard and changes their view from cost center to account- and finds out that T&amp;E is going up across the board. Then they can have a specific conversation around T&amp;E instead of having everyone trying to chase down local
 patterns in each person's departmental data... that totally changes the conversation in the meetings.</p>

</p><p>Tableau does have a free version, I believe the limitation is that you can only save your work to their public server, so you won't want to practice with confidential or proprietary data. There are plenty of public data sets (government web sites, etc.)
 that you can connect to and play with. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the two products&nbsp;serve different niches, and would recommend you look at some of the sample visualizations on the Tableau site or your other media site of choice, to get ideas of how it can be used.

<h2>            E-mails in inbox disappear</h2>
                    <p>Goodday,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The e-mails in my inbox automatically disappear after I have read them.&nbsp; I would get an e-mail, read it and when I go to sent e-mails and click on inbox again, the inbox is empty - nothing to show in this folder.&nbsp; It only happens for the e-mails in the inbox
 folder, the full history of e-mails in the sent mails folder is available.&nbsp; Could someone please advise?</p>
