    <title>Automatic repair loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickraal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic repair loop</h2>
                    So i have been having this problem with Windows 10. Basically everytime&nbsp; i start my PC it does this Preparing Automatic Repair and then Diagnosing The PC. And when it finishes doing that, it says that your PC did not start correctly and it just continues
 to do that over and over. I have tried many different things to fix that like restarting my PC several times, doing a Reset This PC, doing a system restore, system image recovery, startup repair, i have tried some command prompts, going back to the previous
 version and all of these methods currently have not worked for me. I would like to know how to fix that. I just bought this PC and i do have some important things on it. How can this be fixed?&nbsp;

            Got it. In this case, it looks like we need to reinstall Windows. Let's do a repair upgrade so it can keep your personal files and installed applications. Follow this guidelines created by Andre Da Costa in this detailed

    <title>ScrewDrivers x86 stops working after Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucaswilliams  say:</h3>
<h2>            ScrewDrivers x86 stops working after Windows Update</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
It seems to me that there is a Windows Update that stops the x86 version of ScrewDrivers from working on 64-bit Windows 7 / Server 2008 machines.&nbsp; From what my tests have shown me, the x86 version works without issue on a 64-bit system until this update is
 installed, where the 64-bit version will not work until the update is installed.
<br />
<br />
Have there been any updates recently that either affected the registry entries that ScrewDrivers inserts, or that have had some other effect on how ScrewDrivers passes its printer settings through to the server?<br />
<br />
We're currently using ScrewDrivers 4.5.08.80, and I know there is a later version (4.6) available, which makes no difference in the way that I'm experiencing the 32/64 bit applications working.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Lucas.<br />

    <title>I can only press two or three keys at the same time, and no other keys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> huopatossu  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can only press two or three keys at the same time, and no other keys respond while pressing them.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but this problem really only comes up with games. The problem is, when I push on left arrow, only one button responds, and none other do. When I push right arrow, only two keys can respond.</p>
<p>It's hard to explain, but it's really a problem when I'm, for example, playing Mega Man games, where you have to keep a key pushed down to keep your weapon charged, move with arrows and dash with another key. So when I'm moving to the left, I can't jump
 because I have another key pushed down, not to mention dashing.</p>
<p>I hope there is a way to to raise the limit of keys being pushed at the same time. It would be greatly appreciated if you could give me instructions.</p>

<p>Did you have 2 graphics processors before 1 March, 2019 update? Have you tried the March 12 update?<br />

<p>What version of Windows 10 are you using? It shouldn't be a problem in 1809. It must be setting problem. You might try changing the display setting.</p>

<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.

            This is not the least bit helpful.&nbsp; This message "There was a problem saving your coin balance to the cloud. Please check your internet connection and try again" appears every time the game opens regardless of the quality of the internet connection.&nbsp; Clicking
 "try again" does nothing.&nbsp; The only option is to click "continue anyway" which deletes all of the coins you have accumulated.&nbsp; This situation coincides with the latest update to Windows 10.

            <p>As I have previously stated, XBOX is adamant that this is NOT their issue.&nbsp; They state that although this has an XBOX tag, it is a MICROSOFT application.&nbsp; I have spent 4 HOURS on the phone&nbsp;over a 2 day period&nbsp;being transferred back and forth and no one seems
 to want to support this application or refund my money.&nbsp; I am running the game on a desktop with windows 8.1.&nbsp; My internet connection is not the issue.&nbsp; This application is a scam as others are having the same issue.</p>

            <p>It is very obvious your replies are NOT helpful at all !! .&nbsp;&nbsp;You should take a look&nbsp;at the Xbox Forums, I&nbsp;could not find any&nbsp;answers at all&nbsp;there, either.&nbsp; So to me it inconsequent&nbsp;that you are including:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before writing this post I also&nbsp;have spent <strong>literally</strong> HOURS trying to get someone&nbsp;from Xbox support both on the phone &amp; chat who sends us to Microsoft, I have also tried both the MS phone &amp; live chat support (who tries to send us back to
 Xbox)&nbsp;who can/will help with this exact game "Microsoft Jackpot" /&nbsp; exact same issue&nbsp;and every support person I talked to gave me the run around. The very last guy told me he could help &amp; fix it, BUT it would have to pay a fee - REALLY a fee to repair a problem
 with a "free to download &amp; play game"</p>
<strong>many</strong>, <strong>many</strong> people complaining about having this issue with this game again this month ( I had this problem once before when it was a win 8 game,&nbsp;I had something around&nbsp;a &nbsp;balance of 50,000,000&nbsp; which was lost forever &amp; MS rep
 said "nothing can be done". This time my balance was near 11,000,000 but I don't remember what a friend did to fix the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;) - personally I am starting to wonder if this issue was intentionally created to have us pay to get issue corrected.&nbsp;Or&nbsp;can you
 explain. On second thought it would be&nbsp;better&nbsp;to have SOMEONE else who&nbsp;<strong>ACTUALLY knows the answer</strong> &amp;&nbsp;<strong>can, WILL</strong>&nbsp;<strong>actually help</strong> us here by telling us how to
<strong>SOLVE the issue</strong>, REPLY to our posts requesting help. &nbsp;I have found&nbsp;&amp;/or heard of what seems like hundreds of complaints all over the web &amp; the &nbsp;social media sites about the Microsoft Jackpot game?

            Just to put in my 2 cents worth, it's currently December 20, 2015, and the problem still exists. Looks like Microsoft casual games is still failing. I know for a fact that this isn't a local issue and therefore must be a server issue. Please fix the Microsoft
 end of this mess. Thanks.

            <p>i'm just replying to&nbsp; your 2 cents worth. This a microsft problem.but they keep passing the buck back to Xbox. Tis not a Xbox issue, **** I spent 4 hours with Xbox on the phone. The Microsoft answer desk is a joke, wasting the money for those employee's.
 I myself can not get any where with Microsoft. The problem is with the Microsoft cloud. I'm at about my wits end&nbsp; as to find what department or&nbsp;division of Microsoft to contact to resolve this issue. From the community boards and my own personal experience
 this started on or about December 10 2015. Again can not get help from Microsoft, their motto is help resolved problems, Pardon my conduct, I call Microsoft this is ****. This is a free game, Microsoft wanted me to pay to resolve this, that aint&nbsp; happening.
 We just peons and don't know anything. Before my blood pressure shoots way up, I need to quit</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for the update.</div>
<div>Let me help you further&nbsp;with this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try the below troubleshooting methods, and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method&nbsp;1</strong>: I suggest you to run the System File Checker, and check if it helps.</div>
<div>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected.</div>
<div>Follow the below steps:<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows + X</strong> Keys on the keyboard.<br />
2. Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> to bring up an elevated command prompt.
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.<br />
3. In the command prompt type in the following command and then press Enter.<br />
<strong>sfc&nbsp; /scannow</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> If you are not able to repair some files after performing SFC scan, I suggest you to refer to the point 3 “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log”.
 Under the section “Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)” to repair the corrupted files after performing SFC scan.</div>
<div>Refer: Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.<br />
A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. Perform a clean boot on the computer by following the steps given in the link:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong>I suggest you to disable proxy and check.<br />
Follow the below steps:</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows +&nbsp;R</strong> keys from the keyboard.<br />
2.&nbsp;Type <strong>inetcpl.cpl</strong> and hit Enter.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click the <strong>Connections tab</strong>, and then click <strong>LAN settings</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;Uncheck the mark &nbsp;"Use a proxy server for your LAN" &nbsp;check box.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            My power supply cord is turning red after about 10 minutes</h2>
                    The power supply on my Xbox 360 slim will let me have it on for about 10 minutes and they will turn red and shut it off. I keep it elevated to prevent it from being blocked... My room is in a basement...idk if that will make any difference. And it's just
 started happening. I take good care of my Xbox not leaving it on for too long so idol why it would do this?

<p>Your power brick is indeed "dying". It definitely has some kind of problem with it. I would call Xbox support (1800-4MY-XBOX) And see if you still have warranty so they can get it repaired. In the worse situation (Expired warranty) you may have to purchase
 another power cord which usually run you around $25. Hope you found this helpful.</p>

<p>I have worked on many of the older white Xbox's and power bricks, I do not know how old your console is but the main issue i have seen with the older bricks are that large dust build up can block the cooling fan as well as the heat sinks causing heat transfer
 loss. This in turn will cause the brick to over heat and go into protect mode where it will shut itself off. This is a feature that protects the brick as well as your console from being damaged incase voltage lvls are affected by the increasing temperature.
 I would suggest unplugging the brick from your console and &nbsp;the reseptical. </p>
<p>Note*** &nbsp;Do not attempt to open the brick for this will Void the warranty if there is one.</p>
<p>Once you have unplugged your power supply take some form of compressed air, I.E Canned air, or an air hoes from a compressor, also Note if you use an air compressor INSURE &nbsp;that is has a water seperation filter on it so you don't risk damaging the electronic
 components within the power supply, and simply Blow the air through the brick from both ends multiple times you may see plooms of dust come out which is perfectly normal. after you have done this in both directions allow 5 to 10 min before reconecting your
 power supply to your receptical and your console </p>
<p>If you still are having the issue I would contact Xbox support (1800-4MY-XBOX) to find out if it is still covered under a warranty</p>
<p>You may also Contact Xbox support at &nbsp; <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us?xr=footnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a></p>
<p>once at this page for product select Xbox 360, Kinect and Accessories- Hardware Errors- and choose to chat with Microsoft support. They can also look up your console to see if it is in warranty and also start a claim for you if it is</p>
<p>I hope this helps and &nbsp;I hope you Have a wonderful Holiday &nbsp;take care &nbsp;:D</p>

<p>I have worked on many of the older white Xbox's and power bricks, I do not know how old your console is but the main issue i have seen with the older bricks are that large dust build up can block the cooling fan as well as the heat sinks causing heat transfer
 loss. This in turn will cause the brick to over heat and go into protect mode where it will shut itself off. This is a feature that protects the brick as well as your console from being damaged incase voltage lvls are affected by the increasing temperature.
 I would suggest unplugging the brick from your console and &nbsp;the reseptical.</p>
<p>Note*** &nbsp;Do not attempt to open the brick for this will Void the warranty if there is one.</p>
<p>Once you have unplugged your power supply take some form of compressed air, I.E Canned air, or an air hoes from a compressor, also Note if you use an air compressor INSURE &nbsp;that is has a water seperation filter on it so you don't risk damaging the electronic
 components within the power supply, and simply Blow the air through the brick from both ends multiple times you may see plooms of dust come out which is perfectly normal. after you have done this in both directions allow 5 to 10 min before reconecting your
 power supply to your receptical and your console</p>
<p>If you still are having the issue I would contact Xbox support (1800-4MY-XBOX) to find out if it is still covered under a warranty</p>
<p>You may also Contact Xbox support at &nbsp; support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</p>
<p>once at this page for product select Xbox 360, Kinect and Accessories- Hardware Errors- and choose to chat with Microsoft support. They can also look up your console to see if it is in warranty and also start a claim for you if it is</p>
<p>I hope this helps and &nbsp;I hope you Have a wonderful Holiday &nbsp;take care &nbsp;:D</p>

<p>
</p><p>the purpose of using the command is to save some precious SSD space as some apps/games need to drop huge files to Users folder which is located in C:/</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I appreciate that you are trying to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10. By the word ‘junctions’ are you referring to the batch files that we generally use to do various command functions at once.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>And if you want to remove unwanted files from your SSD you may run the disc cleanup for windows 10.</span></span></p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>When the Window appears, does a program name appear across the top of the message bar?</p>
<p>Does this error appear with any other program?</p>
<p>Has the program run before on your PC?</p>

<p>chelle2709 - The error really doesn't have anything to do with how much space is on the computer. It's a very misleading error message. It means that the program is failing. If the program was already installed and suddenly doesn't work, then something has
 changed so the program can't work any more. It could be that the program was hard-coded to use a now obsolete version of Java, depended on some .dll that has now been updated, or a host of other factors.</p>
<p>If the program wasn't installed and you are trying to install it, perhaps the program is very old (Windows 95 perhaps?) and not designed for Windows XP. If the program is new, you should contact its maker's tech support. If the program is very old and has
 previously worked before, uninstall/reinstall it. If the program is very old and you are just trying to install it, then you should probably forget about it and buy a new similar program for your kids. I remember having an I Spy program for my kids that ran
 under Windows 95 and if this is the same one, I would just toss it and move on.</p>
<p>So you'll need to give a lot more information about the program, its age, and your exact situation.</p>

<h3> vngi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Elite Controller</h2>
                    <p>I've had my elite controller for a while now, my grips had worn down to a point where they came off, I&nbsp;had actually went a head and replaced them using Scuf Grips that I&nbsp;purchased via Scuf, now recently the inner grips have gotten worse to a point where it's generally uncomfortable to hold the controller, I understand I can send my controller in for repairs!&nbsp;but that would leave me with no controller, I am wondering if it's possible to purchase inner-grips regardless of the price so that I could personally take the time to replace them myself.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you for your time</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>Xbox Game DVR - No path folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gamedvr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Game DVR - No path folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>there has been another user (Helheiom) that has asked this question. I followed the steps that were given to them, however they have not resolved my problem.
</p>
<p>These are the steps that I have taken</p>
<p>1. I have reset my Xbox App using Windows Powershell (admin) and reset my computer.</p>
<p>2. I have reset my store cache and then have reinstalled my Xbox app.</p>
<p>3. I have logged out of the Xbox app and have tried to use the DVR but it will no work.</p>
<p>4. I have logged out of my user account on my computer and have used a guest account to find that the DVR worked.</p>
<p>5. I tried to make a copy of the captures folder from my guest account to move to my user account in an attempt to resolve the issue. (It did not work)</p>
<p>6. The Game DVR does not recognize any folder at all, nor does it show a path. There is not a manual way to access it either as the Open Folder button found under Settings -&gt;Gaming-&gt;Game DVR does not respond or open a location. (It's just a button to push)</p>
<p>7. My Game DVR settings is set to record game clips, screenshots, and broadcast using Game Bar, but when I push Win + G it says "Can't save your recording. Make sure your captures folder allows files to be saved."</p>
<p>8.When Using another account (Guest) the DVR does work, and the captures folder can be moved around within the guest account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very frustrated and would like this issue to be resolved. I believe that when Moving files to an external hard drive the captures folder was also moved and is why it can no longer be detected by my computer. I hope that there is another way to allocate
 a new path rather than search through 4Tb worth of data or having to make a new account just to use the Game DVR . Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Captures folder is set as a a regular file folder and not as a system folder. Is there any way to make it into a system folder.</p>

<h2>            Paint not working well in Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm having trouble using Paint in Windows 10.&nbsp; It keeps freezing up on me halfway through the job and I lose hours of work because I can't save it before shutting down to unfreeze it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to unfreeze the program is to restart the computer.&nbsp; In
 short, Paint does not work as well in Windows 10 as it did in Windows 7.&nbsp; I've tried finding a newer version (if there is one) but no luck there yet.&nbsp; Any solutions?

            <p><span>Hi Elly,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can quickly go ahead with few steps and see if it works fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Try to boot the computer in Safe mode and see if the issue still persist. Safe Mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows
 from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the computer works fine in safe mode, perform a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".

            Thanks for that.&nbsp; Unfortunately your answer was way too techie for my level of understanding on&nbsp;the deeper workings of a computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did however find a roundabout way to solve my problem so I don't lose my work by saving the work first&nbsp;with an extension
 other than jpg to start with, saving it often until it was finished, then saving the final work to a jpg file.

<h2>            Skype Manager</h2>
                    <p>My Skype Manger account is totally messed up.&nbsp; I've been on chat 4 different times to try to fix the problems, but now am told I just have to wait for them to get back with me?! :(&nbsp; When I try to access the Skype manger dashboard page it immediately switches
 to the "oops, something went wrong" page with error<span>&nbsp;ID:&nbsp;</span><em>REQUEST-8a4e0943/2019031015.</em></p>
<p><span><span>At this point, I'm wondering if I can just delete the Skype Manage account and start over?!</span></span></p>

            Hi Christine
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />The message you are getting usually happens when there is some technical intervention happening on that specific feature. So, if the Microsoft support team, on the chat, indicated they would all you back, I would recommend that you wait for their feedback. They are most likely working on fixing the issue.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

<p>Thanks for the information. I'm just dumbfounded that I'm at 5 days and counting on this problem, with no end in sight.&nbsp; Do you know if I can delete Skype Manager and then use the same email to make a new account?&nbsp; Just trying to figure out a way to fix
 this issue today.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            Hi Christine
<br />
<br />I am not sure if you could reuse the same email, however, even if you can, it would usually take several weeks before a delete email can be re-used. So it would really be better to wait for them the get back to you. Sorry this is not going as fast as you'd expect.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />Margarida

                    <p>I can't install any apps from the Windows Store.&nbsp; I always get the "Something happened and this app can't be installed.&nbsp; Please try again.&nbsp; Error code: 0x800705aa" error.&nbsp; I have had a Microsoft level 1 and a Microsoft level 2 technician work on this problem.&nbsp;
 We have run sfc /scannow, DISM online restorehealth, and have rebuilt Windows using Tweaking.com.&nbsp; Absolutely nothing works.</p>

<p>
</p><p>PLEASE Microsoft - how can it be acceptable to you to have a broken Windows Store app, have 2 technicians work on this for a total of probably 6-7 hours, and the only hint that you can provide is "SOMETHING HAPPENED" and a meaningless error code?!?!&nbsp; Isn't
 there someone in your organization who can get to the root of this problem?</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and I really appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I can understand the inconvenience caused to you. I will certainly help you with this Windows Store issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There could be several reasons for causing this issue such as Windows Store cache, proxy settings, pending updates, third-party application conflict or corrupted user account. However, let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Are you using any proxy server on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Are you using Microsoft account or local account?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Have you installed all the </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">pending Windows Updates</span></a><span>?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the steps to <strong>check the status of the proxy connections:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press "<strong>Windows key + R</strong>" and type "<strong>inetcpl.cpl</strong>" and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) Click the <strong>Connections tab</strong>, and then click <strong>LAN settings</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c) <strong>Uncheck</strong> the option “<strong>Use a Proxy Server for your LAN</strong>”.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d) Click "<strong>Apply</strong>" and "<strong>OK</strong>" to save changes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Reset the Windows store cache.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press <strong>Windows key + R </strong>to open run window.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b)&nbsp;Type “<strong>wsreset.exe</strong>” without quotes and click on ok.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then try the suggestions provided from this Microsoft article&nbsp;and check if you are able to install the apps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/why-find-install-app-windows-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Why can't I find or install an app from the Windows Store?</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try to <strong>run the </strong></span></span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">App troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span> and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. </span><span>Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

    <title>How do I re-enable Intel Virtualization&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I re-enable Intel Virtualization&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp;My name is Mathew and I am&nbsp;maintaining my mom's HP Notebook 2000 PC running&nbsp;Windows 10 Home 64-bit. I check the task manager frequently and I could have sworn that the 'Virtualization' was enabled the last time I was in task manager. I guess there's
 a possibility that I'm getting it mixed up with 'Hyper-V Support' but&nbsp;it would explain the&nbsp;performance drop in this laptop. So my question is: did this laptop&nbsp;come with&nbsp;'Virtualization' disabled and if it didn't, how do I enable it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I couldn't give enough detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Myue,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To understand the issue better, I would like to know which Windows 10 edition are you using?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:
</strong>Hyper-V is only available in Windows 10 Pro, Education, and Enterprise edition. It is not available in Windows 10 Home.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your system hardware support ‘Virtualization’ the only way to enable this is through BIOS settings. BIOS will be supported by the computer manufacturer. So, I suggest you to contact computer manufacturer
 for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting
 properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</span></span></p>
