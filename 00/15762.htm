            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot directly attach files from OneDrive into Outlook 2013. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround you can share files from OneDrive where-in you can generate a link for the item then send it from Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the section ‘Get a Link’ in the article given below:</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 - Duplicate Commands in list for Customizing Ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d pauldalton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 - Duplicate Commands in list for Customizing Ribbon</h2>
                    <p>Using Outlook 2010 (perhaps 3013 is similar), I have noticed that when I bring up the facility to Customize the Ribbon and select "All Commands", a great number of the commands on the list appear to be identical.&nbsp; In addition to looking like it wastes resources,
 it often can be confusing to decide which of several apparently identical commands to add to the Ribbon.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are a few of my observations:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 50 or so are marked as &lt;&lt; No Label &gt;&gt; and, while the tooltips that pop up when the cursor is placed over one of these reflects that some are different, even the tooltips are identical for a lot of them. &nbsp;</li><li>Some of the duplicates appear to be in there because of something I must have done, as there are 8 commands named "Dana Lynne" (my daughter's name), all with a tooltip of "Macro: cmdFG!_Click".&nbsp;
<br />
</li><li>Others appear to be the result of Add-Ins, such as the 7 "Do Time Entry" commands, all of which have a tooltip of "Macro: onActionCommon_Callback".<br />
</li><li>I suspect some also may be Microsoft's, such as the several "Decline" commands, some of which have different tooltips.&nbsp;
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>There seems to be so many of these "duplicates" that I wonder:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.&nbsp; Is something going wrong with my copy of Outlook?<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.&nbsp; Does the presence of all these "duplicates" affect Outlook's performance or might it be the cause of the occasional shutdowns I experience?
<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">3.&nbsp; Does Outlook just "allow" all these "duplicates to proliferate and there's nothing to be done about it?<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4.&nbsp; Should any of these "duplicates" be "pruned" from the list and, if so, is there a way to do it safely?<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><br />

<h2>            power failure during upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi, It took 18 hours on my slow connection to download threshold 2 and we had a 5 minute power failure during the upgrade / install.</p>
<p>It reinstalled the older preview build, but now wants to download the patch again! Surely there is a way to use what was already downloaded!!!</p>

            <p>Hello Yarrums,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Today a new Release build&nbsp;was...eh...released, so you'll probably want to wait for that.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to create an ISO from the .ESD downloaded, see: </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update/how-to-update-to-windows-10-threshold-2-using-iso/65de41f3-64ef-4384-9f3e-572ccb98f8d3">How to update to Windows 10 "Threshold 2 " using
 ISO </a></p>
<p>for more links and info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be warned, it is not a trivial procedure and if you've already started a new download the .ESD might no longer be on your machine. The Insider preview business does involve a lot of downloads so you might be better of running the Released builds, just saying...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ya, it's gone. I assume it goes into c:\windows\SoftwareDistribution?</p>
<p>Pretty dumb of it to have to start over!</p>
<p>I am using an old laptop as it serves no other purpose. It just bugs me when I have to do something like that twice for no good reason. I am paying for Internet connectivity.
</p>
<p>BTW Is the release build as large or is it just a patch?&nbsp;</p>

            <div>Hi Yarrums,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I think its in fact this file, but I am not completely sure:</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Install.ESD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to check View-&gt;Hidden files and do a search for *.ESD n your c: drive</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Copy it and use the decryption-tool and you'll know soon enough.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>As for the Release Build, I downloaded the 10586 English International X64 ISO: over 3.9GB, so yes, it's a full installable version, i.e. BIG! (the normal English version is a bit smaller (3.7GB)</div>

            <p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>It is indeed gone.</p>
<p>I started to download the ISO, but decided to wait to see when my desktop gets updated if it has the improvements I am hoping for.</p>
<p>When I asked about the release build I meant the one the general public gets to update Win 10. From what I heard it will come in as a patch the way other updates are installed. If so will it be 3.9 gig also? I'm assuming not.</p>
<p>The laptop I use is for fooling around so I'm in no rush for it.</p>

            <p>I am pretty sure that what you get from Windows Update is simply a compressed version of the ISO. So expect at least 2.6GB there (this seems to be the norm)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time, this is the Released version as we are currently 'in sync', still given your download speed it's a significant difference, so I think you're right to wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and have fun 'fooling around' |-)</p>

 and you’ll be able to download it right on to your phone, bringing a whole heap of improved features."</span></p>
<p>and btw Symbian Belle is now Nokia Belle</p>

            was reading conversations and suddenly this message pops up. although i feel much relieved now as the belle is finally coming and the source is no other but nokia itself. i can wait for a month more to get belle in my x7-00. don't know why ppl going complaining
 about the delay. I NEVER had any information regarding update coming to us through official channel. but this time it is for real and it will for sure sooth many loyal nokia customers.<br />
<br />
As discussed with one of my friend who work for nokia, he told me that they are processing files for nokia belle to nokia care centers and by new year they will recieve it around the globe. also he told me that there are chances to see belle by the end of january.
 but this conversation happen before this official statemnt and i think my x7-00 is going to be my valentine this time..lol

<p>Mate I understand the plight of being the owner of x7-00 but nokia never said that they will update n8,c7 and e6 first. What they actually meant to say is that these phones are the one who will get the treatment first and now they will come with belle pre
 installed as a default ui. What I understood by nokia statement is that&nbsp;all nokia phone will get belle update as a software update in Feb.. People who are interested to buy new n8(camera), e6(qwerty) and&nbsp;c7(economical)&nbsp;with belle in it were the one who get
 benefit out of this. For ppl like u n me who already own one have to wait for Feb. to come. Till now belle is available&nbsp;to the phones&nbsp;which are no good. All three are somewhat identical in hardware and they provide nothing much. Its nokia marketing gimmick
 to announce belle preloaded with n8 and others because these phones are best selling phones of nokia and together with belle nokia will make gud profits.For phones like x7 and c6-01 who&nbsp;comes under s^3 category but didn't sell much because of any reason, they
 have to wait patiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and yes again I have already decided to go for a ball dance with belle on valentines day&nbsp;:smileylol:&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am optimistic about the fact that the official announcement is feb 2012, because if I remember correctly I got the anna update for my C6-01 over navi long before Nokia gave an official statement of Symbian's Anna update..<br />
And moreover since the first gen S^3 mobiles are now Nokia Belle Mobiles, the firmwares for them will be available too in navi(atleast I think so)...!!!&nbsp;</p>

"Rumours"? I don't know what kind of sites you are getting your information from. There was a Nokia event in Hong Kong back in August. They not announced three Belle devices there (one of them got canceled silently), but also the Belle update for existing S^3
 devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The said devices were announced with Q3/2011, which was more or less actually happening. The Belle update for existing devices however was announced to be "Available from the fourth quarter onwards". They didn't announce a year with it though ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to round up:</p>
<ol>
<li>This was an official event organized and held by Nokia</li><li>The speaker was official Nokia employee Colin Giles, EVP of Sales</li><li>Information were given via official Nokia websites maintained by Nokia employees</li></ol>
<p>Where are the rumours now? I can clearly remember the keynote, since I was watching the live-feed from it. Belle update starts coming Q4/2011 onwards for existing S^3 devices. As said, this is all via official Nokia channels. Not via a Blog ran by somebody
 or "shady" tech and gadget sites. There are even some existing screenshots where you can have another look at this announcement.</p>

            Hey Kirsty. You don't need the analysis toolpak for this. Let's try this again on your PC. Please try this:
<br />1) Open Excel
<br />2) Type in some data in A1 to B4. See screenshot 1 which is attached to what I typed.
<br />2) After typing in data, click cell B2.
<br />3) Click Insert  &gt; Chart dialog box launcher (red arrow pointing at it in the screenshot).
<br />4) Click All Chart at the top. (screenshot 2)
<br />5) Do you see Histogram?  Please let me know.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9a66464-b03d-41cb-aae0-b981e9290e9f?upload=true" />

    <title>Extracting dates by weekday on access report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a3ash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extracting dates by weekday on access report</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,<br />
<br />
I have a report that I want to capture as header, the dates (based on Friday to Thursday) of the last 4 weeks and then use the header to sum data from the source query. The second part I don't expect would be a problem because I have done something similar
 on a monthly basis.<br />
<br />
Example of how I would like the headers to look:<br />
<br />
29 Dec 2017 - 4 Jan 2018&nbsp; &nbsp; 22 Dec 2017 - 28 Dec 2017&nbsp; &nbsp; 15 Dec 2017 - 21 Dec 2017&nbsp; &nbsp; 8 Dec 2017 - 14 Dec 2017<br />
<br />
I have the expression below which gives me the end dates. These dates will move if i run the report tomorrow.<br />
<br />
=Format(DateAdd("ww",0,Now()),"dd mmm yy")<br />
<br />
Any and all suggestions will be appreciated.<br />
</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Formula to SUM totals across multiple worksheets</h2>
                    I have a workbook containing a number of worksheets ... each is uniquely named.
<div>Hours of work are captured in each worksheet and summed ... same column but a worksheet can have from 1 to 160 cells.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Because of the cell variance total hours can be found in D2 or D160.</div>
<div>Is there a formula that calculates grand total hours adding total hours from each of the worksheets.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in Advance ...</div>

            Yes, there are lots of ways. however, you ought to think about rearranging your worksheet. Put the sum at the top if there are varying lines of details. Then the total will always be in the same cell and easy to sumarize or conslidate.<br />

<h2>            My hotmail account got locked</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently move back to India (from USA) and while login in to my Hotmail account Microsoft asked me for additional verification. I'm in the following situation
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My ATT cell# is disconnected so I could not verify the login code via phone or text</p>
<p>- Before moving to India I was working for Microsoft, and verification email account is
**** @ microsoft.com which I don't have access to.</p>
<p>- There is an additional verification form for that I've entered correct information for: birth day, previous password etc. I primarily use this account for TFS online, OneDrive and Bing reward. So could not verify the subject line for the last email I received/sent,
 and email I sent to people - since I rarely use this account for sending message.</p>

            I've been following up from the link you sent but no response since past 3 days. I would greatly appreciate if you any moderator can follow up internally or if you can provide direct contact to moderators or teams. So sad to lose access to OneDrive and
 TFS. My email alias was *** Email address is removed for privacy *** if that helps to verify the identity.

    <title>Microsoft Band 2 Refund - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdc3161  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Band 2 Refund</h2>
                    <p>On October 26th I had to ship back my Microsoft Band and they told me that in 8 - 10 days after they received it I would either get an email letting me know that they were sending me another Band 2 or a refund.&nbsp; On November 7th I received the following
 email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc56cb73-f467-4062-9390-ceee229f5ffc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc56cb73-f467-4062-9390-ceee229f5ffc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After waiting the 3-5 business days I didn't receive the email from Microsoft Payment Central. I contacted the Band support and was given the run around and I finally asked for a supervisor.&nbsp; The supervisor told me that I misread the email and said it takes
 3-5 weeks.&nbsp; I offered to send her the email and she refused.&nbsp; I spent the rest of the day trying to contact Microsoft corporate office but could find a way to do it, not even by email.&nbsp; The last person I talked to said that she could give me a mailing address
 for Microsoft's legal department.&nbsp; What a joke.&nbsp; I asked her for their email address and she said she didn't have one.&nbsp; I must have talked to at least 20 people at Microsoft and got no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am disabled with several different heart conditions.&nbsp; I purchased the Band to monitor my heart rate as I have to keep that under control.&nbsp; I need the money to replace the Bank with another product as I am on a clinical trial and my doctors want me to make
 sure I check it frequently as we need to know weather the medication effect the heart rate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't even care that they are harming me.&nbsp; I guess they might go broke if they give me the refund.&nbsp; I have read in other forums of people waiting over 5 months for their refund, with Microsoft claiming that the refund got lost in the mail and
 telling them they will have to wait another 3-5 weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been buying Microsoft products since the late 80's, but I think I just decided that I am not giving them another penny.&nbsp; Good luck if you are trying to get the refund.</p>

            I've also found it virtually impossible to get a refund out of them. I've been waiting since March. The first time I waited 6-8 weeks for a cheque as they originally promised, then after it didn't arrive they told me it hadn't been sent and I would have
 to wait another 6-8 weeks. Following that the cheque never arrived, and I was told the issue was being passed to another department and instead of a cheque someone would email me. The emails never arrived even though they insist they had sent them. I checked
 my spam folder, they weren't there either, so I gave them another email address to send it to. Finally I got word that I would be referred to Microsoft Payment Central to receive my refund. I never received the email again and the invitation to sign up expired.
 I asked them to resend the invitation, which they did, and then it arrived, asking me to sign up within 2 business days. I tried to sign up immediately and got the same error message telling me that my invitation had expired. I'm gett

<p>I am struggling to get my refund out of Microsoft also for my husbands band. It has been 4 months now since we returned it. Every time we want an update on the service request, we have to contact them. We received emails similar to the one above, however
 it did not mention anything about it being for the refund for the band, so we put it down to a scam. Once we realized, we contacted chat to explain that we couldn't sign up due to the email they had linked it to ( long IT related explanation). I was then told
 that a cheque would be issued and posted out to us, expected to arrive on Dec 12. The date came and went, no cheque, so onto chat again to find out that that date was incorrect and we should have been told Jan 2. Again this date came and went, no cheque so
 onto chat again to 'escalate'. We were told to expect a call/email with 24-48 hours and when we didn't receive any onto chat again. Again, we were told that that timeframe was incorrect and we would be contacted about this 'escalation' within 1-2 weeks. About
 a week later, we get an email to say that they have 'voided' the cheque and invited us to sign up to payment central again with the previous email that we explained to them would not work! So back to square one.... onto chat again who setup another email address
 to sign up to payment central with - waiting again on an email to invite us to this process once again which should take 24-72 hours, which is nearly up and no email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been told the chat staff cannot do anything for us as they need a 'higher authority' to issue the refunds or do whatever they need to do and they are very busy with all the refunds for the bands. Maybe Microsoft need to employ or reallocate their
 staff to deal with these refunds so the turnaround for the refunds are in a reasonable timeframe.</p>

            I wouldn't hold your breath, as this is what they are doing to everyone.&nbsp; I haven't seen anyone get paid.&nbsp; I believe they are trying to get us to do a class action suit so that they can make an agreement that will cost them a lot less money and would mean
 they will get away with paying us practically nothing.<br />

<p>I will be investigating it through our Fair Trading System or the like if the payment central emails/sign up are not forthcoming. I have transcripts of all the chats I have had with Microsoft stating the refund is approved and 'the cheque will be in the
 mail' which I can provide them. I have read on forums that others have received a refund but not the full amount and have then had to chase Microsoft again for the remainder.</p>
<p>They are breaching consumer law by not providing a refund on a faulty product that they can't repair &amp; considering they have approved it (or so they tell me), I will be taking it further.&nbsp;</p>

            I've been told I will get my refund once I've signed into Payment Central and entered my bank details. Every time I try to sign in, I get the same error message saying my invitation has expired. I've contacted Payment Central support and they're useless,
 we just keep going round in circles where I tell them I can't sign in, they tell me to send a screenshot of the error, they do nothing about it, then when I ask again they tell me I need to sign in and enter my details. I KNOW THIS. Their payment central system
 is broken and they're doing nothing to fix it. When I contact the regular Microsoft Support they just say "it's gone to payment central, it's not my problem any more". Worst customer service I've ever known. They're an utter disgrace.

<p>At least you have the payment central emails. We got the email saying that they will be sending the invitation shortly, but to the email address we had previous told them could not sign up to payment central before they said just wait for the cheque! So
 on 23/1 we chatted to them again and changed the email address for the payment central invitations but they still haven't arrived even though we were told to expect them anywhere from 24-72 hours or up to 3-5 weeks depending on which customer service staff
 you chatted with. So when the emails starting arriving to the incorrect email, I contacted them again, only to be told that they can't cancel the wrong email and replace it with the new one, they have to request it again for the new email, which means you
 are back at the end of the queue again for these emails! For a big IT company, their software/systems are poor! So we have been told to wait until 9/2 for the emails to the new email address about payment central..which probably means another 3 weeks after
 that realistically!&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this was a circus, I would be on the floor laughing at how comical this process and service is, especially when it's 'escalated' which can take another 3 weeks to hear what action is to be taken.</p>

            Do you guys have any news? It seems like I have the same problem. I sent 3 Microsoft Bands to them. For the first one I got my money, but for the second and third one I wait for a cheque. But I still didn't received anything. They just move the receive-date
 later and later.

            Finally managed to sign into Payment Central and received some money - over a year late. Even then, they didn't even refund the full amount, I received about 2/3rds of what I was promised!

<p>I keep getting told by Microsoft Support that it is all set up and Accounts Payable says that it has been rejected and that I need to have support re-submit the request. I cannot get anywhere with them.&nbsp; They told me that I am supposed the get $174.99 ($25
 less than I paid for it. How much did they say you would get and how much did they give you?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, to everyone owed a refund, keep hounding them as they have already told me that not to far in the future Microsoft will be ending support and we will not have anyone to contact about the Band refund.</p>

<p>My process was smooth. I too had the same confusion of 2-3business days vs weeks! Looks like they don't correct the email that goes out. fter I got the email in about two weeks, I was able to setup mt bank account and the process for that seemed very crude
 interface! I somehow set it up and then a week later got paid $174.99 as an ACH to my bank. I still don't know how the $174.99 amt was arrived at. i paid $249.99 when I bought it.<br />

                    <p>How easy is it going to be for&nbsp;the average Jon Doe like me to upgrade his machine from Win8.1 to Win10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading recent forums postings has me concerned, because I see people saying they encountered issues when using the Beta version of Win 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I am posting is because I want to buy a laptop soon (Win 8.1) but I am hesitating because I am afraid that whatever laptop I buy might present an incompatibility with Win 10 and since the laptop is going to be&nbsp;my only&nbsp;purchase for the next 2-3
 years I would rather just wait till the Win10 comes installed on all new laptops on the market at hat time!

<p>Microsoft has confirmed that any computer you purchase today preinstalled with Windows 8.1 is Windows 10 ready. So when it is finalized launches next year, you will be able to upgrade to with the guarantee it will work with your system. Its rare to find
 a modern release of Windows being incompatible with anything manufacturerd in the last 10 years.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10, Windows 8/8.1, Windows 7, Windows Vista all share the same driver model, so the majority of hardware that works with these previous releases will work with Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for upgrading, its pretty simple and works similarly to upgrading to Windows 8.1 from a Windows 7 PC. The routine is similar if you are installing from retail media or using the upgrade assistant. Learn more about what its like to upgrade to Windows 10
 based on the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/how-to-upgrade-from-windows-7-to-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8</span></span></a>
</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, there really is no reason to wait to get it preinstalled on a new PC. Of course, Microsoft will say this is the easiest way to upgrade to Windows 10, get it on a new PC. If you need to have work done now, you should get your Windows 8.1
 PC right away. Besides, you probably want to wait a few months after Windows 10 is released next year before you upgrade to it right away.

<p>Hi Mihail,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To investigate this issue, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. If you create a test file, give it the same name as that "one specific file", see if this test file will run into the same issue.
</p>
<p>2. Access that problematic library with browser, check if you can upload the same name test file.</p>
<p>3. Could you let us know the former name and current name of that specific file (inculde the file format)? Meanwhile, please capture a screenshot of the error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Let us know the library URL which cannot paste the file and also URL for one library which can paste this file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent you a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
private message</a> to collect the info mentioned in 3 and 4. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi Mihail,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you updates.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your first post you mentioned that you are able “copy the same file to other folders in this document library”. I want to confirm if the same file means the same file name or just the file itself (name changed). I mean if the specific file name file can
 be uploaded/copied to all other folders except 03_T**e. As you mentioned, when you just change the file name, you are able to upload/copy it to 03_T**e. It means you should have the proper permission in this folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it’s convenient, could you check the result for the following operations?</p>
<ol>
<li>Rename 03_T**e folder. </li><li>Create a new folder with the name 03_T**e.</li><li>Upload a file with that specific name to the new 03_T**e folder.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to copy with same name in another folder like 03_T**e_Temp</p>
<p>When I try to rename this Folder using user account which has contribute permissions for a folder where 03_T**e is I see the same "Access Denied" error.</p>
<p>I have renamed it using site collection admin account and created a new one 03_T**e folder. The I have moved from a renamed folder to newly created all other content and then tried to copy once again with normal user account (with contribute permssions)
 and see the same access denied error and only for this specific original file name. When I rename it once again I can copy it to this folder. And the same I can't rename it with this normal user and see Access Denied error message.</p>

<p>Hi Mihail,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the normal user account, is it only not able to rename that specific folder or all folders in that document library? Please give it edit permission to see the result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we can firstly focus on that site collection admin account. Given your description, create a new folder with the name 03_T**e, site collect admin account still cannot upload/copy the file with that specific name. We can say it runs into the same
 situation as before. In this situation, I need to collect some trace logs to move on. You may find detailed steps in my private message. The trace logs can let us investigate further.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, give a test account higher than Edit permission (or even set it as site admin), see if the same situation only occurs with your specific account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your mapped network drive, please select the option to see all hidden files. Make sure there is no hidden file with already has the same specific name.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time. </p>
<p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave Full permissions to that normal user (which had contribute) and it still not possible to rename this one 03_T**e folder. Its possible to rename any other folder but not this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to upload with site collection admin I saw that file already exists but it was uploaded:</p>

</p>
<p>Than I deleted it with site collection admin and tried to upload with the normal user and this time it was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't explain this behavior.</p>
<p>There was no any hidden or system files.</p>

<p>Hi Mihail,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given your description, the current status should be that the specific name file can be uploaded to the specific name folder. As now we just has this one situation that the file name cannot be uploaded to the folder name (I created the same name site collection
 as you, create same name folder and file in your scenario. However, there is no error message. Meanwhile, based on my understanding, the issue should not be related to permission, because when you change the file name, you could upload/copy it to the folder
 which cannot be uploaded/copied before), I suggest you firstly monitor this library. See if other situations will occur. At that time, we could investigate the behavior further.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a passport.com account, and I cannot receive with this email address. I can send to any other email address from this account, but cannot receive. It wouldn't be a huge issue, but my MCP profile is bound to the passport.com account and I cannot do
 anything, because if I try to change my MCP passcode the system is trying to send a verification mail to my @passport.com email address, but it doesn't work in meaning of receiving emails. What can I do?</p>

 passport account to my MCP account, where I cannot change my primary email address form passport.com to anything else, so I have to be able to receive mails with my passport.com account.</span></li></ul>

<p>We appreciate your patience regarding this matter, Zoltan. Since passport.com is a legacy account, we suggest that you provide your complete information on&nbsp;<em><strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/</a></strong></em>
 to have everything updated. This process is very important in order to notify the server that your account is still active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, perform a reputation check on&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/reputationcheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://account.live.com/reputationcheck"><em><strong>https://account.live.com/reputationcheck</strong></em></a>. This is
 so we can check the integrity of your domain and complete the resyncing process.</p>

            Dear Don,
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />If you are using Outlook.com, please check your rules <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> , it seems that there is a rule that moves emails to another folder before it comes to inbox. After you will find that rule, delete it and you should be able to receive emails normally.
<br />Hope this will help!       
        </p>

            Hello Don, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having an issue with Outlook.com not forwarding all your emails to a distribution group as some are not. I know how important this is to you as it can be very disruptive to your work, and I am committed to help you with this.
<br />
<br />
In order for me to troubleshoot this with you, I need additional information from you:
<br />
<br />
1. Do you receive any error messages? <br />
2. Just to confirm, you are using Outlook.com or Microsoft Outlook? (This is Outlook.com forum)
<br />
3. What is your Microsoft account type? Is it an Office365 account? Enterprise? <br />
4. Is it OK if you elaborate on your auto forwarding setup? Was it accomplished by the aforementioned inbox rules?
<br />
<br />
If the "distribution group," is a shared mailbox, can I suggest you to setup it as POP3? Configure it to not delete email from server, and so POP can be thought of as a "store-and-forward" service.
<br />
<br />
Explore POP3: <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/POP3-Post-Office-Protocol-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Hope to hear from you soon, <br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - No I do not receive any error messages.</p>
<p>2 - I am using this from Office 365 Outlook to view the email account. We are a hosted Microsoft Exchange account.</p>
<p>3 - The email address is set up on our Active Directory, and synced to the hosted exchange.</p>
<p>4 - I turned on the auto-forwarding on the email account. It auto-forwards to the distribution group. The distribution group is not a shared mailbox. It is set up on our Active Directory and synced to the hosted exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send an email (with an attachment) from my account to the email address in question, it forwards it to the group. When our phone system sends an email (with an attachment) to the email address in question, it does not forward it. Our phone system
 email address is part of our network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Don</p>

<h2>            My Word 2013 crashes constantly &#40;not on startup - when typing&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with Word 2013 - 365 subscription. &nbsp;My Word 2013 keeps on crashing constantly. &nbsp;It is not on startup. &nbsp;I can open a document - or create a new document. &nbsp;I do some work and then it "has to close," "looks for a solution," "tries to recover
 my work," and then sometimes restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only about 10 percent of time or less it does recover something. &nbsp;Most of the time it reopens the last saved by user file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new laptop, Windows 8.1 with all updates up to date, plenty of memory and disc space. &nbsp;I usually have only a couple programs open with Word, maybe Outlook and Excel, but even if I have only Word open, it will still crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled all Com add ins, deleted all add ins related to Adobe. &nbsp;When Word was closed, I deleted the temporary/recovery files - these were then hints I found before. &nbsp;But it keeps on crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran it on Windows 7 until a few months ago, it was also crashing. &nbsp;I thought that updating to the newest OS would help but it did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many times during the crashing the Word will display a message that it has to close and will reopen when a solution is found, then just closes and does not reopen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried opening it in a safe mode and cannot find any problems. &nbsp;I deleted the Add Ins when running it as an administrator, but also cannot find any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran a quick repair through Programs in Control Panel, and it did not help. &nbsp;I ran a full repair, did not help. &nbsp;I am out of ideas as to why it crashes. &nbsp;It is quite irritating - imagine you are working on something, then it crashes, and you have to
 redo that work, then it crashes again, and again, and you end up having nothing accomplished in a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question that I have to the Microsoft technicians - can this be related to your feature with added "last position" bookmarks? &nbsp;When it crashes, about 25 percent of time there is no bookmark in my last saved or recovered file - it just vanishes. &nbsp;I would
 rather not have the bookmarks if they cause the crash and can move the cursor to my last position manually if this can be disabled. &nbsp;Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me, please? &nbsp;Thank you!</p>

<h2>            I have backup media, but no product key</h2>
                    Costco tech support was helping me with a frozen HP laptop. &nbsp;When nothing else worked, they told me to reset all. &nbsp;I have the backup media for MS Office 2007 which was wiped out on the reset. &nbsp;However, I no longer have product key. &nbsp;There are several sets
 of numbers on the media packaging, but when I enter them, they are not accepted. &nbsp;Help, what do I do short of repurchasing the software?

            <p>Thanks, ypu're right on the product key. Hats off to HP tech support they replaced Office software (took a while to do it because I had other self inflected problems trying myself) with a compatible program in absence of a PK ... the cost covered under my
 warranty. The program works fine but I have to replace all data that was on&nbsp; Excel. The "Compatible" program calls it "Spreadsheet" ... works the same as Excel.<br />

            Although there is a slim possibility that the file name contains illegal characters it isn't the most likely cause. You can easily test by locating the file in Finder, renaming it to something strictly containing alpha characters &amp; moving the file to a
 folder from which you have no problem opening other files. If Word still balks you can be certain that "invalid characters" isn't the problem.<br />
<br />
More likely, the file has been damaged in some way or has content that Word cannot interpret. The specific element involved could have been introduced in the file if the document originated from or has been edited by another user. Also, some earlier versions
 of Word 2007 which haven't been properly updated have been known to create .docx files that can't be opened by other versions of the program.<br />
<br />
There are numerous other possibilities, but unfortunately you may never figure out '<i>why</i>'. The important concern is salvaging the file if you can. These are some options to consider:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>If you can get a copy of the file to a PC running a <i>fully updated</i> Office 2007 or later, see if you can open the file there. Win Word has more powerful file repair tools than the Mac version. If you can open the file there, examine the content to
 see if there are any objects that might be the source of the problem. Remove the objects &amp;
<b>Save As</b> to create a new .docx file.</li><li>If no objects, copy all but the last <b>¶</b>, paste to a new blank document, then use Save As as above.</li><li>Launch the <b>Open XML Converter</b> app &amp; drag the document into the converter window. If it can, that will generate an
<i>.rtf</i> version of the file. Use <b>File&gt; Open</b> from within Word 2011, then Save As in .docx format.<br />
</li><li>In Mac Word 2011, use <b>File&gt; Open</b> &amp; select <i><b>Recover Text from Any File</b></i> from the
<b>Enable:</b> list. You'll lose any graphic content but may be able to recover the text.</li></ul>

    <title>How to reinstall MICROSOFT Internet Explorer rather than one from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hobbs92  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reinstall MICROSOFT Internet Explorer rather than one from another provider&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Recently I have found out that I am getting a LOT of pop-ups, because my Internet Explorer is running as:<br />
"Windows Internet Explorer provided by Freeserve"<br />
Freeserve was my previous internet provider, but I am now on a different line. <br />
<br />
A friend of mine told me that they had their Internet Explorer provided by Yahoo! before and got many pop-ups and then had their computer fixed to get rid of the Yahoo! part and replace it with the original Microsoft Internet Explorer. This has now stopped
 all of these random pop-ups coming through and nothing has appeared on the popup blocker (justifying that it is not just because of sites that are viewed that would have most likely displayed pop-ups, so no smart comments please).<br />
<br />
I have already tried many ways to remove this: <br />
I deleted all Freeserve items off my computer (Favourites, Registry Keys (I was very careful and everything is still running fine), and all programs to do with Freeserve in "Add or Remove Programs".<br />
I even tried deleting Internet Explorer 8 (which then restored Internet Explorer 7, but I could not delete that and this was still running of Freeserve). I then installed 8 again, but I am still receiving the same problems..."Provided by Freeserve".<br />
<br />
What else could I do to repair this myself? I am fairly confident that I have a good understanding of computers and everything, so please throw anything my way and I should understand it.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks a lot!<br />
<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
My Mac OSX contacts can not talk to Office 365. For example I do have mail group, mails but when I try to search for any thoses contacts in "Mac Contacts" through Office 365 Outlook , it does not show any at all. Is there any issue why Contacts can not communicate
 with Office365 ?</p>

<p>Looking forward to your feedback.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
