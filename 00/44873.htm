    <title>I&#39;m inquiring what&#39;s the email to inquire price range for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mercado yotd  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m inquiring what&#39;s the email to inquire price range for license for Operating Systems&#63;</h2>
                    I'd like to purchase a Win 7 License. And would like to inquire of prices for multiple licenses... I'm thinking of purchasing 2 or 3 license depending on the price range. I purchased my Windows 7 through Amazon. And I've been looking for prices for Win
 7 License but could not find a link to the webpage to inquire to purchase one. I might require more but unfortunately it is not for business related but for personal use. I enjoy custom building my own PC because I don't see much benefit from a generic brand
 because some of the parts of the component of the PC is not what I'm looking for. I'm sort of giving detailed information because I want someone to have better idea of what kind of license I may require.

<h2>            Where are photos stored which are taken on Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The latest version of Skype has restored the ability to take snapshots of the person you are seeing on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past these have been stored in 'C' / Users / user name / Application Data / Roaming / Skype / Pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the Application Data file is hidden in W10, but thanks to a Google tip have found it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, photos taken on a Skype call a few days ago are not in the sub-file.</p>
<p>All photos from previous versions of Skype are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please suggest where the photos might be stored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful for any advice.</p>

<p>I am an avid pc gamer. &nbsp;I Purchased Gears of War day 1 of release last month and planned to purchase Quantum Break, but $60? &nbsp;I could have purchased the Xbox game for that and traded it in....I will not pay $60 for any game. &nbsp;What is Microsoft thinking?
 &nbsp;Gears of War was priced right....</p>

<p>Gears of War is also a re-release, whereas Quantum Break is a brand new triple-A title, which tend to run $60 a pop these days. &nbsp;Dragon Age Inquisition, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, etc.. all $60 for the base game, then there are usually extra costs for any
 DLC released. &nbsp;You didn't have to worry about that with Gears because it isn't brand new. &nbsp;Halo Anniversary and Fable Anniversary were both much cheaper than a brand new title.</p>

<p>Plus game prices have dropped from what they used to be. I'm sure the younger gamers see a rise in price but if you go back to the late 80's and early 90's you can see what I mean. $60 is cheap for what you get.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have a Lenovo G505s, AMD-A105750M with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics 2.5GHz, 8 GB Ram, X64. I had Windows 8 on it, after a while it was upgraded to Windows 8.1 without any problem. Two weeks ago I had a problem with my sound and tried
 to fix it. I restored the windows to the start point. Then tried to upgrade it through Windows Store, it downloaded all updates and tried to upgrade the windows, but unfortunately it shut down after a while and restored my previous version showing the error&nbsp;0xC1900101-0x30018.
 I read a lot about it, uninstalled the antivirus, deactivate the firewall and win defender, removed other apps, run a compatibility test, made a clean boot and other things that were suggested on the internet and in forums. I tried several times, but got the
 same error.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then I made a USB for boot, tried to upgrade to Win 8.1, but after a while got the error&nbsp;0x101-0x2000C.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So I cannot understand what the problem is. I had been using Win 8.1 on this laptop for several months, and now I am not able to install it again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please help me. I am working on it for more than a week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">On my Computer I have just some non-important per-installed Lenovo apps, which were there as the Windows managed to upgrade last time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I ran the compatibility test of Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assitant and it showed that all my hardwares and apps are complatible with Win 8.1. So, whats the problem?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Since now I tried 8-10 different ways.&nbsp;</span></p>

Search your computer for all pictures, look through them manually until you find it, copy it someplace *you* can find it without all the searching and send it...</div>

                    <div>
<p>I use connectify to create a wifi hotspot which I use in my Android device. But a problem occurs that the internet access stops after a minute or so in my Android device. I have to restart connectify so that it works fine again, but again I face the same
 problem in a minute or so.</p>
<p>Its not a problem with my device as it runs properly on other wifi networks.</p>
<p>Any solution to this??</p>

<p>You marked that you are using Windows XP when you sent your question form, but you typed out that you are using Windows 10.&nbsp; I'll switch it so your question is filed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, yes you are most likely seeing malware.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't do anything like that, and those kind of "webpage takeovers" are illegal tricks to try to get you to pay for fake help, or worse.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I would run a full scan with your antivirus and/or Windows Defender and make sure you are clean.</li><li>Then when that is done, do this also:&nbsp; right-click Start and choose Run, type MRT and click OK.&nbsp; Run a full scan with that malware removal tool also.</li><li>Next, reset your browser.

    <title>HP 8600 OfficeJet Pro wireless problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vic1342  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP 8600 OfficeJet Pro wireless problems</h2>
                    So, I have an HP 8600 OfficeJet Pro utilizing wireless print over home network connection and I have done nothing but BRAG about this printer since I got it two months ago. &nbsp;However; today it decided it wasn't going to print the document I needed from
 my laptop, though it has done so several times in the past.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My source of irritation is that the document is in the que to print, but not only will it not print...it won't cancel, it won't delete, it won't go away at all!!! &nbsp;I've restarted the laptop 3 times, the printer twice to no avail. &nbsp;The document remains
 showing as "deleting," &nbsp;Which is odd because I've turned the laptop off several times and restarted. &nbsp;You would think the directive to print would have deleted itself simply through those means.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Nope, it remains and it keeps me from printing any other documents. &nbsp;Now I am not allowed to print ANYTHING as a result. &nbsp;Any advice? &nbsp;Anyone else with a similar problem, and how did you make it go away???</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm on the verge of uninstalling and reinstalling the printer...wouldn't that solve the problem of a document that refuses to print and refuses to disappear???</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Vic,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While HP Support (for your printer, start here: <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html</a>&nbsp;and input the details - there are several models, so I can't be more specific information), is the best option,&nbsp;it may be a simple issue which can be&nbsp;resolved by clearing and resetting the Print Spooler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do that, go to Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Services.&nbsp; Scroll to Print Spooler.&nbsp; Stop the service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once stopped, restart it again.&nbsp; That normally is sufficient if the spooler is the culprit, but if the problem persists, reboot after doing
 this and see if that helps (not typically needed, but possible).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At HP, you'll find a page dedicated to print queue problems.&nbsp; I chose one of the related printers as an example, but you should be sure it's using the page appropriate for your printer by checking and changing (if needed) the specific model at the top:
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02205477&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lang=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=4323648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02205477&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lang=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=4323648</a>.&nbsp; Then find your OS and follow the instructions step-by-step.&nbsp; I also noticed that some printers offer a printer diagnostic program to help with problems
 (but again, without knowing your exact model and since it will want to run it based on connecting to your system to detect and analyze the printer, I can't do that for you).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option is to try the Printer troubleshooter for your Operating System (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/printer-problems-in-windows-help#fix-printer-problems=windows-vista&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/printer-problems-in-windows-help#fix-printer-problems=windows-vista&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a>&nbsp;but
 you may need to specify your OS) to see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

            <p>I have been having a related? problem with my HP Officejet Pro 8620.&nbsp; All attempts to install the printer using HP software FAIL.&nbsp; A "work around" using "add Device" but forgoing the option to attempt wireless installation puts a proper printer image in
 the list of devices, but the driver "is unavailable".&nbsp; All attempts to have Device Manager "update the missing driver" of the printer that Windows 10 indicates is "working properly" in all Property classes causes the printer to disappear from the device list.&nbsp;
 After a month of chats with HP and MS support, I was able to get a partial install on a DELL XPS 8900.&nbsp; The "installs ?" on a HP ENVT 700-030qe, HP Pavalion 23 AIO and a Toshiba Satellite laptop all FAILED to provide a working Printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; As a LAST RESORT I have sacrificed two of my computers to a CLEAN {no files/no apps retained} install of Windows 10.&nbsp; When the computers again became available [over night for the laptop install] the first software loaded by me was the HP 162 MB install
 software for my printer.&nbsp; This is the first time in a month that I have seen screen images described by HP for a valid printer install.&nbsp; Big green check marks after each step of the procedure.&nbsp; When Adobe Reader on my DELL could not print to the Officejet
 Pro 8620 over the network, I placed the document on a USB memory stick, transferred the stick to the HP ENVY 700, allowed EDGE to open the document and selected print the Officejet Pro.&nbsp; After a significant time "connecting" the print properties screen seemed
 to be displaying the advertised options, color, gray scale, <br />
multipages per page, and "both side booklet" printing options.&nbsp; Click of PRINT resulted in hard copy of my document.&nbsp; Because the CLEAN install of Windows 10 wiped out my copy of OFFICE, I was forced to allow OpenOffice Writer to open the .docx WORD file.&nbsp;
 The ten page document was printed both sides duplex with color highlights.&nbsp; However the WORD document header and color banner were not translated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My only problem now is determining why the HP printer installation will not work when I use the "in place install" of Windows 10 preserving my apps and files.&nbsp; I plan to ask this question in another venue.</p>

            <p>I also have a HP Officejet Pro 8610 e wireless printer on a home network,it wont print on any device in the network,i have to smart phones both using android and the hp print app......no print!,i have a pc running windows 7 64 bit with a new Ubuntu (linex
 ops),two tablets one a Microsoft Surface 3 running windows 10,and a tablet running window 7 64 bit,i can only get one device to print and that was a laptop running an upgraded windows 10 but the cpu went out.So now i am cant get any thing to print,escan,or
 efax,my Hp printer is now two years old but i have had this issue now for over a year,in fact probably since it was new.I have contacted HP a hundred times and every time thy tweak it with software updates,and can get at least one to work, but not this time,
 and now thy want to start charging me tech support,and thy blame it on Microsoft windows 10 updates,and say thy don't have support for ubuntu,which is not true.</p>
<p>My son works for a small manufacturing plant 90 total employees and maintains the computers and said thy got rid of all of there hp officejet wireless printers because of the constant problems,so what i am trying to say is this not insulated problems,my
 son say there should be recalls or class action suits over this and not turning down free tech support with software problems.I have a few Hp printers over the years and never had problems with them but i am now done with them,thy can just sell $250.00 printers
 and walk away from them because these software issues.I think there tech support people are getting frustrated with all of the complaints at least that is tone of the voice from the tech guy i talked to last.If someone has any fix please let me know,i would
 love to able to print on my only pc with ubuntu version # 16.10.But i would be happy to print from any device.</p>

            <p>I experienced the same problem with an HP 8620.&nbsp; After passing through several sessions of tech support from HP and MicroSoft with no acceptable resolution, it became clear that the printer software was being treated by MicroSoft as insecure unacceptable
 and therefore not to be accepted onto the Windows 10 OS.&nbsp; After months of the problem and three replacement printers with no success installing under Windows 10 {The printer would install under OSX on a iMAC as advertised} I decided to do what every Windows
 user is forced to do.&nbsp; I downloaded the 1115 version of Windows 10 and did a "clean install".&nbsp; Before reinstalling any software, I installed the printer using the latest files from the HP web site.&nbsp; Somehow this procedure does not raise a security concern
 by Windows 10 even through all of the updates over the past year.&nbsp; The HP 8620 is still communicating, printing, scanning for all my network HP, DELL, Tohsiba, Apple computers.&nbsp; I have yet to complete reinstalling all my apps, but is that not the penalty one
 must suffer using MicroSoft Windows ?</p>

            I am using HP officejet Pro 8610 and my printer has not worked since I started using Windows 10. It will not do anything that my PC is involved in. So I can understand how you feel. Just reading this page, I am finding that it seems that no printer will
 work with Windows 10 as far as printing goes. I uninstalled it to reinstall it and it would not do that. It did uninstall but won't reinstall. Seems like the problem is Windows 10 to me.

            I have had no problems until I started using Windows 10. I think that is the problem. I can still copy with my HP officejet Pro 8610 but my laptop doesn't know it exists anymore. I removed it from the laptop but could not reinstall it. The problem is Windows
 10. I really hate I got that upgrade on my PC. It worked very well with Windows 8.1. Your son is right. The trouble is with Windows 10 and not your printer. You printer is just fine.

<h2>            Disable &#34;Location&#34; feature on Surface Pro 3 fixed my Wi-Fi problem on Windows 10 build 10240</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have my Surface Pro 3 for nearly one year now and it's completely a nightmare for me after upgrading to Windows 10 because of lots of UI bugs and app crashes, etc. Anyway, the most annoying part must be the Wi-Fi performance problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to capture the packets using Wireshark, I can see a lot of packet loss causing TCP retransmission. Also if try to `ping 8.8.8.8 -n 100`, you can see the latency will fluctuate up and down seriously (for me in Hong Kong, Google DNS 8.8.8.8 has a normal
 latency of 80 ms, but when it's fluctuate it can go up to 4xx ms).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the same WiFi problem as me, please try to turn off "Location" (Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location), this fixed the problem for me. The drawback: Cortana will not work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To MICROSOFT, please fix this problem ASAP, you don't want me to turn off Cortana isn't it?
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Xbox one talkback cable replacements</h2>
                    
<p>When i 1st purchased my xbox one i bought a headset adaptor to use my turtle beach x41s with. Unfortunately after a few months the flat talkback cord developed a short and produced a crackling sound and wouldnt transmit my voice. I then purchased a 3rd party
 cable adaptor from ienza which was a thicker wire but after 3 months this wire too developed a short. Is there an official talkback cable that can be purchased from microsoft or are there any more reliable 3rd party adaptors which could be used?</p>

<p>Now I'm not an expert on 3rd party headsets and cables that go with it, but unfortunately it appears there is no official Xbox talkback cable. Though as you've said it's for turtle beach x41s, why not look at turtle beaches official cables:

www.turtlebeach.com/.../339</a> </p>
<p>I know that link above is for a 360 cable, I'm not sure what differs for the Xbox One, but I personally try and use the same brand if I'm happy with the quality of the original product.</p>

<h2>            Time restrictions, but just for some users and not others.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>My children and myself use our xBOX and I want to set time restrictions so that they can only use them between set times or for a preset total each day.&nbsp; However I want to set this on a per user basis so that I can play on it when I want to.I know I can
 set a timer on the xBOX but this seems to effect every user and not indervidual users.</p>
<p>I can do this on our PC using the Microsoft family settings and it works fine.</p>
<p>Any ideas or have I missed somthing?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>Hi Sherry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It could be difficult when things don't work the way it should be on your computer. This could be an issue with compatibility of the version of flash you are

    <title>FAMILY GOLD PACK EXECUTION - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> posthumos1  say:</h3>
<h2>            FAMILY GOLD PACK EXECUTION</h2>
                    
<p>I received an email saying that they were doing away with the XBL Family Gold pack. This is the absolutely WORST news about the Xbox1 evolution I have heard.<br />
<br />
My family has had four accounts in this plan since the week it was made available. We haveplayed and enjoyed this service since that point. At $99 for the membership it was an affordable expense which was family inclusive.
<br />
<br />
Now, in your infinite wisdom, you take that away? You are going to try and strong arm families like mine into paying $240 a year on a single $600 console? And what do the owners of the Xbox 360 do who still have the old console and wish to play the games on
 XBL, especially since it was pointed out that there will be no backwards compatibility with 360 games? Is it going to be $480 a year?
<br />
<br />
This is a ridiculously bad PR move aimed at &nbsp;families that have been loyal since the First generation Xbox/Halo bundle.<br />
<br />
I can certainly say this, I would have supported Xbox through a lot of things. But I will sell every single one of the 200 or so games we own and completely walk away from this company if this isn't addressed. It is outlandish greed and I will never support
 it to anyone.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This is a change for the Xbox 360 console, the Xbox One will only require 1 person out of the whole family to have a Gold subscription and everyone else on that same console can have as many gamertags as they wish and they will all be gold members. So it's
 a $500 console and a $60 membership / year and that covers everyone on that console.<br />
<br />
As far as the Xbox 360 is concerned if you wish to play games on that console each person will need their own membership. You certainly don't have to purchase a $60 subscription for each person, feel free to look around for bargains on other sites such as Amazon,
 Best Buy, etc they usually have sales almost every month for a gold subscription for $35-37 / year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I too have been and Xbox fan since the original console / Halo and I agree with you wholeheartedly. &nbsp;We currently have 4 Xbox 360 consoles in our home just for the convenience of not having to deal with split screen issues. Should I also include the broken
 consoles as well since the $100 cost of repair was better spent toward the purchase of a new console?</p>
<p>This announcement brings about the end of an era. &nbsp;I refuse to invest in a single Xbox One console, let alone 4.</p>
<p>As stated, **Home Gold benefits limited to a <strong>SINGLE</strong>, designated Xbox One console in Gold member’s home.**<br />
The reason we have multiple consoles is so we're not limited to one&nbsp;<strong>SINGLE</strong> console..&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>DUH!!!</strong></p>
<p>Well congratulations... &nbsp;Microsoft has just lost a customer that has invested quite a bit of money into Xbox consoles alone not to mention the multiple copies of games we regularly purchase for the convenience of playing together on separate systems. &nbsp;Add
 to that the movies we've rented over the years.<br />
<br />
So sad too bad...&nbsp; it will not be hard at all to say Goodbye!!!</p>

<p>I am in exactly the same situation, the Notice is Way too confusing:</p>
<p>"Starting 27 August 2013, each activated account in your Gold Family Pack will convert to an individual Xbox Live Gold membership."</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>"Any accounts in an Xbox Live Gold Family Pack are being converted to individual Xbox Live Gold memberships to prepare for new and exciting upcoming benefits and features on Xbox Live Gold. Through the new Home Gold feature, a single Xbox Live Gold membership
 allows anyone in your home to enjoy many Gold features, like multiplayer, access to Gold entertainment apps and more on your Xbox One"</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>"Home Gold benefits limited to a single, designated Xbox One console in Gold member’s home; restrictions apply. Some Gold benefits cannot be shared"</p>
<p>What is "Home Gold" and how does that differ to "Live Gold"??</p>
<p>We are a family of four (2 Adults and 2 kids) using a Gold Family Pack and have 3 XBOX 360 consoles, which we use for games and movies.</p>
<p>The Xbox Live Gold Family Pack allowed any of us to use any console to do what we wanted. I have the Kids setup with restricted profiles, and all the payments come through my account, simple and easy....</p>
<p>But with &nbsp;this change, as the kids don't have email, it looks like I will have to go into each account, and set their email addresses to something that is monitored by me, and make payments individually at $60 each - what a pain.</p>
<p>The big question is that after I have done all that, will the NEW individual "Xbox Live Gold memberships" still be able to use ALL the XBOX 360 consoles, or will they be limited to one console????</p>
<p>I had planned to replace two of the XBOX 360 consoles with Xbox One consoles but now I am not so sure, as it looks like to use two consoles each user will need a membership for each console... $480 per year in subscription fees...</p>
<p>So Annoyed!!</p>

<p>I also just received the email telling me the party appears to be over for families who've invested in the Gold Family Pack. I am floored that such a GREAT service that has allowed my two kids and I to spend quality time together online is being dismantled
 like this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no interest in upgrading to the XBOne for two reasons:</p>
<p>1. Its ludicrous pricetag and lack of backwards compatibility</p>
<p>2. My family's current investment in 4 x XB360 hardware consoles and countless games.
</p>
<p>I would like to think that Microsoft had learned by now that their customers were more intelligent and could see through these half-baked ideas to gin up more cash for the machine for no additional benefit. I agree with Posthumos1 in that the value offered
 at $99 was impossible not to appeal to families - and now it appears that's gone. What a waste as I loved it and was fully prepared to keep it going for the foreseeable future.
</p>
<p>I'd really like an official explanation here: does Microsoft expect us to shell out the full $60 per person subscription price for each member of our family if we stay on the 360? If so, I can assure you there will be no more Microsoft gift cards, no more
 purchased games, no more paid DLC or subscription payments from my household. </p>
<p>This is yet another colossal blunder from the XBox team.</p>

<p>I agree. This thread needs more attention. It's great they threw in 3 extra months on each of the accounts that are converting over to individual gold accounts (which is like a free year when u add it up) but the bad certainly outweighs the good here; plain
 and simple, it's like this: $99/yr vs. $240/yr. </p>
<p>My kids each have their own Xbox in their rooms, so "Home Gold" does me no good, nor does it save me any money.
</p>
<p>Microsoft... if you are listening... If for some technical reason you had to do away with the Family Gold Pack due to Xbox One's release, PLEASE come up with another way for us to save money on gold subscriptions for multiple console homes. That extra $140
 a year is a bitter pill to swallow.</p>

<p>I've cancelled my auto-renew. I'm a family of four and the family plan was one of the best features MS implemented. This makes it easier to walk away from this corporation's train wreck of a change.</p>
<p>i've already told my boys that when the time comes that our accounts expire, i will not be purchasing xbl unless this is 180'ed back.</p>

<p>Three XBOX360 consoles in the house, to also avoid split screen and provide video playback etc in different rooms, I WAS looking at starting to replace with XBOXOne's, however that is now on hold with this announcement.</p>
<p>Listen up M$, there is NO way I shall be blackmailed (or be able to justify the cost) to have to run 6 Xbox Gold accounts (2 adults and 4 kids),
</p>
<p>All these stupid XBOXOne decisions appear to be premised upon the assumption that people only have a single XBOX console in the house, leaving potentially millions of households to essentially "get stuffed". Wake up or else this is a perfect time for disillusioned
 customers to vote with our foot, remove M$'s tentacles from our wallets and move to purchasing a Sony PS4.......that also doesn't happen to need all these paid subscriptions to play online !!!</p>

<p>So a few things;</p>
<p>While I'm sad to see the Family Gold go away, especially with the constant push in family gaming there are a few things people are missing.</p>
<p>Firstly everyone on the main console gets access to Gold features.</p>
<p>The subscriber to Gold can log into another Xbox One and get all gold features.</p>
<p>Yes it seems those not upgrading to the Xbox One are going to be the biggest hurt by this change.</p>
<p>Those who say they will buy a PS4. Well problem is you'll need to buy a PS+ account for every member to play online. They don't even allow on the main console to access online play on multiple accounts.</p>
<p>You can thank everyone who complained about the DRM plan for this. If you remember, you were going to be able to create a "Family" and share everything, including Gold features. Now we are stuck with this model. But obviously the more people speak up the
 better our chances are to get this changed. </p>
<p>I would hope MS creates a $99 plan which allows us to DRM the games and then share them and Gold features with X number of "Family".</p>

<p>"Any accounts in an Xbox Live Gold Family Pack are being converted to individual Xbox Live Gold memberships to prepare for new and exciting upcoming benefits and features on Xbox Live Gold."</p>
<p>Utter rubbish. Just say it how it is. "Here at Microsoft we're not making the bazillions of dollars we were a decade ago, so we're looking to screw as much money out of our existing customers as possible. Hence we're doing away with family accounts and will
 make you pay full whack for separate accounts and limit them to one machine only."</p>
<p>The Sony Playstation does look rather attractive now.</p>

            <p>Hi Model88,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click on the startup bar -&gt; Check "Lock Taskbar" is <strong>NOT</strong> tickmarked. Now press your left mouse button and hold the button pressed -&gt; Drag the task bar to the bottom of the screen and release the button -&gt; you should see the taskbar
 bottom of your screen. Now again right click on it and select "Lock Taskbar".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            If "Autoplay" is enabled, the installation will begin automatically when you insert a CD/DVD, usually with a window asking&nbsp;you if you want to proceed, accept licensing terms, etc. If that doesn't happen, you must start the process manually (or enable "Autoplay"
 at Control Panel, check the box "Software and games", and re-insert the disc) by opening the PC/DVD (double-click the icon at "Computer"), then double-click on "setup.exe" or whatever the installer is called.

<h2>            Urgent&#33;  Windows does not respond&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yesterday i installed Wind 8.1 pro and after this, while running drivers, my dongle driver took unusualy long time and i stopped it by force. This lead me serrious problem: what i see on my desktop now is only wrting "Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; The application
 is not responding. The program may respond again if you wait. Do you want to proceed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Literally tens of time i have pressed cancel button and end task,&nbsp; but no solution yet. Only arrow sign gets changes to reload cycle and nothing happens for hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried to solve the issue by using safe mode, but i hv never been able to access it. First, (i think) coz i hvnt signed in yet, power button doesnt appear along with username when i start the comp. Not always but sometimes im able to access slide menu
 so I tried to call the safe mode from there&nbsp; by pressing power+shift+restart. It asked me to wait. I waited hours of time, but no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hv also tried to access it by pressing f8 frequently, but it doesnt work as well..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you say,&nbsp; in this case, what may i do that can solImageImageve the problem??</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am a researcher and have very important things to do on my laptop. Unfortunately, next three days all the offices will be closed due to public holiday in the country that im based in. So i dont have a chance to use that comps as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help from ur side that would help me handle this issue would highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Fyi,&nbsp; im using Asus K55vd notebook. My harddisk is free of data and all software on the notebook are licensed.

            <p>Hi Jafarli, </p>

<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>

            <p>Dear Ganesh, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont ave any external devjces except wireless mouse, which is disconnected already.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately i cant open command promt that can type there something. When switch on it,&nbsp; it start with usual asus logo,&nbsp; and then without windows logo or so,&nbsp; it moves to welcome user part.&nbsp; Simce i hvnt signed in with my account,&nbsp; im not able to swich
 to safe mode from there by using power button. After this doskop appears with no shortcut/folder/logo on it.&nbsp; Here sometimes i hv a chance to open slide menu, but again i neither&nbsp; open msconfig, nore restart it with shift tbat wluld permit me to open safe
 mode nor command prompt. Wherever i click reloading cycle appers and then, after minutes,&nbsp; i see windows not responding message.&nbsp; I cant put it into sleeping as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried describe the matter as clear as possible.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Hopefully still there are chances to continue without installing windows again.<br />
