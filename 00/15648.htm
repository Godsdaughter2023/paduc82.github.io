<h2>            Synaptics HID Device is Faulty</h2>
                    <p>Since 10041 you have been pushing the Synaptics HID device driver via WU, and it is faulty.</p>
<p>Just installed 10074 and here it comes again.....</p>
<p>This version 18.1.45.6 still has the same issues, i.e. requires 4 clicks to generate 1 actual screen click</p>
<p>Roll back driver and everything works again properly, 1 click generates 1 screen click</p>
<p>
</p><p>My device is a Dell Venue Pro 11 7139 with mobile keyboard attached, but I am sure others are affected also.</p>
<p>It has been reported via feedback since early march.</p>

            <p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community and&nbsp;
</span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>I would like to inform you that there are two types of updates in Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Recommended updates (Important updates).</p>
<p>b. Optional Updates (Usually contain driver&nbsp;updates or updates&nbsp;for non-Microsoft products).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows automatically install recommended updates, which can address non-critical problems and help enhance your computing experience.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where as&nbsp;Optional updates are not downloaded or installed automatically. It's completely up to you whether you want to update your drivers or not.

 or durations you can only copy messages.&nbsp; If you pull the chat logs it will also only give you the messages.&nbsp; Clearly the information is there and stored.&nbsp; I can scroll up and see calls from 3 years ago and their durations, I just want access to that information
 without writing it down manually.&nbsp; Am I missing this functionality somewhere?&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.

<h2>            Reinstalling Apps on Replacement WindowsPhone8</h2>
                    I had to replace my new Nokia 920 and want to reinstall all the apps I had on my original phone to my new phone.&nbsp; I logged into Windowsphone.com, and selected "Purchase History".&nbsp; However,&nbsp;only about 20 apps that I have installed are displayed, not all
 of them.&nbsp; I had installed at least 60 apps.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;click the "More" link at the bottom of the page on the "Purchase History" page the list of apps extends from about 10 apps to 20 apps.&nbsp; There are no other links to click to display more apps that I have installed.&nbsp;
 How can I find all the apps I have installed on my previous phone so I can install them on my new phone without having to purchase them a second time?

            <p>If you login to your new device with the same Microsoft Account (and had Backup activated on the old phone) you should get a question about restoring your old device settings. That will automatically reinstall the apps you had on your old device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to reinstalling previously installed apps it is just a matter of clicking the Buy-button in the Windows Phone Store. It will then recognize that you already own the app and you will get the option to reinstall the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            I'm sorry to hear of the problem you had installing My Phone to your windows device.&nbsp; I have not experienced such a problem using My Phone on any of the 4 windows phones that I've used it with and haven't read of this sort of thing happening to other folks,
 so I don't think your experience is typical.<br />
<br />
What you describe happened to me recently after a failed sync attempt (I can't remember if it was a sync between My Phone or between my computer).&nbsp; Anyway, my windows phone hung up and would not boot up, getting stuck at the green, similar to what you describe.
<br />
<br />
I was able to fix the problem without performing a hard reset.&nbsp; Since I knew about the failed sync attempt, I figured the Outlook data on the phone was corrupted and was causing the problem.&nbsp; During a soft reset, windows mobile devices initialize certain applications
 and services on the device and outlook is one of those items (you can see the items that are initialized during a soft reset by viewing the \windows\startup folder).&nbsp; Instead of performing a hard reset, I connected my device to my computer and, luckily, ActiveSync
 recognized it as a guest connection.&nbsp; I was able to use ActiveSync's Explore option to navigate to the \pim.vol file, the file where all the Outlook data is stored, and delete it.<br />
<br />
When I disconnected my windows phone and performed a soft reset, the windows phone booted up successfully and I just synced the device to my computer and got all my Outlook data back.<br />
<br />

            Thanks for the tip. Unfortunately, I already reset it. The problem might be due to my connection setup configuration. I have a tmobile tdash with Windows Mobile 6. I have my phone set up to use the tzones router address for my internet and imap email connectivity.
 I don't use the standard data plan for that and wonder if that has anything to do with My Phone not working. I know other internet based apps (such as im clients) do not work with my setup but they are graceful in handling that with a nice error message and
 don't get tangled up in the operating system.<br />

            Did you actually manage to use the My Phone client on your phone to go out the to My Phone website and it was at about that time the phone locked up?<br />

I know you're probably nervous about trying out the application again (I would be if I were you), but you could conduct a full backup of your phone to your storage card and try it again.&nbsp; Then if the phone locks up again and you wind up having to perform another
 hard reset, you could always restore from your backup file and your phone would be fully operational again in just a few moments.&nbsp; Does your device include any kind of backup software on it?&nbsp; (If not, you could download the trial version of some of the third
 party applications that are available for windows mobile devices, such as SPB Backup or Sprite, for this).<br />
<br />
I don't think accessing My Phone via a wifi connection versus a data connection should make any kind of difference, but since your wifi network is different than the typical wifi connection, it is hard to say for sure.&nbsp; You could try accessing My Phone from
 another wifi connection to see if you have a different experience.<br />
<br />
It really is unfortunate that this happened to you.&nbsp; My experience with My Phone has been pretty good and it is a nice service to use to easily backup your data just_in_case something_badhappens, like you lose or break your phone or it gets stolen, or if you
 plan to replace your phone with another windows mobile device.

<p>Hi Haroon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such issues occur due to several reasons such as the Internet settings of the affected device or restriction placed on the file itself. We'd like to ask a few questions for us to better assist you:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your device managed by a domain or an organization? </li><li>Are you the original owner of the Excel file?</li><li>Is the issue happening with other hyperlinks that are saved in a different location?</li><li>Which browser are you using to open the hyperlinks?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

<h2>            Cant change footnote number from superscript in footnotes</h2>
                    <p>Prev question</p>
<p>&lt;How do I edit the footnote numbers?&gt;&nbsp; I want reverse to this preve question wanting to change to superscript..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen an answer to above to&nbsp;change ordinary numbers in footnotes to superscript. However I have superscript in foootnotes and text when I want ordingary numbers in footnotes only. I cant apply the same principles to my problem. . I highlighted the
 number but only get "justify" in styles showing up&nbsp;in a box and referencing styles not active. I have three footnote references in styles&nbsp;and between them make up 200 foonotes so must have changed font. All&nbsp;say "superscript".&nbsp;I need to "change all"..I know
 it must be simple because I can change one buy highlighting and clicking on Normal style. but cant change all of them and I now this is an option. .What should fields show. in 'Name', 'style type' and' style type based on'. Cant find answer in 'help"</p>
<p>Has anyone got a link to an answer that is not as complicated as one I saw from Doug Robbins please?&nbsp; Sorry Doug.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I LOVE directions given in screenshots if anyone has a good link on on this subject.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>If you want the footnote references in the text to remain superscripted and only the references in the footnotes themselves to be normal, then there are a couple of possible approaches.</p>
<p>You might want to try the macro here: <span><a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/UnSuperscptFnotes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/UnSuperscptFnotes.htm</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you can modify the references directly, as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Place the insertion point in a footnote (not the main document body).</span>
</li><li><span>Press <strong>Ctrl+H</strong> to open the <strong>Replace</strong> dialog.</span>
</li><li><span>Select the <strong>Find</strong> tab of the dialog.</span> </li><li><span>In the "Find what" box, type ^f (which is the code for footnote reference mark.</span>
</li><li><span>Click "Find in" and select "Footnotes." </span><span>All the footnote reference marks in the footnotes will be selected.</span></li><li><span>Click the title bar of the document to return focus to the document but leave the footnote reference marks selected.</span>
</li><li><span>Press either <strong>Ctrl+Spacebar</strong> (to remove direct font formatting) or
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+=</strong> (to toggle off Superscript formatting).</span></li></ol>

            You can modify the Footnote Reference character style, but note that it affects not only the reference number within the footnote, but also the reference in the text, which you may not want. Suzanne has linked to a workaround.

<h2>            Lumia 532 Update Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I am from the Philippines and I'm using a Lumia 532 Dual Sim. I've tried updating it several times still I'm getting a bunch of error codes. I downloaded the update advisor. It tells me that an update is available. However upon contacting to a support,
 she told me that I can't update my phone anymore. Now some of my apps are not working. It bugs me since I use my phone daily on my work. (emails, client's details, photo presentations etc.)</p>
<p>
Please help me on this one. What can I do? Is it really not upgradeable? Enlighten me please. Thank you.</p>

            the easiest way to find out if an update is available for you simply go to the update setting and it will tell you if an update is ready for you if you are having trouble with your phone try a soft reset turn your phone on then press and hold the volume
 down and the power buttons until it vibrates then release them and it will restart don't touch the screen until it restarts let us know how you go or if you need more help rgds Roy

            I already did that sir. Still no good. I got enough space for the update also. What bothers me was the answer given to me by an MS support agent. That my handset can't be updated anymore. I don't know if she's high or what. Anyway, thanks for the response.

<h2>            Now that activation is linked to my MSA, how can I associate a different MSA with Insider Preview &#38; my Windows 10 computers &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have a couple of PCs on the Insider preview, and I have associated these with my @NTLWORLD.COM (ie. non-hotmail/outlook) MSA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is though that Win10's built-in Mail app, assumes that my MSA is hotmail/outlook, and auto-creates a default mail account for my MSA on hotmail's server - this obviously won't work etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've bugged this over &amp; over again for each new Win10 build, but I'm getting fed-up with this now&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm wondering if can I change the MSA associated with my Insider Preview account &amp; Win10 computers, to e.g. an Outlook.com MSA (so that the Mail app's default account will work), - without loosing my computer's activation status etc.

            <p>Thanks - I also use a local account to install, (or simply install with the network disconnected) - It's much quicker</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also skip the entering of a product key, because once I add my MSA account to Win10, - Win10 &nbsp;activates automatically as (MS Win 10 Activation "knows" my pc's hardware information, which is linked to my MSA)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let me (try) to re-explain ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed-up with the Win10 Insider Preview, with an MSA account<br />

<p>I now want to change the MSA account that I use within the Insider Preview Program (to another MSA acount)</p>
<p>However, I can't find any links to do this&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, I do not want to join up to the Preview Program as a "New Person" - as all my existing problems &amp; feedback will be left behind under my old MSA account &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I suspect that changing the MSA account that's linked to my existing Insider Preview computers to another (different) MSA account will screw their activations</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had two (2) on-line chat sessions with MS Support, and no-one seems to know the answers to this</p>

            <p>I'm not sure either, I think you might have to wait and see if anyone else responds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still not sure your MSA account is linked to activation as I think it is just the hardware. But as you say using a new one would screw up your previous feedback &amp; problems.</p>

    <title>Account in Project Spartan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasdewangga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account in Project Spartan</h2>
                    I have some question, why every time I signing into some account, like Microsoft, Xbox, or google account, I can't stay sign in on all the web page. After I open the page and open it again, the web still not sign in and I have to sign in again. My biggest
 problem in Xbox account, when I want to play Xbox game on PC, it's always ask me to sign into the Xbox.com. But every time I open the Xbox page, I need to sign in again and again. There is no option "stay sign in" or "remember my password". IE is better on
 this issue. Can anyone tell me how to fix this?

<h2>            Avery Templates Windows 10, office 365</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please tell how I can get a template for Avery 5163 mailing labels?</p>
<p>
</p><p>this used to be a simple task (before Windows 10 upgrade), open blank document, go to mailings&gt;labels, then choose the label number you need and create a blank page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mailings&gt;labels is still there, but the number of available Avery labels is greatly reduced.&nbsp; and of course the labels I have are no longer listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would Microsoft remove such a simple feature?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got Windows 10 a few days ago and now a simple task that would have taken two minutes has grown into a wild goose chase that has me going down a rabbit hole looking for answers.</p>

 they are now showing (along with what seems to be a comprehensive list of all their labels).</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>When you use the References dialog box to directly reference another workbook, add-in, or object library file, you can run a macro contained in the referenced file using the Call statement and the macro name, or only the macro name.<span>&nbsp;<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Open the add-in file (either before you run the macro, or as a command in the macro), and then use the Run method of the Application object to run the macro as in the following example:<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<div>
<div><em>Application.Run("ADDIN.XLA!Macro_Name")</em> <br />
</span></span></span>
<p><span><span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/115208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/115208</a></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>By default, Office sets macro security to High. This setting prevents
 Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) sub procedures and add-ins that have not been digitally signed from running.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>To
 work around this issue, you can refer to this KB article</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Hello TE_444,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unable to access your work's links or emails using the personal emails are being set by the company admin. Work related links and emails are often blocked from being accessed outside the company or by a different email account. Admin set up rules for security
 purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access emails outside the office and using a different account, I suggest that you contact the company admin to whitelist your account and IP address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your question, you can access two different account using two different browsers or using Incognito or In-Private browsers. Again, this issue may be caused by the setup used by the company admin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</p>

    <title>Not happy with Windows 10 at all - wondering where Microsoft has gone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> airspeed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not happy with Windows 10 at all - wondering where Microsoft has gone wrong&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been a strong supporter of Microsoft, having started with DOS 2.11, and for a decade been a software engineer dedicated to Microsoft's development products (I am out of the business now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was smart enough to avoid the Vista debacle, and went from XP to Windows 7. I have a ton of machines, all legally licensed, and have mostly gone with 64 bit pro. I have to say I was really, really happy with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put 8.1 on one machine, and hated it from day one. I was thinking of reverting back to 7, but decided to wait for the full rollout of Windows 10, especially because it was being hyped as being the best operating system of Microsoft ever, having learned
 from previous mistakes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did something very unwise - I put Windows 10 on my traveling laptop, and then went off on vacation, trusting it would work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WRONG!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate this so much now that I think I will go back to Windows 7, and not try anything until it has been out for a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my gripes:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Privacy issues - oh boy, am I now getting interested in Ubuntu. I thought I would never say those words...</li><li>Quality of the build - it is not good. Here is what is happening: fuzzy fonts (won't fix), unpredictable mouse behavior (makes me do cold reboots), unpredictable lock-ups. It is simply unacceptable quality</li><li>Interface - I think it stinks. Sorry. Very bluntly put. I had to get an external package to make to windows button work in a way that is practical for me.</li><li>The forced updates: Please, please let the user remain in control of the machine. This alone is cause to revert to 7.</li></ul>
<p>This is a very rough listing, I could go into more detail. But I am really, really disappointed in Microsoft at this point, yet I am so dependent. If there were a way I could drop Office completely and move away from Microsoft as an operating system, while
 still keeping the open PC architecture, I would. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several things Microsoft could learn from this. Here are what I would recommend:</p>
<p>1. Privacy is now becoming a real issue. Don't force the cloud, and don't rely so much on Microsoft user accounts.</p>
<p>2. Let the user stay in control! I cannot re-emphasize this enough. </p>
<p>3. Look at the quality of what you are pushing out. Take more time to get it right.</p>
<p>4. I'd rather pay $100+ for an operating system that works, per machine, than install a free junkopsys, which is what Windows 10 is revealing to be to me. Believe me - I pay for my licenses. And I don't want junkware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I return, I am going back to Windows 7. After all, I have the disks, and I paid for it...</p>

            Many of us have been saying exactly the same thing for the last 10 months now since the start of the Windows 10 test program. We were sold on the idea that we would be getting a genuine desktop operating system back in our possession. &nbsp;What we got instead
 was a highly modified, stripped down, traditional Windows OS built on a phone interface that just happens to be compatible with the desktop. The Universal OS concept may have it merits, but he idea is not new and has been tried before without too much success.
 Windows 10 in it's present form, appears to be head in that same direction.

            If you used Migration assistant to move your applications over. <br />
<br />
Instead since you already had a DVD copy<br />
<br />
go to this Link: <br />
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5287</a><br />
<br />
This is page on Remote Disk which will allow you to install software on a DVD from another Machine, even from a windows machine (PC).<br />
<br />
If you have gotten rid of the old machine Then you you will need to download the Office2011 from Microsoft's website.
<br />
<br />
By the way if you are a very new adopter a MacBook Air using the newest Airport version 802.11ac (I think I have the last letter right) it may take longer than normal to download as there is a Bug in the software. If your using a MacBook Air using the older
 802.11n standard then you should have no trouble. <br />
<br />
IF you have access to DVD follow instructions in this link:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768</a><br />
<br />
The use remote disk to Reinstall<br />
<br />
If you don't have access to a DVD drive then first Download the installer from Microsoft.
<br />
<br />
Remove all Traces of Office (except you data files as in the link above)<br />
then run the installer<br />
From Help menu in any of the office applications (except Outlook) run updates or auto update, or look for updates.<br />
<br />
you need to run in order Service Pack 1(SP1), SP2, SP3, and updates .1, .2., .3., .4, .5 (the auto update may skip update steps if previous updates are rolled into each other)<br />
<br />
Repair Permissions<br />
Then use Font Book to check for duplicated or bad fonts. <br />
Follow this: <a href="http://www.phillipmjones.net/Font_Book.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.phillipmjones.net/Font_Book.html</a>&nbsp; to do a thorough check of fonts.<br />
<br />
After all this you should be good to go. <br />

                    One of the statuses available for an Appointment/Meeting in Outlook 2011 for mac is "Out of Office" (which appears to map to "Away" in the Outlook Web App, when viewing Calendar entries).

<div>This status, surprisingly, does NOT prevent someone from scheduling a meeting with me in the same time slot. &nbsp; If I use the "Busy" status, however, the time slot is unavailable for meetings.</div>

            Hello Jackie
<br />
<br />What happens with others apps (word, excel,etc) that’s only happening  with Outlook?
<br />
<br />Follow below troubleshoot for Outlook issues in an Outlook 365:
<br /> 
<br />Step 1: Investigate possible issues caused by add-ins
<br />
<br />Exit Outlook.
<br />Open a Run dialog box. To do this, use one of the following procedures, as appropriate to your version of Windows:
<br /> 
<br />If you're running Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 8, press the Windows logo key+R.
<br />If you're running Windows 7, click Start, type Run in the Search box, and then click Run.
<br />Type Outlook /safe, and then click OK.
<br />If the issue is fixed, click Options on the File menu, and then click Add-Ins.
<br />Select COM Add-ins, and then click Go.
<br />Click to clear all the check boxes in the list, and then click OK.
<br />Restart Outlook. If the issue doesn't occur, start adding the add-ins one at a time until the issue occurs.
<br /> 
<br />Step 2: Repair Office
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel, and then click Uninstall a program.
<br />In the list of installed programs, right-click the entry for your Office installation, and then click Change, and then click Online Repair. 
<br /> 
<br />Step 3: Run Outlook Diagnostics
<br />
<br />Note You must have an O365 account to run this diagnostic.
<br />
<br />To diagnose and fix Outlook connectivity issues, install the Office 365 Support and Recovery Assistant (SaRA). Then, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Run SaRA.
<br />On the first screen, select Outlook, and then click Next.
<br />Select any of the following options, as appropriate, and then click Next:
<br />Outlook won't start
<br />Outlook keeps hanging or freezing
<br />Outlook keeps crashing with a message "Microsoft Outlook has stopped working."
<br />SaRA runs some diagnostic checks, and returns some possible solutions for you to use to address the Outlook connectivity issues.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Step 4: Create a new Outlook profile
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel, and then click Mail.
<br />Click Show Profiles.
<br />Select the profile that you want to remove, and then click Remove. 
<br />Important
<br />Removing the profile also removes associated data files. If you're not sure whether the data files are backed up or stored on a server, do not remove the profile. Instead, go to step 4.
<br />
<br />Click Add.
<br />In the Profile Name box, type a name for the new profile.
<br />Specify the user name, the primary SMTP address, and the password. Then, click Next.
<br />You may receive the following message:
<br />Allow this website to configure alias@domain server settings?
<br />In this message, click to select the Don't ask me about this website again check box, and then click Allow.
<br />When you're prompted, enter your logon credentials, and then click OK.
<br />When Setup is finished, click Finish.
<br /> 
<br />Step 5: Run SaRA Advanced Diagnostics before you contact Support
<br />
<br />This step creates diagnostic details and gives you the option to upload them so that they can be reviewed by a Support engineer before your Support call.
<br />
<br />Run SaRA.
<br />Select Advanced diagnostics.
<br />Select the Outlook diagnostic.
<br />Select Create a detailed report of my Outlook, Office, Windows, and mailbox configuration, and then click next
<br />
<br />I hope that help you. Let me know if you need further 
<br />
<br />Regards
