            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did not mention your version of Project: I'll describe how to do it in versions 2007 and later.</p>
<p>Open the Change Working time dialog.</p>
<p>Make sure the name displayed is the one of the Calendar you want to change (Standard I presume)</p>
<p>Click the pad "Work Weeks"</p>
<p>Click "Details"</p>
<p>In the upcoming window select Sunday</p>
<p>check Set day(s) to these specific workig times</p>
<p>Enter the working times for Sunday</p>
<p>Now select Friday</p>
<p>Check Set days to nonworking time</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>There you are.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p />

<h2>            Outlook Mobile &#38; Windows 10 desktop &#47; Email sync missing since last week&#39;s update</h2>
                    <p>After last week's update I have a strange problem in Outlook on my Lumia 640DS and on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot read the emails in the inbox or the sent folder. It cannot be a password issue because all the subfolders and their messages are readable since the opening of my account. On my computer "normal email"&nbsp; the mails are readable with no problem (Thunderbird)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the welcome screen of my Email account (IMAP) Outlook always tells "Not yet synchronised". After pressing the Sync button I receive the message "No objects to show"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else experiencing the same?</p>

<p>Hi Jent525,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description I understand you are encountering a credential issue when you are trying to install Exchange 2016 server in your environment. Please check following options on your side:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.May I ask what is the specific page it is in the installation wizard? Please collect a screenshot of it if convenient.
</p>
<p>2.Please run following PowerShell to double check if you are in the Administrators Group:
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Get-ADGroupMember -Identity Administrators</span></p>
<p>3.If convenient, please assign a new admin member and check if you can use that account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to let me know the outcome.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<p>Hi Jent525,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the screenshot it requires your Office 365 admin credential rather than on-prem admin account to verify the Hybrid deployment check. If you have already tried enter your Office 365 global admin
 credential but the issue persists, please try to perform following options to check if your admin account is in "Organization Management" role group in Exchange online:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)Connect to Exchange online PowerShell:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)Run<span style="font-weight: bold"> Get-RoleGroupMember -Identity "organization management"</span> to check if your admin account is in the role group.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to let me know the outcome.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Thank you...yes I am using my o365 credentials but no luck.</p>
<p>I did run the command you suggested and my account comes up.</p>
<p>I did notice that it only seems to come up if my name is in the old part of exchange permissions. If I take it out and only put in under the new compliance and security permissions....it does not show up.&nbsp; I don't know if that makes a difference. I put my
 account in both, but still no luck.</p>

<p>Hi Jent525,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to this following article, there are there things you need to check on your side.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The user account you entered must be in the Office 365 organization that's already configured in a hybrid deployment with your on-premises organization. If you provide a user that's a part of another
 Office 365 organization, you'll receive an error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Access to the Internet.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Make sure you can connect to
<a href="https://ps.outlook.com/powershell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ps.outlook.com/powershell</a>. Please try to connect to Exchange online PowerShell on the affected machine:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><blockquote>I was able to follow these steps and set up a daily scan to run in the early morning hours. &nbsp;However after a couple of days, I checked Windows Defender and it still shows last scan date as a date from early in the week when I did a manual scan.
 &nbsp;Why did my setup not work? </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p><span>The </span><em><span>Last scan</span></em><span> info should be updating with the daily Automatic Maintenance Quick Scan. The steps provided above will only start the Windows Defender app – they won’t run a scan. Also, a scheduled scan won’t wake up
 a sleeping PC unless that option is checked in the Conditions tab. There's generally no need to run your scans in the wee hours, and&nbsp;they're much easier to monitor if they run while you're using the PC. Try this setup:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan Setup:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open Task Scheduler (Start button &gt; All apps &gt; Windows Administrative Tools &gt; Task scheduler)
</span></p>

<h2>            My email will not open with Google Chrome</h2>
                    
<p>I can open all of the other options on Office 365 for business, but when I click to open my email it just keeps thinking about it and never opens. &nbsp;I have been able to open it on my phone and other computers (not using chrome). &nbsp;This is a new problem as
 it has never had issues with google chrome before. &nbsp;Not sure what else I need to do. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Heidi,</p>
<p>According to the description, I understand that this issue happened only to the Google Chrome browser suddenly.</p>
<p>Given the situation, I suggest you:</p>
<p>1. Upgrade your Google chrome browser to the latest version.</p>
<p>2. Clear the browser cache of the Google Chrome browser.</p>
<p>3. Try opening the emails under the “Google Chrome new-incognito” mode.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after performing the steps above, I’d like to know:</p>
<p>1. Can you open the emails using other kinds of browsers such as IE11, Firefox, etc. on your computer?</p>
<p>2. Please ask other users in your organization to open their emails with the problematic Chrome browser to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>3. Do other users in your organization encounter the same issue?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>
        </p>

Same problem here, that n73 finds the gps but wont display information and thus not functional and all this thanks to the upgrade to v4<br />
<br />
any solutions anyone would be grateful. Reinstalling and deleting doesnt work it is a flaw in the update which has stalled the connection

            Hiya.<br />
I have tried everything with no success, i went to nokia service center this morning and they could not help, so<br />
there appears to be two solutions.<br />
1) Buy a nokia gps receiver.<br />
2) Put the phone on ebay??.

            I have bad news for you guys. I supposed that once a version is updated, there is no way to downgrade the version back to 3.0713 which supports your program. Another solution: Wait for the newer version to be released. This might take a very long time.
 So i guess selling it away might help.

<h2>            DPC Watchdog Violation Windows 10 Technical Preview.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still getting this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stable Build 9926</p>
<p>
</p><p>Builds 10041, 10049 and now 10061, all give DPC Watchdog Violation during installation upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It always occurs on the reboot, just before "Setting up a few more things".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant provide the logs, because the system reverts back to build 9926, and the logs required, do not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Catch 22 situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers etc are bang up to date on Build 9926.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a case that I've literally, got to try to install each new build as it is issued, and hope that that build is stable on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 and Windows 7, are running fine on alternative hard drives, within this computer, and they work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please don't direct me, to the standard issue problem solving guide as I've tried all that, and the LOGS DO NOT EXIST, even though build 9926, is set to create them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea's ?</p>
<p>

            <p>Like you, I could never get past 9626, until yesterday. I have Windows 7 x64 and Windows 8.1 x64 install, plus 5 other discs containing media, data, games etc, and a blank drive that used to have Windows 10 installed, but yesterday I weakened and downloaded
 the 10162 build and burnt an iso. </p>
<p>I then did a clean install of windows 10, which went in without a hitch. At the final restart, I disabled Windows 10 quick start in the "what the power buttons do" menu, as this tended to mess up my other drives requiring a checkdisk, and then allowed a
 reboot. It came up fine, so I went the next step and installed the latest Nvidia Windows 10 certified drivers, and a backup program, and backed it up. Since then, I have been back into my other two OS with no checkdisk and back into Windows 10 with no problems.</p>
<p>At last, my machine is running something other than 9626, so if you are feeling brave Swordie, try loading from the iso, I could even leave everything, including my logitech wifi G602, connected, and no sign of the unmentionable watch***&nbsp; thing. I will see
 what happens with the next lot of updates, but this is the second day trouble free, which is a first without 9626.</p>

    <title>WP 8.1 loses access to MobileIron exchange mail &#40;error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i.smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            WP 8.1 loses access to MobileIron exchange mail &#40;error 86000C34&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This is an issue that a couple of us are having in an enterprise situation. I do know yet fully understand the pattern, and I don't see anything else online about this. This post is an attempt to bring out others who have the issue or at least find some
 information for myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia 830 with 810.14176.243</p>
<p>Now with Dev Preview 8.10.14219.341</p>
<p>Exchange 2010 SP3 Update Rollup 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connect to the enterprise Exchange system through MobileIron, but the enterprise email loses it's mind frequently. MDM is the enforced means of connecting to mail in the enterprise and I am in IT so there are no alternatives. Before MobileIron was enforced
 I never had this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every day or two the exchange account on the phone fails to sync. It'll say "last updated X hours ago."
</p>
<p>Refreshing brings up a message like this: </p>
<p>"&lt;exchange account name&gt; phone error </p>
<p>Last updated x hours ago</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can't sync right now, but you may be able to find more information about this error code at www.windowsphone.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last tried 2 seconds ago</p>
<p>Error code: 86000C34"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally what I have to do to get the mail working is delete the email account entry on the phone, wait a few minutes, and then go into Settings &gt; Workplace &gt; [workplace name] and hit the refresh button. The exchange account is automatically recreated, I
 have to enter the password and then it'll work again until next time.&nbsp;Next time could be 5 minutes, 5 hours, or 2 days...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following are patterns that I've seen and it is all unproven conjecture at this point, but it may be useful to someone.</p>
<p>*** The enterprise about about 15 WP8.1 devices in it and only myself and one other person (both in IT) have seen this issue. Could AD/exchange groups be related?</p>
<p>** Connecting to wifi in the workplace seems to cause the exchange connection to be broken sometimes. A co-worker with a different model Lumia (I think 920) stopped connecting to wifi and has not had the issue. However, he does connect to wifi at home without
 triggering this failure.</p>
<p>** I still have the issue frequently (every day) even when I do not connect to wifi at work.</p>
<p>** I have noticed that when switching off bluetooth the device will sometimes lose *all* network connectivity for a second. That momentary loss of network might corrupt the MDM connection? That might indicate a bug in MDM or the OS or both.</p>
<p>** This issue only affects MDM connected mail. The other regular IMAP/POP3 accounts have never had an issue.</p>
<p>** OS resets don't help.</p>
<p>** MobileIron in the enterprise is entirely up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The end result is that I am becoming very disenchanted with this device despite my significant preference for the OS. This one feature is such a failure that it creates added work to reset or at worst an inability to be responsive to enterprise emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love any kind of discussion here that will aid in discovering a solution or workaround to this issue. If this is not resolved by the the time the device is off-contract I will be ready to just go with iOS. That will make me very sad.</p>

                    <p>Please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having the same issue for months, but now it finally stop working all together.&nbsp; Basically I'm unable to delete or empty my "Deleted Items", which is the trash bin, in my Hotmail account.&nbsp; I'm using the browser base and login through "outlook.live.com".&nbsp;
 So now I have over 80,000 deleted emails in there that's taking up space.&nbsp; Now my quota exceeded and I no longer receive/send email anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically every time I go into "Deleted Items" and delete any email in there, it would go away, but if I come back later, or hit refresh, that same email appears back.&nbsp; I contacted Outlook Support Team but it's still not working.&nbsp; I used Chrome, Edge, Mail
 app that comes with Windows 10.&nbsp; I don't have the real Outlook app to try out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone advise on what else I can try?&nbsp; I have important emails coming everyday.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to sync Meeting Notes between Outlook for Mac 2016 (v 16.22 (190107)) and OneNote for Mac 2016 (v 16.22 (190107)).&nbsp; I can successfully sync emails between Outlook and OneNote; however, attempting to sync *any* meeting results in the following

<p>
</p><p>This is true for meetings created by me, someone inside my organization, someone outside my organization, or from another calendar (Outlook or external.)</p>

    <title>Front camera not working with Skype for Business and Surface Pro4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewpohlmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Front camera not working with Skype for Business and Surface Pro4</h2>
                    Recently my front camera stopped working using Skype for Business on a Surface Pro 4. The rear camera works fine and both cameras work using Windows Camera so it does not seem to be a hardware issue. I tried a Repair and reinstalled Skype but neither worked.
 More specifically, the front camera shows an image after a few minutes but it's really delayed and green. This was not an issue a couple months ago but I can't figure what changed. Help?!

            You may download and run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403723...</a>) to determine if it is a camera app issue or because of firmware or driver (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021719/update-for-the-surface-pro-4-camera-front-driver-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402171...</a>). If it is because of driver issue, there's a need to update your Surface Pro 4 - Camera front driver to get it resolved. If you haven't install it yet, please refer to this link (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505</a>) to know how.
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the rear camera
<br />
<br />Click Disable
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager
<br />
<br />Restart then check if the camera now works in Skype for Business.

<h3> ed1-us  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote app on Windows 10 - broken&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently started to use the OneNote app on my Windows 10 desktop computer (upgraded free from Windows 7).&nbsp; I have it syncing with OneNote app on my Windows 10 notebook computer and the OneNote iOS app on my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, when I try to open OneNote on my desktop, I get a message that the app cannot be opened as the trial period has expired.&nbsp; I am directed to go to the Windows Store to purchase the full app.&nbsp; When I go to the Windows Store, it detects that OneNote is
 already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to do.&nbsp; I thought OneNote is now free to use on desktops, notebooks and mobile devices.&nbsp; Is this not true?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to get OneNote working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Problem solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I had gone to the Windows Store to try to uninstall or reinstall the OneNote app, those options were not presented to me.&nbsp; Only text that said the app was already installed and a button that said "Launch", which of course did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In browsing for a solution, I found a Microsoft support chat system.&nbsp; The support person first wanted to refer me to a dedicated Office support team, but I advised him the problem was with the built-in OneNote app.&nbsp; He was given permission to "take over"
 my computer and tried a few things.&nbsp; OneNote did not open on a new Windows user account that he set up.&nbsp; Then I advised him that I had seen something somewhere that the Windows Store cache may be corrupt.&nbsp; I found no way to fix it, nor did the support person
 deal with that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>He went to the Windows Store and looked up OneNote.&nbsp; For some reason, a reinstall button option was presented.&nbsp; He tried to reinstall the app several times unsuccessfully.&nbsp; But he just kept pressing that button.&nbsp; After probably 6 or 7 tries, OneNote finally
 reinstalled.&nbsp; It then worked properly - on both the new Windows user account and my original user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still do not know how or why I had this issue, or why I was not presented the reinstall option in the Windows Store while the MS support person was presented with this option.&nbsp; (I do have Administrator privileges in Windows.)&nbsp; Just happy it's fixed.</p>

    <title>Security Essentials 4.3.215.0 downloads point to old 4.2.223.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rainer meier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Security Essentials 4.3.215.0 downloads point to old 4.2.223.1 download archives</h2>
                    Currently the download links on the Security essentials download page and as well in Microsoft download center point to the outdated 4.2.223.1 download archives instead of latest 4.3.215.0. This seems to apply to all editions (checked English an German
 languages, 32-bit and 64-bit downloads).<br />
<br />
<br />
On <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-all-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Security Essentials Download Page</a> all links seem to load to the download of the 4.2.233.1 installer.<br />
In <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download center</a> it states version 4.3.215.0 in details panel but publish date still reads 2/26/2013 which is the release date of version 4.2.233.1 and when the download is started
 you will get version 4.2 downloaded.<br />
<br />
Actually the same issue happened already during the release of MSSE 4.1. See <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/german-download-for-microsoft-security-essentials/082804a2-1ca1-47fb-a2cb-9325e00131fa">
here</a>. Seems Microsoft is unable to release a software in parallel on Windows update and update all download Links. What I don't get is how Microsoft could update metadata in download center (Version) but forget to update the download link as well as the
 release date. This is totally confusing and misleading.<br />
<br />
Last time I complained about this Microsoft managed to update some download links (English edition) but still forgot others (German edition). This is quite ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know the download URL for latest 4.3 installers? I actually only got English MSEInstall.exe for English version since I grabbed it from the download folder during Windows update.<br />

<h2>            98&#37; of CPU usage when RSS feeds are updated</h2>
                    <p>* Original Title: msfeedssync&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I can't find the answer to this problem.<br />
<br />
I am running ie8 on xp.<br />
<br />
Whenever my RSS feeds are updated, msfeedssync, after a few minuites, starts taking up to 98% of CPU power.
<br />
<br />
Currently I have my machine set so that it only updates automatically once per day, otherwise I use "refresh all", wait a while then use "end process" in task manager so that i can use my machine again.<br />
<br />
If i leave it long enough it does eventually sort itself out. But it is a total pain.<br />
<br />
Any help really appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Ian<br />

    <title>Why is OneNote using up to 400MB of mobile data a day when it&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonnierod  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is OneNote using up to 400MB of mobile data a day when it&#39;s set to not use mobile data at all&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Over the last month I have had this intermittent problem with the OneNote mobile app for Android which is that no matter what I do in the settings it will not stop using my mobile data to sync up to 400MB of data a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both the app and in the Android settings I have instructed OneNote to only sync over WiFi. This had been working fine for me for years. Then one day my phone gave me a warning that I was nearing my data limit and when I checked OneNote had synced over
 1G in the background over mobile data. I have checked and checked and checked and there is absolutely no setting that is telling OneNote it is allowed to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't understand why the data usage is so much. I have had my notebooks synced to my device for years so OneNote should only need to sync changes that are being made. I do not understand how opening pages for reference (which should already be saved
 to the phone) requires 400MB of data. It is not possible that casual use is creating 400MB of new data every day. This morning I literally opened a single note, added two lines of text and the app used 100MB of data. I am very sure of these numbers as I was
 aware of this problem going on and was paying attention to it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting to the point where I see no alternative but to stop using OneNote and start use Evernote instead. I do not want to do this, but I'm really not seeing an alternative unless you can provide me a fix for this.</p>

<p>We are sorry to hear that you are still experiencing the issue. Changes made to your OneNote can cause this issue since it will sync again all your notes. For us to further help you with this, we'd like to know if you made any changes prior to this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this, kindly try clearing the cache of OneNote application to your phone.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any changes that were made to my OneNote account. It was working fine, then it wasn't. I know that's not helpful but I'm honestly perplexed. I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm used to troubleshooting things, I've certainly checked the obvious culprits,
 but can't find one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've cleared the cache, I've reinstalled the app, all that. When I reinstalled the app I stopped having the problem for about three weeks, then it came back. It's odd. It's syncing even when the app isn't running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have it installed right now, I've been using Evernote, honestly, which is not what I want but I simply can't afford 200-300MB per day of data, and since it's doing this in the background I don't even have a way of stopping it while I troubleshoot.</p>

<p>We are sorry for the delayed response. For this, can you check if the issue will persist when you turn off OneNote to your cellular data? This usually happens since there are some device applications are still running on the background even though you are
 not using. This will stop unless you will turn off the app on your cellular data.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi, thank you for replying! Before your reply I had shut off mobile data for OneNote in order to stop hemorrhaging data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this does prevent my mobile data usage from going through the roof, it also prevents me from using OneNote while out at work. I have a small business and need to make and see small updates throughout the day. All my updates are short, textual changes...
 nothing data intensive.</p>

            I had already turned off all the mobile data settings, both within the OneNote app and in the system settings, yet it continued to sync over mobile data in the background. No idea why.

            Sounds like it's probably just easier to use Evernote, don't you think? Their app doesn't have this problem on Android devices, it works as is.

<h2>            List View Web Part with Document Library - Downloading Items</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working to create a shareable database of publications with downloadable RIS files for exporting to citation managers. I have gotten to the point where I have a Custom List with details of all the publications, and a Document Library with all
 the RIS files. I've created a LookUp column in the Document Library list so all the information related to the publication will be linked to the RIS file. Everything is working great; when in the 'new' experience of the Document Library, I can search for items,
 select the ones I want &amp; download them all in bulk in a zip file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I add the Document Library to a List View web part, I can only download individual items - not bulk selected items.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Does anyone know a way that the "bulk download" feature that is available in the 'new experience' of the document library can be added to a Web Part?
</strong></span>This would make my database perfect. The 'new experience' library is great, but it can't be stylized as nicely as a Web Part.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sometimes unable to send or recieve mail. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dcskye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sometimes unable to send or recieve mail.</h2>
                    I am not the most technologically minded person so bear with me! This may be a very stupid question.<br />
<br />
I have an Outlook account and also a separate Hotmail account both of which I run through Thunderbird (version 17 I think) on separate computers and until recently all has been well. About a week ago problems started - I was unable to send or receive mail at
 all and now whilst it seems to be getting better the problem has not gone away.<br />
<br />
When I want to send mail a get a window in TB which says 'Looking up smtp.live.com' then I get another which says 'Sending of message failed.<br />
An error occurred sending mail: SMTP server smtp.live.com is unknown. The server may be incorrectly configured. Please verify that your SMTP server settings are correct and try again.'
<br />
<br />
Sometimes this happens and sometimes it doesn't and of course when it doesn't the mail is sent and arrives in the normal way.<br />
<br />
In my limited way I cannot see that anything is wrong with my settings and I have not changed anything - as far as I am aware. I spoke to my ISP and they said everything looked OK and it was most likely to be an outlook problem saying that this time of year
 is when the hackers really go to town and that might be the problem - I was asked to 'ping' the bbc and that worked but pings to outlook didn't.<br />
<br />
Also sometimes when I try to log into my Outlook account Firefox says it cannot find it - not always just sometimes and I don't think has happened to me before.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at your concern, this might be a configuration issue. We recommend that you reconfigure your account again to Thunderbird. Please refer to this link to properly configure your account:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also would like to verify what do you mean with "when I try to log into my Outlook account Firefox says it cannot find it." Are you referring to the error message "Account does not exist?" If not, please provide us the exact error message you received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>We have to consider several causes why you were not able to send emails such as:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>A. Mail Client Settings.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>User might&nbsp;not be able to&nbsp;send or even receive emails in a mail client due to incorrect settings. Mail client is an application to a computer used to access and download emails from the online account such as Microsoft Outlook or Windows Live Mail.
 For this reason, please reconfigure your account by following the settings of the link below:<br />
<br />

</span></b></p>
<p><strong><span>B. Mail rejected by recipient's server.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If you're unable to send an email to a specific recipient, Hotmail will be sending you a notification that contains information why it won't be able to send the email. H</span><span>ere are some examples:<br />
<br />
1. Mailbox Not Found, Invalid mailbox, User unknown:<br />
2. Mailbox unavailable: <br />
3. Mailbox full or Quote Exceeded: <br />
4. Host unknown, Domain Lookup Failed: <br />
5. Message too large</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Moreover, if this is happening to a specific domain (or all&nbsp;ends with the same email addresses), then it is possible that there is an issue with their server or domain provider. You might need them to contact through other means and let them know the
 issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To ensure that your account filter settings are not causing incoming email not to be delivered to your account, I suggest that you visit this link:<br />

Sounds like you have either the Parent or Child link set incorrectly. Select the Subform CONTROL (not the open the subform itself) in Design mode and check the Data tab to make sure the link fields are set correctly.&nbsp;

            <p>Link fields are correct. When barcode is entered or name selected the correct data appears on the sub form, but all my efforts to have that data saved to the table that the subform is based on fails. I've tried just to access the sub form using</p>

<p>Volunteer_Id is the child link on the sub form.</p>
<p>Everything on the form is working fine; just this problem of not being able to save the data.</p>

            I've heard that saving a calculated field to a table is redundant and can cause problems down the road. &nbsp;Perhaps displaying the calculated field in a report would provide the data you would like.

            <p>Your going in the wrong direction MMegan. This part of the program is only to track workers who come on site. The main form built on a two table query is used to access data concerning the volunteers. When either a barcode is entered or a name selected the
 appropriate info concerning that individual is displayed on the main form. The sub form will display the name of the worker and the day and time of entry. My problem is saving the data from the sub form to the table that it is based on so that I can access
 that data later as to who is all on site, how many etc.</p>
<p>It should be a relatively easy fix but I can't find it</p>

            I see - I had misunderstood, thinking the subform contained calculated data you were trying to save.
<div><br />
<div>The things that come to mind are checking the control source for the date and time control(s) on the subform, and/or using something like the RunMenuCommand &gt; SaveRecord macro, but take my thoughts with a grain of salt - I'm still figuring these things
 out myself. &nbsp;I hope these thoughts help!</div>

            <blockquote>It should be a relatively easy fix but I can't find it
</blockquote>
<br />
Maybe not quite so easy.<br />
<br />
My guess, and it's no more than a guess, would be that the date and time are inserted into the subform by means of the DefaultValue property of the date/time column&nbsp; in the subform's underlying table and/or the control bound to it in the subform being set to
 Now().&nbsp; When you set the DefaultValue property it does not in itself initiate a new record.&nbsp; That only happens when further data is inserted into the row or the default data updated, so without doing this, while the data will show in the subform, no row will
 be inserted into the table.<br />
<br />
Probably the best solution here would be, in the AfterInsert event of the parent form insert row into the referencing table, and then requery the subform to show it, with code along these lines:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO VolunteerLog(Volunteer_Id,DateTimeStamp " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "VALUES(" &amp; Me.Volunteer_Id &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ",#" &amp; Format(Now(), "yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn:ss") &amp; "#)"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.sfcVolunteerLog.Requery<br />
<br />
where:<br />
<br />
VolunteerLog is the name of the subform's underlying table.<br />
Volunteer_Id and DateTimeStamp are the names of its columns.<br />
sfcVolunteerLog is the name of the subform control in the parent form.<br />
<br />
You should set the subform's AllowAdditions property to false as the row is now being inserted by the code.&nbsp; otherwise you'll get two rows showing in the subform, one the inserted row, the other an unsaved new row as at present.<br />
<br />

            <blockquote>and/or using something like the RunMenuCommand &gt; SaveRecord macro
</blockquote>
<br />
If I'm right about the DefaultValue property being used here to insert the date/time value, the problem would again be that there is nothing as yet to save.&nbsp; This often confuses people because when you see a form with default values in it, the natural assumption
 is that there is something there to save.&nbsp; That's not the case, however, until the user begins to enter more data or change a defaulted value in the form.&nbsp; A trick in cases like this is to set the value of one of one of the defaulted controls to itself, which
 does begin to initiate a new record, so it can then be saved.&nbsp; It might be possible to do this in a macro before saving the record, but I think the best solution here is to insert the record with code as I described.<br />

            Thanks ken, sounds like a possible solution. I never realized that using DefaulValue would cause that kind of a problem. I'll remove it and see what happens. Will keep you posted. Thanks

<br />
another problem is i dont know how to use my barcode reader. where am i going to face the barcode? is it on my phone's screen or on the camera?<br />
<br />

<p>@smirclehari - unfortunately you are wrong. The RM in nokia model numbers is in no way related to the radio, radiation or sar.<br />
<br />
It's simply a number assigned to a product before it gets it's consumer name. The exact meaning of the term RM is what is unknown, not what the number is relating to.</p>

    <title>Windows Phone 8.1 Playlists Losing Songs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Phone 8.1 Playlists Losing Songs</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I really have never seen software for a device work so poorly as I have on Windows Phone 8.1.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 7 was good , Windows Phone 7.5 was better Windows Phone 7.8 was great and then the wheels came off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is horrid!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fought with this phone OS for 5 months now trying to sync music and pictures from my PC and have had nothing but wasted time and heart ache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finally able to use WIndows Media Player to get playlists on my phone. I found I had to do it 1 at a time. If you drag all your playlists and try to sync them at once, it puts duplicate playlists on your phone and none of them have all the songs in
 them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did it one at a time, nice and slow (more minutes of my life wasted). And now after playing a few songs on one playlist I open music, slide to the playlists to put more on and what did I see? The playlists that had like 30 or 40 songs now have only
 2 or 3????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>MY GAWD HOW CAN MICRO SOFT EVEN MARKE THIS ****???? WHY DOES IT DO THIS!! HOW DO YOU GET PLAYLISTS ON THIS PHONE SO THEY STAY THERE?????????</p>

            <p>I havent had any trouble moving/syncing my playlists, but I am having the problem where a playlist suddenly looses all of its songs. &nbsp;The playlists play fine for a day or two and then when I look at the list of playlists, they all have 0 or 1 song each.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting does not help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only fix I have found so far is resyncing the playlists. &nbsp;This solution is not good because I usually discover the playlist error when I'm away from home and then I have no playlists.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have seen that too. Mine seems to have started working well after I took out the SD card, though now I am running out of room on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The songs seem to be staying put after I drag them over. It seems to take a long time for them to appear on the phone when they are synced. Also I noticed&nbsp;it doesn't work well if you try to change a playlist and re-sync it. You have to delete it off the
 phone completely and then sync it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep updating your music app and see if it get's any better is all I can say.</p>

            <p>I think I might have fixed it, but wont know for sure for another week or two to make sure it doesnt return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the fix is to disable cloud sync (push ... then settings then turn "connect to streaming music" off). &nbsp;It was enabled by default when I turned my phone on the first time. &nbsp;Since I disabled it, my playlists have remained intact.</p>
