<h2>            Documents are suddenly scrambled with ruler bars and missing text</h2>
                    I have worksheets I have written for my students with tables and text boxes.&nbsp; When I have gone to edit them, there are ruler bars going vertically and the text has turned invisible.&nbsp; I can read the document in the Read View, and I can type on it in the
 edit view.&nbsp; However, I can't see the text to work with it.

            Which version of Microsoft Office (2016,2013,2010,2007) or Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint etc. is it? 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

            Hi Kelsey, are you using Microsoft Office to open these documents?
<br />
<br />If so, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the online repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .
<br />
<br />NOTE: Please be advised if you are running Office 2013 or earlier, before attempting a repair, have your Microsoft Office Product Key at hand, Office may need to be re-activated in some cases       
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your earnest effort for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can connect all kinds of Bluetooth devices to your PC including keyboards, mice, phones, speakers, and a whole lot more. Possible reason why you cannot see the Bluetooth Stack is because the service is
 not started or it is not installed on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start troubleshooting this, we recommend that you perform the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Check if Bluetooth hardware is installed.
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Select Windows Start button then click Control Panel.</li><li>Select Device Manager.</li><li>Check for Bluetooth Radio in the list.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the item is there, your computer has Bluetooth hardware installed and you can safely assume that the software has been set up as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">If your PC didn’t come with the Bluetooth hardware installed, you can easily add it by purchasing a Bluetooth USB dongle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Check for Bluetooth Service</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows logo key</strong> +
<strong>R</strong> at the same time. A Run dialog box will open.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>services.msc</strong> in the run box and click
<strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p>3. From the Name list, locate<strong> Bluetooth Support Service</strong>. Right-click on it and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Change the Startup type to Automatic and click
<strong>Start</strong> button to start the service.</p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Apply</strong> then
<strong>OK</strong> button. </p>
<p>6. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uninstall then Reinstall the Bluetooth Device Drivers</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key</strong> at the same time. A Run dialog box will open.</li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> in the run box and click <strong>OK</strong> button.</li><li>Expand category Bluetooth Radios, right click on one Bluetooth device and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. (If you see more than one Bluetooth device under this category, uninstall them one by one.)</li><li>After uninstalling the drivers, update the driver.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can go to your PC manufacturer’s website to download the latest Bluetooth driver. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the system version that you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>I downloaded a free Bluetooth adaptor, which said I should uninstall the Toshiba Stack from the programmes list, and reboot the computer which I did.&nbsp; But when I tried to install the new software it wouldn;t go any further than "Looking for Bluetooth Adaptor"&nbsp;&nbsp;
 and a link to report Hardware configuration, which came to 99 pages!!&nbsp; I have downloaded and saved it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Bluetooth Radio in the list at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the bluetooth icon that was in the little system tray on the task bar has disappeared as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked in C:\Toshiba\ &nbsp;&nbsp; and found two folders, one&nbsp; Drivers and the other info, in the info is a file ENO.TAG.&nbsp; In Drivers is MSBluetooth Monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have made a bit of a mess!</p>

<p>If Bluetooth Devices item is not present or it has disappeared from Device Manager, this may occur if Bluetooth driver is outdated, missing or corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix the problem, you can try to update Bluetooth driver by manually going to the manufacturer's website of your computer, and search for the most recent and compatible driver for your device.</p>

            I went to Toshiba web site and downloaded Bluetooth stack and installed it.&nbsp; I now have a Bluetooth icon showing on my computer, but the computer still cannot find any bluetooth items, I have mobile phone and the speaker; it still says No Connection.&nbsp;
 Windows support says go to Control Panel, select <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> then
<strong>Add a Device</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no Hardware title or Hardware and Sound, and under the Sound Title menu there is no option to 'Add a Device'.&nbsp;&nbsp; So much for Windows support!!<br />
In control panel Bluetooth Local COM it says the Bluetooth device is not ready. Both speaker and mobile phone bluetooth are on.&nbsp; I have run out of ideas now.&nbsp; Although whilst I was on the Toshiba site, as it was so incredibly complicated and time consuming
 to get to the downloads, I downloaded everything I could see that might relate to the Bluetooth, just in case there is more needed!

<p>Do you have a desktop/tower computer or a laptop?&nbsp; Most desktop/tower computers do not come with Bluetooth capability.&nbsp; If you want Bluetooth for these computers, you have to buy an inexpensive Bluetooth receiver (which is
<strong>NOT </strong>something you can download).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the serial number of your computer, or at least its specific model designation?&nbsp; See

<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite Pro. 5 years old, but I found the right software from Toshiba and they knew the serial number of the laptop when I put it in, (ZC103420R) and told me the purchase date!</p>
<p>I have a wireless router, called technicolor provided by the broadband people, and I remember someone trying to connect the Bluetooth a few years ago, and gave up and so did I !&nbsp;&nbsp; But now I have been given this wireless speaker and can't use it.&nbsp; It would
 be nice to have the BT facility on the mobile, but I can manage with that as I use a cable to move photos over.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am on Windows 7, it has always had a bluetooth icon on it, until I started meddling the other day (but that's what old ladies do - meddle!).</p>
<p>F + F12 turns wireless off and F + F8 turns it back on.</p>
<p>Do you want to know anything else ?</p>

<p>Do you now have the Bluetooth icon showing in the notification area (near the clock display)?&nbsp; If it's not there, it may be hidden, so click the up-pointing triangle to the left of the other icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Bluetooth icon, if you click on the icon, you should see a menu with "Add a device" as well as "Open settings."</p>

<p>
</p><p>Depending on how long ago "the other day" was, you might see if System Restore can put things back they way they were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, type System Restore into the Search box, and press Enter.&nbsp; Choose a date just before you did whatever it is that you did to lose the Bluetooth icon, but don't go back more than about a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, if after you do the restore you don't like what's happened, you can "undo" the restore by going back to System Restore and selecting the "undo" restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming the above doesn't work ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you purchased your laptop in the UK.&nbsp; Is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll take your word for the key combinations that turn wireless on and off, but I couldn't find a reference to that in the User Guide for your laptop.&nbsp; I would have expected that F12 (alone, without simultaneously pressing the Fn key) would turn the wireless
 on and pressing it again would turn it off.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also couldn't confirm that the specifications for your particular model include a Bluetooth adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, if the "wireless indicator" light -- the right-most light on the front edge of the computer -- is lit (amber), then whatever radios the laptop has (wifi and Bluetooth) should be on.</p>

<p>Yes I do have a Bluetooth icon in the system tray, its not blue, but red. When I click it says Bluetooth Manager, followed by No Connection.</p>
<p>I have already done a System Restore, as I made a restore point before I uninstalled the Toshiba Stack.</p>
<p>Yes I bought the laptop in the UK in 2013, and it has been very reliable.</p>
<p>I have not used those key combinations before, but it was told me by the Toshiba web site today.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried the F12 one and it switched off the internet connection, but when I clicked it again it did not come on.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I tried the F8 and it came back on.&nbsp;
 A bit odd.</p>
<p>If I want to disconnect I click on the bars on task bar and click disconnect, and to reconnect do the same thing.</p>
<p>Yes of the 3 lights on the front of computer the right one (amber) is on and the middle one which is on/off switch for computer, and the left one shows power is connected (the battery is old).</p>
<p>In Device Manager under Bluetooth it shows Bluetooth USB Controller-14 from Toshiba.</p>
<p>Further down the same list under System Devices it lists Bluetooth ACPI</p>
<p>I have done a search for Bluetooth Adaptor, it took a while, but nothing showed.&nbsp; I can't find Bluetooth Radios either.</p>
<p>No I have not had any warnings show up.</p>
<p>I very much appreciate your patience, thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What does this mean? Why does it keep occurring without reason? My computer will allow me to sign on to Firefox but will not stay functioning on Chrome. I can be using Chrome for emails etc. and it will just lock up and do nothing and the above message shows
 ever so briefly.</p>

</p><p>I have installed Skype for Business (for Office 365 MSO 16.0.11629.20192 - 32bit) and when I start Skype my status is "Away" automatically. I did change my status manually choosing "Available" but it changes automatically to "Away" around of 15-20 seconds.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Also...
<br />
<br />Launch an Office application such as Microsoft Word
<br />Click File &gt; Account &gt; Update options
<br />Click Check for updates
<br />
<br />Still not working....
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time. Do not worry, will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you see an issue where modern OS elements like the Start Menu, Cortana, Microsoft Edge, Settings, Notifications<span>&nbsp;
</span>are non-responsive, use the following steps: </span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open an Administrator CMD window.&nbsp; If you can’t find a way, use these steps:</span><span>
</span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press CTRL+Shift+ESC to open Task Manager. </span></li><li>
<span>Click File &gt; Run New Task </span></li><li>
<span>Make sure you have a check mark beside “Create this task with administrative privileges”
</span></li><li>
<span>Type CMD</span><span> </span>
</li></ol>
</li><li>
<span>Type the following commands at the CMD prompt: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color: rgba(155, 0, 211, 1)">sfc /scannnow</span><span>
</span></li><li>
<strong><span>If EITHER command does not show a good outcome</span></strong><span>, we need to stop and repair Windows. We have 3 options:</span><span>
</span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Go Back: If there are other significant issues, or if the customer is not sure of using Windows 10, Go Back. The plan from there will be to clean up the configuration to prepare for an upgrade.
</span></li><li>
<span>Reset: If possible, remove Antivirus/Sec Software and perform a Reset (keeping data and settings). Customers will need to reinstall apps with this option.
</span></li><li>
<span>In-Place Upgrade: If the customer is unwilling, we can try uninstalling the Antivirus/Sec Software and try an in-place upgrade. We should set expectation.
</span></li></ol>
</li><li>
<span>If the above commands both completed and show no remaining issues, run these commands:
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">powershell<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(155, 0, 211, 1)">Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span><span>
</span></li><li>
<span>Check to be sure this command ran, showed a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.
</span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be an larger problem with Windows 10.&nbsp; Try again.
</span></li></ol>
</li><li>
<span>Check to see if the issue is resolved. </span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>If not, restart the PC.In this case try as a new administrator user account.
</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the new user also fails, go up to the steps for “3. If EITHER command does not show…” above. We need to repair Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>have you tried a Disk Cleanup of System Files ?</p>
<p>After the first scan look for a System Files button on the lower left...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing... There may be a large amount of space being reserved for system use in hidden folders...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance... PageFile.sys, HiberFil.sys, and SwapFile.sys...</p>
<p>The folders are usually empty, but the space is shown as used...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PageFile is additional memory overflow space should it be needed..</p>
<p>HiberFil.sys stores the machines settings and open files during Hibernation, and is also used for Windows fast Startup feature...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what my machine with a 128GB SSD looks like with hidden files shown.. You will see about 32GB in hidden files...</p>

    <title>Changing Windows 10 User Directory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandon_478  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Windows 10 User Directory</h2>
                    I'm trying to sync files in a reference manager between two computers using a symbolic link with Dropbox, but in order to do so, I need to have the Dropbox paths in both computers be the same. Unfortunately, when I installed Windows 10, I did a fresh install
 on one computer (which set the user directory as the first five characters of my email address, C:\users\b****), and kept the files and settings on the other (which kept my full name as the user name, C:\users\Brandon). However, it would appear that I don't
 have any ability to change this; I even tried making a new account, but I cannot create another account with my first name. Any suggestions to fix this? Thanks!

<h2>            talk of a ban on mw3</h2>
                    
<p>There a lots of story in the paper today about banning mw3 in the uk because of the tube crash in the new trailer. I love how people think they have any chance of banning a game like this, the same happen with mw2 airport level all it did trying to ban it
 was give it more press and help make it a bigger seller.</p>

<p>A short term fix is to downgrade back to version 8.10, they are available here:</p>
<p>https://repo.skype.com/deb/pool/main/s/skypeforlinux/</p>
<p>You will need to uninstall current version and repository (to temporarily stop upgrade) before installing older version. Don't attempt unless you know what you're doing.</p>

<p>I installed version 8.10 by downloading from the Index you provided and using the Deb installer and find it</p>
<p>successfully installed in Synaptic; but when I launch it, it is again version 8.13 Who does this magic?</p>

            I'm guessing you didn't uninstall 8.13 first. You may need a package manager to fix this so may be better to wait until a new version is released.

<p>For anyone elses info, I just checked and the repository is reenabled every time you install one of the older versions so you need to:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- uninstall current version</p>
<p>&nbsp;- remove repo</p>
<p>&nbsp;- install old version</p>
<p>&nbsp;- remove repo (again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a fix is out simply redownload current version and it will take you back up to date.</p>

<p>Are you having this problem with the mic that come with the One or a 360 mic with the adapter? Either way, I can't find a solution to this ANYWHERE. I've looked everywhere I can think and it never helps. It always works the day before, then I join someone
 the next day and everything's fine until I try to talk. </p>
<p>P.S. I don't have Destiny for the One, so I don't think that's the problem.</p>

<p>They are collecting data on this over on the Console subforum. However, this should not have happened in the first place. Half of the second most important part of our gold subscription is utterly gone. This is something that testing really should have picked
 up on since it is wasting consumer's money. </p>

<p>Same issue ever since March 5th I think. It was working perfectly fine the night before. All of a sudden I could only hear people and others couldn't hear me. I've gone through about 11 different forums to find a solution. Bought a new adapter to hook up
 a different gaming headset, that didn't work either. I'm about done with this. Can't communicate with my teams. HELP US FIX THIS!</p>

<h2>            Gravelord Servant&#63; What&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I finished Darkroot Forest and killed the wolf, joined the forest hunter covenant but gave up after getting just 1 kill out of many. I continued with my journey and finished Blighttown and decided to try my luck with defending the forest before trying
 Sen's Fortress or going into the Catacombs. I invaded a player and failed, I returned to my world and put down a white soapstone to get some co op when all of the sudden, I get a message "<span><em>Disasters are gone after the defeat</em> of the
 Gravelord <em>Servant"</em></span> HUH?!?! So I go to a bonfire when all of the sudden it says I am being summoned (I figured it was the white soapstone I put down), but then I get a message about a "master world" and "returning to your world" before anything
 happens. What's going on?</p>

<p>It'll be a white sign that is large and has black outline on it. &nbsp;It'll also move around. &nbsp;It follows where the gravelord is standing in their own world. &nbsp;When you stand over it and press A, it will ask if you wish to invade the gravelord's world. &nbsp;I suggest
 you do it that way. &nbsp;If you use a red eye orb, you can still invade, but you may invade someone else instead.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that's not correct. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure it does move, and that I've seen one move. &nbsp;It's discrete movement though, in that it's in one spot for a while then moves based on the movement of the gravelord if I'm correct.</p>

                    <p>Why does Microsoft make it SO DIFFICULT to SIGN IN?</p>
<p>Previously I used my Outlook account but after that I couldn't and distracted me with SKYPE and so on.</p>
<p>Also why does Microsoft not accept my USERNAME and wants me to use a username of its choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These difficulties just to sign in is MOST IRRITATING.</p>
<p>Can things be simplified please??</p>

<p>I already have a Outlook account with a proper password (PW) some months ago but when I wanted to return to Community months later, I typed that PW but a message said it seems it is being tampered with [I forget the exact word used] and suggested another.
 So I tried a variation of it. I thought that was it but then I got some info about Skype and that I could use another email with PW. But I wasn't interested in Skype and I was being unnecessarily distracted.
</p>
<p>Then came another problem: they wouldn't accept my choice of username. And no matter what I chose, they said it was already taken which was impossible. At that point, I gave up and have tried today after a couple of months to sign in to Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not use my Outlook account but another email but my original username for this email was rejected and when I changed, they ignored my choice and insisted I use one they offered and that's how I came to end up with edray_943, something I would never
 pick myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if I can return to my Outlook account and change my PW&nbsp;<em>and have a username of my choice.</em></p>

    <title>Intermittent lag spikes while Xbox game streaming to PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shyvai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent lag spikes while Xbox game streaming to PC</h2>
                    
<p>All of my devices are connected via Ethernet to a switch, switch is connected to the router, router is then connected to the modem. &nbsp;My Xbox, Windows 10, and Xbox app are all current versions. &nbsp;I can stably&nbsp;play games on my PC, I can also stably play games
 on my Xbox. &nbsp;The problem is when I play Xbox games via the Xbox app on my PC. &nbsp;Everything runs fine for the first hour or two and then the lag spikes start. &nbsp;At which point I cancel and restart streaming and the lag spikes occur every couple of minutes until
 I reset the console or the whole system including the networking equipment and PC which starts the whole cycle over again from the beginning.</p>
<p>Of note, this follows the same pattern as the app crashes that seemed to have been fixed in the latest update. &nbsp;Also, the lag spike cycles are present on the Beta version of the app as well, the beta app is also the current version.</p>
<p>Any ideas or further information I can provide?</p>

<p>No, I am not using third party firewall or anti virus. &nbsp;Windows fire wall is active. &nbsp;Windows defender is also active and now back to running with real time protection turned on. &nbsp;I had tried to run it with out real time protection as I have read it can
 cause conflicts but lag spikes are present with or with out it. &nbsp;Also, windows defender likes to turn back on real time protection without asking, probably after updates?</p>

<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Can you also try streaming on a lower quality? You could also file feedback from the app, but the quality setting will tell us some too.</p>

<p>Sure thing, for reference I stream at high, I thought the instability might be a stream quality issue and haven't streamed at very high in a while. &nbsp;As soon as I get a chance I will switch down to medium and see what happens, I will do it on the standard
 app.</p>

<p>I Just played for a few hours at medium streaming quality without incident. &nbsp;Not quite sure we can call that significant yet but it is promising. &nbsp;When I have longer to play I will switch between streaming qualities and see if that affects the occurrence
 of lag spikes.</p>
<p>That said, any clues on possible fixes or at least what might be the culprit?</p>

<h2>            how to determine which of the 130 windows updates for windows home basic sp 2 are important to me</h2>
                    <p>with the help of the Answer Desk Level 2, i just repaired my hp compaq presario pc, 512MB, 32 bit&nbsp;with windows vista home basic sp 2.&nbsp; while reinstalling MSE and its updates i froze up and upon reboot was able to change wupdates to let me chose which to
 install.&nbsp; as i know its only the beginning as only a handful did install initially, i want to determine which of the 130 important updates and likely 200 more subsequently, are important for me&nbsp;to install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>as i gained 4 GB in my C drive&nbsp;and wish to perserve as much as possible of the 106 gb free i've got now,&nbsp;i don't want to be forced to update things like the trial office i won't use.&nbsp; unfortuately the updates&nbsp;are&nbsp;not listed by date of release, they are mixed,
 i even found one in the middle which said it was released today.&nbsp; How do i determine which to install and which to hide?&nbsp; i thought i'd do a few a day and try to observe changes to my programs and processes, but if i can do that, will i be able to uninstall
 the unnecessary, or just hide the subsequents? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and more&nbsp;urgently now,&nbsp;should i start say 5 from the top, or the bottom?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>with the help of the Answer Desk Level 2, i just repaired my hp compaq presario pc, 512, 32 with windows vista home basic sp 2.&nbsp; while reinstalling MSE and its updates i froze up and upon reboot was able to change wupdates to let me chose which to install.&nbsp;
 as i know its only the beginning as only a handful did install initially, i want to determine which of the 130 important updates and subsequents are important to me&nbsp;to install.&nbsp; as i gained 4 GB in my C drive&nbsp;and wish to perserve as much as possible, i don't
 want to be forced to update things like the trial office i won't use.&nbsp; unfortuately they are not listed by date of release, they are mixed.&nbsp; How do i determine which to install and which to hide?&nbsp; i thought i'd do a few a day and try to observe changes to
 my programs and processes, but if i can do that, will i be able to uninstall unnecessary, or just hide the subsequents?

Are you stating your system has 512GB of memory/RAM and 32GB of drive space (total?!)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You should install all non-optional updates.&nbsp; The optional ones are... Optional.&nbsp; The others - you should install them for security and stability reasons.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
The updates are *not likely* the biggest user of your drive space.&nbsp; In the case of a 32GB drive - it is possible your full Windows Vista with SP1+SP2 and all post SP2 updates could approach 10-15GB total, likely the lower end of that scale.<br />

            <p>thank you shenan for taking so much time to give me so much good advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;i apologize for the scetchy details as i rushed my question off before returning to work and did just edit it a little.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; this is hopefully the end of&nbsp;a long journey you don't want to hear the rest of, but if your curious, click on my profile here and the tech net forums to get a rough idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;i currently have a TOTAL of 6 updates right now with four failed as my system froze up while either finishing the repair or while reinstalling Microsoft Security Essentials thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;i know if i install them all, i have up to 300 more coming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>5.</em></strong>&nbsp; when i catch up again,<strong><em> i know i will primarily only be installing optional updates (i too get a kick out of "optional") because that is where my "Definition Updates for Microsoft&nbsp;Security Essentials" are located.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; in addition to routine disk cleans and defrags, adjusting my virtual memory, and employing readyboost from a flash drive, currently i primarily use msconfig, the task manager, the resource monitior and the control panels system performance and administrative
 tools to observe, uninstall, disable, pause, delete, delay,&nbsp;start, stop, pause or restart&nbsp;unnecessary programs, processes, services, apples, no appelets...&nbsp; of course it is difficult to track dependancies and all my efforts probably necessitated the repair
 although upon the initial reboot ms.net framework v 4 was the only thing reported to be in need of repair.&nbsp; someday i will come back to the tools and services you suggested to learn some new tricks if possible&nbsp;and i thank you again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; but right now, i really need to know more about <strong><em>the order of years of updates, how they are&nbsp;loaded in the update queue,</em></strong> and if i'll be able to identify which come en mass to all vista operators, whether or not their underpowered
 packages can support them or not and if so, will i be able to identify them in the info panel without painstakingly researching each one.&nbsp; for example i don't need&nbsp;the trial or to purchace office, sync, silverlight or powershell i think, make or play movies
 or manage my meger desktop in 3D,&nbsp;and have hidden&nbsp;such updates in the past.&nbsp; i've seen cumulative updates and
<strong><em>wonder if there truly&nbsp;is a cumulative update</em></strong> for every category i can choose, instead of just installing this 130 now and then another 75 next reboot and than&nbsp;40 more and then 20 and only 15 the next week....until i get down to primarily
 only the "optional" MSE updates again.&nbsp; ie: &nbsp;all security kbs, all vista, all .NET frameworks, all media etc. &nbsp;right now i can chose to update ie 7 which i think its reverted to.&nbsp; wouldn't it be better to just go download&nbsp;ie 9 again and not updating 7 at all?&nbsp;if
 not i wonder how many ie 7 updates i have to download before one of these updates, programs or sites prompts me to do just that again, update to ie 9, and then its updates i'm sure.&nbsp;
<em>isn't that a waste of space?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; i wholly agree, with underpowered systems especially, less is way more. &nbsp;thats why i'm not rushing this, i don't want what i can't use or support or will become obsolete with the next check for updates.&nbsp; and i know there will be more stuff to manage
 and its&nbsp;on the way if i install them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; <strong><em>are there any links to truly ESSENTIAL truly cumulative updates</em></strong>, be they recommened, important or optional, dating back from&nbsp;the service packs to present?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps. i recently updated or checked all my drivers with the device manager.&nbsp; presently i only have 5 start ups, 4 more than i started with but still not bad, my processes with nothing open went from ~52 to ~39 and&nbsp;although i've only run them once since finishing
 the repair last night, the resource and performance scan still reports <strong><em>excessive paging</em></strong> and that<strong><em> MSE will not report to the MS security center to notify the MS os&nbsp;that i&nbsp;have MS anti-virus software.</em></strong> &nbsp;but
 there were <strong><em><u>no errors</u></em></strong> in that hour to join the&nbsp;33,000 total items (excluding the 72,000&nbsp;informationals) in the event viewer!&nbsp; some progress at least!&nbsp; i know that microsoft did not build this package but as they partnered with
 hp, i have no choice but to use the os&nbsp;to help make it as functional and secure as possible, in spite of itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks to anyone who takes the time to reply</p>

What are these 6 you have that you think you will have 300 after?&nbsp; I seriously doubt that as long as you have SP2 installed.&nbsp; ;-) While I have little doubt that 300+ updates have been released for Windows Vista (probably closer to 600+), many are optional and
 many were integrated into SP1 and SP2.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I would also recommend running some antivirus solution other than Microsoft Security Essentials.&nbsp; Avast, AVG, Avira, UnThreat, etc. all have free options.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Uninstall any of the 'trials' that got restored when you took the machine back to factory defaults.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Do not use the built-in methods or any third party (not made by the manufacturer of the hardware) products to see if you have the most current drivers.&nbsp; Always go to the actual manufacturer of the product(s).<br />

That's fine.&nbsp; I just think you are going about this a little too precise.&nbsp; You have 106GB free and if you were to install every update you are offered at this point from Microsoft (excluding hardware) - I would bet you stay over 100GB free (probably over 105GB
 - but I may be pushing it there.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
My prejudice against Microsoft Security Essentials is simply the number of times I have had to cleanup systems that were using just it for protection (and the number of times I was cleaning up systems with just it for protection and found items it let through
 that weren't necessarily causing issues... yet.)&nbsp; Not saying the others do not have issues as well - there is no perfect solution.&nbsp; I have just seen LESS issues with the other solutions over the years.&nbsp; My actual recommended combination: eSet NOD32 Antivirus
 (not the suite - just the AV) combined with MalwareBytes Antimalware Professional - a&nbsp;~60 USD + ~25 USD solution for two years and ~60 USD every two years thereafter.&nbsp; I have people I swear TRY to get infected/infested stay clean for years so far on that combination.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are not going to use any of the extras that got installed when you refreshed the machine - get rid of them.&nbsp; Open Office or Libre Office are fine free office suites and will work for most home users just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Just to leave you with one more thing to think about: having free space on your hard drive means very little.&nbsp; It's good to have if you need it - but it sitting unused rarely does you any good.&nbsp; You keep ~15GB free on that drive at all times and it won't
 affect your performance for daily normal use in any way.&nbsp; Everything above ~15GB is just there *to be used*.&nbsp; &nbsp; Same with your system memory (which I would bet is the real performance killer on your specific machine) - unused memory does nothing for you *until
 you need it* and most home users (especially non-gamers) will not be using more than about 2GB at any given time.</p>

            <p>shenan thanks much for your interest and efforts in my case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in 2008 i bought this package from my union where we exclusively used it as an off line typewriter and document saver.</p>
<p><br />
i set it up at home&nbsp;as recommended, automatically downloading all windows updates.&nbsp; for the most part, i&nbsp; only tried to remove a bunch of pre-packaged stuff, tried the norton trial, switched to the free avast only performed occasional disc cleans and defrags
 and as time went on, utilized sys restore quite frequently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>by 2011 however i became increasingly plagued by freeze ups, long, loud humms and black boots. i then copied my files to a flash drive and reverted back to the beginning using the recovery discs.&nbsp; with the exception of one or two updates at that time, i
 installed NO updates for the next two years.&nbsp; apparantly secure enough, with ie 7 i think, i was able to utilize my e-mail, pay some bills, conduct other home business transactions, play ms solitaire and hp games.&nbsp; all i need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>finally in the middle of january 2013, i was no longer able to access my bank account unless i upgraded to ie 9, &nbsp;i believe and as i was on a seasonal layoff, decided to
<strong><em>try</em></strong> to bring this baby up to date again.<br />
<strong><em>i then began my second odessey that is Windows Update of a dinosaur</em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; by the end of january i employed the Answer Desk to help resolve my performance issues among other things and embarked on a crash course in pc maintanece and troubleshooting,
 briefly resulting in # 6 above.&nbsp; in early february level 2 uninstalled avast, disabled defender and installed MSE with another million updates.&nbsp; sometime over the next month i think i observed 238 and 284 updates, know there were many more, primarily the MSE
 optionals, but forgot to check the final&nbsp;total prior to...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>on tuesday 4/23 the repair of home basic was performed with a WV Ultimate sp2 included, 32 bit factory disc and so a clean install without all the hp package junk, right? freezing up with the mse reinstall i decided not to install all and asked for thanks
 again, your very generous help.</p>
<p><br />
yesterday i typed all the details of the 6 sucessful and 4 failed updates and described in groups the 130 important and 3 optionals pending.&nbsp; unchecking everything but the mse def ud, i tried to reply to your letter, which would not send or copy, and using
 start option to install and shut down the one update, i noticed 34 configuring when i left for work.</p>
<p><br />
i was down to only 95 importants when i returned, the ie 7 update was not listed as sucessful or pending and spent all last nite setting up ie 9 for the 4th time this year and couldn't even load my home page.&nbsp; i ended up installing most of the remaining 95
 last night and it took me over an hour to become functional again today (yeah power options disfunctional agian too) with the restart and reload of next batch.&nbsp;&nbsp;as i head&nbsp; to work late again now after this mornings 3 hours, i will try and copy this note pad
 to a refreshed community and send it (sorry no time to reread or edit). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope you haven't lost interest in me yet, i really do appreciate your time and efforts.&nbsp; tbc :0)</p>

            <p>as of this writing (day 4, wu round 3), i've been automatically upgraded to ie 9, for the fourth time this year.&nbsp; i apparently set it up wrong this time as two nites ago my home page loaded inproperly.&nbsp; &nbsp;i could sign in to my e-mail but not manage it,&nbsp; delete,
 compose, check addresses bars&nbsp;etc. missing.&nbsp; i messed with the safety and internet options tools and now the home page only calls up Cox Home Page Location Interceptor.&nbsp; i enter state and my home page loads and recognizes me and though i make it my home page,
 the location interceptor returns.&nbsp; now the page loads correctly but i can not even sign in to my email at all.&nbsp; the last time i tried, i reset options to default, allowed pop-ups to cox, deactivated activeX filtering to site, etc... but to avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>inadvertantly initially, but with relief actually, i have now installed all but 5 of the 130 important and optional updates, while installing the MSE ud and defs twice a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the space available in the&nbsp;c drive has reduced 1 GB per day, starting with 106 and now 103 GB free.&nbsp; you are right i'm sure that i the lack of free space in my d drive&nbsp;at 889 MB of 7.08 GB is at the root of my performance issues but i again have a long way
 to go, to redo all you suggested in your first letter, in order to regain the performance prior to the repair.&nbsp; currently it is painfully slow and unresponsive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the upside i think i will have many fewer updates to endure this time around because the repair came with the service packs included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the 5 i have left and are researching need or cumulatives for are:</p>

            <blockquote>my available in the&nbsp;c drive has reduced 1 GB per day, starting with 106 and now 103 GB free.&nbsp; you are right i'm sure that i the lack of free space in my d drive&nbsp;at 889 MB of 7.08 GB is at the root of my performance issues but
 i again have a long way to go, to redo all you suggested in your first letter, in order to regain the performance prior to the repair.&nbsp; currently it is painfully slow and unresponsive.</blockquote>
Your D drive will not matter in terms of performance as with your given setup - it is unlikely to be anything more than a recovery partition and unused by daily activities of your operating system/you.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
The root of your performance issues is the 512MB of memory.&nbsp; It's that simple.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; You want to have 2+GB of memory.<br />

            <p>always been confused about that.</p>
<p>aren't gigs larger than megs in the byte world?</p>
<p>but then how could i have more free than capacity?</p>
<p>Memory (RAM) 512 MB,</p>
<p>C: 105GB free of 141 GB</p>
<p>(up again, must have lost my new factory restore point or one day of errors in the event viewer maybe)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as D: being 889 MB free of 7.08 GB capacity. MGs obviously smaller right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>underpowered has been repeated to me over and over, i understand i need more memory, but i know i can get it working better than it is, as i have, both with and without updates.&nbsp; i knew the repair would neccessitate a revisit to my setting etc...but i did
 not expect to be this dysfunctional from the get go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>back to researching powershell as i keep getting:</p>
<p>WIE&nbsp; dialog box with</p>
<p>yellow ! and blue box reporting object errors everytime i'm able to sign in to e-mail or change pages, even moving around on this site as well.</p>
<p>today i still couldn't get in to mey e until i again deactived activeX filtering and&nbsp; it still won't load my home page.</p>
<p>now i'm considering reloading ie 9 again and downloading ms fixit to just reset ie settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as i don't use outlook express&nbsp;/ windows mail? because i had found it more difficult to use than cox and i don't wish to manage 2 accounts as deleting/saving/even opening in one didn't do so in the other
</p>
<p>(last time i tried 5 years ago? maybe with older os);</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i still haven't updated live essentials or the junk e-mail ud above, though may be i should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any thoughts on Powershell and Silverlight?</p>
<p>could my new performance issues and errors be related to not updating/reinstalling them yet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks again and please don't give up on me yet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there may be an app in the future that allows you to wirelessly extend your desktop using some VNC magic, such as iDisplay:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.getidisplay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.getidisplay.com/</a> .</p>

<div><br />
<div>The Surface with Windows RT does not have a video input and so it will not work as an extended Monitor for other devices.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All of those are great ideas. I will pass the suggestion along.</div>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>Firstly, do you mean if we can create response groups as the feature in Skype for Business server side? If so, after doing some researching, I found no official article says that it’s feasible to create response groups when using Skype for Business Online
 services. So we don’t have a dedicated plan including the feature. Given the situation, it’s recommended you submit feedback to our related team via the link
<a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273497-skype-for-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273497-skype-for-business</a>. Customers’ constructive ideas will help better our products and services. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>If I misunderstood the response groups you mentioned above, please provide detailed information regarding the feature to let us better understand the situation.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Aaron</p>
