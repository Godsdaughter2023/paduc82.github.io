<h2>            EMAIL NOT EXISTING&#33; URGENT HELP NEEDED&#33;</h2>

            Thank you for the answer! SO there is definitely no way possible to even log on to this email now? I only need to go onto it i don't need any previous emails.

<h2>            Emails from my websites server not reaching Hotmail, Outlook and Live email accounts &#40;no bounce backs&#41;</h2>
                    <p>We have a busy jobs website in the UK that sends out emails to users such as notification emails, job applications and account activation links etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently changed servers this week, which means we have a new IP address. &nbsp;Since our server move any email sent out by the website to a&nbsp;Hotmail, Outlook or Live account doesn't reach it's destination. &nbsp;It doesn't even bounce back, it just doesn't get
 delivered. &nbsp;All emails sent to non&nbsp;Hotmail, Outlook or Live email accounts are being delivered just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've never had any problems with the site sending emails to Hotmail, Outlook or Live email accounts on our previous servers and when we contacted *** Email address is removed for privacy *** informing them of the problem they informed us the new IP address was NOT on
 any block lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have followed up on Microsofts initial response over 24 hours ago, but are yet to get any help on the matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the nature of the site we are getting lots of messages from users wondering why they are no longer receiving emails, so we're looking for a resolution ASAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned before, nothing has changed on the site technically apart from the IP address, but Microsoft claims that the IP address isn't on any Blacklists, so we can't understand why all of a suddens emails from the site don't reach these accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone on here experienced such a problem or can advise on anything we might have a to do to our DNS to fix the problem.<br />
</p>

<p>Thanks<br />

<h2>            If you&#39;re having trouble syncing your contacts, please read this&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Lately, we've been seeing some users complaining that they are unable to sync their contacts back from the portal to their devices. We are very interested in understanding what is the issue that you're facing. However, most users have not been able to provide
 an accurate description of the problem or how to reproduce it.<br />
<br />
We'd like everyone that is seeing this issue to provide us at least the information listed below as well as any other you may find relevant. This will help us figure out what is going on.<br />
<br />
Please go through each question and send us the answer.<br />
<br />
1. Start the client, go to Menu -&gt; Sync Options. Is "Contacts" enabled (not greyed out) and checked?<br />
2. How many contacts do you have on your phone?<br />
3. How many contacts do you have on your My Phone web account under Phone -&gt; Contacts?<br />
4. Are any of them Archived? (check the "Location" column, they'll show an icon with an archive&nbsp;and a green arrow instead of a phone)<br />
5. What happens when you hit Sync on the My Phone application? Does the operation succeed or fail? What is under the "Details" on the application?<br />
6. If 2 and 3 match, what happens when you create a new contact on the phone and hit Sync on the My Phone application? Does the operation succeed or fail? What is under the "Details" on the application?<br />
7. If 2 and 3 match, what happens when you create a new contact on web portal and hit Sync on the My Phone application? Does the operation succeed or fail? What is under the "Details" on the application?<br />
8. Can you reproduce the behavior you're seeing with Contacts with any other data-type (Tasks, for instance)?<br />
9. Any other relevant details?<br />
<br />
Thanks for doing this. Your contributions will help us improve the quality of the Microsoft My Phone service.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marco.</p>

            The device reaches 60% most of the time and hangs.&nbsp; All other data types backup and restore fine.&nbsp; Sounds like some contacts contain invalid data or picture type or something, I would be more specific but the process doesn't give good error codes that
 pin-point where the problem took place.<br />
<br />
The problem is easy to reproduce, I've tried 5 different roms as well with no luck with this contacts issue.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing I've seen help was archiving every contacts, then restore to phone and sync page by page FROM THE LAST PAGE AND UP, until I hit the same error again. This resulted in me having more of them back, but with over 500 contacts which then turns into
 34 separate pages to go through with no "Show All" or "Select All" options.<br />
<br />
The site needs an export function or some other way to get data from the site in case of emergency.<br />
<br />
As a business user, I am deeply disappointed.

            Hi, Right Hand of Satan.<br />
<br />
This is good feedback. The process you went through (archive all, restore to phone partially and sync) shows that the issue can be narrowed down to a specific individual contact or group of contacts. The fact that you mention that the sync "hangs" at a certain
 point is also a good pointer.<br />
<br />
The best guess right now, is that this could be a contact with an overly large image associated to it.&nbsp;Which contact management application are you using to associate images with contacts? Some of them will allow you to add full blown 5MP images directly from
 the camera without resizing or cropping them. This images can take up a few MBs which means that the contact itself will also take up a few MBs. When you see the sync "hanging" what is probably happening is that one of the large contacts is being transferred
 and you don't see that much progress.<br />
<br />
Can you try to narrow down which contact(s) are "blocking" the sync? Do they have thumbnail images associated to them?<br />
If you leave the sync going for long enough (even if it looks like it is "hanging") will it finish? You can use wi-fi for this so it will be faster. Can you also use a tool like this one (<a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/pocketpc-software/wirelessmonitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/pocketpc-software/wirelessmonitor/</a>)
 to see if data is being transferred when the application looks "hanged"?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Marco.<br />

<p><span>Dear Marco,<br />
<br />
Let me share with you my experience, I have ( HTC Touch Diamond 2, windows mobile 6.1, my phone version 01.01.1720.0000&nbsp;)
<br />
I have 1170 contacts on portal but can't know how much on phone ( there is no option for that ) but i guess less because I found some missing.<br />
when&nbsp;I modify something on phone it goes to portal but not the opposite, at 55% I got " updating # of# contacts ( if I made any changes at the phone side, then it always stops at 60% after sending the data to the portal but not getting them back, the message
 is : downloading changes of contacts ... 1 of # ( currently I'm stocked at 37 ) and stop for a long time, after canceling, the message I receive is : certain files were skipped due to issues, these will be attempted for sync again during next syns and mentioning
 that total size is 10 kb.<br />
This is done many times with the same exact results of data size transfer and number of contacts.<br />
I&nbsp;already deleted all the contacts from the portal with photos as there is no option to delete the photo only but no use.<br />
There are no Archived contacts.<br />
When i deleted some contacts from the portal that are associated with photos the number of contacts that are trying to be sent to the phone decreases but never come back, they were 42 and now 37.<br />
There is no way of knowing which contact&nbsp;which is hangs because the missing contacts are randomly, i guess the portal organize them with a different way, I also tried to delete some of the contacts that I identified which were not received from the portal but
 it didn't work also.</span></p>
<p><span>Please tell me what other things that I can try or ask me if you need any further information.</span></p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Alfred</p>

            Hello Marco;<br />
<br />
I too am having trouble syncing my contacts from the MyPhone website back to my phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Activsync associated with my BlackJack II performed some action that randomly deleted only some of my outlook contacts.&nbsp; Here are my answers to your questions:<br />
<br />
1. All boxes are checked, and Contacts - Calendar - Tasks are greyed out (they are checked)<br />
2. Idk, probably somewhere around 70ish contacts on my phone<br />
3. I have 54 contacts on the MyPhone web account.<br />
4. Um, before today none of them were actually archived.&nbsp; I did though click to archive them today . . .but this did not make any difference associated with syncing the contacts back to my phone.<br />
5. When I hit "sync" on the My Phone application it reads as a successful synchronization, but the contacts do not synchronize back.<br />
6. When I create a new contact on the phone and hit Sync no synchronization of that contact happens.<br />
7.&nbsp;When I create a new contact on the website and hit sync no synchronization of that contact happens.<br />
8. I don't think so.<br />
<br />
I hope you can figure this out!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi Marco,<br />
<br />
It generally takes me 5 or 6 attempts to sync my contacts back with a&nbsp;hard resetted(Wiped) HTC Blackstone, I don't actually progress to syncing I just get an unable to sync error message after a few minutes of waiting.
<br />
<br />
-55 contacts, all with pictures of around 5-10kb.<br />
-1200 messages<br />
- Contacts, Calender,Tasks &amp; Texts set to sync.<br />
<br />
One thing I've noticed that does seem to reduce the number of attempts required considerably is setting my timezone location &amp; City, don't know if that is just a coincidence.<br />

            Dear Sir/Ma'am<br />
<br />
My cell phone and the My Phone website are telling me that my cell phone successfully synced with the My Phone website. However, many of the items that are listed as reoccurring on my calendar and other calendar listings from my cell phone are not in my My
 Phone calendar. I have tried re-syncing from my cell phone and rebooting my cell phone. The problem is that the information is on my cell phone, just not on my My Phone calendar. This was not happening before, but now it is.&nbsp; What could be causing this?&nbsp; What
 is the solution? Any help you can provide would be very useful. Thank you.

            So I had the same problems restoring my contacts back to my HTC Touch Pro after a hard reset. I took one page at a time and set them all top Web archive. I went back one page at a time and set the page to Restore to my Phone. The first page synced fine.
 Did the same with the second page and it hung on the 5th entry. I canceled the sync, counted down on page 2, 5 entries and I marked the 5th one "Web archive". Synced again and the rest synced successfully. I did this for all 8 pages (122 contacts) and found
 3 contacts to be the problem. I recreated these contacts manually on the phone, and deleted the bad ones from the web. Ran sync and it all worked fine. My guess is these were saved with pictures linked that were no longer on my phone. The other contacts that
 synced successfully also had pictures, but these were on the memory card, and thus preserved when I restored the contacts. The ones that failed were using pictures that were on the phone itself and were no longer on the phone since the hard reset/reflash.
 So the problem seems pretty clear with how myPhone handles pictures that it can't find anymore. It just hangs indefinitely it seems. I hope this helps.<br />

            I have a HTC touch pro 2 , win mobile 6.1<br />
<br />
Everything syncs well except contacts.<br />
I have a total of 28 on phone and 8 carried over to my phone contacts web<br />
<br />
New ones added to phone within last week will move over others do not.<br />
Havent tried it the other way (web to phone)<br />
<br />
I was looking for a date stamp in that if the contacts do not fall within a certain time frame they will not move, no such luck..<br />
of the 8 that moved to the web 3 had pics...<br />
<br />
any solutions?<br />

            I'm finding that several of the contacts on my phone aren't getting copied to the portal. Sync doesn't fail -- they just aren't copied. By my count I have 49 contacts on my phone and only 43 showing in the web portal. Doesn't matter how many times I sync
 -- they never get copied over. There's nothing unusual or unique about the contacts that aren't being copied as far as I can tell -- just basic data and no pictures. Phone is a Motorola Q9c with WM 6.1.

            <p>Do you mean what was presented in the <strong>Document Gallery</strong> as the "Label Wizard" when going to
<strong>File&gt; New from Template - Labels</strong>? If so, yes, it has been excluded from Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really did nothing more than going to <strong>Tools&gt; Labels</strong> or clicking the
<strong>Labels</strong> button on the <strong>Mailings</strong> tab of the Ribbon, though... In fact, IMO it was a pointless, more round-about way of getting to a readily available feature :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There also is the option of assigning a keyboard shortcut to the <strong>ToolsCreateLabels</strong> command.</p>

            <p>Yes, the main menu bar at the top of the screen. It begins with the  logo followed by the program name [e.g.,
<strong>Word</strong>], then <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong>, <strong>
View</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of whether using the Label Wizard [not the <em>Avery Wizard</em> which has never been supplied with Office] from earlier versions, the Tools menu command or the Labels button on the Mailings tab, you wind up in the same place. Neither direction
 locks you into anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few minor cosmetic differences in the dialog window but the functionality has not changed in any significant way.</p>

    <title>Lumia 950 - Car Bluetooth and overall Cortana Integration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlong09  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 - Car Bluetooth and overall Cortana Integration</h2>
                    <p>Before buying the Lumia 950, I had the Lumia Icon (928?). I loved it and it worked very well with my&nbsp;2014 Ford Fusion (aka Mondeo) Hybrid Titanium. If I got a text, Cortana would ask if I wanted to read or ignore, it would respond appropriately and was surprisingly
 accurate with its recognition of my words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After buying the 950 and moving to Windows 10, that experience has dramatically worsened. Couple primary issues:</p>
<p>1) like others have stated, Cortana seemingly won't respond to 'Read or Ignore'. Just an awkward silence and then nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Regardless of my choice to read/ignore, it&nbsp;indefinitely pauses&nbsp;my previously played music from&nbsp;Bluetooth.&nbsp;With the Lumia Icon, it would immediately start the music back up going from quiet to loud, elegant and masterfully every time. I think the 950 has
 worked that way once in my 2.5 months of having it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Frequently, the Bluetooth seems to skip out when playing music. Causing short lapses in music's play to then hear it try to catch up a couple seconds later. This is frequent enough that it's extremely noticeable and considering it never happened with
 the Icon is worth noting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) There is no way to disable the text message reading prompt from Cortana without getting rid of her entirely to my knowledge!! This is incredibly annoying when I pick up a date&nbsp;to then hear Cortana shout that my female roommate text messaged me, my new
 date just thinks it's some other random woman!! What the heck Cortana!?! In all seriousness, there needs to be a way to disable this. I made my car (and the Bluetooth channels of rented vehicles) ignore texts but that only worked for the first day or so of
 doing it (drive mode also stays on after I leave my car so it continues to ignore my texts).&nbsp;I also set my phone to Do-Not-Disturb mode but Cortana overrides that. Is it because Cortana knows Ford's Sync/myFordTouch is a Microsoft system so overrides some
 things? This was also a problem with my Lumia Icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Generally unrelated to the previous 4 - my Band2 doesn't connect with Cortana nearly as consistently as the Band1 did with my Lumia 950. I could set reminders with incredible accuracy and consistency with my Band1 and Lumia Icon. I switched to Band2 and
 950 about the same time and have struggled to make the interaction meaningful since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any ways to get around some of these things? I just play music from my other phone for now because I got tired of the bluetooth's music skipping so much. Otherwise the Bluetooth issues are rampant, if we could mirror the Bluetooth experience with
 the Icon,&nbsp;I'd have nothing bad to say and this&nbsp;phone with my a smooth operator.</p>

<h2>            How to disable the &#34;SafeLink&#34; option in Outlook for Mac.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure there are many people pissed off about the SafeLink in Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some point I got an update and ever since then I can not click on a single link within my "trusted" emails that doesn't open a blank google page.&nbsp; This is pissing me off to no end.&nbsp; I never asked for this feature and from what I have heard there is no
 way to disable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions other than to just cancel my hotmail account and move to Google mail which I do have but rarely use.&nbsp; I just want the feature to be turned off!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, if you're listening (DISABLE THIS FEATURE)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Does a SharePoint site that is created when a Team is created in Microsoft Teams become a sub-site for a primary Site Collection&#63;</h2>
                    I am new to working with Microsoft Teams and am in the process of configuring a new SharePoint Site Collection. When a Team is created, does it create its own Site Collection that sits at the top-level in the SharePoint hierarchy, or does it get created
 within an already-existing Site Collection? I would like to make the Teams' sites be subsumed beneath a top-level site but want to be sure I understand what happens before I go through the work of creating them.

<p>Hi Hanihass,</p>
<p>May I confirm whether the drafts were not migrated from you side when perform IMAP migration?
</p>
<p>As if so, we may need to help your troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>1. Are all users’ drafts affected or just a part of them?</p>
<p>2. Is the migration batch statue syncing or synced?</p>
<p>3. For affected users, are all items or part of items in the Draft folder not migrated?</p>
<p>4. Besides the Drafts folder, are other folder folders affected?</p>
<p>5. Let us know whether there are large quantities of drafts affected. </p>
<p>Because if there’re a few, we just suggest manually copy and paste them to their mailboxes respectively since all other data are migrated.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Update query or Macro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamdelaney1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update query or Macro</h2>
                    <p>I have a table named Dues. In the table I have the following fields:</p>
<p>Dues Year - (I enter the year)</p>
<p>Paid - Checkbox</p>
<p>CC - Checkbox (stands for Credit Card)</p>
<p>Month and date - I enter the month and date payment was received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to either run a query or a macro that will add the dues year that I enter. I want a field with a parameter for me to enter the dues year as this entry is entered before the actual year starts. For example during 2018 dues year starting
 in July we accept prepaid dues for 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the new dues year added to the table without is deleting or changing the prior years as I go back 2 years. Each record has for this year 2016, 2017, and 2018. I want to add 2019 when I run either the query or macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried an update query and an append query and those did not seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please tell me what I would have to do to automatically enter the next year when I run/select that query or macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will need some help on what to enter (the design/setup) as I am not very good at update/append queries or macros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>For the life of me, I can't figure out what you are attempting to accomplish. It kinda seems like you want to add one new record to a table for a year that you would enter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would expect a Dues table to have a field for MemberID or something. What are you actually storing in [<span>Month and date]? If you store a date value, you don't need to store a month.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you provide some sample records both before and after your query?</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Looking at the file which you posted to OneDrive in connection with an earlier thread, you don't need a query for this, you just need to enter a new row into Dues via a bound form in which you select the member in a combo box set up as follows:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp; MemberID<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT MemberID, LastName &amp; ", " &amp; FirstName &amp; " (" &amp; MemberID &amp; ")" FROM Member_Info WHERE NOT PaidForLife ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.&nbsp; The MemberID is included in the concatenated value
 for the visible column to cater for the possibility of two or more members having the same names.&nbsp; By restricting the combo box's list to those members who have not paid for life, the possibility of such a member being inadvertently selected is avoided.<br />
<br />
You'd simply enter the year into a text box bound to the DuesYear column, and tick a check box bound to the Paid column.<br />
<br />
To prevent the same member inadvertently being recorded as having paid more than once in a year you should include the MemberID and DuesYear columns in a unique index via the Indexes dialogue opened from the Design ribbon in table design view, as below:<br />
<br />

<br />
</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; If you set the form's DataEntry property to True (Yes) it will only allow you to enter new rows into the table, if this is what you want.&nbsp; The form will not show any existing rows.</p>

<p>hi beheerdervd borne,</p>
<p>from my side, i can reproduce the issue. i added a new domain (mydomain2.com) to my tenant. athough *** Email address is removed for privacy *** was not used by *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or any other mailboxes, i could not use it to create a shared mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=fbb321d3-d5de-42ca-9e09-cdcc3cecafe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dfbb321d3-d5de-42ca-9e09-cdcc3cecafe4" /></a></p>
<p>after further investigation, we found it an expected behavior. although we can use
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** to create a new normal mailbox, this cannot be done with a shared mailbox. as a workaround, you may need to user another alias to create the shared mailbox.</p>
<p>while, if you consider it as great importance, we welcome and encourage you to let us our relevant team know this by submitting
<a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">feedback</a>. doing this will benefit you and other users who have the same concern. we appreciate your time and efforts.</p>

<p>The P3450 comes comes loaded with WM6. There is no WM5 image for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can go back to WM5 if you have the ROM image. The installation would be the same as upgrading.</p>

    <title>AADC multiple forest matching users - &#34;identifying users&#34; page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rick day &#40;rick.day&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            AADC multiple forest matching users - &#34;identifying users&#34; page not showing in AADC setup.</h2>
                    <p>After a company merger, we have two different AD forests with a two-way trust, and a single O365 tenant synced with one forest using AADC.&nbsp; Each AD forest hosts a single AD domain.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most users have an account in both AD forests, but "User logon names" are
 NOT the same.</p>
<p>We are using O365 for Office applications, but not Exchange.&nbsp; Email is totally separate, the only connection is the AD E-mail attribute is used to hold the users email address.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>DomainA --&gt; AADC --&gt; O365</p>
<p>DomainB not synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been asked to migrate the AD users from DomainA into DomainB, merging DomainA user accounts into the existing matching DomainB user accounts, including retaining the sync to O365 for the migrated users.&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually DomainA will be turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using ADMT to migrate the accounts from DomainA to DomainB.&nbsp; &nbsp;The initial migration of a few test user accounts has completed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we can't get AADC to sync the migrated user accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AADC setup has been modified trying to follow the topology "Multiple forests: full mesh" as described in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-topologies#multiple-forests-single-azure-ad-tenant.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Documentation for this setup in AADC shows a "identifying users" page (like this), but we can't get our AADC to show this page.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fgithub.com%2fMicrosoftDocs%2fazure-docs%2fraw%2fmaster%2farticles%2factive-directory%2fconnect%2fmedia%2factive-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom%2funique2.png" /></p>
<p>Note: this page is copied from the documentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want AADC to user match based on the 'Mail attribute', but don't know where to configure it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result is we are getting a "AttributeValueMustBeUnique" error during the sync of the migrated DomainB account, rather than the sync matching that we want to happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;IE 'Mail attribute' is not unique, which we know, because we want AADC to use this
 attribute to match the two user accounts DomainA\user1 and DomainB\user1, and merge them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how we can tell AADC to match based on the "Mail attribute"?</p>

<h2>            Sync contacts MyPhone</h2>
                    Dear Sir/Madam,<br />
<br />
I recently started the MyPhone. I use windows live as account and also on my phone the contacts there are from Windows Live. I know it is a bit double to have them on windows live as well on the myPhone, however after syncing the contacts do not show up on
 the web app of myphone. Is this because they are WL contact?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

            Mr. Middendorp, <br />
<br />
You are correct. The windows live contacts do not sync since they are already backed up. However, this will probably change and you will be able to sync them as the Myphone team announced yesterday they will be integrating Myphone with Windows live Contacts
 and calender.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Word revered back to the previous name of a document</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word revered back to the previous name of a document. I worked yesterday on an application and used the name "cover letter 10-1-18". I opened word today and the documents are gone.&nbsp; The only remaining documents are the previously saved ones i.e. "cover letter
 9-28-18". I'm 100% sure that I saved the documents. I've used finder to try and locate my documents. I've even used the "Go" tad to search through the library of my computer to see if it was hidden somewhere.&nbsp; The other problem is a number of documents are
 now appearing as "~over letter".&nbsp; I know I can fix this by deleting the "~" but I'm not sure why this is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query and we are here to assist you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My guess is that your Mac OS or Wod encountered a crash recently. To recover documents, you may check the below methods:</p>
<p>1. Click File &gt; Recent.</p>
<p>2. Open Finder under&nbsp;<em>"/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery"&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/recover-files-in-office-for-mac-6c6425b1-6559-4bbf-8f80-4f038402ff02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recover files in Office for Mac</a></p>
<p>3. If you have set up<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Time Machine,</a>&nbsp;you can restore your Mac.</p>

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. The steps didn't work but I don't think it is a crash issue. Word has not crashed recently and certainly not in the last week.&nbsp; My only thought is that the document was originally download off email i.e. I had someone edit my cover letter. I'm not
 sure if that created the problem although it had been saved numerous times since then.</p>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your thought may be the cause. I'm sorry for the situation. Currently, my suggestions are as below. Hope they will help in the future.</p>
<p>1. After saving a file, you may check the Date Modified column in Finder. In your situation now, it also helps you recall the past activities.</p>
<p>2. In addition to saving files locally, you may also consider&nbsp;<span>using&nbsp;</span><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive service</a><span>&nbsp;to
 backup files there as suggested in my last reply. We can at least use free 5GB OneDrive Basic Plan.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,<br />
Tina</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word revered back to the previous name of a document. I worked yesterday on an application and used the name "cover letter 10-1-18". I opened word today and the documents are gone.&nbsp; The only remaining documents are the previously saved ones i.e. "cover letter
 9-28-18". I'm 100% sure that I saved the documents. I've used finder to try and locate my documents. I've even used the "Go" tad to search through the library of my computer to see if it was hidden somewhere.&nbsp; The other problem is a number of documents are
 now appearing as "~over letter".&nbsp; I know I can fix this by deleting the "~" but I'm not sure why this is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeff </p>

<p>Tilda (~) files are not "overwritten" renamed files&nbsp; but they are sometimes called "ownership" files that MS Word automatically opens for all Word files you open. They should disappear when you close the session of Word.</p>
<p>Renaming them wont do you any good as the file is only an indicator to allow MS Word to work and they don't actually contain any content as per your working file.</p>
<p>If these files are not being removed when you close files could indicate the file was not closed safely and MS Word did not close correctly.</p>
<p>If the file you had open yesterday is not on the recent list and you cant find them, I think you may have over-saved the previous version. Seen this before even when the user states they did not :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck :)</p>
