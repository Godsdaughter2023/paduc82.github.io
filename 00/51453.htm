            <p>If you have the Windows 7 32 bit DVD, you will need to do a custom clean install. This requires that you either start the installation from within Windows 7 64 bit or boot from the Windows 7 32 bit DVD.</p>
<p>Please note, you should go to the manufacturers website for your computer and make sure that you have downloaded all the necessary 32 bit drivers for your system, since the drivers that are being used now are for 64 bit Windows. You will notice that some
 devices do not work. Also note that if you have 4 GBs of RAM in your computer, this will not be recognized by Windows 7 32 bit.</p>
<p>How to downgrade from Windows 7 64 bit to Windows 7 32 bit<br />
There is no in place upgrade path from from Windows 7 64 bit to 32 bit. This means you will need to backup whatever personal files you have accumulated since you started using your Windows 7 64 bit PC to an external hard disk or burn them to a blank DVD. You
 cannot use Windows Easy Transfer program when migrating from 64 to 32 bit, it is not backward compatible with the older architecture. This means, you will need to copy and paste files into a folder on an external hard disk or thumb drive. You need to gather
 all those application and driver installation disks and prepare to reinstall all of them.
</p>
<p>Obtaining 32 bit Installation media</p>
<p>If your computer came with Windows 7 64 bit preinstalled, then you will need to contact the manufacturer of the computer about obtaining a alternate recovery Windows 7 32 bit disk set to reinstall Windows 7 on your computer. The manufacturer might charge
 a small shipping and handling fee.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers will include the ability to choose either 32 or 64 bit Windows 7 at installation time. This will require that you boot into the Recovery Environment, most manufacturers require that you press the F11 Function Key when you start your computer.
 Please consult the documentation that came with your computer about how to reinstall Windows 7.</p>
<p>If you bought a retail box license (upgrade or full version) then you should have both 32 and 64 bit DVDs included in the box.</p>
<p>If purchased a digital download of Windows 7 from the Microsoft Store, then you will need to go to the Microsoft Store website (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com</a>), log in with your store account, select
 Download Options and select Windows 7 32 bit and proceed to download.</p>
<p>If you have an Anytime Upgrade license, you will need first reinstall the base Windows 7 32 bit license, activate it then do the Anytime Upgrade to the particular edition and then reactivate again.</p>
<p>Starting the Installation<br />
Boot to the Windows 7 64 bit desktop, insert your Windows 7 32 bit DVD, click Run setup.exe when the Auto Play dialog appears. If you want, you can also boot from the Windows 7 32 bit DVD and also do a custom install. Its just that, it’s a bit more elegant
 when you simply boot to the desktop and start the installation from there.</p>
<p>Click Yes when the User Account Control window appears</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Unlike the Windows 7 64 bit disk, you can start the installation from within Windows 7 64 bit because the Setup program in Windows 7 32 bit is a full 32 bit application.</p>
<p>When the setup menu appears, select the custom (advanced) option, select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 32 bit. Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. It is still recommended you do a manual backup, because you might explicitly format the drive during setup which will delete all information on the drive. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers. Persons running Windows Vista 64 bit, can also use this method when contemplating whether they should upgrade to Windows 7 32 or 64 bit. If you decide to go the other way around by migrating from Windows 7 32 bit to 64 bit, the same principles apply
 with some exceptions. You can use Windows Easy Transfer to backup your personal files and settings and you will need to boot from the Windows 7 64 bit DVD to start the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

            <p>Much 32 bit software runs on Windows 7 x64 [I run Office 2007, for example, and that is a 32 bit application].&nbsp; It's just a matter of finding out for each desired piece of software whether or not it is compatible with Windows 7 x64.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 Your first point of call is the Win7 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Compatibility Center</a>.&nbsp; This might say yes, no or only on certain conditions being met.&nbsp; Note that there are separate results for Win7 x32&nbsp;&amp; x64.</p>
<p>2 Next, go to the software producer's support site.&nbsp; Look for statements about Win7 compatibility - you might find definite answers, update / upgrade requirements&nbsp;or simply advice about how to go about it.</p>
<p>3 You can also search the internet for solutions - several incompatible applications can be made to run completely or partially.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;If you want to try&nbsp;to install something that is not fully compatible, study this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Make older programs run in this version of Windows</a>&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>5 If you have Win7 Ultimate edition then you also have the ability to install XP mode [a virtualisation mode].&nbsp; You can learn about that in Windows Help &amp; by searching this forum.</p>

Hi, MS doesn't really sponsor clans or either teams, not that I know. Also you're responding to a 7-year old thread and probably is goint to get locked, please use the forum wisely.

<h2>            Clean Install Windows 10 Pro on new Dell 7586 &#40;Feb 2019&#41;</h2>
                    I've searched for a clear way to do this-no luck. All semi relevant information was not recent. I'd like to do a clean install on a Dell laptop with no additional software. Anything I may decide I need I could always just download from Dell.&nbsp; I'd like
 just Windows 10 Pro and any required drivers. I know there's probably something hard-coded into the BIOS that may have to be dealt with and getting the drivers installed as well.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi dcell,
<br />
<br />A clear way to clean install Windows 10 Pro is to use the Media Creation Tool. Be sure you save the drivers (you can download them from Dell indeed) to the same flash drive, so when it comes time to reinstall drivers, you have quick and easy access to them.
<br />
<br />Any built-in measures to clean install Windows do not exist, a clean install is done by external means (as in not a reset, refresh, restore, etc).
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows by using the Media Creation Tool, here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You will need a flash drive of 8 GB or larger in capacity.
<br />
<br />Let me know if there's anything else, good luck.

            I wonder if the system would boot after all that with the essential drivers being native in Windows. If some, I would guess I could go to Dell's site and run the driver/download app and get the actual Dell drivers.

            Yes, It would boot that would not an issue. Just go to Dell's site and run the driver updater.

            Hi dcell, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, and then just install the essential device drivers from the support page for your device on the Dell website and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Before you proceed, make sure you have activated Windows and backed up your data . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Windows 10 Pro - FSUTIL VOLUME DISKFREE Output - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c.g.miller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - FSUTIL VOLUME DISKFREE Output</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running Windows 10 Pro (Version 1809 OS Build 17663.316).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently run into an issue that I am hoping to find a workaround for. A Windows Update within the last month or two has changed the output of one FSUTIL Windows Utility, which is resulting in crashes with proprietary legacy software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>At my workplace, we have a legacy system that uses a customized bundle of Apache+MySQL+Tomcat to provide a web interface for some systems that we install on customer sites. We have this system installed on our workstations here at the office in order to
 test and develop them in-house before deployment. The system in question is legacy; the company that supported it is no longer around, and while I have access to the partial source code for some of the application, I do not have enough to recompile it, meaning
 that I cannot make any changes to the application's functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Tomcat application starts up, the proprietary code runs a check to verify that there is a minimum amount of free space on the disk, for logging and other purposes. The way the application determines the amount of total free space is implemented
 in the following way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Execute the command 'cmd.exe /c fsutil volume diskfree C:\ | find "Total # of bytes"'</p>
<p>2. Split the output at the ":" (colon) character, take the second value, trimming the output of whitespace before and after it. This effectively takes the value part of the output, disregarding the colon and everything before it in the output line</p>
<p>3. Convert this do a Long (Java) using the Long.parseLong() method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works with no issue in previous versions of Windows 10 and Windows 7 - the output for the 'cmd.exe /c fsutil volume diskfree C:\ | find "Total # of bytes"'&nbsp;command looks like this:</p>
<p>Total # of bytes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 1985612570624</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per the code, it would end up converting the String value of "1985612570624" into a numerical value, and everything continues without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, sometime in the past month or so, my Windows 10 has updated, and the output of the 'cmd.exe /c fsutil volume diskfree C:\ | find "Total # of bytes"' command looks like this:</p>
<p>Total # of bytes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 1985612570624 (1849.25GB)<br />
</p>
<p>The "(1849.25GB)" part of the output, something that has changed between the FSUTIL.EXE build 10.0.17763.1 (the one on my workstation), and the FSUTIL.exe build 10.0.17134.1 (the FSUTIL.EXE application on a coworker's Windows 10 machine) that has added in
 the GB calculation in the output. As the code in the legacy application does not take that into consideration, it ends up throwing an error (NumberFormatException in Java, as the output is directly passed to Long.parseLong()), and the application will not
 start, rendering the application unusable on my workstation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What I am looking for:</span></p>
<p>As I am unable to modify the application source code (because I cannot recompile it), and as I cannot contact the company that would support it, as they are no longer around to contact, is there any way that I can "roll back" or modify the FSUTIL utility
 to output with just the byte count, without the GB calculation? I have attempted to replace my FSUTIL.EXE file in the C:\Windows\System32 folder with the older version that my coworker has, along with the FSUTILEXT.DLL and other files that showed up in a Dependency
 Walker. None of these were successful in doing what I needed; they either threw errors or output nothing at all. I have since replaced all files back to the original ones included with my build of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the FSUTIL utility to output the raw number of bytes WITHOUT the calculated GB after it, like the previous versions did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I cannot roll back to a previous version of Windows, and any updates that I have uninstalled from the Uninstall Updates menu has not resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am worried that if there is no solution for this, when my coworkers' workstations end up updating automatically (as Windows 10 forces updates eventually), we will no longer be able to perform work on this system in the office, as we are all on Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            Hi c.g.miller 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />You can get an older copy of Windows and install and then stop the updates so it does not update.
<br />Below is a link to get previous builds of Windows, it is safe.
<br />Then another link on how to stop windows updates.

<p>If I am understanding correctly, it sounds like I would be reinstalling the entire Windows operating system. Would you be able to confirm that?<br />
</p>
<p>Additionally, would you be able to provide a link to a valid Windows installation through a confirmed Microsoft download mirror?</p>

<p>Would there happen to be a solution that could involve file replacement or downgrading without an entire reinstall of the operating system? Due to licensing of other proprietary software used and the time required to set everything back up, reinstalling
 the OS is typically the very last troubleshooting step we take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any combination of files that I could pull from the version of Windows 10 that a coworker has with the FSUTIL utility functioning as expected that I could replace on my machine to give it the intended effect?&nbsp;</p>

            That I don't know cause I am not familiar with how the utility functions.
<br />It is not that easy to copy an app from one machine to another unfortunately.
<br />And no way to downgrade the existing windows machine.

<p>That's because the default setting of Windows 7 is to hide extensions for known file types. Turn that off and you'll be able to rename the file extension.</p>
<p>(In Windows Explorer do Organize-Folder and Search Options-View)</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm not familiar with the .ai Illustrator file type, but are you sure that you can simply change the file extension to convert to a .pdf document?</p>
<p>I looked for some information about this and found a ton of free&nbsp;.ai to .pdf conversion utilities.</p>

<p>Please double check if the Home button is being routed to Gamebar instead of Steam etc. For example, open notepad, press Win+G to bring up gamebar, you can temporarily choose Notepad as a game in the popup, follow the prompts, and choose the Gear icon for
 settings in Gamebar. There should be an option there to bring up Gamebar on pressing the Xbox Home button, my suspicion is that is turned on, if you turn it off, then Steam and other programs will see the Home button.</p>

<p>I have the same problem that the home buttons stopped working for the gamepad.......after the TH2 Update of Windows 10 got released.</p>
<p>Already made a thread in the nortmal MS Forums as i think it is some driver problem (gamepad only is shown as xinput compatible device in the device manager and not as Xbox one Gampad.....in the gamepadmenu to calibrate it of the wireless adapter it shows
 correctly) but as the guy there said that i should ask here too...</p>
<p>That is the original thread btw. as i dont want to write it all down again</p>

    <title>Stuck on Black Screen with Cursor during Windows 10 Upgrade from 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reasonedtraveler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck on Black Screen with Cursor during Windows 10 Upgrade from 8.1</h2>
                    I'm upgrading to 10 &nbsp;from 8.1. At approximately 35%, the display goes black. The installation continues and a few reboots occur, then nothing. If I move the mouse around, the cursor will appear on the screen, but all else remains black. &nbsp;I know that the
 install has completed or, at least paused because the computer will go to sleep if I don't do anything, but will wake upon a mouse click or a keystroke. The screen remains black, with just the mouse cursor visible.<br />
I have attempted to log into safe mode, to try rolling back the graphics card driver, however, when I press the key to enter safe mode or safe mode with networking, the computer restarts as if it is going into safe mode, but then quickly restarts again and
 takes me to the black screen with just the mouse.<br />
Using recovery mode, I have been able to restore my previous install (Win 8.1). I've gone through this process 3 times since the release and I am out of ideas and quite frustrated. &nbsp;I've uninstalled the Nvidia GeForce Experience, my antivirus software and neither
 helped.<br />
My PC is an Alienware X-51 R2 with 2 TB HD (300+ GB free) and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX645&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for the quick reply. The upgrade switched the output from the NVIDIA graphics card to the Intel display on the motherboard and set the system into dual monitor mode. That made my montor the "#2" monitor, which was black, giving the appearance of no
 output. Connecting a cable to the motherboard output to my monitor and switching the display mode allowed me to complete setup. I was then able to restore my settings to a single monitor using the graphics card and not the Intel graphics.</p>
<p>

    <title>No Audio Detected from HDMI Cable&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No Audio Detected from HDMI Cable&#63;</h2>
                    My monitor is an ASUS VG248QE and I use a HDMI cable to connect it to my PC. It already has built in speakers and until yesterday, I've had no problems with the video or audio, but for some reason, now Windows says it that no speakers or headphones are
 plugged in. The video is fine. I've already tried unplugging the HDMI cable and checked if the monitor's volume was muted. I've tried uninstalling the audio driver and installed the newest version. I've already been to the device manager and it says that the
 Realtek High Definition Audio is working properly. I've never used any other device besides the built in speakers to hear my computer so I can't set a new default. I can't connect my monitor and PC using a DVI and PC Audio cable because those ports are being
 used by my Xbox. I cannot arrange the wiring because of the lengths of the cables. Plus, I already know that my sound card supports HDMI Audio since it was working before. I don't think it's my monitor because I turned on my Xbox

    <title>Xbox One is becoming very tedious&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bendotcom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One is becoming very tedious&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Last night I hit my best clip on CoD ever, exited to record it to show my friends I proceed to shout "Xbox Record That", a couple of minutes later I get a confirmation notification that the clip had been recorded, so when the game finishes I proceed to upload
 so I can watch the clip back. . . BUT NO!!! I get an error message saying "clip was deleted or never recorded", at this point extremely annoyed, I start to play the next game and I hit another clip I want to record so I repeat the "Xbox Record That" only to
 have the exact same thing happen again, in fact my xbox has failed to record any clip I have wanted in the last month!</p>
<p>I fell in love with my 360, never really liked playstations, I bought an Xbox One on day one giving MS the benefit of the doubt after a horrible announcement, I bought it solely because I hate PS pads. To be honest the whole Xbox One experience thus far
 has been nothing but disappointment for me. The Xbox One was supposed to be an all in one entertainment system: Can I watch films from my own digital library? NO! I have to sign up to an MS subscription or rent through them. Can I listen to my own music collection?
 No, I have to sign up to an MS subscription! Can I watch TV through my xbox? Yes, but only if I have another £100+ box to connect to. The Xbox One user experience is horrible, I can't send a message see what friends are online etc in between games because
 the apps wont load in the minute or 2 before the next game starts. It takes an enormous amount of effort to get a party working, half the time I can't join, the chat cuts out all the time and most of the time it won't let me join games with friends without
 having to restart the game/console. The kinect is so hit and miss it is more of a hindrance than a convenience, it hardly ever sees me, I have never had a pleasant experience using kinect when I am playing with friends in the room, it wont recognise us, it
 will link controllers to the wrong account and cant be sorted unless all pads are turned off and accounts signed out. MS built a console around kinect, a device that is intrusive and works very inconsistently and now they have done a u-turn, admitted it is
 bad and are now cutting off the teather to kinect.</p>
<p>I expected from day one for the console to be able to do everything the 360 can do and then some, in the last few months there have been countless times I have regretted selling my 360 for the Xbox one, based on userbility alone, for a next gen console that
 thought should never cross my mind. Yes it's great that MS are coming up with monthly updates to improve the system, but the fact remains they are expecting a gold medal for doing things that should of been there from the get go, even after 6 months of updates
 we are not even close to the functionality the console should of had from day one, it just isn't acceptable. I don't want to play it any more, every time I turn the thing on I feel like I am having to jump through so many hoops for the simplest of things,
 it is frustrating waiting a few mins for an app to open so I can join a party only to be told that the app isn't working. I feel like it is just a marketing machine, it feels like they are more bothered about trying to find sneaky ways of advertising to me
 than making an entertainment console that is actually ENTERTAINING, not a constant headache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 360 was an amazing gaming machine, it established itself as the standard, it gave MS the perfect platform for the Xbox One to take the gold, the recipe was there and what did they do with it? they threw it all down the drain. At this point the only thing
 that can save this console is if MS came out at E3 with another console, as the One was built from the ground up around failed ideas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>@ the OP, </p>
<p>Sorry to hear your experience isn't the best but and you will hear it time and again, if you look back to the Xbox 360 when it was first launched and look to what features etc were added as time went on then surely you will see it's the same for any console,
 as time goes on, it will improve, these things just take time.</p>
<p>Like mentioned in the thread, I had issues of game clips not recording, a hard reboot/power cycle of the console solved it.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Yep, I've clocked up around 70 hours in the co-op arena lol</p>
<p>Back on topic, Of course everyone is different, overall though I've been extremely impressed with the Xbox One, I mainly buy a console for the games and so far it hasn't disappointed. Sure it isn't perfect, on a few occasions I've had to hard reboot it to
 solve a few issues and there's a few things I'd like to see added but over time, updates, I'm confident it will just get better and better.</p>

<p>I'm in the same boat as the OP. Xbox One is a buggy mess. This was Microsoft's generation and they got complacent and lost focus. They were mesmerized by Nintendo's novelties and brief success. So, the last 4-6 years, MS did not focus on people who buy games.
 The hardware is everything for a console, just as it is for a gaming PC. Hardware is the last place to pinch your pennies.</p>

<p>I've never tried recording gameplay so I'm not sure if it works. I dont even know how to use it. I don't have voice commands anyway.
</p>
<p>If I do something cool, does it automatically record it or do I have to stop what I'm doing and then start recording in hopes that I do something worthy of recording?</p>

<h2>            Mail App Windows 10. E-Mail Properties</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>I would like to know if it is possible to open the properties of an e-mail. More specifically I can only see the "from" e-mail address and the "to" e-mail address. But i can not display the "respond to". And more generally I can not display the properties
 of an e-mail (all the IP-Addresses of the servers that the e-mail went through).
</p>
<p>Is it possible to display those features? </p>
<p>Thank you </p>

    <title>Xbox 360 S 250 GB internal hard drive wont work . - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acw110  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 S 250 GB internal hard drive wont work .</h2>
                    
<p>So 5 years ago for Christmas I got an Xbox 360 slim. It came with 4 gigs on it. And throughout the years I've relied on flash drives to download my games. It's worked perfectly, until now. &nbsp;This Christmas I thought I'd buy myself dragon age Inquisition,
 especially I was such a fan of origins.</p>
<p>I purchased the game For the 360 and Once I got home i attempted to play it . The game said it needed around 7 or so gigs to install .it also mentioned it needed a hard drive .so i brushed it off as if it were nothing and tried to install it onto my trusty
 flash drive. It didn't even make an effort To install the 7 gigs required to play the game .it needed an actual hard drive with at least 7 gigs. Keep in mind I only have 4 gigs on my slim. I purchased a 250 gig hard drive off of Amazon, and i purchased it
 "new" apparently . Because let's be honest not everybody has a hundred and twenty dollars just laying around to go spend at Gamestop for a measly 80 gig hard drive .it arrived today January 26 2015 . The first thing I did was turn my console off and then unplug
 it I gently slid it in .then proceeded to Go into the system settings and looked at storage .there was no 250 gig hard drive in storage even though the hard drive fit perfectly into my 360 . I removed it a couple times and put it back in , that didn't work
 .I then proceeded to look up a tutorial on how to install the internal slim hard drive . And I did everything properly before looking up the tutorial . One odd thing I noticed was, in the tutorial When inserting the hard drive there was a click. There was
 no click for me. Almost as if something is blocking it from going all the way into the 360. I've looked all over for an answer to why this was happening .the xbox support guys always just say "its your hard drive. Heres another support link" and then that
 support link sends you another link to where you can spend another $120 . There's been plenty of people this has happened to and you're telling me nobody at Microsoft knows what to do? well you see I don't want support from them guys .I want to hear from other
 game players people who have to go through this rubbish all the time just like me . Does anybody out there have a solution, or a fix for this other than spending more money on something that is exactly the same as what I have right now ? Even if I have to
 bust my xbox open and solder the thing .or the hard drive your choice anything that works right? I'm very sorry that this is so long for anybody who is reading this .the post that I have seen about this have not been very descriptive about the situation .
 And therefore the support guys will say stuff like "try a flash drive" &nbsp;well there's the problem for you , with the direction video games are taking flash drives apparently will not be enough for the future .</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is the risk you run when buying from anyone else but a Microsoft authorized dealer.
</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, you can't just buy any HDD and throw it into your console. Whoever you got it from, may just have swapped the enclosure and thrown a regular HDD in there, which is why your console is declining to recognize it.</p>
<p>Get your money back. If everything is snug and it doesn't work, return it.</p>

<p>Please post a link to what you purchased.</p>
<p>If this is an official hard drive, it sounds like the drive is defective and needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>If this is an unofficial hard drive, it sounds like it is incompatible with the system.

<h2>            Xbox One will turn on only sometimes</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox has developed a power on problem. Sometimes it does turn on, but most of the time the lights flash, it start making noises and shut itself down moments later. It varies in time. Sometimes it almost goes for the green screen with the logo, other times
 it just give up a second after i press the turn on "button"</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I tought it was the power brick, cause it was making a loud noise, but I bought a new one and still get the same problem. I also tried turning it on with all acessories unplugged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really don't know what else to do</p>

<p>Hey Bernardo thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest checking out our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/console-wont-power-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One X, Xbox One S, or original Xbox One console won't turn on</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>troubleshooter. Now if the issue
 persists after that troubleshooter has been done we suggest to turn the console on to the troubleshooter page (on the console) and do a soft factory reset from there:</p>
<p>If you're unable to get to the dashboard&nbsp;at all to do the factory reset you need to access the Troubleshoot screen by using these steps&nbsp;:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Unplug the network cable if you're using a wired network connection.</li><li>Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.
</li><li>Wait 30 seconds, and then plug the power cord back in.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>BIND</strong> button (located on the left side of the console) and the
<strong>EJECT</strong> button (located on the front of the console), and then press the
<strong>Xbox</strong> button on the console. </li><li>Continue holding the <strong>BIND</strong> and <strong>EJECT</strong> buttons for 10-15 seconds.
</li><li>Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the
<strong>BIND</strong> and <strong>EJECT</strong> buttons after the second power-up tone.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also try a different power outlet (no power strip)</p>
<p>From there you can reset your console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>

En la mayoría de juegos te piden pruebas como capturas, videos etc para verificar la denuncia&nbsp;y jugadores con mal perder o troles no perjudiquen al resto... pero aquí con dar a un par de botones, te joden después de ganarles, y llevo ya mas de medio año intentando jugar a algo multijugador. La paciencia tiene un limite y estando Steam, la verdad es que no se por que sigo perdiendo el tiempo con los juegos de Microsoft.</p>

<p>Because it violates the code of conduct. </p>
<p>Don't create a gamertag, profile content, Avatar action, Avatar content, or in-game content that other users may be offended by.
<strong>This includes, without limitation, anything related to or suggestive of</strong>: profane words/phrases,<strong> topics or content of a sexual nature</strong>, hate speech (including but not limited to racial, ethnic, or religious slurs), illegal drugs/controlled
 substances, or illegal activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all you do is change it around, they'll continue to issue forced name changes. If you have too many, then they will ban your account.</p>

<p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information you have provided on your post, we may need to do further investigation. For us to assist you better, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes on your device?</li><li>Were there any external devices connected to your computer when it happened?</li><li>Have you recently installed any software?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

            Of your three queries I can only admit to having loaded in some free anti-virus and sound recording programs. I have Avast also but I don't have much faith in it. This is a new Pavillion running Windows 10. Are you saying it's worth deleting all recent
 additions? I did not get the closeness in time that I was expecting to see from a bad program.

            It&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>
