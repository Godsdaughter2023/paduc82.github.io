<h2>            Purchased movie on XBox Video, it is not showing up in library and only plays the trailer</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the extended Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring + bonus content. It does not show up in my video library. I chose to download it. It will only play the trailer when I try to play it. I purchased it on the same XBox I am trying to play
 it on</p>

            <p>Hey there Drew! I'm sorry to hear about the Lord of the Rings issues! That's my favorite movie series of all time so let's see what we can do to get that movie playing for you!<br /><br /><strong>I suggest giving these steps a shot:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage, find the movie, the trailer, and any partial downloads of the movie/trailer and delete them.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your system cache</a>.</li>
<li>Restart your console.</li>
<li>Download the movie again from your <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/view-download-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download History</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Let us know how that works for you and we'll work with you from there! ^_^</p>

<h2>            Powercfg &#47;sleepstudy report shows &#34;Unknown &#91;NONE&#93;&#34; appid which consumes more power</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 10 pro 64 bit laptop (Thinkpad X1 yoga).</p>
<p>My laptop charge is draining fast and when I ran the sleep study report using powercfg command, i found and "Unknown [None]" app id consumes lot of power (see the attached image below). Not sure how to identify which services (background) causes this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>Since the sleep study report could not identify which app is draining the power of your laptop, we suggest running

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggestion on running SFC and DISM. It did had a corruped file and got fixed by the SFC.</p>
<p>After some time, I tried running the sleep study report and still I happen to see the "Unknow [None]" appid in the report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply Jan Del.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to run full scan using virus scanner (i.e. Microsoft windows defender antivirus) but no virus found.</p>
<p>Still facing the same issue.</p>
<p>But found the post from microsoft from another user with the simiar Unknown [none] appid issue. Though it is not looking like a device (Surface pro) specific problem since I am facing similar problem in my Thinkpad X1 yoga.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro3-surfperf/what-does-unknown-none-lossmw-and-othermw-mean-in/e8f2bf48-2860-4398-ac9d-1aefbfa9e31a?auth=1&amp;rtAction=1503250065113&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But in my initial analysis what i found was, this "Unknown [None]" appid of consuming power is very high in battery mode (avg 6000 mW) but in Charging mode (i.e. ~200 - 300 mW ) this consumption reduces drastically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>i.e. in Battery mode this Unknown appid consumes&nbsp;60% overall battery drain compared with other appid but in Charging mode this appid only consumes less than 5% of overall battery drain.</span></p>
<p>Any solution will be of great help.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I think its a problem of my battery because I recently hearing a noise from my laptop charger and while see movies without connecting charger my screen loose correct color for 2 sec and after that color getting correct again(problem
 while playing moveis showed in pic ) and this problem getting happen again and again while seeing movies with battery and sometimes even when in browsing web its happen.</p>
<p>another problem is waking up from sleep random.and like u I see this&nbsp;"Unknown [NONE]"&nbsp; exactly like you and I see this app id does not use any cpu or any thing except loss. I want to know its a problem from any app or battery<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ee11148-9e9b-48ca-b69a-02af4e508af4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ee11148-9e9b-48ca-b69a-02af4e508af4" /></a></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5e21b705-d6af-4320-8f53-3a1f8cbf48b3" title="Mohsen20247">Mohsen20247</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still not clear on why this Unknown appid appears and whether it links to the battery or not.</p>
<p>But what i found is, when I run the laptop in charging mode, this Unknown appid completely disappears.</p>
<p>But continuously charging the battery will bring the life down so I am using Lenovo Settings app and use the 80% Threshold for max charge level, that way I think i will save the battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per "Jan Del" from Microsoft team replied me in this post to check for virus by running antivirus software, but since this Unknown appid doesn't appear in Charging mode i think this may not be an virus related issues, If virus is the case then it should
 have appeared even in charging mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what i gave you (continuous charging) is an work around for this problem, but still we should find out why this Unknown appid appears, either Microsoft or Lenovo team should help us in solving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this partially help. Please check yourself this charing approach and let me know if it helped you.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I purchased the deluxe edition of Call of Duty Black Ops IIII and was supposed to get 8,500 COD points to purchase things in the game but they are not on my account when I play the game.&nbsp; I would like someone to help me figure out how to get what I am entitled
 to.&nbsp; It would be easiest for me if someone could call me at&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed - Personal&nbsp;Information]</strong>&nbsp;and explain.&nbsp; It is extremely frustrating that it is virtually impossible to get someone on the phone to help.&nbsp; We spend a lot of money with your
 company and I have just spent 45 minutes trying to figure how to get through to someone but to no avail.&nbsp; Even when I searched your website, the customer service number on there is not in service.&nbsp; Talk about poor service from one of the richest companies
 in the world.</p>

In this article, we take a look at backing up your files, specifically, we look at backing up manually. Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported. A manual backup is also handy for migrating your personal files to a new PC or an important way to ensure your data is kept safe."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have an issue with the computer stuck on a screen with an error code
</span><span>0x0000005D</span><span>. It can be difficult when something that is important to you does not work as expected. It is pretty simple and we are here to help
 you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get this sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Please answer these questions-</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you run the upgrade assistant before installing Windows 8?</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>What kind of Windows 8 installation did you perform?</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span>What is the system configuration?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What exactly happens when you press and hold the power button? Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span>Is the processor on the computer Pentium 4?</span></p>

<span><span>8)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any other changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue occurs when the processor does not support Windows 8. The processor must support
</span><span>Physical Address Extension (PAE), NX, and SSE2. Most CPUs have support for these features, so if you receive this error, it is likely because the NX feature is not enabled on your
 system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p><span>You can try booting to computer using the System Recovery options assuming that you are unable to boot to the desktop.</span></p>

<p><span>Note:</span> Performing a System Restore will undo any changes made on your computer earlier. You may also lose unsaved information as well. Proceed at your
 own risk.</p>
<p>Make sure you back the data on the computer before proceeding further.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2–</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this error, follow the manufacturer guidelines to enable NX (“No eXecute bit”), or the equivalent XD (“eXecute Disabled”) feature, within the BIOS security settings.</span></p>
<p><span>If the BIOS settings for the NX support option are not available on your system, you may need to contact the manufacturer for updating the BIOS. Note that some older processors
 may not contain these features and will be incompatible with Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Updating and changing the configuration of the BIOS is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3-</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming that you have changed the BIOS settings and now, the CPU is capable of supporting</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 8, I would have you perform a Clean install after formatting the hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 8 should function smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you back the data on the computer before proceeding further.</span></p>

<p>Do you realize the computer in this current state as I mentoned above:</p>

<p>Error Code: 0x0000005D</p>

<p>Essentially&nbsp;my computer is on a loop that will not be interrupted.&nbsp; It always boots to this same screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it be best to use the recovery console and revert to a previous XP restore point?</p>

            Hi; I have exactly the same issue (error 0x0000005D while upgrading from XP Home SP3 to Windows 8). I identified the root cause to be my Bios which is A02 and hence does not support NX.&nbsp;
<div>Can you help me to get my PC to get back to working condition back to WP Home. Thanks.</div>

            <p>From what I found, Windows 8 removes the previous operating system, so there is no going back.&nbsp; No NX, no Windows 8, that simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOAPBOX FIRST:</p>
<p>To Windows 8 Development Team, Product Manager, Brand Manager and anyone else in the Windows 8 Go to Market Planning Team that may read this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be ashamed and embaressed for releasing an Operating System that is so ultimatly dependent&nbsp;on the Microprocessor having NX capability to not check this until after the installation and&nbsp;first boot cycle.&nbsp; I ran the pre-evaluation and this was&nbsp;NEVER
 flagged as a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now My solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, configure computer bios to boot from the CD drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removed my hard drive and connected it to my company laptop via a SATA - USB kit (purchased at Micro Center).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I copied all my files on my root directory I wanted to save to another hard drive or to another partition on the same hard drive (I had 3 partitions which I used on this drive - C:, D:, and E:.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I was satisfied I saved everthing I wanted to save, re-installed hard drive back in my computer, inserted Windows XP disk in cd drive and went through the steps of re-installing Windows XP -&nbsp; it will&nbsp; format the partition which is why you want to save
 all the files on the C: drive partition you want to keep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once completed you now have to go through the Service pack installs, and then let windows updater bring XP fully up to date with all the updates, etc.&nbsp; .Net frameworks you need, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait to install all other apps until Win XP is fully up to date and running fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now start loading apps, games, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is&nbsp;a long process but at the end - I have a really clean operating system and I will not let all the garbage get loaded on my computer as I did before.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means all the browser tool bar add-ons, etc&nbsp; Do you hear this -&nbsp;anyone at Adobe, Google, Bing, this stuff is not worth the space it takes&nbsp;and is a total&nbsp;waste!!!</p>

<h2>            Thanks for the DOWNGRADE&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>How is it called? Experience Update????</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>It's the most worse experience update ever.</p>
<p>Nothing is improved.</p>
<p>Here's my list of things that need to be changed:</p>
<p>-User Interface, give us an option to change the UI to the previous style...the 'old' dashboard was fine</p>
<p>-since the update there is a significantly higher lag while 'multitasking'</p>
<p>-friendlist managing is still worse, bring back the old xbox 360 friendlist.....people send friend request you accept or decline was just the best ever</p>
<p>-or at least allow us to remove unwanted followers (dont get me wrong, i dont want to block people i just dont want unwanted friends or followers without my permission</p>
<p>-language settings still tied to locations, i live in germany but i prefer english, always have to choose another country but need to change it to germany whenever i try to buy a game</p>
<p>-why games in the US store not available for other countries?&nbsp;</p>
<p>-still controller disconnects in the middle of the game</p>
<p>-allow us to set a time for the 'record clips feature' sometimes it records 29 seconds, sometimes 27, sometimes 30.......</p>
<p>-allow us to save game clips on our external harddrive or alternatively in the cloud to prevent them from expiring</p>

<p>THUMBS DOWN for the best DOWNGRADE.</p>

 but I can't get to it. When I start my pc it shows a black screen with a dash Mark in the top left and "B2" in the bottom right corner of the screen it will sit there for about a minute and then shows the graphics card starting a d goes back to a black screen
 with a dash Mark on the right. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;

                    <p>I just recently bought a new computer with windows 10 and set up my email account as instructed. It receives email but will not send. puts the sent message into drafts with an error message. I can't believe Microsoft hasn't got an update for this yet as
 I see this has been an ongoing problem since it came out. Windows 10 will&nbsp;NOT open up the command prompt under administrator as suggested to do the fix from the forum messages , I get an error message for that also.&nbsp; So now what !
</p>
<p>I don't see many&nbsp;answers&nbsp;to other peoples questions on this. </p>

<h3> markstonaha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I changed the password to unlock my computer. It worked once but now it says the password is wrong. I have tried all the solutions I could find. I did not create a password recovery disk when I got the computer. It is a Dell. No matter what I use to solve
 ( starting in safe mode, changing the bios etc ), well, none work. But my windows does not do what the solutions say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, one is to go to the boot priority screen and have a flash or cd checked so it boots with one of these that have a downloaded recovery. When I go to this screen and get the boot priority manager, there is no option for putting in a cd or flash.
 My screen says :</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI Boot.............Windows Boot Manager or +Network Boot.</p>
<p>Secure Boot Enabled</p>
<p>Load Legacy Option ROM</p>
<p>Boot List Option</p>
<p>Add Boot Option</p>
<p>Delete Boot Option</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most solutions say to boot the computer and repeatedly press F8 to get the black screen to open in Safe Mode. That does not work. I can get to the screen that says enable safe mode, press the F or number key associated with that but it just goes tot he password
 screen which tells me the password is wrong. I do not remember if I created an Admin account when I got the computer, but it does not come up on the password screen so I do not think I did. Stupid, &nbsp;but it is what it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really need to get this fixed. I will take any suggestions. I am using my friend's computer right now. Any suggestions??</p>
<p>

            You will need to check if it is possible to perform system recovery by using recovery partition (if it is already there in your system) or a recovery disc. To know more about this, you are advised to contact Dell support using the following link:<br />
<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04</a><br />
<br />
If the recovery is not possible, then you may need to reinstall Windows. To know how to do this, the following link can be useful:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/clean-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/clean-install</a><br />
<br />
Hope this will help you.<br />

    <title>Bitlocker hardware encryption on M500 &#43; XTS-AES 256-bit setting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolfpup3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker hardware encryption on M500 &#43; XTS-AES 256-bit setting</h2>
                    <p>I recently discovered that the november update of Windows 10 (1511) supports a new, better mode of encryption for Bitlocker, namely XTS-AES.&nbsp; I also discovered that you can use 256-bit instead of 128-bit encryption on both the old method of encryption, and
 the new XTS-AES encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a single drive that supports eDrive/hardware encryption with Bitlocker-Crucial's M500.&nbsp; It was working before, but when I set Windows to use XTS-AES 256-bit, it can't get past the test Bitlocker screen...I punch in my password and the computer just
 locks up.&nbsp; I have to reboot, then hit escape to get back to Windows, which tells me the attempt failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what kind of encryption the M500 uses...it's supposed to be 256-bit, but maybe turning on XTS-AES 256-bit causes this to not work?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a setting in Windows to just use software encryption, and maybe doing that, bypassing hardware would actually be better encryption than what the drive does?<br />
</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this, why this isn't working, whether I should switch to software encryption on it?</p>

            <p>Oh wow, seriously? &nbsp;That's great news, as it would explain why it's not working! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have software encryption for all my other drives (including an older Crucial M4 which doesn't support hardware encryption), so I suppose it's no big deal to just flick on software encryption.</p>
<p><br />
Any thoughts on all this? &nbsp;I don't really see a reason NOT to use XTS-AES in 256-bit mode. &nbsp;More CPU utilization, I guess, but who cares?</p>

</p><p>It's an internal SATA drive, which has been working fine under Windows 8.1 and then Windows 10 with Bitlocker turned on (using the drive's hardware encryption)-it's been working just fine until I just turned Bitlocker OFF for this drive, and attempted to
 turn it back on, after telling Windows to use nothing but XTS-AES 256-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just hangs on the Bitlocker pre-boot screen that it boots to to test whether you can unlock it or not, and when I hit escape to bypass that screen, it boots back to Windows and just says it wasn't able to enable Bitlocker. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a TPM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is an issue with hardware encryption in this version of Windows, sounds like just switching to software mode should be no big deal...I would love to kind of know officially that it's a problem though, just so I know what's going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Oh, and I have the newest firmware for both the notebook it's installed in, and the drive (and both were working just fine for hardware Bitlocker, prior to disabling it and re-enabling it after having set Windows to use XTS-AES 256-bit, AND after having
 upgraded to Windows 10 Pro 1511.</p>

            <p>Thanks again...because of your post I was able to search better, and found a handful of threads on Microsoft's site, Tomshardware, etc., that mention problems with other drives with 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just glad to know what's going on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No real downside to using software encryption, I guess...I mean it's slightly slower, uses a little CPU, but for all I know it might actually be more secure than what the drives can do anyway.</p>

            I would be very careful with Bitlocker.&nbsp; A single bit of corruption in either the key or the software renders the entire disk un-readible.&nbsp; I have seen far too many cases of it.&nbsp; Just an FYI<br />

<p>
</p><p>I've been using it for...not sure, maybe a couple years? &nbsp;Haven't had issues yet, so hopefully I'll be lucky. &nbsp;My data's always on at least two drives, and often more, which helps.</p>

<p>Original Title: Where do i type in the administrator password on the user account control?</p>
<p>I'm having user account control problem it says to type in an administrator password but there's nowhere to type it in. I can't access anything on my computer because there is a password. My computer doesn't have an administrator account and i can't enable
 the hidden administrator with the UAC on becuase i can't type in the password. Where do i type it in?</p>

<p>Try a System Restore to when things worked. If you are unable to do that, try logging into Safe Mode. The built-in Administrator account is normally disabled in Vista but if no other administrative accounts exist on the system it may become enabled. If you
 can get into Administrator that way, create an extra administrative account per the recommendations below. Then do a thorough scan for malware.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a></p>
<p>If you are unable to get into the built-in Administrator or do System Restore, please post back for further steps.</p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold">User accounts - Recommended Setup</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">Vista</span> and<span style="font-weight: bold">Windows 7</span> )</span>
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista and Windows 7 are multi-user operating systems with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be
 left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista and Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily
 work and that account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may require more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</p>

            If it's an enforcement action you should get a notification. It's usually around 24- 72 hours. It could be that you're underage. Any accounts under 18 can't upload customized photos. You can try signing out of the app and back in and see if that helps
 too.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have the same problem as the OP. The error happens when trying to install updates to Office 2013 RT on my Surface 2 running Windows 8.1 RT. I have been having this issue for a couple of weeks now I think.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The fix you mentioned (repair the .NET framework) does not work because all the different methods on the Microsoft support webpage include installing software, which is not allowed by Windows RT on an ARM processor.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there any other way to get these updates to install? Some are security updates and having these updates pending prevents me from accessing my corporate VPN, which is quite annoying.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>/Matthieu</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Bloodstained&#58; Curse of the Moon</h2>
                    <p>Are there any plans to make this game available on the Australian marketplace?&nbsp; &nbsp;It is available on the US marketplace, but that is somewhat redundant as I am in Australia.&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems odd that it would be available on the Playstation store here, but not
 Xbox, especially considering the sequel, Ritual of the Night is actually available for pre-order.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to get a copy of Curse of the Moon, but the only way I can seem to find is to somehow switch regions, which I neither completely understand how to do, nor do I believe that that is allowed under the Microsoft terms.</p>

            Its not that hard to switch regions :) You have to buy a prepaid code for the currency of choice and then once but on your account you go into settings locations and change to where you want to access the marketplace. Once your on the right store place
 you just purchase and install the game like you normally would. Hope that helps anymore questions give me a shout on xbox and ill try my best to help you out.

    <title>File Explorer often becomes unresponsive and freezes for several - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_boss_gfc  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Explorer often becomes unresponsive and freezes for several seconds</h2>
                    <p>File Explorer often becomes unresponsive and freezes for several seconds.<br />
A busy cursor is shown. File Explorer and the taskbar ignore any clicks.</p>
<p>Freeze time is usually 2-3 seconds, in severe cases up to 20-30 when many windows and applications are open and there is a high disk or registry usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Fresh installs of windows 10 are also affected. A system with many hard disk volumes and many files are more likely to be affected. Once triggered, any file operation triggers a freeze (even small ones): rename, move, copy, delete, file operations by other
 programs e.g. installing a small program. Frequent file operations, especially those that require elevation are more likely to cause it.<br />
<br />
Having many windows open helps to reproduce it. For example:<br />
1. Multiple File Explorer windows with of various paths (5-10 windows)<br />
2. A few Google Chrome windows with multiple tabs in each, including Facebook<br />
3. Skype<br />
4. Process Explorer when running helps a lot to trigger this bug; screen updates become very slow after some time.<br />
5. Regedit search or other programs that are causing heavy registry usage are also very efficient to trigger the issue.</p>
<p>6. Programs performing heavy disk usage like Windows Update and Defender scan may cause severe freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible cause:<br />
File Explorer is constantly checking for file and folder changes and for registry changes so that it may update the list of files and the navigation tree.<br />
Renaming a folder on the desktop may also trigger that.<br />
The longer the computer has been running, the easier to reproduce.<br />
<br />
Another way to trigger the issue is to enable Restore previous windows at log-on, open many File Explorer windows<br />
and then restart the computer. This can make folder browsing a terrible experience, until all windows<br />
are closed.<br />
</p>
<p>I have seen this issue on every single computer which I have installed and used so far. Presently I am running Windows 10.0.10586 on Intel i7 930 with 20 GB of RAM, 2x3TB disks and GTX 570. I have first seen this issue on a my university computer running
 Windows 8 Enterprise. Windows 7 is not affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious how many people have experience this? And if there is a way to fix it. I suspect it is a design bug within the Windows operating system, because I have reproduced it right after a clean install with only the video drivers installed.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Corruptions in Windows components.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I am able to reproduce this on a fresh install of windows as well as on completely different hardware. Basically any computer I start using ends up like this within a few hours or days. The only solution is to I close all running
 programs and folder windows or restart. But then I can't work if I don't have many folder windows open.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Virus attack</strong>. This computer is free from any viruses.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Driver related issues.</strong>&nbsp;Reproduced on a fresh install with only Nvidia drivers installed. Also reproduced inside a VMware guest. Also reproduced on different hardware. That would make me guess that Driver related issues are not the
 case.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Application conflicts etc</strong>. That could be it, but only if the built-in Windows applications and File Explorer are conflicting with each other, since at the time I reproduced the issue, there wasn't anything else installed.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>I see that you had installed an old build on Windows 10 and I suggest you to download and install any pending updates that needs to be installed on the computer through Windows
 update and check if it helps to resolve the issue</strong>.</span></p>
<p>As far as I know, 1511 (10.0.10586.318) is the latest and this is what I have. I used the&nbsp;media creation tool and provided my serial number to automatically download the latest available build. Then I performed a clean install and installed all updates.
 I have no plans to go for the Insider previews, they are terrible and full of bugs!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>If the issue still persists, you may place the computer in a clean boot state and check if that helps to resolve the issue</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have tried clean boot and it doesn't help. And neither does reformatting and performing a clean install.</span></p>
<p>I have replaced the following components on my computer, and it did not help: main board, power supply, hard disks and all cables. All volumes are defragmented. Windows is installed
 after all these changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I think this could be an issue with windows itself. I noticed that File Explorer is constantly monitoring many files folder for changes and there seems to be some bottleneck somewhere. I think Microsoft should try to resolve this!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I also have Windows 7 on the same computer and I have never experienced any lags or freezes even after 50 days of uptime.</span></p>

            <p>Looks like you covered many aspects, and illustrated nicely. Here are some more ideas anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried running ProcMon? Enable the Duration column and see what's causing delay.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Process Explorer you can view the modules loaded with explorer.exe. Take a note of 3rd party modules there. Or you can see the loaded modules using msinfo32 or by running tasklist.exe /m</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eliminate all .CPL files (non-MS) from System32 and SysWOW64 folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnect external drives to test.</p>

            <p><strong>Here is the list of modules</strong>:</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>3rd party modules in explorer.exe</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">windowmess.dll - this one is mine :) for window snapping, pen scrolling and various other useful features.</span></p>
<p>A few modules from Tortoise GIT, Nvidia, Desktop Restore, Classic Shell, Classic Explorer.</p>
<p>^ All of these are from programs that I have installed and I think we should rule them out since I have reproduced the freezes before installing them.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Disconnect external drives to test</strong>.</span></p>
<p>No external drives</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Performance logging and monitoring is definitely one of the good ways to investigate such an issue. I can't remember if I used Process Monitor on this, but I have performed similar logging in the past. One of my tools injects code in all applications to
 hook window messages. For example if you drop one window near the edge of the screen it will automatically adjust the position to snap. So I already had a way to intercept all messages and it was very easy to force only explorer.exe to print logs to screen
 or a file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my research with Windows 10 Technical preview:</p>
<p>If I hook WH_CBT and WH_GETMESSAGE, there doesn't seem to be any performance impact. However as soon as I hook WH_CALLWNDPROC or WH_CALLWNDPROCRET, even with an empty handler, there was a noticeable slowdown; the number and length of freezes got severely
 increased. This is most likely due to the extremely high amount of messages that are sent to explorer.exe. There is probably some bottle neck and it cannot handle all that stuff that is thrown at it. Performance became even worse when I opened a console and
 started printing messages. Surprisingly however as soon as I redirected STDOUT to a file, all freezes and lags disappeared. This generates tens of megabytes of text logs every few seconds so it wasn't practical as a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another example for message bottle necking: I have a program that converts pen input to scroll events. The pen rate is 120 or 100 and this feels very smooth on Word 2010 and Windows 7. However Word 2016 on Windows 10 can easily get flooded and often freezes.
 So I was forced to cut the rate in half to avoid this. Vertical sync can be dangerous if used improperly and the scrolling in Word 2016 is a terrible implementation! I should make a video on this ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that you mentioned Process Monitor, I ran it and captured over 10 gigabytes of logs multiple times. Unfortunately so long as it is active, my computer keeps running like a rocket :D and I can't get any major freezes. The duration for &gt; 99.9% of the events
 is currently &lt; 300 us. If I get things to freeze and manage to run a capture at the same time, this will probably give us a good lead.<br />
</p>
<p>As soon as I get the chance to capture some interesting logs I will post them. It might take some time, as I work 'till late every day. It is important for me to resolve this issue, since I have struggled with it for a long time, and I can't escape by performing
 a clean install. This is the only thing preventing me from using Windows 10 as the primary OS and I want to move towards writing code for the new technologies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if Windows defender, System Restore, Search indexer, Superfetch or some other poorly written background task are interfering with my work and causing the freezes? I just disabled System Restore since I relay on partition backups. I also found a
 way to disable the&nbsp;Windows Defender Service. I am looking for a way to uninstall it completely to get rid of its drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your nice ideas, Ramesh!</p>

    <title>using ppjoy on windows 7 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merrick davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            using ppjoy on windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>i wanted to know if there was anyway to use ppjoy on a windows 7 home premium&nbsp;64 bit computer. i had it fully working on the same windows 7 version but the hdd died and needed to be replaced. after windows was&nbsp;reinstalled i decided to reinstall the program
 in test mode but whenever i try to make a virtual joystick it fails to install the driver software. going into device manager and double clicking on&nbsp;Parallel Port Joystick device 1<br />
&nbsp;device status says: "Windows cannot apply all of the properties for this device. Device properties may include information that describes the device's capabilities and settings (such as security settings for example).&nbsp; (Code 50)</p>
<p>To fix this problem, you can try reinstalling this device. However, it is recommended that you contact the hardware manufacturer for a new driver."&nbsp; i cant think of what could possibly be diffrent about this install of windows 7 that it wont work.
</p>
<p>so far i have tried: uninstalling and reinstalling it</p>
<p>running the installer in compatibility mode and as an administrator</p>
<p>manually installing the driver software (comes up with a make sure the driver&nbsp;works for&nbsp;x64 systems)</p>

    <title>Out of three desktops &#40;same location on my desk&#41; the Buffalo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jg_903  say:</h3>
<h2>            Out of three desktops &#40;same location on my desk&#41; the Buffalo WiFi adapter &#40;N150&#41; connects instantly on two of them and will not on the third one</h2>
                    So I know the adapter works.&nbsp; The two it works on are a W7 64 bit and a Vista.&nbsp; The problem desktop is a W7 64 bit as well.<br />
<br />
Previously, I'd loaded the drivers onto the other two, put in the password to the router and Voila, instant connections.&nbsp; On the second W7 64 bit, it used to connect every now and then and now not at all.&nbsp; I finally gave up and put in a new hard drive (as the
 C drive) reinstalled Windows (fresh install, things should work right?), loaded up the Buffalo drivers and, miraculously, the adapter worked and connected long enough to download 142 Windows Updates (!!).&nbsp; After all that updating the adapter would not connect.<br />
<br />
I tried copying the adapter settings to a USB thumb drive from the W7 that connects (the one I'm typing on right now) and transferring that over.&nbsp; Autorun would not start up to transfer the settings over.&nbsp; Frustrating?&nbsp; Yes, it is.<br />
<br />
I've tried everything Microsoft Support suggested.&nbsp; Yes, "Device is working properly".&nbsp; Yes, device is "Enabled".&nbsp; I've never seen the "use as default" option when diagnosing the Buffalo adapter.&nbsp; But the adapter remains unconnected to the router that the other
 two connect with instantly.&nbsp; So I did a System Restore back to before all the Windows Updating,&nbsp; reloaded the adapter drivers.&nbsp; Didn't work.&nbsp; After starting up the "View Network Connections" and "Troubleshoot" a hundred times I eventually got, under "General"
 under "Adapter Properties" this:<br />
<br />
"This device cannot start (Code 10)"<br />
<br />
So I shut down the problematic W7 computer, stuck the adapter into this computer and it connected instantly.&nbsp; What else can I do to troubleshoot this problem?&nbsp; Thanks for your time.<br />
<br />

            If the adapter worked to "download 142 Windows Updates" and then no longer works, chances are that you downloaded a driver for it that isn't working properly.&nbsp; Because you have something to compare, do the following on your other Win 7 64-bit system and
 on the problem Win 7 64-bit system:<br />
<br />
Open Device Manager (type Device Manager in the Search box and press Enter)<br />
Expand the Network adapter section by clicking the arrow to its left<br />
Double-click the entry for your wireless adapter<br />
Click the Driver tab<br />
Are the Driver Provider, Driver Date, and Driver Version the same on both machines?<br />
<br />
On the bad machine, click the General tab.&nbsp; Please provide the complete text from the box under "Device status."&nbsp; Do this as soon as you see the message that
<span>"This device cannot start (Code 10)."</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Possible solutions:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Uninstall the device from Device Manager; disconnect the adapter from the computer; reboot the computer; reinstall the device using the CD that came with the adapter.&nbsp; If you no longer have the CD, download the CD image from
<a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.buffalotech.com/</a> and burn it to a writable CD.<br />
<br />
You may not see the device if it's not connected.&nbsp; If you don't see it under "Network adapters," look in the "Universal Serial Bus Controllers" category.
<br />
<br />
You can also temporarily view disconnected devices in Device Manager as follows:<br />
Open an Elevated Command Prompt (ECP) window (type cmd in the Search box, then right-click on Cmd.exe and select "Run as administrator" and respond to the UAC prompts)<br />
In the ECP window, type the following and press Enter after each line<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; devmgmt.msc<br />
When Device Manager opens, click the View menu and select "Show hidden devices"</span><br />
<br />
1a.&nbsp; You may also be able to uninstall the drivers using the CD that came with the adapter:<br />
<ul>
<li>Insert your AirNavigator CD. When you insert CD, AirNavigator Setup Wizard will launch automatically. To launch it manually, double click [My Computer], then your CD-ROM, then [AirNavi.exe].</li><li>Click [Options].</li><li>Click [Remove Drivers].</li><li>Follow the instructions on the screen to remove drivers.</li></ul>
<br />
2.&nbsp; Perhaps Microsoft's <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Windows_USB_diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Diagnose and fix Windows USB problems automatically</a><span> troubleshooter will help.<br />
<br />
</span>Other notes:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>You should not have seen "Device is Enabled" in Device Manager -- that box is in Device Manager in XP but not in Windows 7.&nbsp; Where did you see this message?<br />
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>You may see advice on some web sites to "uninstall <i>every device</i> under the Universal Serial Bus controllers hardware category in Device Manager as part of the driver reinstall."&nbsp; Unless you have a keyboard with a PS/2 (round) connector, DO NOT DO
 THIS.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I suggest that you not use -- at least initially -- the Buffalo Client Manager software.&nbsp; If you have that installed, uninstall it.&nbsp; The CD has an option to do this.<br />
</li></ul>

            Both the "bad" computer and the W7 that works have the identical numbers (Provider, Date etc).<br />
<br />
I went into Device Manager, uninstalled all the drivers, reinstalled (yes, I do have the original CD).&nbsp; When I rebooted I actually had a yellow exclamation mark down in the tray over the grayed out antennas which is farther along than I've been in days but,
 it seems like the computer then actively tries to override that.&nbsp; Meaning, eventually I was back to just a red cross over the antennas.&nbsp; I got as far as telling Windows to connect to that particular modem, it asked me for the password, I gave it, then nothing.<br />
<br />
Yes, I can "disable" or "enable" the device in Device Manager.&nbsp; I did "disable it" then "enabled it" to no avail.&nbsp; If I select the "Troubleshoot" button at the bottom right, eventually I'd get "Windows cannot resolve your wireless connectivity issue".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I didn't have a problem seeing the adapter when it was installed.&nbsp; I kept getting "The device is working properly".&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; After awhile while trying to connect to the router that I connect to on this computer and was on the list on the "bad" one, that possible
 connection eventually disappeared too!&nbsp; It's like there are gremlins in there thwarting my every move.<br />
<br />
I have seen "Device Status" somewhere in my troubleshooting this past week but could not find it today so, sorry, I can't give you those details.&nbsp; I wasn't able to run the Microsoft USB Problem software because, quite frankly, I have work to do and had to log
 off and get back to it.<br />
<br />
When I fired up this computer, I looked at the tray where the blue spinning orb hovered over the grayed out antennas then SCORE! it connected as always.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank god.<br />
<br />
Could it be a problem somewhere in the Bios?&nbsp; Chipset drivers needing updating?&nbsp; In the past I was always a wired internet connection guy so I never knew if the "bad" one would have a problem connecting wirelessly.&nbsp; I can always just go wired again but it would
 be nice to fix this wireless adapter problem.&nbsp; <br />
Remember, this adapter loaded up and works flawlessly on my Vista computer as well.<br />
<br />
I know it's tough for you to give me advice based on what I can relate back to you.&nbsp; Be better if you were sitting right here!&nbsp; I feel the same about Julieanne Kost when I have Lightroom 4.4 questions.&nbsp; Thanks for any help you can give me.<br />

Like the five green bars (Connected).&nbsp; I'll see this when I look up the adapter's "Network Connections" and there's a line of grayed out boxes, the middle of which is the Buffalo Adapter.&nbsp; There will be a red cross next to the five green antennas with "Not
 Connected" written inside the box.&nbsp; Double clicking the box and choosing "Diagnose this connection" gets me (usually) "Disconnect the adapter"--which I've done a hundred times.&nbsp; In the very early stages (weeks ago) that might lead to something happening but
 not now.<br />
<br />
I should say I never see the five green antennae in the tray (on the "bad boy" or this computer) only when the list of connections is displayed when that icon is expanded or like the above paragraph states.&nbsp; But I see the grayed out with the yellow blob a lot
 (on the "bad") on the tray. &nbsp; If I click on that and it says "connections are available" or something like that, and I do actually get into the list of connections available and mine is there (with five green antennas) and I say connect, the antennas in the
 tray then get covered by the spinning blue orb that never leads anywhere (now) sometimes ending up with the red cross over the grayed out antennas.&nbsp; Or worse, no antennas at all but a red cross over some other icon.&nbsp; When I fire up this computer, there is
 about five seconds of the blue orb (while I guess it's "automatically connecting") then five white bars.<br />
<br />
Although when I am fully connected, like I am now on this computer, there are just five white antennas with no blue orb or red x's or yellow blobs---meaning all is good.<br />
<br />
You would think that a full fresh install would have done the trick.&nbsp; After all, the same 142 Windows Updates I put on the "bad boy" are on this computer and this one connects instantly.<br />
<br />
I'm prepared to completely reinstall W7 again and start all over again with this new hard drive in.&nbsp; The old "C" drive I took out because it did exactly what is happening now.&nbsp; If I could fix it that would be best because it has all my photography software
 already installed and updated.&nbsp; But that's another thread, as they say.<br />

            Since installing W7 on a new hard drive is turning out to be no solution at all (for some unknown reason) I'm going to put the old "C" drive back in.&nbsp; It was behaving the same way that this new install is so I might as well troubleshoot it as it already
 has all my software loaded which was a long long process to get to this point.<br />
<br />
I had originally gotten the W7 Install Disc that came with the computer and attempted to do a "fresh reinstall" leaving all my programs in place.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; I had SP1 installed and the Install Disc was pre-SP1.&nbsp; Just uninstall SP1, right?&nbsp; No, couldn't do it
 because I'd run "Disc Cleanup" at various points and the backup files needed to delete SP1 were no longer around (or so MS tells me).&nbsp; I couldn't even delete SP1 from the Command Prompt so was left with trying this fresh install.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll do a search here or start a discussion about how to delete SP1 when all else fails and try the "fresh reinstall" that I attempted originally.&nbsp; Or borrow a W7-SP1 Install Disc and try what I originally tried.<br />

            I put back in the original "C" disc and absolutely no hint of connecting.&nbsp; The network I'm trying to connect to is shown, I click "Connect" the little blue orb turns around and around over the five grayed out antennas down in the tray, I get the message
 "gathering info from this network" (or whatever) then it asks me for the password.&nbsp; I give it, the blue orb continues to spin and finally (as always) I get the message "Windows cannot connect to this network, we give up" or words to that effect.<br />
<br />
So I hooked up an ethernet cable and connected instantly.&nbsp; I'm typing this on the "bad" computer.&nbsp; At least now I can trouble shoot and ask questions about and from a computer that works.<br />

            I don't have much more to add.<br />
<br />
The usual steps for "unable to connect" to a wireless network are <br />
<br />
(1) go into the router's configuration utility (using a computer connected to the router with an Ethernet cable), and (temporarily) disable ALL security (usually, this just means configuring "no encryption," but some folks also have added additional things
 such as MAC filters, time of day filters, IP filters, and the like; those should all be disabled)<br />
<br />
(2)&nbsp; delete the "profile" for the wireless connection on your computer.&nbsp; If Windows 7 is in control (and in your case it may or may not be; you may have to deal with the Buffalo Client Manager), go to Manage Wireless Networks and delete the profile (see image
 below)<br />
<br />
(3) View available wireless networks and attempt to connect to your now unsecured network<br />
<br />
If that succeeds, then you can go back into the router's configuration utility and reconfigure your wireless encryption.&nbsp; Don't add any other "security" features (they are all easily spoofed, anyway).<br />

            I've been wondering what the "Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adaptor" is so I did a search and came up on another Microsoft forum wherein there were multiple complaints about how that "virtual adaptor" seemed to be messing up many computers' ability to
 connect.&nbsp; The solution finally was to either uninstall that Windows Update (not easy to do) or just simply to disable that "virtual adaptor".<br />
<br />
Hmmmm, I thought, I wonder if that's what it is?&nbsp; I went into Device Manager on my W7 computer that does indeed connect wirelessly instantly and saw that "virtual adaptor".&nbsp; "This device is working properly!" crowed the status box on that "virtual adaptor"
 which I still don't know what it is.&nbsp; I disabled it on the working W7 computer (just because I could).<br />
<br />
So I then fired up the W7 computer that will not connect wirelessly (you all know the story) went into Device Manager and...and...there is no "Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adaptor" listed.&nbsp; So I had no option to disable it to see if that helped.&nbsp; Stranger
 and stranger.<br />
<br />
I'm typing this on the "bad" W7 computer only I'm connected using my ethernet cable.&nbsp; So cool to actually use this computer again.&nbsp; If I don't think about it's inability to connect wirelessly my stress level slowly drops to zero.&nbsp; I'm just waiting for the latest
 "Patch Tuesday" updates to come available so I can grab them---wired!<br />

            I've been using the "bad" computer for a couple of days now, hard wired to the modem, been downloading every possible update I can think of (for Windows and for my photo software).&nbsp; It's been wonderful being able to connect--ya know, just like the one
 I'm typing this on only this one is connecting wirelessly!<br />
<br />
I thought I'd do an experiment.&nbsp; I re-formatted the "C" drive I did a fresh install of W7 on (the one where it connected wirelessly long enough to download 142 Windows Updates).&nbsp; Only this time I was just going to install W7, install the Buffalo drivers and
 check out exactly what the settings looked like while it's actually connecting.&nbsp; Then get Windows Updates later and compare.<br />
<br />
But no.&nbsp; The "bad" computer won't even let the Buffalo adapter connect even before all the Windows Updates now.&nbsp; I was dead in the water before I even started.&nbsp; It's a crazy world we live in.<br />
<br />
The "bad" computer has a standard Gigabyte motherboard from three years ago with an i5-750 cpu.&nbsp; The one that connects wirelessly instantly is a Biostar H61MH with UEFI.&nbsp; Can the problem lie within the BIOS settings of the older computer and not with Windows?<br />
