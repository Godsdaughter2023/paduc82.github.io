            Ever so slowly, more information trickles in. So just turn off the option to use the Outlook Today page: R click the root folder &gt; Properties &gt;&nbsp;disable the option in the Home Page Tab.

    <title>Disabling Text Formatting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disabling Text Formatting</h2>
                    Hello community, popping in here to air a few complaints, though I do have a legitimate question. I was on the Legacy Skype, as it served its purpose well, but unfortunately, with Microsoft being Microsoft, it forced the new version on me without my permission.
 I've come to terms with the fact that that tree has fallen, so to speak, but in the version they pushed me onto (12.13.257.0), aside from being a complete eyesore, forces text formatting. In the past, I could either go onto the settings and turn off emoticons/formatting.
 Now, there is no setting regarding formatting at all, period, and the settings list has been dumbed down to the point of confusion for anybody looking for anything useful. On top of that, the @@ workaround that saved my life beforehand has stopped doing its
 job and text formatting will show even with that. Any help before I completely drop Skype or do my best to go back to an older version?

            <p>I don't really understand why you want to remove the quotes. Usually if a formula contains quotes and you wish to copy and paste it then the quotes should remain with the pasted formulas. Or are you saying that the quotes get added when you paste?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you copy the formula are you copying the equals sign with it because if the equals sign is left out then that might cause quotes to be added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post a copy of the formula with the quotes and explain why they need to be removed.</p>

            My next quest has to be "What values are in the cells being concatenated"? I just placed a test string in each cell and was able to copy and past the cell with the formula and it simply pasted the calculated value of the cell in both word and notepad and
 no quotes.

<p>You can upload an example workbook to OneDrive and I will have a look at it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guidelines to upload a workbook on OneDrive. (If you already use OneDrive and your process for saving to it is different then you can probably start at step 8 to get the link but please zip the file before uploading.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Zip your workbooks. Do not just save an unzipped workbook to OneDrive because the workbooks open with On-Line Excel and the limited functionality with the On-Line version causes problems.
</li><li>To Zip a file: In Windows Explorer Right click on the selected file and select Send to -&gt; Compressed (zipped) folder). By holding the Ctrl key and left click once on each file, you can select multiple workbooks before right clicking over one of the selections
 to send to a compressed file and they will all be included into the one Zip file.
</li><li>Do not use 3rd party compression applications because I cannot unzip them. I do not clog up my computer with 3rd party apps when there are perfectly good apps supplied with windows.</li><li>Go to this link.&nbsp; https://onedrive.live.com</li><li>Use the same login Id and Password that you use for this forum.</li><li>Select Upload in the blue bar across the top and browse to the zipped folder to be uploaded.</li><li>Select Open (or just double click). (Be patient and give it time to display the file after initially seeing the popup indicating it is done.)</li><li>Right click the file on OneDrive and select Share.</li><li>Select "Get a Link" from the popup menu.</li><li>Click Copy the link and Paste into your reply on this forum.</li></ol>

            <p>The line feeds in the wrap text fields are causing the problem. The only way to get rid of the double quotes in Notepad is to firstly remove the line feeds from the Excel worksheet
<em><strong>but I suspect that this will not suit your purpose.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove all line feed in excel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a single cell in the worksheet</li><li>Select "Find &amp; Select" on the Home ribbon</li><li>Select "Replace"</li><li>Position the cursor in the "Find what" field.</li><li>Hold the Alt key and on the numeric keypad at right of keyboard type 0010&nbsp; (ie. zero, zero one zero)</li><li>Leave "Replace with" field blank</li><li>Click "Replace all.</li></ol>
<p>While I know what is causing the problem, I don't know how to&nbsp;eliminate the double quotes&nbsp;and leave the line feeds in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to paste OK into Word so why not simply use Word in lieu of Notepad?</p>

<p>As a general rule, the&nbsp;sheet modules and the ThisWorkbook module should contain only event procedures, and nothing else. All other code should reside in regular code modules. Some would argue convincingly that private procedures used only by the event procedures
 in a module should be contained in the same sheet/thisworkbook module in which they are used. There is no practical limit to the number of modules allowed in a project, so you should organize your code into multiple modules, based on the type of functionality
 provided by the code.</p>

 returns 64 yrs, 6 months, 6 days, can anyone help &nbsp;please. This is the formula i am using, the date format in the cells is :</p>

                    <p>Three attempts to install the new build 10049, and three frozen installs after more than 24 hours running the upgrading. I had no previous problems with the old previews 9956 and 10041, but 10049 seems impossible to install, and every time i must do a restart
 and rollback of the system. </p>
<p>The errors show after the rollback are: <strong>0x1900101 - 0xC3000D.</strong></p>
<p>Someone knows what can be the problem???</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you&nbsp; to place your computer in Clean boot state and then try installing update and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

            I have exactly the same issue. Tried many times. I don't anything attached to the USB ports or any other communication ports and nor I have an antivirus solution installed apart Windows Defender which came with the operating system. Upgraded every build
 one after another but cannot do it with this build.

<h2>            Problem With Nokia 3110C Music Player</h2>
                    Hi guys. I have my Nokia 3110c for almost a year now. Everything was perfect untill this day. When I updated my libr my phone seems not to find all the songs. I have about 80 songs and it finds only 17. I've tried everything from updating my libr several
 times to restarting my phone. I even formated the memory card but this didn't help.I have a memory card (1gb Kingston) for a year so I don't think that it's causing the problem (I put another card and the phone did the same way). Can anyone give me an advise
 or should I go somewere to fix it.

<h2>            outlook won&#39;t send emails with links in them</h2>
                    <p>im having a problem that i just cannot figure out! if i send an email in my outlook to a sender and i include my signature (which includes my email address with domain name), it doesn't send. if i write someone and email and include a website, it doesn't
 go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if someone writes me an email with their signature, their company name, their phone numbers, their webiste, etc, i can receive it. but if i REPLY and include their original email, it won't go (because it's detecting web site).</p>
<p>
</p><p>i use hostgator for my emails. they keep telling me that they don't control the spam filters, blah blah, that all spam filters, do that, etc. i told them that i R RECEIVE emails with links just fine....finally someone there suggested i use GSuite, which
 defeats the purpose of outlook......</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there ANYTHING I can do??</p>

            Hi there,<br /><br />You should have a webmail that you can login to, do you face the issue with not being able to send links?  Can you try that for me?<br /><br />If working It looks like it may be outlook related, as far as I am aware there is no configuration to prevent sending links to my best advice would be to try an office repair<br /><br />In the search bar type appwiz.cpl and press enter <br /><br />This should load the list of applications installed on your machine<br /><br />Amongst the list you should see office.<br /><br />Click on this and select change<br /><br />Then select quick repair<br /><br />Reboot your machine<br /><br />Failing this chose the other repair option reboot and try again!<br /><br />Let me know how this goes<br /><br />Thanks

            Hi Jen,
<br />What do you use for antivirus/security? If its any 3rd party application it likely scans email. (Defender does not scan email.)  If the antivirus/security software installed an Outlook addin, disable it - the Safe mode test will disable the addins temporarily.

<p>Hi thabks for your reply. I dud some troubke shooting and heres what i figured out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its MY webaddress. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tested sending various emails to my husbands gmail. Anytime i sent an email that had my website in it, &nbsp;He didnt get it. Its not even in his spam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent ten different emails with various urls. He ALWAYS got the ones with other urls except mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes sense bc even when i reply to an email from someone, it has my email address in it so they dont get it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now i have to believe its an issue with my domain, my email provider, my site, etc. where do i even start to fix this???</p>
<p>
</p><p>my site is www.mysagesalonspa.com if that tells anything.</p>

            Hi there,<br /><br />It may be due to the fact that your domain is not secured using an SSL certificate. Many providers such as Google are trying to stop access to sites with no SSL certificate<br /><br />My best advice would be to speak to your domain provider, explain the issue and they should be able to assist.<br /><br />Let me know how it goes

            If you just want to stream you tube videos, you can just visit the website through your default browser and watch the videos. Doesn't require any application. If you want to download you tube videos to watch later on, then you'll have to install apps specially
 designed for download. As already mentioned you tube downloader and you tube downloader pro are two such apps.

<p>Since upgrading to FP1 on Belle (Nokia 701) around March 2012, we cannot watch youtube videos. It says 'cannot contact server'. But the browser does open the youtube site and show all the video links. This is happening using the standard Nokia browser as
 well as Opera browser.</p>

<h3> jessicanicole89  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the e-mail associated to My skype account without deleting the account entirely</h2>
                    Hello, I have signed up with an e-mail address that has been hacked and deleted by hotmail. Now, when I sign into Skype it asks me to verify my account through the non-existing e-mail. I would love to keep this account but should I have to verify in the
 future, I will not be able to verify. As of right now, I have skipped the verification for up to 7 days. It will ask me about verifying again after the 7 days.&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Missing Emails, Message Rules &#38; Sent Items Problems</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently purchased a new laptop with Microsoft Office 2013 installed. &nbsp;Having used Outlook 2007 and 2010 at work with no problems at all, I assumed 2013 would be better, or at least not worse. &nbsp;I have added my email - I use GMail with IMAP settings and
 from the start I have had irritating simple problems - I do not use outlook for calendars, meetings, synchronizing contacts or anything elaborate, I just use it and want to use for sending and receiving emails, for my emails to go into the correct folders
 and for it to work with webmail and my phone. &nbsp;The problems so far:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1 - Emails go missing, they disappear either in front of my eyes or when I am not there - not all emails, but a few and there is no rhyme or reason to which ones go missing. &nbsp;They are there on my phone and in webmail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2 - Message rules do not run automatically - Despite setting rules up and running the first time, they simply do not work, they always go into the inbox. &nbsp;And this is every rule/message not just one or two rules.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3 - Sent emails - when I send from outlook, sometimes they remain in the sent folder, sometimes they don't - again no reason as to which do and don't. &nbsp;However, they are there on my phone and on webmail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have searched the web and the forums for answers to these questions. &nbsp;I see that other people have similar problems, but no real answers have been given. &nbsp;Firstly before I keep searching for the answers I could do with knowing whether:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>a) Microsoft know and accept there is a problem that they are trying to fix. &nbsp;If this is the case, that's fine, I'll make do until the problem is resolved. Not ideal, but at least it will save me time searching for an answer that is not out there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>b) Microsoft can give me clear and simple steps of what I should do to fix the above problems. &nbsp;Not just delete and reload my profile. Then I will follow them to the letter and it should be fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am fairly computer literate but by no means expert, however, I don't believe you should need to have any great technical knowledge to get this to work - especially as I have previously used older versions without a problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone from Microsoft or the community has any ideas it would be much appreciated.</div>

            <p>1) What view are you using? Are there any similarities between the missing messages?</p>
<p>2) Are you downloading full messages? Rules won't run until the full message is downloaded. Also, Gmail recommends setting up rules in gmail, not in Outlook.
</p>
<p>3) This usually happens when the connection to the server is not good and outlook doesn't get a response back from the server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have all updates installed? Microsoft releases monthly updates and some of the updates have addressed issues with IMAP accounts.

            Hi thank you for your response.
<div><br />
<div>1) I have tried different views and it does not change anything - I am also unsure why it should? &nbsp;Why would the view change whether sent items and emails go missing? &nbsp;The message are nothing special, not big, or attachments etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) As I understand it 2013 Outlook always downloads full messages. &nbsp;However, even if I am wrong I have not changed any settings for this, I have simply set up the email and most emails have synchronized but some haven't.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Setting rules in Gmail - is that really the way to do it? &nbsp;Surely everyone you uses Outlook does not need to go to their webmail and set the rules? &nbsp;Gmail must be one of the biggest email providers out there and surely a basic setting such as message rules
 must work through Outlook? &nbsp;Also if I had Outlook 2007 or 2010 would I need to set the rules in Gmail?</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) Server connection - I don't know what I can do about this. &nbsp;I have had my laptop in different locations and different Wi-Fi locations and my emails are still missing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have gone to the Windows Update tab and installed all updates. &nbsp;If there is another place with updates please can you tell where I should go or send a link.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I too have experienced this same problem recently. I am running outlook 2013 on Win 7 Pro. Our business email runs on Gmail and I manage my email with Outlook using IMAP. I never had problems while using outlook 2007 and 2003 before that but mid June I upgraded
 to a new laptop and to office 2013. I also had problems with my imported rules not working and I had to re-create them to get them to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However the most serious issue is with emails suddenly disappearing from my inbox. However no emails in any of my inbox subfolders or my sent box disappeared. Just the ones in my inbox.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be sure, the emails were not moved or deleted. I did nothing other than clicking on another folder to view emails in that folder but when I clicked back on the inbox folder, everything was gone. The messages still exist in my gmail account but for some
 unknown reason Outlook simply refused to display them without warning. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem fist occurred one week ago. I seriously wonder if this is tied to the July Office update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried renaming my PST file to ".old" and letting it recreate itself using my existing profile. That sort of worked but then I had problems with my contact and task lists. Took entire day to resolve it and everything was working fine but then 2 days ago
 the same thing happened again. I tried my previous fix but something happened and I could no longer send emails and received a strange error message. When I searched that code it mentioned something about an object being deleted possibly a folder. But again,
 I did not delete anything. After much searching I came across advice from someone at Microsoft to delete the profile so I did along with the email account. I recreated the profile and email data file&nbsp;AND&nbsp;set up&nbsp;a separate data file to hold just my contacts
 and tasks. I'm holding my breath not knowing when or if the problem will happen once again.

            <p>Not sure if this is relevant to your Issue, but it just might help someone as I spend quite of bit time troubleshooting our issue.
</p>
<p>We had just install Office Pro 2013 on to&nbsp;many Local PC as part of our Office 365 Subscription and the next day One User did her usual emailing of Invoice through Sage 50 Canadian and the Invoice email would appear in her Sent Folder for only a min or less
 and then Disappear, but the client where getting them and on top of that they'd show on her Blackberry and stay there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Our Solution was stumbled on after I noticed that when logged into online webmail of her account and changed option to show Conversation mode that I could then see the missing Invoice emails showing as in the Sent Folder I then checked under the properties
 of the Sent Folder in Outlook , under Synchronization Tab, that the Server copy of the Sent Folder (Exchange) had quite a few more files than the Local Cached copy. Research that quickly and found that she had her&nbsp;Mail to Keep Offline&nbsp;to be set to 12months
 under the Mailbox Account Settings, which with Outlook 2013, can be found under Change Account Settings, Server Settings, I simply moved the bar to the far right to allow ALL and then everything started coming in from the Exchange Server to her Outlook folders</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Found the Article on this setting at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2733062/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Having it set to 12 months would only affect mail over a year old - it wouldn't affect newly sent messages. They should be on the local computer for 1 year.&nbsp; (The Sync slider was added for tablets and computers with small drives - users won't fill up the
 drive with old messages they don't need on a daily basis.)

            <p>Yes, You would assume that, as I did think that also, but decided to try it anyway.. but&nbsp;with our issue that was not the Case.. as soon as I changed that setting to all.. All the emails that were sent via Simply Account Email Invoice in the last 5-6 days
 ,&nbsp;after I upgraded her to Office Pro 2013&nbsp;appeared in her Local Outlook Sent folder as I said above along with many other sent emails.. so its definitely an Odd and unexplainable solution, but it worked and my User is happy, as she saves those Sent Emails
 to individual customer folders as proof and&nbsp;confirmation that Invoices were sent to the client. That is why I choose to share it here as it may help someone else..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that at this moment this User has over 2.5GB of data in her Sent Folder alone as in her line of work she sends and received lots of attachments daily and saves them as confirmation. I'll be working with her soon to Archive some of the older
 stuff to offline PST files, so perhaps that's relevant to our situation</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Title slide in blank presentation won&#39;t take on custom theme - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Title slide in blank presentation won&#39;t take on custom theme</h2>
                    I created a custom theme in PPT 2007. When I open a new (blank) presentation and apply the custom theme to it, the existing&nbsp;title slide takes on the master design, but not the title slide layout design. Also, it becomes 1_Title Slide Layout rather than
 the existing Title Slide Layout.

            You probably need to go through step by step HOW you made the theme. 1_Title Slide layout suggests that you have duplicated but not deleted the original Title master?<br />

            Thank you for your responses. I played around with it and the reason seems to be because I added a placeholder to the title slide. When I remove the placeholder, save the theme, and apply it to a new presentation it works fine. When I save the theme&nbsp;with
 the extra placeholder it doesn't. I would like to have the placeholder there if possible. Am I adding it incorrectly or is there a work-around?

            I am having the exact same issue. If I add an extra placeholder to the title slide, the title slide no longer "maps" to other theme title slides, but instead creates a new title slide called 1_Title Slide. &nbsp;If i remove the new placeholder, it maps perfectly
 without creating a "ghost" title slide.
<div><br />
<div>This new title slide becomes the thumbnail for the theme as well...so my thumbnail does not show the graphics that should appear on the title slide.<br />
<div><br />
<div>It would be VERY helpful to my company's theme to add a placeholder to designate where a client logo should appear, as well as a formatted placeholder for the date...but when these are added (or even just one of these), I run into the aforementioned issue.</div>

            <p>As has been discussed, if you add (or delete, for that matter) a placeholder to the Title Slide layout, it is no longer a true title slide layout and PPT doesn't really know what to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you MUST add or delete a placeholder from any of the default slide layouts, duplicate the layout and add/remove the placeholders as desired. Give the new custom layout a name -- like Alternative Title, for example.</p>

<h3> shirley_943  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the colour on Service Invoice template</h2>
                    I have downloaded the Service Invoice template on Office 365 Word and put my logo on it. I'd like to change the template colour, as blue doesn't go with my logo. I can change the text colour, but then it looks really strange because the lines of the table
 steadfastly remain blue, even when I go in and change them to black. How can I change them and make the change actually work?&nbsp;

            Hi,
<br />
<br />These are table borders. You'll need to reset them using the Borders and Shading dialog on the Table Tools. You'll need to do the header row and the Totals row separately. You actually need to apply the borders in the new color. Those rows have different width borders.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.

    <title>Desktop and Start menu no longer responsive and error for pagefiles. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swuell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop and Start menu no longer responsive and error for pagefiles.</h2>
                    <p>Ok first of all if this is in the wrong forum categorh I'd like to apologize--and you (moderators) can move it if you choose to--but I felt this was more appropriate than the initial category I was going to post in--which was in the Desktop amd Start--since
 pertains mainly to how the Desktop and Start functions or lack there of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For some reason after a recent fresh install--which everything was working fine--the Desktop decided to hang a little so I decided to shutdown the pc and manually cold boot it up but here in lies the problem, after that initial booting the software no longer
 wanted to load and hung on the bootscreen for several boots until Win10 decided it needed to do a recover so I dix and than after loading it up the desktop no longer loaded properly and was unresponsive--the start wouldnt even open up--though certain that
 loaded by itself worked fine just interaction with the desktop taskbar and start menu did not. So i decided to do a refresh and it still happening. This is all on the latest buid with several upates, could anhbody tell me what is going on? And im guessing
 I need to do a fresh re-install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I'm quite unsure if this is a bug pertaining only to me or if this has happened to other people--but could find no threads about this--or if Microsoft is just limiting end pro-consumers/tinkerers/users with no upfront forward knowledge to us but I thought
 I'd post it here along <span>wth my initial question, hopefully Microspft tech could help alleviate this problem or answer directly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But if the end chooser chooses to move their pagefiles from default drive C to another drive the direct Microsoft approved way there is still an error that the pagefile is constructed wrong and a temprorary pagefile needs to
 be created. Even after cleaning the pagefiles and fixing the registry keys through cmd and runing the sfc command with no errors. After a reboot the page file error still shows up, the only way to resolve this is to move the pagefile back to C drive though
 moving the swapfile provides no error. If microsoft did not want any of thus to be moved the option should not be there nor made so easy on the screen as all it does is provide an error when there is none... So could somebody let me know also if they got this
 error fixed when moving the pagefile and could Microsoft tell me if we can or cannot move the pagefiles without this error or of its a bug? As if this option is provided but it doesnt work as intended then maybe its a bug.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding to me so fast--sorry for not being able to reply to till today since I've been busy studying for my finals--though regarding moving of the Pagefile it was to my logical drive not my external--since I don't even have an external drive
 nor would I move it to an external drive in the first place--and also it's not efficient at all since I had deleted the previous pagefile created in the C drive when I moved it to my other drive. And yes I am running programs where the pagefile being on another
 drive is more critical--and helps a lot better (aside from the fact that programs and games generally run better when the pagefile is on another drive vs. on the same drive as C since you can do a read and write simultaneously -- unless MS has changed the
 code drastically for MS10 from all previous iterations, which I doubt). So please let me know why when I move the pagefile successfully it is not working and still provides me with the error? How would I move the &nbsp;pagefile then or is this function in-effectively
 disabled even though it is given as an option to the end user?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I've already ran System file checker and had fixed my registery's which did not change or help anything. Though the thing to note is that the taskbar/start menu not responding did not affect the default local administrator account made by Microsoft as
 that worked fine when I enabled it and logged in but if that were the case then that means that effectively making a new user account as you suggested should of ended the error--which should of just been as well been the same as a refresh of the pc as that
 basically wipes the user and you have to re-log in (thus recreating your user again into windows) if that is not the case then i would suggest Windows NOT use the same menu after a refresh and login biding the user that an account has been made (as the same
 window when a new account has been first made after a fresh install) as that effectively does not communicate what is actually going on then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I haven't tried is deleting my old user account--though technically that should of happened with the refresh of the PC unless you tell me otherwise--and then making a new user account with my old credentials. Though enabling the administrator
 account and logging in was not effected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd loathe to make a new user account as that means all my games/apps/programs are wiped but my games/programs are already wiped since I had refreshed my account and had not made an image in time before it happened so I could might as well try it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Samuel</p>

<p>This has been so for 48 hours now. So am I the only one facing this problem,</p>

It works on other computers without a problem. I've tried switching it on/off, tried putting it in different USB ports on my computer (front and back), but nothing seems to work.<br />

<p>It clearly has to be something with the PC that has caused the issue since it does work on other PCs.&nbsp; I wish I could offer more that might be more definitive but that is what I would try if it were mine.</p>

    <title>ActiveSync 4.5 connection disabled after installation of Office 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ActiveSync 4.5 connection disabled after installation of Office 2003 Service Pack 3</h2>
                    
<p>I experienced an error when synchronizing with my Palm Treo 750 (windows mobile 5.0 OS) after I downloaded Service Pack 3 for Office 2003.&nbsp; I received an error message and the phone and PC would not synchronize with
 each other any more.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled ActiveSync 4.5 and re-installed it, but then the device manager wouldn't recognize the Treo, only a smart phone device.&nbsp;I&nbsp;even did a hard reset on the phone&nbsp;to completely restore the phone back to its original state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A balloon popped up and said, "Found New Hardware - SmartPhone USB Sync"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then a systems message comes up that says, " The software you are installing for this device - SmartPhone USB Sync - has not passed Windows Logo testing to verify its compatibility with Windows XP.&nbsp; Continuing your installation of this software
 may impair or destabilize the correct operating of this system either immediately or in the future.&nbsp; Microsoft strongly reccomends that you stop this installation now and contact the hardware vendor for software that has passed Windows Logo testing."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither AT&amp;T nor Palm are able to give me any answers to this problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has any one experienced similar issues and found a solution?</p>

            I never experienced this error before, not even on the forums. I suggest you uninstall Office, Service Pack and Activesync. Reboot your PC. Start by installing Office followed by the service pack and Acticesync. Then connect your device again. That should
 fix your issue.

<p>I'm not sure that it is the Service Pack that caused the issue ... possibly, but I find it unlikely.&nbsp; Does everything appear to be working fine with Office?&nbsp; How about Outlook ... and abnormalities that you can see?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think if it were my device, the first thing I would try would be to&nbsp;remove&nbsp; the device from Device manager while connected to your PC.&nbsp; Then I would delete the partnership from both the PC and&nbsp;the device.&nbsp; Now reboot the PC and soft reset
 the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now attach the device to the PC and hopefully it will recognize it and will get a new partnership going...</span></p>
<p><span>If not, if it were my device, I would repeat the steps above but this time, hard reset&nbsp;the device.&nbsp; I can hear you groaning but if it works, you will be glad.&nbsp; I had for the first time in years an issue that would not let me connect no
 matter what I tried ... finally the hard reset, it connected, resynced and I was up and running.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Interestingly enough, I reinstalled everythingg I liked, did not install that which was never used and my device is running better than ever before....</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Just my thoughts....</span></p>

            Encountering recent problems with ActiveSync v4.5 and sync with Outlook 2003<br />
<br />
Running WM6 Treo 750 phone - was working OK prior to updates<br />
- applied WinXP SP3 -- no issues<br />
- applied Office 2003 SP3 - issues started<br />
<br />
Phone/PDA connects to PC, but it seems to be linked to some "other PC" (Windows PC).. ActiveSync tries to setup a new relationship with a "Windows PC 2".&nbsp; Note: as calendar, to-do, etc are already synced to "some PC", A-Sync will not enable me to sync calendar/etc
 with "PC 2".<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.<br />

            <span>Yep I have experienced major problems with sp3 and trying to connect my o2 xda orbit 2 thru active sync. Somewhat more worrying than you, I get a blue screen error saying that it is try to execute a non executable
 memory. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just uninstalled activesync and will try again. I know it will fail again tho. <br />
<br />
<br />
Can I just go into add/rem programs and unistall service pack 3 and it will roll back? I thought you couldnt do that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Microsoft. Well tested once again. </span>

<br />
I just uninstalled activesync 4.5 and reinstalled. Rebooted, reconnected my xda orbit 2 (touch cruise) and blue screen error again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can I do a system restore back to sp2?<br />
