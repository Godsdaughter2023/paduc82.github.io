<h2>            How to change an email alias name in Hotmail</h2>
                    <p>I have a Hotmail account.</p>
<p>I have a couple of aliases attached to this account.</p>
<p>I want to change the name of the alias on one of those aliases.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** &gt;&gt; Change to: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be done? And if so, how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or do I have to create the new one and delete the old one? (In which case I will probably have to give up the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** domain name)</p>

<p>I got a Support reply from MS on this question.</p>
<p>The answer is "No", alias names cannot be edited once they have been created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is what I expected. The solution will be to create a new alias.</p>

<h2>            Logging into  my email on tablet &#40;iPad&#41;</h2>
                    I keepmtrying to log into my email from my iPad and when ever I do, and this happens for both emails, the first time it said it was unable to authenticate it or something like that, and the third time and beyond it kept saying that the password was jncorrect
 even though I tried my password about five times and it didn't work. I just created this account too so I don't know what's wrong. It also says that on my other account even though I changed the password two times recently. Please help, I can't send emails
 on one account and I can't send or receive on my other.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi Zachary,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just a few questions to get a clear picture of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>1. How are you trying to access outlook.com? Is it through a browser, outlook.com mobile app or any other third party/built in app?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you able to login to both the accounts on your computer using a browser?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to&nbsp;delete the&nbsp;outlook.com account from the third party app if&nbsp;you are using one and try the following steps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you do not have outlook app you can download the Microsoft Outlook app for iPad from the app store.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=525541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">Download the Microsoft Outlook app</span></a> or search for Outlook in the app store with your iOS device.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>After the app has installed, tap Get Started.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Next, select the account you would like to add.</span></li><li><span>Sign in to the account and the Microsoft Outlook app will begin to sync with the account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If youâ€™re unable to use the app for any reason, you can still set up Outlook.com on your iOS device.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Tap Settings, and then tap Mail, Contacts, Calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Tap Add Account in the Accounts page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Select Hotmail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Enter your Outlook.com address and password.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 with Docking Station overheating while installing Windows 10 builds</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm testing Windows 10 as a Insider on the SP3, and noticed that recently, when a New Windows 10 build gets installed, the SP3 shutdsdown at every reboot because of the heat.</p>
<p>This only happens, in the Docking station, as far as I noticed.</p>
<p>Also I installed Speedfan(www.almico.com/speedfan.php) in order the check the Temp, and noticed that when the SP3 is in the docking station the Core Temp is 10-20 C higher with simmilar cpu usage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all Windows &amp; Surface(last one from here&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826&amp;751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6=True) Updates (that I know of) installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SP3 is a i7 256GB, Lot No 1429.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any recomandions in order to fix these problems with the Docking Station?</p>

<p>Great specs, hopefully the OS holds up and apps come out.&nbsp; BUT WHY NO QWERTY KEYBOARD?&nbsp; I don't think the qwerty keyboard was the problem for the N97 and n900. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Still what would be great is TRUE MEDIA MULTITASKING, being able to receive a call on a bluetooth headset WHILE; continuing to play a movie on a television, recording images or video, playing a game or playing music to lineout, FM or a bluetooth stereo device.
 THAT would be a TRULY USEFUL multimedia device.&nbsp; Plus I hope this time around the music player will allow the playing of files by folder, and please bring back the flashlight function and get rid of that obnoxious red video light.</p>

<p>This phone was never ment to have a slide out keyboard...</p>
<p>Why should it? - Nokia has decided to make a new phone that is slim and nice as the htc's but have a much better camera. - I'm sure there will be more phones coming in the N category and E category in the near future.&nbsp;- I think this formfactor will be a
 winner!<br />
<br />
If you&nbsp;don't want any of the phones on the market right now, you will have to&nbsp;sit back and wait. That's all you can do!<br />
<br />
Cheers!</p>

<p>As far as I can gather the N8 is a very up market, solid 5800. The N category of phones won't end at 8, so as the guitar man says , wait and see, thats what I'm doing, I want a really reliable N97 with a bigger screen and faster processor, and hope that
 will be the N9 or N10, but we'll see in the future, the N8 isn't even released yet, so panic when it's 'real' and not just a very solid promise :smileywink:</p>

<p>Changed my mind !! Think everyone should build up the hype on this phone as much as possible, and decide exactly what it will and should be like way before its release. Also I think all hanset production should be closed except the Apple Orchard and they
 should have to produce dual operating systems on all there phones both apple and android. All phones should be limited to a 3 megapixel camera and don't need flash, and only smart phones with touch screens should be available with physical qwerty keyboards.</p>
<p>Now surely everyone will be happy and we can just get on with our lives !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <title>Closing microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bal39  say:</h3>
<h2>            Closing microsoft account</h2>
                    My daughter wants to close her Microsoft account. She currently has Office 2013 installed and uses Outlook for her email client. She also has a hotmail.com email account. I told her I don't believe she can continue to use her hotmail account (it will permanently
 close after 60 days) or the Outlook portion of Office without a Microsoft account. Is this correct? She is a little paranoid because someone accessed her computer through her Microsoft account (she believes).What are the issues with using any of the installed
 Office products if you don't have a Microsoft account?

            <p>You can link your hotmail account to Outlook so that the emails are pulled from hotmail by Outlook. Hotmail does not have to have access to your Outlook account.&nbsp; Then you can use the hotmail account as a "throwaway". Provide that address to places you may
 not fully trust. If it gets spammed no problem. Even if it gets hacked, no problem (assuming you don't use the same password for both!).&nbsp; Actually I use a combination of gmail and hotmail so that I have 2 spam filters working for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2013, other than Outlook, does not NEED a MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, all Office 2016 applications have the (default) option of being signed in to your cloud service (OneDrive). 2016 applications do have that onedrive connection thoroughly integrated but you do NOT HAVE to be signed in, I don't.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having the 2 account allows you to use them as your fail-safe connection.&nbsp; Most email providers now have the option of sending password, especially "recovery" passwords to your predefined alternate account.&nbsp; That way, if you forget your password, or it gets
 hacked and the password changed or locked by hacking attempts, you can have the new reset password sent to your alternate account.</p>

            Thanks for the detailed explanation. So if I understand it right, if she closes her Microsoft acct., her Office 13 Outlook program will still work as long as she keeps her hotmail account but uses it only for junk mail.. then she can set up a new email
 account, e.g. gmail, charter.net or comcast.net and use it for her primary, default email. &nbsp;When you said "hotmail does not have to have access to your Outlook account" &nbsp;are you referring to the Outlook.com, not the Office 13 Outlook? I wish Microsoft didn't
 use "Outlook" to refer to both the Outlook.com and the email client Outlook which is part of Office.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Time to clarify what exactly you're referring to when using the word "account"</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - The Office 365 subscription is tied to the account used when it was purchased which applies to all components. Would not suggest cancelling &lt;that account&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - As long as the Office 365 "account" is active - then Outlook can be configured to use any &lt;email account&gt; which has nothing to do with the Office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Going to need a whole lot more info regarding "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">She is a little paranoid because someone accessed her computer through her Microsoft account (she believes)" - don't know of any way that someone would
 simply access a computer via their MS Account. If someone actually did access the computer - then there is something else at play. She believes this why exactly?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Strongly suggest clarify item #3 before cancelling anything.</span></p>

            <p>Sorry I shouldn't have used the word "account" but instead accessed her computer somehow. She had subscribed to a MCHelper service (I believe not a good idea) and was suspect of what they were doing when they had access of her computer once when she was
 experiencing issues and since then had problems with with strange emails and her connected devices such as android tablet and phone. She said different apps were getting downloaded by them selves and some of her settings were grayed out which normally aren't
 (on her phone). She took her computer and devices to a computer tech place and they reset them. They did find a virus in her computer. She also had a google account and received an email from Google that they detected "suspicious activity" on her account,
 so she suspended that account also and reset her gmail password. &nbsp;She isn't really sure how her devices got accessed as there is also an "open" WiFi network through Comcast where she lives in her townhouse but she said she doesn't click on it. Neither of us
 are knowledgeable enough about internet security to know how her devices got compromised. So she just wants to start all over and be as secure as possible. She wants to close her Microsoft account but I don't think that is necessary. I believe a local account
 is safer than signing in with a Microsoft account which is a link to your email. She does not have Office 365. She has the installed programs on her computer of Office 2013 Professional which includes the Outlook email client that she would like to continue
 to use. I like the Rohn007's suggestion of leaving her hotmail act as a junk collector and create a new email account. That way she wouldn't have to sign in to a Microsoft acct.</p>
<p>So I believe the only thing she has tied to her Microsoft account is her installed Office programs. I don't think she ever purchased or downloaded anything from the microsoft store. What other features of Windows 10 won't she have access to? I hope this
 clarifies things somewhat.</p>

</p><p>Hmmmm..........that description covers a lot of territory :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before all else - need to be absolutely certain that the system is currently &lt;completely&gt; clean. Unfortunately, the only approach that provides 100% certainty is starting over and re-installing everything. That being a seriously PITA time-consuming approach
 is to take some precautionary measures of your own (not that I don't trust the computer tech involved) - my suggestions for that as a start would be the following as a minimum (there lots of different solutions and everyone has their own preferences - just
 identifying some of the stuff I use on my systems and those of systems where I'm the "go to" person when problems arise) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>*** at a minimum install the free version - personally use the Premium version - gets much more economical the number licenses purchased especially when opting for the 2 yr term)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When that's done - change the password for the MS Account instead of outright cancelling it given that it is likely the same account associated with the Office 365 subscription unless she purchased a one-time license instead of a subscription (whether from
 the MS Store or anywhere else). Essentially, change the password(s) for any account in use be it GMail / Hotmail / or anything else. If those accounts aren't being used for anything, then by all means create new ones but begs the question, if the accounts
 are being used to start with - why bother with new ones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else that I've grown to really like is for on-going protection against things getting unexpectedly installed etc. This is especially useful on systems where the user needs gentle assistance in protecting themselves from themselves (i.e. age/health
 reasons etc where can't always depend on the person making the right choices).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WinAntiRansome (subscription) - from WinPatrol (also a really useful thing to have IMHO</p>

<p>
</p><p>As for local account vs MS Account - makes no difference if the system has internet access and there is stuff running on the system that shouldn't be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Wi-Fi access if she has a wireless modem/router, make sure that that connection is secured and keep ignoring the unsecured open connection unless there's an absolute need to do otherwise - treat it the same way as any open hotspot taking the appropriate
 precautions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, there's the age-old lecture that can't be avoided which is to make sure that there is always a current &lt;data&gt; backup - Outlook and anything else of importance (preferably following a multi-generational approach for things like Outlook in the event
 a problem isn't spotted immediately. If the time involved recovering from a catastrophic situation is a factor (be it hardware failure or total system corruption/infection) - then the final layer is to maintain regular image backups so you can be up and running
 in hours (or less) instead of days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottomline - simply changing accounts isn't going to help much should the same thing happen again.</p>

    <title>InPrivate Browsing not working for Other Accounts with Family Safety - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chulix  say:</h3>
<h2>            InPrivate Browsing not working for Other Accounts with Family Safety - IE10 Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>We have IE10, Windows 8, and on the accounts that have Family Safety, I noticed that InPrivate Browsing was not active (light grey color).</p>
<p>I needed one of those accounts to have access to Private Browsing, so proceeded to remove all Family Safety from it, as well as to make it an Administrator account (just in case). I also did a 'reset' on IE, but nothing helped. My account has the option
 available, but all the other computer's accounts do not. All the otehr accounts had Family Safety and were not Administrator accounts, just mine.</p>
<p>Would you please help me?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Chulix, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the efforts which you took to get the issue resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how annoying it gets when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>InPrivate Browsing enables you to surf the web without leaving a trail in Internet&nbsp;Explorer. This helps prevent anyone else who might be using your computer from seeing what sites you visited and what you looked at on the web. You can start InPrivate Browsing
 from the New Tab page or the Safety button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you start InPrivate Browsing, Internet&nbsp;Explorer opens a new browser window. The protection that InPrivate Browsing provides is in effect only during the time that you use that window. You can open as many tabs as you want in that window, and they will
 all be protected by InPrivate Browsing. However, if you open another browser window, that window will not be protected by InPrivate Browsing.&nbsp; To end your InPrivate Browsing session, close the browser window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are surfing the web using InPrivate Browsing, Internet&nbsp;Explorer stores some informationâ€”such as cookies and temporary Internet filesâ€”so the webpages you visit will work correctly. However, at the end of your InPrivate Browsing session, this information
 is discarded.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> </p>
<p>Run the following fixit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Fix Internet Explorer issues to make IE fast, safe and stable
</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety?wa=wsignin1.0</strong></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I<span>f the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Perform the steps mentioned below and see if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Maximize the Internet Explorer window and then press <strong>
Ctrl key&nbsp; +Shift key&nbsp; + P key </strong>and check if&nbsp;you are&nbsp;able to open In-private Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Close Internet Explorer completely,&nbsp; right click on Internet Explorer icon in taskbar and select
<strong>un-pin his program from task bar</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> Press <strong>Windows Key + R Key</strong>, type <strong>iexplore.exe</strong> and hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>d) </strong>After the Internet Explorer opens right click on Internet Explorer icon on the taskbar and then select
<strong>pin to taskbar</strong> and then check with the issue.</p>

            <p>Jessen:</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply and for trying to help me.</p>
<p>I will try to use the FixIt, but I don't understand how it works.</p>
<p>Just by reading the second Method that you mention, I can tell you that there is no option for InPrivate Browsing when right clicking on the Internet Explorer icon for the non-administrator accounts. My account&nbsp;is set as an administrator and it does show
 the option when I right-click on the IE icon, but it doesn't on the others, even if I change them to administrators and deactivate Family Safety from them.</p>
<p>I already tried to uncheck IE from the Control Panel, then re-check it, but still no luck.</p>
<p>I will try FixIt, but I don't see how it will know what I need. Anyway, I'll try it and post if it worked or not.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Chulix.</p>

    <title>MS Word 2011 for Mac Calendar Template Functionality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iconcomm  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Word 2011 for Mac Calendar Template Functionality</h2>
                    <p>Started with an existing Word 2011 Calendar Template that I've customized. No matter where or how I save it (templates folder or desktop, docx or dotx, upon opening,&nbsp; I always get the dialog asking me if I want to change month/year, and I get the Calendar
 option in the header menu. That is good.<br />
<br />
However, if I take the file to another computer and try to open (Mac or PC, range of MS Word versions including Word 2011 for Mac), I don't get any of that, and I need that functionality. What am I missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies, Think I posted this previously in maybe the wrong place.</p>

            <p>Yes, you are! &nbsp;You are missing the macro code that does the work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry: this is a really difficult concept to explain, unless you have been working with Word for years. &nbsp;But let me try again (I can't believe I did not explain this properly last time, I am a Technical Writer, I am supposed to be good at this!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word, there are typically three files in play for each document you have open:</p>
<ul>
<li>The document</li><li>The Document's Attached Template</li><li>The Global Template</li></ul>
<p>What makes it confusing is that each of the three can inherit functions that normally belong in one of the others. Fortunately, in this case that does not happen so we don't need to worry about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you said "I opened a brand new calendar template..." what you did was effectively a File&gt;New&gt;From Template, and you chose one of the template files. &nbsp;For the purposes of this explanation I am going to assume you chose the Calendar Template known as
 "Horizontal Monday Start".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my system, the template is here:&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">You won't be aware of the file name or location unless you go looking, because Word hides what is actually happening from you (which annoys me intensely, because that means people never learn how to do this for themselves).</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">When you click OK, instead of performing an "Open" on the file, Word actually triggers a different command: "New From Template". &nbsp;It reads the file, detects that the file is one of the "template" types, and changes from "Open" to
 "New From Template".</p>
 and some of them are not full. &nbsp;The various file types: .docx, .docm, .dotm, .dotx can be thought of as different "shops". &nbsp;They all have some shelves, but some files do not have particular shelves because they do not stock that kind of merchandise.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">"New From Template" copies only the "Document" properties from the file: things such as Page formatting, section formatting, styles, and any text or graphics that might be there.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">It does NOT copy the code. The Calendar templates are actually quite complex little Word Applications behind the scenes: there's a form pops up to ask you to choose the month, and some quite complex code that runs behind the scenes
 to populate the cells with dates.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">What happens instead is that Word sets a LINK to the original source template. &nbsp;If you choose a calendar and set the month, then look in Tools&gt;Templates and Add-Ins in the "Document Template" field, you will see the link to the
 template that you chose.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">This link is almost never used after the document has been created: the only thing it is used for is to call in the code that does the work if you ever decide to change the Month. &nbsp;You will not that whenever you create a new Calendar,
 a new menu appears on the Menu Bar beside the Window menu, named "Calendar". &nbsp;That menu is inserted there by the code when it runs.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">However, the file you have on the screen after you create a Calendar is a .docx. &nbsp;You won't be able to see that, because Word simply gives it a serial number and no extension: in my case, "Document 2". &nbsp;But if you try a File&gt;Save
 As... at this point, Word will then show you that it proposes to save the file as a .docx type, because that is what it is. The internal containers ("shelves") that can contain the macro code are missing: purposely removed, because a .docx can't contain macros.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">You could override this file type (in fact you did, during your testing) and save as a .dotm. &nbsp;The missing shelves will be created, but since the file does not contain any code, they will remain empty. &nbsp;Even though the file type
 is now .dotm, the content will be only what was allowed in the .docx.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">To do what you want to do, you need to locate the template and copy that across to the other machine. &nbsp;On my computer it is in&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Macintosh HD/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/Media/Templates/Print Layout View/Calendars/Horizontal Calendar - Monday Start.dotm</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to find <strong>Horizontal Calendar - Monday Start.dotm</strong> and copy it to the other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other computer you need to store that file in a template location that Word knows about, otherwise when you open File&gt;New... Word won't offer it to you.</p>
<p>Templates can be anywhere you put them. &nbsp;You "could" of course place the file in the path above. &nbsp;However, I suspect that location does not exist on the other computer. &nbsp;I suspect that someone has been at that other computer
 with one of those applications that promises to make Office run faster by "deleting unnecessary files". &nbsp;Around the world, users have wasted centuries of their life attempting to fix the damage caused by those things. &nbsp;If the location did exist, all this would
 have worked a week ago and you would not have the problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to find out where to put them is to ask Word where it wants to keep its templates. &nbsp;Go to Word&gt;Preferences&gt;File Locations and highlight "User Templates" . &nbsp;Click Modify. &nbsp;Don't make any changes: the folder that opens is where
 Word wants its templates. &nbsp;You will see the file Normal.dotm there already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make a note of that location (you can drop down the disclosure arrows in the folder name field at the top of the dialog to see the full path). &nbsp;Then quit Word (for safety: Word does not like having its private parts played with while it is running...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Move your calendar template in there. &nbsp;Word will offer it to you next time you do a File&gt;New From Template... &nbsp;It will work exactly the same as it does on the original machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for grins, have a look at this:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.john.mcghie.name/Calendar.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.john.mcghie.name/Calendar.xlsx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a copy of one of the other Word calendar templates, re-expressed in Excel. &nbsp;It does not use VBA, so it does not need to maintain a link to any other files. Everything works off the "Month" field. &nbsp;It's not actually a "Month" field, it's
 a complete date: Year, Month, Day; formatted so only the month is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially Excel populates that date with today's date from the system clock. &nbsp;To get a different month, simply type the date of the first of the month in that cell: 1-jun-2014 or whatever. &nbsp;When you type, the cell should display only the name
 of the month. &nbsp;If it displays anything else, Excel did not recognise what you typed as a full date: try again, using a date format Excel knows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise leave it, and each time you open it, it will reset to the current month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do whatever you like to the formatting, just ensure that the formulas remain in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Outlook - Moving emails using the MOVE icon</h2>
                    Iâ€™ve just installed Microsoft Office 2011 and Mavericks on an IMac. I wish to move emails into various folders and the only way I can see to do this is by using the Move Icon in Outlook. However when I try to do so by typing in the name of a folder, no
 names appear in the Move window and there's no way to move the email. Does anyone know how to fix this, or another way of moving the emails to where I wish to store them, which is in the folders of various clients?<br />

            <p>Thanks Arshad Khan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand about the account. However I've elected to&nbsp; go with drag and drop because of the large number of changes to my h/w and s/w at one time and my continuous need for an operational system for my business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This caution has been reflected with my use of MS outlook for the Mac, which has been problematic from installation of Office Mac 2011 a few days ago. I kept getting messages that Outlook had to close down because of an error. Today it closed down and now
 all I can get is about a second of the yellow splash screen - it wonâ€™t open at all. If anyone can help with that Iâ€™d appreciate it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me help you with your concern of not being able to see your contacts. If I understood your issue correctly, you cannot see your People page.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest that you install Silvelight on your browser and see if the same issue persists.
<span><font color="#000000">Make sure your computer is running an operating system and browser that is compatible with Microsoft Silverlight. This includes Microsoft Windows Vista and XP with Internet Explorer or Firefox and Mac OS 10 with Safari.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are running Internet Explorer, it will prompt you to download and install Silverlight. Click on
<strong><span>Run</span></strong> to start the installation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here is a link on where to download Silverlight: <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once done, make sure that Silverlight is not being disabled in the IE Add-ons section. Hereâ€™s how:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><font>1.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><font>2.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the <strong>
Tools Menu</strong>, click <strong>Manage Add-ons</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span><font>3.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>From the <strong>
Toolbars and Extensions</strong>, Select <strong>Microsoft Silverlight</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span><font>4.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If it says <strong>
Disabled</strong>, Click the <strong>Enable</strong> button. </span></p>
<p><span><span><font>5.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong>
Close</strong>. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Re-launch your browser after doing so and check if you can see the dropdown on your account.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Inform us for any results.</font></p>

    <title>5GHz Wi-Fi channels limitations, according to local laws on Lumia 830, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> damiencaen  say:</h3>
<h2>            5GHz Wi-Fi channels limitations, according to local laws on Lumia 830, purchased for use in another country, any fix for it &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>It is still hard&nbsp;to find out what means &nbsp;"PWBASSY" and "LIGHT SWAP ENGINE GLOBAL" while talking about Firmwares for my Nokia 830, with RM-983 from AT&amp;T(us). I was seeking Global Firmwares on RM-984, which are not "CV", but "SWAP", and I am not sure about
 what it is for, same for PWBASSY,&nbsp;what does it mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I wish I could avoid to flash RM-983 for RM-984 or RM-985,&nbsp;because I am afraid of bricking the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;While any suggestion is very welcome, it seems to be the only way to see my "5GHz only" Wi-Fi !!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">I purchase&nbsp;Lumia 830 online, from USA seller. Phone is unlocked,</p>
<p>but still AT&amp;T firmware will only&nbsp;scan on legal channels (149...)according to local laws(U.S.).
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">I am French, and legal&nbsp;channel range&nbsp;in France is totally different (VAR EURO).</p>
<p>Using a French Livebox, from F-Orange internet provider, it is obvious I can 't turnaround, but flashing my Nokia 830 for "VAR EURO", or better... "GLOBAL" one, to be free at last to access any 5GHz hotspot!!!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">If anyone knows how to free up "full range view" of 5GHz wide&nbsp;channels on lumia 830, without flashing,
</p>
<p>your help would be greatly appreciated!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to set Regional settings in Windows phone to USA, but that seems to affect language and time only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Many thanks for help!!</p>

            <p>Hello, and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I understand that i have no turnaround, but using global RM. </p>
<p>Your support is limited to the software and applications that are built-in to the phone, so, what about built in wireless settings and regional settings&nbsp;?
</p>
<ul>
<li>can you confirm me&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">for real</span> that nothing that is built-in to the phone can fix that?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;i wander&nbsp;about firmware to select, for using with THOR2, which is part of &nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool you currently&nbsp;support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it right&nbsp;that i'd better&nbsp;find what country is allowing most 5GHz channels, including my&nbsp;local ones,&nbsp;then load it with THOR2 (<a href="http://www.lumiafirmware.com/info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.lumiafirmware.com/info</a>), because
<strong>Global Firmwares </strong>are not updating to windows mobile 10?</li><li>any advice ?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for those infos, according to your support limitations.</p>

            Microsoft went for external agents of 3rd-party Internet agencies here at Microsoft Answers. Their knowledge and motivation to help is limited. Why ever. SWAP is not a good idea because those are Product Codes used internally at Microsoft Mobile, just
 for repair. That is not the bad part, the part is, some of these codes never see a firmware update. Therefore, which Product Code do you have currently?

            <p>Hello and thank you for being the only one to care about my help call !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually could not figure my product code, as none of the apps i tried provide this info.&nbsp;Also nothing&nbsp;on sticker inside phone...any solution you my know would be greatly appreciated !!</p>
<p>I only know about firmware: 02179.00000.15455.24047, so it is either 059W4P1 or 059W5H3....as Lumia 830 was SimLocked(SL), on ATT US, then unlocked by the seller of the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went in deeper search for info about Wi-Fi 5GHz regional limitations, and i am confused because according to Wikipedia , my phone is supporting&nbsp; only CHINESE channels (
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_des_canaux_Wi-Fi#Liste_des_canaux_dans_la_bande_des_5.C2.A0GHz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_des_canaux_Wi-Fi#Liste_des_canaux_dans_la_bande_des_5.C2.A0GHz</a>&nbsp;), if USA&nbsp;was really supporting all channels...</p>
<p>Moreover, &nbsp;when i switch region from France&nbsp; to USA, My Synology NAS and my TP-Link WA-7510N AP are both supporting channels from 149 to 165&nbsp;only !!!</p>
<p>Do you know which info is correct about USA allowed frequencies range??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless product code can make the difference, while &nbsp;RM-983 VAR US ATT DARK GRAY SL DEMO would not be&nbsp; fully functional firmware, versus
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>RM-983 VAR US ATT DARK GRAY SL, i have to assume that Flashing is latest chance......</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing i must ensure at this time is that Flashing from RM-983 to RM-984 is safe. I would feel better with trustful confirmation. I wish i avoid bricking phone, because of lack of infos....Many thanks for helping to know, because i read something
 about RM-983 difficulties for changing to unbranded ROM....</p>

            <p>If you do not know your Product Code â€“ to say it short â€“ you should not <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/3b595a10-1a9c-47b8-877f-657819e86bd2?threadId=d36f0575-73e7-4b66-95a1-24494d4e50ed">
go for a change</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;059W568 (RM-984, France). I do not have a Lumia 830 handy to double-check the location of the Product Code, however, it is printed somewhere on the phone (underneath the battery or within the SIM slot) and starts with 059â€¦</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, while re-reading your posts (why didnâ€™t I get that the first time? Mhm), I finally got that you have the Model Type&nbsp;RM-983 â€“ which was designated for AT&amp;T USA, yes. So your current Product Code does not matter actually. I am not aware of any procedure
 to change the â€˜Model Typeâ€™ through changing the â€˜Firmware Variantâ€™.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I would have to double-check whether those higher channels are supported with Lumia phones at all. I use channels 36-48, normally. However, with Lumia phones, the supported channel range does not depend on the Model Type or Firmware Variant but the
 SIM which is inserted. For example, when no SIM is inserted, channels above 11 are not searched anymore. Therefore:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have an AT&amp;T or french SIM in your phone?</li><li>Are you able to see any 5GHz band Wi-Fi, like one on channel 36-48?</li></ol>
<p>I understand, that you want to use channels 149-159, but let us start the easy way (actually, I have to dig depth in my gadget collection to find a Wi-Fi access point which supports that). Are you really sure, your TP-Link WA7510N is correct? Here in Germany,
 it supports 36-48 as well. Furthermore, the&nbsp;TP-Link&nbsp;WA7510N is designed as outdoor access point â€“ a bit unusual to connect a mobile directly to that because such an access point is used for bridging two networks normally. Furthermore, your Lumia 830 supports
 802.11ac. I really recommend to go for that, otherwise you are limited to 72â€¯Mbit/s.</p>

            <p>Hello, and thank you for the time you spend for helping me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a smart card LDAP and public domain admin, so more a geek, than a novice/beginner.
</p>
<p>Asking help is for&nbsp;more advanced problem, as i would not mean to waste time of helpful users, for easy-to-fix issues.</p>
<p>Please, trust me that none of the&nbsp;codes (FCC ID, SKU, IMEI&nbsp;....) underneath the battery includes *059* sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem seems to be misunderstood:</p>
<p>I don't want to use channels 149-159, but that is the only ones Lumia 830 detects.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am French, using Orange Caraibe for GSM and French Orange&nbsp;Livebox at home. Livebox is only running on 36-48, so i&nbsp;firstly contacted the seller of Nokia Lumia 830, because i thought 5GHz was not working, then i got it!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>that is why&nbsp;I use TP Link on AP Mode. Within this WA7510N,&nbsp;&nbsp;i can change country to USA through&nbsp;Web UI setup, to make it run on phone supported&nbsp;channels (149-165), which are not supposed to be used where i live. Thus, I am currently outlaws, because of Lumia
 830 limitations.</p>
<p>Indeed, 5GHz should depend of SIM origins, but it is not. I previously owned a Lumia 820, with&nbsp; suchlike "VAR EURO FR&nbsp;Bouygues" firmware, with this same SIM, and it was working correctly, on 36-48, and 100-136(DFS).</p>
<p>I must logically assume that AT&amp;T&nbsp;firmware is the problem, while SIM was doing ok before...and if so, how&nbsp;can&nbsp; French SIM&nbsp;is CURRENTLY allowing me USA range&nbsp;access in French area ?</p>
<p>Only good new is that my SIM allows any channels worldwide, but it still remains to evaluate risks of RM-983 flash for RM-984....If anyone has already done it, i just need to make sure it is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all previous users help, but unless somebody knows how to fix that a simple way, i will stay outlaws with this firmware.....please anybody share experience and confirm me that RM-983 can be flashed/unbranded !!!</p>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>That is not normal, whether it is France or USA. However, I do not know the situation of the&nbsp;Caribbean. Perhaps, the firmware goes for the wrong channels with such a SIM. Yes, your Lumia 820 behaved correctly, I read that. Anyway to double-check, did you
 try with a SIM from another country?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>anybody share experience and confirm me that RM-983 can be flashed/unbranded</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you click on my link, you see the procedure how to do that normally (within the same RM-xxx). Consequently, that does not work across RM-xxx. This is an ongoing question in several Internet threads. I recommend to subscribe to one of those, because
 Microsoft Answers is rather low on input from that level of expertise.</p>

            <p>Hello, and also thanks for help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You wrote that anybody shared experience and confirmed you that RM-983 can be flashed/unbranded.</p>
<p>While assuming that you really understand and&nbsp;know my issue better than i could ever do, i must trust that no way to switch between different RM-98x firmwares. So,&nbsp;i get confused because all RM-983 firmwares are AT&amp;T branded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Could you provide me one of these experience shares, to figure out how they could successfully un-brand RM-983(AT&amp;T only), without changing it to RM-984 or RM-985?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I wish that &nbsp;you finally are the one to&nbsp;get the solution. I get back my hopes !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another side, since my product code is not available, i could only figure out that my firmware version is 02179.00000.15455.24047, which refers to either: "RM-983 VAR US ATT DARK GRAY SL DEMO", or "RM-983 VAR US ATT DARK GRAY SL".&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Should my problem be caused by such a "DEMO" firmware version?</li></ul>
<p>No matter un-branding, as long as i get proper 5GHz Wi-Fi channels back. Here is my Priority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you for sharing RM-983 un-brand feedbacks, because that is what i actually need to know.</p>

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Finally tried to Flash with RM-984 VAR EURO FR CV D GREY, but i had an error message about invalid platform ID !!</p>
<p>...i guess there is something to do with "-productcodeupdate" or "-skip_id_check" flags within&nbsp;THOR2&nbsp;command, but don't know so&nbsp;far.
</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;i learnt that RM-1049 is also intended to Lumia 830 (with RM 983-984-985).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, &nbsp;I 'd better try to flash with RM-983 NDT ATT DARK GRAY (when its&nbsp;current download&nbsp;will complete).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In last/worst scenario,&nbsp; flashing with RM-983 VAR US ATT DARK GRAY&nbsp;should succeed, and comfort me, at least,&nbsp;that i don't stuck on demo version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, i will try above steps, as soon as possible,&nbsp;and feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still get interested in un-branding AT&amp;T&nbsp;from RM983,&nbsp;in my Lumia 830, if anyone did it successfully !!</p>

                    <p>At 0810 hrs this morning, I happened to be sitting in the room where my computer was blissfully snoring away (i.e., it was in Sleep mode). &nbsp;Without anything or anyone nearing it, it woke itself up and never went back to sleep. &nbsp;Almost an hour later, I tried
 to access the computer and found it entirely frozen (the screen wouldn't even turn on). &nbsp;According to the Event Viewer, the last thing to happen (almost an hour before I forced the computer to shut down and restart) was something waking the computer via the

            <p>I keep getting the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
It all started when I either got my new Acer monitor with a USB 3.0 hub and uses an uplink cable or when I installed the Roccat Kave XTD Digital headphones which plug in via USB (2.0). I can't get the comptuer to not wake up on its own.</p>

            <p>ISSUE SOLUTION FOR ME:</p>
<p>I was experiencing same issue - wasn't the hardware after all.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I was mistakenly working with <em>powercfg /lastwake </em>command line and Event Viewer system logs to stop auto-wakeups by
<em>USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller</em> device.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
The cause was <strong>scheduled software task</strong> by <strong>Norton Security Suite</strong>:
<em>Remidiation Antimalware in task scheduler</em>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">SOLUTION: Unchecked "wake computer to run" under settings in the software application.&nbsp; (They were crafty, the setting was buried.)&nbsp; Issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event View system log message of issue: <em>"Wake Source: Timer - Windows will execute 'NT TASK\Remediation\AntimalwareMigrationTask' scheduled task that requested waking the computer."</em></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Play Hulu Plus, Netflix, or Xbox Video - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> birdstories  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Play Hulu Plus, Netflix, or Xbox Video</h2>
                    <p>Received official Windows Phone 8.1 update Friday (7/25) and obviously installed it. The actual installation itself seems to have been smooth, and since for general usage I have not encountered anything that appears problematic - except of course when trying
 to play video content on Hulu Plus, Netflix, or even Xbox Video (streamed or downloaded). Content from Fox Now, SyFy Now, Comedy Central, or YouTube play perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>Nokia Lumia 1520</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8.1</p>
<p>OS: 8.10.12397.895</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to upgrade I was able to play content from these applications/services without issue. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Netflix and Hulu Plus without success. Xbox Video is not something that can be uninstalled and it simply states "Cannot play video".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hulu thinks I am accessing from a Windows 8 device, not a Windows Phone 8.1 device. The error it throws is: "We're sorry, there was an issue playing the video you selected (PB4-System.Exception: 3102 An Error has occurred.)" When selecting "ok" it takes
 me to a Hulu help and suggests I check for OS&nbsp;or Graphics driver updates. I checked for new updates for my device and none were found (surprise surprise), but I obviously don't have an option for upgrading graphics drivers on my handheld.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Netflix throws Error Code: P8156-3102, their support indicates I need to disconnect my USB cable and try again; however, this is without connecting my phone to any cable. I am, however, connected via Wi-Fi, and I do have an SD card installed (unclear from
 Netflix if that is affecting this - and I have not attempted to remove my SD card to validate (mostly feel I shouldn't need to)).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've sent notifications to at least Hulu and Netflix before coming here to ask my question; any feedback would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Update* Netflix and Windows Phone chat Support have both confirmed this as a new issue for them. If either are able to provide a solution to this issue I will post an update here.

            <p>I must say communication with Hulu Plus was quite aggravating - to say the least.</p>
<p>Netflix support was the BEST experience of the three.</p>
<p>Windows Phone/Xbox Live support was acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through it all I have changed nothing other than the obvious.</p>
<p>1) Uninstalled/Reinstalled Hulu Plus and Netflix &gt; Shut off Phone &gt; Turn on Phone &gt; Check if App Works</p>
<p>(You cannot uninstall XBox "Video" as it is baked into the OS)</p>
<p>2) Turn phone off for full minute</p>
<p>3) Try app(s) over Wi-Fi</p>
<p>4) Try app(s) over cellular</p>
<p>5) Launch from Home</p>
<p>6) Launch from App list</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing, since I posted this, had made any difference. Today, however, they are all magically working (the exact same videos that were not working before). None of the companies contacted me indicating "we've resolved this" comments either. The only notable
 difference would be that Netflix obviously deactivated my device (which forced me to log in again) and it then worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion, if after upgrading from WP8 to WP8.1 your media apps are not working, that you deactivate your device with said service provider (i.e. Netflix, Hulu, etc.) and try again. It could be that it was erring because I wasn't "registered" for a WP8.1
 (my thoughts). </p>
