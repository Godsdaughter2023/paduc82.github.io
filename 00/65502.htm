<h2>            Virtual Desktop - Can&#39;t really Multitask in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got high hopes with Windows 10 virtual desktop, may be I"m not able to do what I want but please guide me.</p>
<p>I want to create 2-3 desktop, where I want to automate tasks for eg i automate my mouse to do certain tasks to</p>
<p>do things in desktop 3, I keep the window of the software where I want my automation to work and the software which</p>
<p>automate things on same desktop which is desktop 3, but now when I switch to desktop 1 or desktop 2 i that automation</p>
<p>program which is supposed to be working on desktop 3 interferes in my desktop 2 as well as desktop 1 also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess developers missed a thing regarding setting up axis of the screens, they should limit application running to stay at the same desktop, or make axis of all the three screens as one so that i can assign the proper axis to my program and can work
 on my original desktop without any interference on the rest of my desktop(just like if i added another monitor which enables me to have have 2-3 monitors in continuous array).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please shed some light or else what's the point of multi tasking.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Explorer.exe not working with windows 10 yet is in safe mode Windows version 10.0.16299.125</h2>
                    <p>WOW!!</p>
<p>Hi everybody, can't believe how many Windows users are having problems.</p>
<p>I posted a question way back concerning how i couldn't access my laptop, only in safe mode and this was after the now "infamous" Windows 10 October updates. Since then, through many,many hours of following recommended, fixes, resets, regedits etc.. was eventually
 able to get it all back, including getting the start option and file explorer working again. Now it seems to have given up the ghost once more. I can use safe mode to use start and file explorer and run programmes but that's it.I cannot use media player, or
 any programme using audio, visual and others. I have downloaded a repair registry tool along with a fix.exe windows tool to try and rectify. The repair registry removed over 500 problems on its first go and seemed to make a difference, until i go back to normal
 windows mode and just does its usual of taking ages, opens with desktop with black screen behind, can acess task manager to run new task but doesn't recognise explorer.exe displaying the message "An attempt was made to reference a token that does not exist"
 and when i click OK then displays the message "Shell:::{52205fd8-5dfb-447d-801a-d0b52f2e83e1} an attempt was made to a token that does not exist"</p>
<p>I have been through every repair, fix, recovery, install, re-install, reset - you name it i've tried it!!</p>
<p>Any help greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Andy</p>

            Hi Andy
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Have you done a full clean install?
<br />Resetting and repairing won't do you any good if your image is beyond reset or repair.
<br />Below is a link by Greg on how to do a clean install.
<br />I would recommend doing that.

<h2>            I cannot show my hidden games anymore.</h2>
                    As the title says; I cannot show my hidden games anymore. It used to be LB + RB + X, but now I see people saying LT + RT + X, but that doesn't work either. It would great to see the hidden section again as I have some game trials in there I'd like to use.
 Thanks in advance!

            <p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
I understand your concern and will assist you to resolve this issue</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I would request to follow these methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>•&nbsp;DISM</strong><br />
Try the following steps to run DISM scan to check and restore system file corruption:
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open command prompt by pressing Windows key + X and selecting “Command prompt admin”.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In command prompt, type the following commands and press Enter after each command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth<br />
&nbsp; DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong><br />
<strong>•&nbsp;SFC</strong></p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Try the SFC scan to resolve the issue. SFC scans the corrupted files and recover it automatically.<br />
To run the SFC/SCANNOW command in Windows 10: <br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left click on Start button.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on Command Prompt (Admin) option which will let you run 'Run as administrator’.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Command Prompt Window pops up.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type:&nbsp; SFC /SCANNOW and hit Enter.<br />
You can also follow the link below for reference:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>if the issue still persist you can follow method 3 and 4.<br />
<strong>Method 3: Wsreset</strong><br />
Wsreset resets the Windows Store without changing account settings or deleting installed apps.<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type Windows key + R<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type wsreset </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 4: </strong><br />
<strong>PowerShell command</strong> </div>
<div>
<p>a.&nbsp;Open the Task manager.&nbsp; Here’s a tip:&nbsp; Press CTRL+Shift+ESC. <br />
b.&nbsp;Click File &gt; Run New Task <br />
c.&nbsp;Make sure you have a check mark beside “Create this task with administrative privileges”
<br />
d.&nbsp;Type Powershell <br />
e.&nbsp;Type the following in the Powershell prompt:<br />
$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest
<br />
f.&nbsp;Close the Powershell window <br />
g.&nbsp;Reboot </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Post back with updated issue details for further help.</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>I'm facing the same issue and tried your methods to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1 / DISM:</strong></p>
<p>The first command with the parameter "scanhealth" works fine, but the second command with the parameter "restorehealth" ends with an error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Error: 0x800f081f"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2 / SFC:</strong></p>
<p><em>Result:</em> No errors found</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3 / wsreset:</strong></p>
<p>Doesn't work at all. Store App pops up and closes immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4 / PowerShell:</strong></p>
<p>Doesn't change anything at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any other recommendations?</p>
<p>

<h2>            My surface Pen keeps disconnecting. Can&#39;t find a solution</h2>
                    <p>I already tried getting help, but was only given articles for troubleshooting that didn't help. Here is what happens:<br />
<br />
Every hour or so my pen will disconnect from my device for a few minutes. During this time, the top button will not work, but my Surface still displays the pen as connected. If I press the long button, the LED will blink green for the few minutes it needs to
 reconnect to my Surface. I have already tried re-pairing the Pen with the surface and uninstallung the the Pairing drivers, but the issue is still occuring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am losing my patience, should I just replace the pen? It is still under warranty. This is not happening with any other bluetooth devices.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your Surface Pen suddenly stops working, replacing the battery usually resolves the issue. However, if you already replaced the battery and still your pen intermittently works, you may try these solutions that may help you resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Restart your Surface device.</strong><br />
<br />
If after restarting the device doesn't work, force shutdown the device.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</li><li>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.</li><li>The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Install Surface and Windows updates.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing the latest updates may help resolve the issue. On how to download the updates, refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box, click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Under H<strong>ardware and Sound</strong>, choose <strong>Configure a device</strong>.</li><li>The Hardware Troubleshooter will open.</li><li>Click on <strong>Next </strong>to run the <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong>.</li><li>Choose the one you want to fix and click on Next. The Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter will try to fix the problem with the pen. You may also check this article about troubleshooting Microsoft Surface Pen issues.</li></ol>

<p>Ive tried everything to install service pack 1 so does it matter if I can't. Been through all the troubleshooting. Installed that tool and this, Disabled this and that including anti-virus etc. Tried about 20 times to install but when I restart it has to
 reverse the procedure. When I say i've tried I mean I've really tried - gone through ALL procedures. Pretty fed up - really fed up - we're still living in the dark ages. When will computers get sorted. Really fed up = and oh yes really fed up.</p>
<p>Not happy with Microsoft at the best of times. Can you get a disc for this ? Does it really matter if I dont install ?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Well its over a month now and I still can't install the Service Pack on my laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most reliable and quickest way to install Windows 7 SP1 is to install manually</p>
<p>1) Try the SP1 Download:</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c3202ce6-4056-4059-8a1b-3a9b77cdfdda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c3202ce6-4056-4059-8a1b-3a9b77cdfdda</a> &gt;</p>
<p>For 64-Bit Windows 7 download: windows6.1-KB976932-X64.exe 903.2MB</p>
<p><br />
Download, *<b>save</b>*, and install the Service Pack with no security software (antivirus/security suite) installed, disconnect from Internet, disable the fire-wall &amp;
<b>close all non-essential</b> process in the <span>task</span> manager. I also recommend taking off USB keys or any external media as this takes place.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When it is downloaded <b>right-</b>click on the file and select Run As Administrator from the menu.</p>
<p>`~`</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) Run Disk Cleanup.</p>
<p>Start/All programs/Accessories/System Tools/Disk Cleanup. Place check marks in at least the following options: Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin, Temporary files</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3) <b>Turn off your security programs</b>:</p>
<p>First run a “Full Scan” of the Windows partition and then if your Anti-Virus software supports ‘Active scanning’, temporarily disable it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Most AV software will have a menu / settings option to disable real time or active scanning. Don’t forget to enable active scanning after installing SP1.</p>
<p>(When was the last time you checked your system for any malware?) </p>
<p>Besides using an antivirus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a>&gt;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>To turn off your antivirus or antispyware programs</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Close all programs, and then restart your computer.</p>
<p>2. After restarting, turn off all antivirus and antispyware programs that might run during the startup process.
</p>
<p>You can usually turn off the program from the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar. To turn off a program from the notification area,
<b>right-click</b> the program icon, and then click <b>Close</b>, <b>Disable</b>,
<b>Exit</b>, or a similar option. If these options aren't available, you might have to open the program, and then turn it off using options from within the program.</p>
<p><br />
3. As soon as you close the antivirus or the antispyware program, try to install the service pack again.</p>
<p><br />
4. After you've installed the service pack, turn on all antivirus and antispyware programs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4) Run the SFC /SCANNOW command:</p>
<p>This will check and repair if necessary any critical Windows system files prior to installing SP1.</p>
<p>Click on Start/All programs/Accessories then </p>
<p><b>Right-click</b> on Command Prompt option and select 'Run as administrator'.</p>
<p>At the command prompt enter: <i>SFC /SCANNOW</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5) Run the System Update Readiness Tool:</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>Microsoft released the System Update Readiness Tool to resolve certain conditions that could cause installing updates and other software not to work. You do not have to manually run this tool. This tool is offered automatically through Windows Update to
 computers that have a condition that the tool could resolve.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6) Rename the 'Software Distribution folder':</p>
<p>a) Click the Start Button, click 'All programs, and click on 'Accessories'.</p>
<p>b) Next, Right-click on the 'Command Prompt' option and then click 'Run as administrator'.</p>
<p>c) In the 'Command Prompt' window enter: <i>net stop Wuauserv</i> and press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p>d) Next click the Start/Orb button in the taskbar, in the 'Search' box, enter:
<i>%windir%</i> and press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p>e) In Windows Explore view, search for and locate the folder named "SoftwareDistribution".</p>
<p>f) <b>Right-click</b> on the folder and select the 'Rename' option and change the name to:
<i>SoftwareDistributionOld</i></p>
<p>g) Close Windows Explorer and in Command Prompt window enter: <i>net start Wuauserv</i> and press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p>h) Wait for the "Windows Update Service has successfully" before exiting/closing the command prompt window.</p>
<p>i) If you open Windows Explorer you should see that new "SoftwareDistribution" folder has been created.</p>
<p>`~`</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Download, *<b>save</b>*, and install the Service Pack with no security software (antivirus/security suite) installed, disconnect from Internet, disable the fire-wall &amp;
<b>close all non-essential</b> process in the <span>task</span> manager. I also recommend taking off USB keys or any external media as this takes place.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When it is downloaded <b>right-</b>click on the file and select Run As Administrator from the menu.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all the replies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I take my car into the dealership for repair and a recall. The mechanic says to me - have you tried to do it yourself sir because we can't do it ourselves. Here's 4 pages of instructions of what to do. WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT ! I can't imagine for the world
 you would . But that's what Microsoft are trying to do to me . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I printed out one set of the instructions above and got to about page 3 when I had to give up. Whether it was because I'm a 70yr old silver surfer , or whether most lay people would find it difficult, I don't know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However what I've done now is found out I can buy a DVD from Microsoft with the Windows 7 SP1 update on it. I am assuming this will work and so am getting one sent to me. I have ordered it and also sent details of the fact I can't get it installed by update
 or manually - so hope Microsoft will have the decency to reply before they send me the DVD. I LIVE IN HOPE !</p>

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged into halo 5 guardians to play some SWAT. I was ranked Plat (4 or 5). I decided to warm up first though on Master Chief Collection so I switched over. I come back to Guardians, and my SWAT rank is reset and I need to play placement matches again.
 What happened?</p>

<h2>            Windows flashing when scrolled over in taskbar, Alt-Tab not working.</h2>
                    <p>Ok this is driving me absolutely crazy. for the last few weeks my taskbar and alt-tab has been broken. when i scroll over the taskbar the &nbsp;program im trying to open just flashes but never actually maximizes. &nbsp;i have noticed that it only flashes as i move
 my cursor over icon. but if i just leave it on it for it to open on its own it never actually does. Also Alt-Tab is doing the same exact thing (which makes me assume the issue is connected.) i click the buttons and the windows flash but doesnt actually open
 anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have looked around and i know this issue popped up a few years ago with a windows reliablitiy update kb977074, but wasnt in my update list. SOOOOOOOO i now have no idea what to do. ive played around with settings checked for faulty or corrupted files and
 i really dont want to have to do a system restore. specially since ive restored my computer and it was doing it before i updated. so... ideas would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance :)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Have you installed any programs, application or update prior to the issue?</li><li>How did you check faulty or corrupted files of your system? </li><li>Are you getting any error message or error code while using the taskbar?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below mentioned methods and see if it works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Try to perform a full scan of your computer using<strong> Microsoft Safety Scanner.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus
 software.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:
</strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:
</strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue still persists I would suggest you to check system health and for that you might need to run the SFC (</span></span><span><strong>System
 File Checker</strong></span><span><span>) tool.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong> and open <strong>

    <title>computer screen has shrunk after installing Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            computer screen has shrunk after installing Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Original question: Hello..</p>
<p>I have a Dell All-in-One Desktop, model Inspiron 2310. Hard Disk 1Tb. Ram 6GB. CPU : Intel Core i5. It came pre-loaded with Windows 7 Home Premuim. I have downloaded and installed the new Windows 8 Pro. The computer screen has shrunk from all sides and a
 23"monitor is now looking like a 17" screen. Seems the graphic card is "ati mobility radeon HD 5000 series". Seems Dell doesnot support Windows 8 on my system and I have just been fooled by the online Windows Upgrade Assitance which said my system is compatible.
 I am in real soup. Does anyone have a solution ?</p>

            <p><span>Hi NitinLall,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you have a problem with monitor screen after installing windows 8. I will help you troubleshoot the issue. Meanwhile,
 I would like to ask you few questions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the screen resolution of the monitor?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you tried to adjust the setting in the monitor?</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To use Windows 8, the screen resolution should be at least 1024 x 768.
</span></p>
<p><span>To snap apps in Windows 8, you need a screen resolution of at least 1366 x 768.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the graphics driver and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Try to update the Display drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Open the Device Manager by Pressing Windows key + R and typing Devmgmt.msc<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2) Right click on your display adapter and update.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Please run System maintenance troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press Windows key + W on the keyboard</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type Troubleshooter then click onSettings under the Search field</span></p>
<p><span>c) In Settings click onFind and Fix Problems</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on System and security</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click System maintenance follow the prompts from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also install the updated video drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that you
 can utilize to get the issue resolved.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 User Account &#34;Support&#34; created Automatically</h2>
                    
<p>I have no idea how a user called "Support" is created sometimes when I boot up.</p>
<p>I have a home machine, and I am the only person who uses it.</p>
<p>The "Support" user has administrator privileges too, so it worries me.</p>
<p>I delete the user and account and all the files, but the "Support" user keeps returning.</p>
<p>1) How can I find out what is creating this user?</p>
<p>2) Is this user normal?</p>

<p>"Support" is not an inbuilt Windows account but your manufacturer might have loaded some process that creates this account. Here is what you could do:</p>
<p>1. Click Start.<br />
2. Type the three letters cmd into the Search box.<br />
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter<br />
4. Click "Run as Administrator".<br />
5. Type the following commands and press Enter after each:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user support<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see when this account was last used)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user support 1234abcd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To change its password to 1234abcd)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user support /active:no<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To disable the account)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net localgroup administrators support /delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To demote the account)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user support<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To examine the following properties: When last used, when password was last set, if active, what group memberships)</p>
<p>Run the last command once every day in order to get a handle on the situation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
<p>I’m designing web sites after a while and I’m looking for a new laptop. And I have noticed that web site can look different with the same screen resolution in different computers. Why is it so? I used the screen resolution 1366x768px with several different
 laptops running Windows 7 and with one new laptop tested web sites were more narrow. Is the reason

http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/03/21/scaling-to-different-screens</a>. Does it depends on how old the computer is,

<p>
</p><p>Is there any tool for testing web sites etc with different screen resolution if it should be pixel densitive.. I mean I can run it exmple on the big screen and I can decide how big (how many inch) my virtual screen is and how big the screen resolution is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking for 14“ laptop with 1600x900 screen resolution but the web sites looked different with 1366x768 resolution in that computer and in a other new 15.6“ computer. And I’m just confused..</p>

 100MB System Reserved partition on this disk.&nbsp; My system partition has 27GB free space, and my data partition has 60GB free space.&nbsp; During the image backup process, the utility automatically selects my system partition and the System Reserved partition for
 the image.&nbsp; I am NOT selecting to include my data partition in the image.&nbsp; I do notice that the System Reserved partition indicates that it is usig 62MB, which leaves less than 40MB free space.&nbsp; When the image process begins, it immediately fails with the
 error code 0x80780119, indicating that I must have 50MB free space on any partition less than 500MB in total size, and 320MB free on any partition over 500MB in total size.&nbsp; My system partion has well over the 320MB free space, but the System Reserved partition
 does not have the minimum 50MB free space.<br />
<br />
Could the System Reserved parition be the cause of the failed image backup?&nbsp; If so, why would the installation of Windows 7 create a 100MB parition, use 60MB, and then have a requirement for 50MB free space for creating the backup image?

<h2>            Windows XP - Want the Search with the dog</h2>
                    
<p>I used to have the windows search that has the dog in it ( http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/helpandsupport/learnmore/crawford_september03.mspx ), but my computer was reformatted after a virus and I have a different windows search now that really
 doesn't work at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the one with the dog called Windows Search 4.0?&nbsp; In my add/remove programs it's there, and hasn't been used since October (which is just before my computer was reformatted).&nbsp; But if I click on search it goes to the crappy non-dog windows search.&nbsp; Is there
 a way to access this or to download a new one?</p>
<p>Help!&nbsp; Thanks,</p>
<p>Victoria</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Acting Weird</h2>
                    So I've had my surface pro 3 for 3 days now. It worked perfectly in the past 2 days but this morning when I booted it up after I had shut it down last night, it started going crazy! The logo would come up and then read "Please wait while we install updates"
 so I patiently waited... It then decided to restart and then the logo popped up and said "Please wait while we install updates" again! I thought it was a bit strange. I had to wait about 15 minutes for this entire thing to finally show the lock menu! When
 I swiped up to unlock and type in my password, the screen began jiggling up and down without me even touching it. It finally stopped after a few minutes... I then unlocked it and began figuring out if something was wrong. Well my touch screen is now half working.
 It takes multiple touches for it recognize what I'm trying to do and the pen only works half the time too. I don't know what is up with the Surface Pro 3 after the 3rd day... I wasn't on any suspicious sites! However, I hav

<p>Try refreshing the device. It seems that you interrupted a firmware update.</p>

<p>Its also important to note that...this is normal activity when installing a big update.&nbsp; If you interrupt this Please Wait cycle....it will go back into that cycle on reboot.&nbsp; Just let it run....see how long it takes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would assume you have installed all the updates....but so did I Friday night. Woke up to a huge install....showing what you are seeing.&nbsp; It rebooted no less than 6 times, before it finally finished.&nbsp; I went into history to see what it installed....turns
 out the firmware update I 'thought' was installed on Friday, failed.&nbsp; It installed yesterday morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally its not a good idea to interrupt that download install process, unless you are prepared for the alternative.&nbsp;&nbsp; IMO, for now anyway, the crazy activity you are saying the Surface is doing....is normal....its doing what its supposed to be doing....</p>

            <p>I faced the same problem on my device now the second time. 4 weeks ago it happened and today it happened again. I can confirm that the problem resolved itself after 5 or 6 reboots. To me this looks like a bug in the Bluetooth driver as it can be clearly
 seen that mouse position, keystrokes and click events are&nbsp;somehow "produced". It seems that Windows itself detected the problem after some time and silently reverts to an old driver after a few reboots. However, the problem is to get the system rebooted as
 it's almost unusable when this happens: keystrokes are sent wildly, mouse position changes and so on.</p>
<p>I found a movie on YouTube which shows the effect (it was not uploaded by me):</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxwruqYQNiY</p>
<p>This means this is not a unique effect but happens regularly on a lot of devices!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this not fixed meanwhile?? Is it that complicated to get Windows compatible to the *own* MS devices like S3Pro? I mean we don't talk about some 3rd party box with an exotic hardware combination ...</p>
<p>Please, MS, fix that and ensure that these users don't need to regret their decision to buy an S3Pro.</p>

    <title>Missing Tool Bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larrydelplanche  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Tool Bar</h2>
                    <p>I have a Acer Aspire Laptop using Windows 10. When I purchased it there was an Acer Tool Bar at the top of the screen when I clicked on IE. That tool bar had an App for Translation. When using a web site from a European country such as France all I would
 need to do was click on the App and a dropdown would appear&nbsp;and I could click "Dutch &gt; English"; the same for Email through a Web site and the pages would Translate. Very easy to use for any Translation.&nbsp;I have been doing this for 3+ years. This past week
 a automatic update hit my Laptop; from Microsoft I assume and&nbsp;now I no longer have the Acer Tool Bar. I can not find it anywhere in my programs. I took my Laptop into Office Depot and their Technician could not find that Tool Bar. Now its Christmas Time and
 I have several Cousins in France and Belgium that I can not communicate with. I need some ideas as to recovering that Tool Bar; better still , where did it disappear to? Is this another Compatibility issue with Windows 10?
