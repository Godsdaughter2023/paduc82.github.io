<h2>            Outlook Express files export to Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Please bare with me.&nbsp; Have a new computer with windows 7. established a Gmail account and no problems having access to the different accounts.</p>
<p>I do have an enormous amount of e-mails stored in personal folders. Is there a process to transfer the folders to gmail/Win 7?</p>
<p>Hopefully I asked the question correctly and didn't come thru garbled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>If they are in Outlook Express folders, then this should work.</p>
<p>Transferring data from Outlook Express to Windows Live Mail:</p>
<p>For Messages:</p>
<p>Copy the *ENTIRE* OE message store folder to a flash drive. (Folders.dbx must be included). Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail. Open WLMail and: File | Import | Messages | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 and point to where
 you saved it.</p>
<p>OE Message Store Location:</p>
<p>In OE: Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Addresses:</p>
<p>Open the Address Book in OE and File | Export | Address Book (wab) and save it to the Desktop. Copy to a flash drive. Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail.</p>
<p>Open the Contacts list in WLMail, (Go | Contacts on the Menu Bar), and File | Import | Windows Address Book (wab) and point to where you saved it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you use a CD or DVD instead of a flash drive, after placing on the new machine you must remove the Read Only attribute in Properties before you import.</p>
<p>For Account Settings:</p>
<p>In OE: Tools | Accounts, select the account and export it to the Desktop. This will be a .iaf file. Copy it to the new machine's Desktop and in WLMail: Tools | Accounts and import the settings from the location you saved them.</p>

            <p>Hi Tayson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Windows 10 is new most of the drivers may not be available which are compatible with Windows 10. However, you can run the previous version of sound drivers in compatibility mode and check. You may refer to the steps from the article below:</p>

 holds good for Windows 10 as well)</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Play Rocket League since the update, going for a month now.</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon,</p><p><br /></p><p>Hello, I've been having a problem in&nbsp;Rocket League since the last update (now going for almost a month). The problem in concept is that it doesn't show any online game choice. When I go to the Game: Rocket League, every single time I try to play online, it displays the usual settings:</p><p> LB Casual/Competitive RB</p><p>&nbsp;but it never loads the options 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 3v3 solo standard, nether do the Casual section, Also down below the Find Match button, it shows: Please Select A Playlist, when clearly I don't have that option&nbsp;do to the fact the loading screen never ends.</p><p><br /></p><p>I've tried to uninstall the game several times, and nothing seems to work, also my brother also haves an Xbox and he doesn't have the same issues (so its not do to our internet connection).</p><p><br /></p><p>It's really starting to bother because I was truly exited for the Rank Hard Reset (Almost a Month Ago), and now I cant even play the new Hall

            <p><em>"Why did Microsoft come up with an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
improved system</span> that locks out all the good programs I had? "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>lol (Sorry! we have to laugh or cry.)... But yes! MS has come up with something that is causing much
</p>
<p>more angst and gnashing of teeth than they imagined (unless they are involved in a conspiracy, and getting</p>
<p>kick backs from&nbsp; on line game retailers who are re-releasing old games without the original DRM like they</p>
<p>are going out of style. Or is that, have come back in style ? ).</p>
<p>(I have CFS2 , Crimson Skies, and they are plagued by this despicable overlording by MS. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>DRM blocking. Yes! After all these years, Monopoly$oft has suddenly determined that a lot of older DRM
</p>
<p>that came with retail disk versions of games is a security threat, and Win10 blocks those DRM, resulting in</p>
<p>no play.</p>
<p>And like early on, when various DRM caused lots of problems for legitimate buyers of games, they now want</p>
<p>to kick these same legitimate buyers in the teeth, and have them pay again for a re-release of their old games.</p>
<p>Honest people are being extorted while the Pirates are still laughing.<br />
</p>
<p>With Win10, at least until they hopefully decide that we can be in control of our own destiny, the only way</p>
<p>around this problem is to use a noCD fix/hack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some were&nbsp; suggesting dual-booting with Win7, but now they have released a Security update for Win7/8/8.1
</p>
<p>that does the same DRM blocking. </p>
<p>Fortunately with these OS's the DRM blocking can be disabled via special Command Prompts.</p>
<p>With Win7 you can also uninstall the back stabbing - KB2919355 &amp; 3086255 'Security Updates',</p>
<p>but Win8/8.1 won't be allowed to get future Security updates if you don't have KB2919355,
</p>
<p>so the command prompts are the only 'fix'.</p>
<p>(for future reference, should you revert to your previous OS) -</p>

    <title>Continual Win 7 SP1 installation failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luke1992  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continual Win 7 SP1 installation failure</h2>
                    After nearly a collective 50 hours trying to diagnose and fix the issue myself, I've given up and am hoping a wizard here can help me solve it.
<br />
<br />
I'm running Win 7 Starter on an Asus Eee PC and Secunia started reminding me that I needed to DL SP1. Sure enough, it was in my to-do Windows Update list. I had a suite of other needed updates, so tried to DL them all at once. DL either failed at a certain
 percentage or perpetually hanged at 0%. I then cleaned out the Software Distribution folder and tried DLing the updates again, one at a time. Each worked fine, until I came to the SP1 download. It either very quickly failed and showed the error 80070005 or
 got to about 90% and then failed showing the error 8024200D. <br />
<br />
Pursuant to internet advice, I ran the sfc /scannow function in cmd (no problems) and then the chkdsk /r /f command. It told me it would perform the task upon reboot but when I did, I get a black screen and have to wait 30mins-2hrs before the login screen reappears
 (and I find the chkdsk function hadn't actually been performed). I also tried to repair C: after being told it had errors with IObit Disk Doctor but that suffered the same issue.<br />
<br />
I've also downloaded the Update Readiness Tool and MS FixIt. Once URT was downloaded, nothing happened (is this normal) and the latter, while identifying there was an issue with WinUpdate, couldn't solve it.<br />
<br />
The only other relevant points I can make is that I don't seem to have downloaded the blackhole update, I use anti-virus diligently but have tried to update with it disabled (MSE), and often use optimisation software such as Advanced System Care and Revo Uninstaller
 (could it be a registry problem?)<br />
<br />
Please, please can someone help.<br />
<br />

<p>Hey there guys! Here's a couple basic troubleshooting tips you can try here. First, if your game is installed to the HDD, try deleting it and reinstalling. If you haven't installed it, try doing that now. Also make sure you test your disc on another console
 and try a different disc on your console. This will help us narrow down where the problem is. Let me know how that works out. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 single language &#40;X64&#41;</h2>
                    When I bought my laptop recently, i bought win 8.1 single language (x64) version (genuine). It was installed by the supplier and was successfully activated. But when I wanted to add new&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;more
 features with a new edition of windows on the system screen, my product key was not accepted ('key won't work...'). I checked the product key which came with the disk against Belarc Report. Although the keys match it says '</span><span>‘<strong>this
 may be the manufacturer’s factory installed product key rather than yours</strong>’. With this version I cannot get any updates. Advice will be greatly appreciated. TDS_838</span>

<p>Many thanks for the response. I would also like to know why the product key on the disk, 'manufacturer's factory installed product key" is wrong when I enter it in the product key section. What is the difference between this key and the "correct key" which
 the computer is asking for?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Bill is saying is that you can't add features with your original key...</p>
<p>That's why it is not accepting it when you try...&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with your key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, to add Features like Media Center, or Upgrade to Pro, you are actually changing your version of Windows...&nbsp;Which requires a NEW key...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to go through the process of purchasing the new feature before you can use the Add New Feature function...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My example... I started with Win 8 Pro... I wanted Media Center... I purchased the Media Center upgrade and was issued a new key as part of the process...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then had to&nbsp;use Add Features and enter the new key I was furnished...</p>
<p>After a period of time and some downloading, I rebooted my machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Properties it no longer said Windows 8 Pro... It now says Windows 8 Pro With Media Center... If I were to now use your Belarc tool, I would see a different license&nbsp;than before...</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can't guarantee you won't need to contact Microsoft before everything is all done, but you shouldn't have a problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Single Language is pretty much the standard edition, but I suppose that some of the various language versions may have different issues with the upgrade...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to contact Microsoft concerning the Media Center Upgrade key with one of my machines, and the other upgraded without a problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time there was a promotion for a Free Upgrade to Media Center, and there were a lot of counterfeit keys that were trying to be used...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can say that I am sure that Microsoft will make it right if you have issues...</p>
<p>Make sure your current version is properly activated before starting...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi there Paras,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well drivers can be a funny thing. Specially when laptop manufactures not always keep driver up to date for the individual type of laptop for a specific OS like Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I would suggest You tried running the agent from Intel:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect/graphics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect/graphics</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It can help You with the right driver for the correct Windows system and if it's 32 or 64bit :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Frank</p>

    <title>Disable public folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lymbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable public folders</h2>
                    <p>So<br />
I recently installed win10, coming from win7, and i set it up to my liking.</p>
<p>One of the things i did was moving all user folders such as downloads or desktop to D:, and because i hate seeing any icons on my desktop, i hide them, and when i need, i open the desktop folder.</p>
<p>But when i went to look for the links created from my programs, they were missing, and i found them in the public folder.</p>
<p>As i use the PC alone, i have no need for anything public, so my question is, can i disable the public folders? or at least set so everything goes to the private folder?</p>
<p>I don`t want to keep searching in 2 different places for stuff on desktop, documents, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account for Minor</h2>
                    Greetings, I got a brand new laptop for my granddaughter. Instead of using my Microsoft account to set it up, I instead created one for her. Now everything I try to do to complete the configuration, which includes web access, will not happen until an adult
 provides verification. This laptop is a requirement for her middle school. I need to somehow delete her Microsoft account and set up a family one, I guess, with me as administrator. I have not been able to delete her account and start over. What can I do to
 fix this and how would I set this up for her? Thanx!

<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows
 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9,
 F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This is how the recovery
 partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Dell, press CTRL +

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For HP, press F11 directly
 after powering up the unit</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For LG, press F11 directly

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Toshiba, press and
 hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Acer, press and hold
 ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Asus, press F9 as soon

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Fujitsu, press the

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Advent, restart your
 computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Sony VAIO, restart
 and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After you reinstall Windows 10, follow the instructions to complete the Out of Box Experience. I would advise you first setup a local Administrator account, then setup a separate account for your daughter.

<h2>            Face Recognition not working, wake-up camera won&#39;t turn on - AutoDesk products</h2>
                    Surfacebook. I downloaded Revit 2019 student version and my face recognition unlocking feature stopped working. The red light turned off. I reset my laptop so Revit 2019 wasn't on there anymore and everything worked fine. I re-downloaded Revit because
 I need it and it stopped working again. This issue also occurred with AutoCAD 2019.&nbsp;

    <title>Does your Day 1 Edition not read discs&#63; Easy FIX&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> biobelisk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does your Day 1 Edition not read discs&#63; Easy FIX&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So about a year ago, my Xbox One Day 1 edition started to not read discs. It was all discs, whether it be games, Blue Ray, or DVD. I was worried, it would eventually read it, if I kept inserting disc, in and out and listening to the noises the Xbox would
 make. You know the noise it makes when you insert a disc as it loads it. If you had the error I did, it made a real weird like grinding noise and would not load a disc.</p>

<p>I made a claim with Microsoft, who did send me a prepaid shipping label and were going to fix it under warranty. But I wanted to keep my Day One edition as I read on the terms that you might not get the same system back.</p>

<p>One day between trying to make time to pack the Xbox, and still trying to play it, I accidentally, held the disc a second or 2 asit tired to pull the disc in. It read the disc! Coincidence? NO. I did this again, holding the disc back just a second as it
 pulled it in, BAM, it read it, no noise. I tired this multiple times, and it worked first shot, EVERYTIME!!!!</p>

<p>My Day One edition works like a charm now for a year doing this method. Reads it first try, everytime. &nbsp;I know the Day 1's are out of warranty now, so if yours starts to do this, try this method..... And enjoy your Xbox Day 1 edition. Who knows, do the&nbsp;not
 day one editions do this too? Some of them? Try this method too.</p>

<p>Should have just sent it off for repair, what is special about a day one console? I got mine day one and as far as im aware only the controller sets it apart which you wouldnt have sent off anyway. That being said if this works for those outside warranty,
 its a useful piece of info to know</p>

<p>It's not the biggest of deals, but it is not said if I get the HD back, and if I don't I lose all my progress is why I didn't send it out.
</p>
<p>Plus when it started, Destiny just came out, and I just couldn't wait 2 weeks like a child to get it there and back. I know I should have sent it out, and I do know there is obviously something wrong, BUT, some of these units are out of warranty (I am not
 complaining its my fault I did not send it in, this is not a rant, its meant to help someone), unless like mentioned above that you bought the extended warranty, I just thought it might help a few people play their un-working systems.</p>
<p>Nothing sets the Day One and regular systems apart, except a cheesy accomplishment, sticker, controller that says Day One, a black box, and came with Kinect.

<p>Its good you took the time to post and it might just help someone out, im currently on my 4th xbox one due to drive issues like you mention, may of been useful to try in between sending them off, May be worth noting your save data is stored in the cloud
 so you wouldnt lose it, only thing is having to re-install/dowload the games, which i was able to avoid the last time after having bought an external hdd. Hope it continues to work for you.</p>

<p>Using a pc. The problem was effectively the NBA add.</p>
<p>There was also another add (car add) that was doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Since those where removed, no more freezing problem.</p>
<p>Obviously there must b something in the code that run those adds to create that freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as of now, no more freezing, will c if the NBA and car adds return if it was corrected.</p>

<p><span>Wrong answer, Ryan.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Running the troubleshooter doesn’t fix the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It won’t fix it today, just as it didn’t work last month and the month before that when Catherine Cus, Jomari Arc and Nyima Yonten each recommended it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The jerky piece movements and game freezes has been and continues to be a software error related to the how Windows 10 handles the ads in the bottom right corner of the game.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You would know that if you had bothered to check previous customer complaints about Jigsaw or had taken 10 seconds out of your day to do a Google search of “Microsoft Jigsaw freezes”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This has been going on for several months now and has only gotten worse with each update of Windows 10.</span></p>

<h2>            Forcing a delete on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up a new Windows 10 after a huge system crash. I used linux to recover my data. Since I did not want to copy Windows System files and similar I deleted them from Linux. They got moved to a .Trash folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a new install of Windows 10 I wanted to delete this .Trash folder. It is not possible. Nether from Windows nor from Linux nor in Safe mode nor with power shell remove item -force nor with command del /f nor with IObit unlocker. I tried to add me as
 owner or to change rights. But as soon as I try to inherit this to the subfile subfolder my permission gets denied. I have admin rights and I executed explorer as admin as well.</p>
<p>I am running out of Ideas.</p>

            Since they are created by Ubuntu, they should be deleted using Ubuntu. 
<br />
<br />(This is created if the drive is connected to a Linux. This is the location where the deleted files/folders are stored, if shift+delete is not used or completely deleted from the trash bin.) 
<br />
<br />
<br />Try to empty the paperbin or delete the folder with the terminal-command as root:
<br />
<br />" sudo rm -rf /path/to/folder/.Trash-1000 "
<br />

<p>Hi Ganesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I thought the same.</p>
<p>But apparently, you cannot delete Windows files from a Windows sys partition even as Sudo. I tried to change the rights and attributes. But permission was denied .&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Group emails not working in Windows live mail.</h2>
                    <p>I have a user who we just updated from outlook express to Windows Live Mail 12. I imported all her contacts which contain a lot of groups. They all look fine but we have found when sending an email selecting the group just from the email window it shows
 the group name but it only send the email to one emails in the group. We have tried deleting and re-entered the group but it still does the same thing. We have found that if we click To&nbsp; and the address book comes up then select the group and click the plus
 sign from the window then it sends the email to all the email recipients. This adds a step to sending the email which does not seem like much but when you are sending 80 a day it adds up. Please let me know if there is a fix for this issue.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p>This is a known defect in Windows Live Mail 2012. The method you seem to have hit upon is documented in this article:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/wiki/livemail-email/send-a-group-email-in-windows-live-mail-2012/cd98d675-e117-4425-bc44-09c10b8bb18f">
<p>
</p><p>I realize that this adds a couple of clicks to each message, which will soon become tedious for a heavy user of the function. It might be better in her case to create one or more templates, especially if those 80 group emails aren't all different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start a new mail message (Ctrl-N) and&nbsp;enter the bits that don't change, or don't change much, e.g.&nbsp;addressees, subject, body, pictures, signature and attachments. Format to suit, then press F12 to save the message as an .eml file in a convenient place, like
 the desktop. The&nbsp;<em>Save message As</em>&nbsp;dialogue will by default apply the subject line as the filename; edit this to suit.&nbsp;Double-clicking on this file will open a new message ready for completing and sending.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately you need to do a clean Installation of Windows 8.1 by downloading the ISO from here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/home</a></p>
<p>It would remove your all of &nbsp;installed programs etc etc. Make a backup of your files and other stuff you need to a separate drive.</p>

            Hi HughMul,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your responses.<br />
<br />
There is no beta version of the driver provided by Microsoft.&nbsp; If you browse to the video card manufacturer's website and search for their drivers you might check if there is a different revision of it there.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:&nbsp; </strong>
<div><strong>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using

<br />
</strong>Loading drivers and any older drivers is not a supported task by Microsoft, any usage of a third party driver is done at the user's own risk.<br />
<br />
You might also try this option;<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Installing in Compatiblity mode with Windows 7 RC</strong></span>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Method 1<br />
</span></span><span><span>---------------</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Download the latest driver for the device to a folder on your desktop.<br />
<br />
Install&nbsp;the driver using compatibility mode (using Vista or XP)? or using the TROUBLESHOOT COMPATIBILITY tool.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Navigate to the .EXE (of the driver you downloaded to the folder on the desktop)&nbsp;
<br />
2.&nbsp; Right Click the .EXE driver and to Run the TROUBLESHOOT COMPATIBILITY tool - select TROUBLESHOOT COMPATIBILITY<br />
or<br />
2.&nbsp; (Cont'd) Right click on the .EXE (installer to install the driver) and select Properties<br />
3.&nbsp; If you chose to run the Troubleshoot Compatibility tool - if Windows finds a possible solution it will respond with "TRY WINDOWS RECOMMENDED SETTINGS" and "CUSTOMIZE SETTINGS"&nbsp;.&nbsp; Choose Try Windows Recommended Settings to use the driver setting Windows
 suggest.<br />
or, after selecting Properties<br />
3.&nbsp;Select the&nbsp;Compatibility tab -&gt; "Run the program..."<br />
3. Select Windows Vista or XP, and click OK<br />
4. Try running the installer.<br />
<br />
If neither the TROUBLESHOOT COMPATIBILITY tool or installing the driver in Compatibility mode works.<br />
<br />
You may consider using the Virtual PC to try to get the printer to be seen in Windows.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Method 2<br />
</span></span><span><span>--------------<br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
We are just beginning the Release Candidate phase of the beta and this is typically the time when the base code of the new OS is considered 'code complete' which means that few changes, other than bug fixes that can be implemented without radical changes to
 the code,&nbsp;will be performed.<br />
<br />
This is also the beta phase when hardware manufacturers will complete work on building their drivers for the new OS, without the need to worry about any major changes in the code interfering. As a result, during this phase you will typically see an acceleration
 in the availability of new hardware&nbsp;drivers.<br />
<br />
If this device is critical for you, there is another solution that does not involve any expense, as long as you have a qualifying system.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The
</span><strong><span>Windows Virtual PC</span></strong><span> is a new freely available program that is designed for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
This comes with a </span><strong><span>specially configured VHD
</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(Virtual Hard Drive) called
</span><strong><span>XP Mode, </span></strong><span>Which is a specially configured, fully licensed version of Windows XP.<br />
<br />
When configured properly you can install a program/hardware device, with drivers&nbsp;designed to run on Windows XP and it will place a shortcut to the program directly on the Windows 7 Start Menu.

            Hi Krizzern,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to "Getting Ready for Windows 7" community forum.<br />
<br />
If a driver you are installing has not been made available for Windows 7, you may be able to install the driver in compatibility mode.&nbsp; The functionality of the device may not be at total capacity, only waiting for the official release of the driver would enable
 that, however, you may try the following steps to try to get your device to work on this platform.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:&nbsp; </strong>
<div>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third
 Party Software is at your own risk.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Download the most current revision - whether that be Vista or XP - of the driver from the manufacturers website, into a folder on the desktop of the system.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Once it is downloaded, navigate to the equivalent of the setup.exe file in the folder.&nbsp; Right click the file and select "TROUBLESHOOT COMPATIBILITY".<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; The Troubleshoot Compatibility wizard will analyze the driver and the system configuration to try to determine if the device
<strong><em>MIGHT</em></strong>&nbsp; have a workaround for operating in Windows 7.&nbsp; If it finds a possible workaround it will present it as "TRY WINDOWS RECOMMENDED SETTINGS" .&nbsp; The other option it will provide is CUSTOMIZE SETTINGS - in which the user defines
 how it wants the driver installed.&nbsp; In this case use the "TRY RECOMMENDED SETTINGS" to check if there is a possible workaround for the driver.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this assists in resolving the issue or if further assistance is needed.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />

<h2>            How can I stop my photos from being corrupted when I upload them to my dell pc with windows vista&#63;</h2>
                    Recently when I attempt to upload pictures from my Nikon coolpix l18 to my dell inspiron 1420 using my built in card reader, many of the photos have been corrupted. Though they look perfectly fine on my camera, once they appear on my computer half the
 picture is gone and replaced with a grey line. Why is this happening and how can I combat it? The camera is brand new and my computer is 2 years old. I have never had any pictures corrupted before.

========================================<br />
Could it be a corrupted memory card?<br />
<br />
Have you tried downloading the photos to a different computer <br />
just to verify that the corruption is occurring after or during <br />
download and not in the camera? <br />
<br />
If you insert the card and go to...Start / Computer...and left<br />
click the drive letter for the Removable Disk that represents the <br />
memory card slot...can you copy the pictures from there to a <br />
folder on your hard drive? Are they still corrupted?
