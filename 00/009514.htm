<h2>            Rebuild search index in Outlook 2013 with Exchange</h2>
                    <p>The search function in Outlook does not find emails that are there (I can see them by just scrolling through the emails).&nbsp;&nbsp;Search will return some results; they're just incomplete.&nbsp; I've tried rebuilding the index more than once, but each time&nbsp;it comes back
 almost instantaneously telling me the rebuild&nbsp;is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp; (It should take several hours,&nbsp;instead of a few seconds.) &nbsp;I've read through the other posts on the indexing issue, but none seem to address this issue of the rebuild not actually running.&nbsp; Anybody
 got a suggestion?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Have you already tried recreating the ost-file?<br />
Rename it to&nbsp;.old when Outlook is closed and then start Outlook again. Wait until everything has been re-cached and then rebuild the Search Index again.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 Safe To Update To FW V50</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just got a replacement Nokia 5800 from Vodafone today as the last 2 weeks its been sent in for repair may have seen my other post on it's problem, anyways they couldn't fix it gave me a replacement 5800. I was using a temp Nokia 1661 and I recieved
 a text from Nokia I believe saying a new firmware was out for my Nokia 5800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I have only just got it back I just wanna know if it's worth updating currently I'm using FW V31. And apart from that new Music Library I dont think its really worth the update if thats all it mainly does.</p>

                </div>

<p>I don't have 5800, but generally it's ALWAYS worth updating. You would never gat an update that would simply update music player, ther will be many unseen stability improvements and bug fixes, if you read most of the blogs they will all recommend it !</p>

<p>The choice is yours, but I would do it, also if you've just got the phone, soft reset as well then you've got a brand new phone with brand new software :smileywink:</p>

            Since you would be updating from v31, you get a new homescreen option and kinetic scrolling all over the interface.<br />
<br />
However, apart from that it adds an embedded Ovi Maps 3.03, meaning it wont eat 15mb off your phone memory anymore. Also the alarm clock bug that plagued many users in v31 was fixed, along with other stability features.

            Its not mandatory. Its still your choice. The only additions I can find is<br />
<br />
1. Embedded Ovi Maps 3.03, meaning it wont eat up 13-15mb of your phone memory anymore<br />
<br />
2. Kinetic Scrolling all over including main menu<br />
<br />
3. New web browser<br />
<br />
4. The contacts bar homescreen eats less RAM<br />
<br />
5. N97/X6 music player with album art view in the library (find function is gone though).

<p>Upgrade improves the 5800&nbsp; .</p>
<p>But be prepared for problems in that things change&nbsp; and you wont know what they are .</p>
<p>Swipe unlock .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Bugs reported are 99% user error .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But one point to note is that you cannot roll the firmware back .no downgrade path .</p>

            Hi Keith, 
<br />
<br />Does it block the templates themselves, or the sites to get to the templates?
<br />
<br />You could always download them on phone, upload to a cloud service drive, and then download them from there. 
<br />
<br />Kind of a long work around, but has worked for me in the past. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            No problem. Even though it's a long cut, I feel like that'll be your best shot. Download the templates on your home box, and either email them to yourself, drop them in your google drive, wherever. And see if one of those routes is accessible at work.

    <title>Office 2013 Upgrade Offer not working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 2013 Upgrade Offer not working.</h2>
                    <p>I've purchased Office 2010 Professional, and want to redeem my upgrade to Office 2013 Professional (not Office 365).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I signed in to the Office.com/offer site with my Microsoft ID, clicked "Redeem Now," filled out the form (including my Office 2010 Product Key), and hit the "Get Started" button, I was taken to a screen which stated that I had no Office products in
 my account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific message text: <strong>It looks like you don’t have Office yet. Do you want to visit the Store to get a copy?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I'd like to download my upgrade!&nbsp; I can provide proof of purchase--online from "buycheapsoftware.com," a Microsoft online reseller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone provide advice?</p>

I just got off the Answer Desk, and they suggested that Windows 8's integration with Microsoft Account might be the cause of the problem.&nbsp; On the form with the "Get Started" button, they suggested I log out of MS Account, then log back in; I believe that the
 tech attempted to run the redeem process on his end, and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll give this a try in the next couple of days.&nbsp; I did get a case # in case I need to contact them again; hopefully, that will be sufficient proof that I attempted a redemption.</p>

I think I may just say f--- it!!! Micro$oft is motivated by one thing and one thing onlly..<strong>GREED</strong>! You get
<strong>NOTHING</strong> without getting out your wallet!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I've vented, I tried logging off and logging back in on a Windows 8 VM (upon which I installed Word and Excel from Office 2010, then activated it after thinking that the copy needed to be activated in order to redeem the offer), and also attempted
 the redemption process on the Windows 7 host PC. (I understand that one of the two will have to be uninstalled--I just want to obtain the installation files OR permission to be able to download/"stream-install" the new version at some future point after redeeming
 this offer! Such as if/when my workplace upgrades to 2013.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else you would recommend? Clicking "Contact support" only gets me phone numbers, and I've read the horror stories of being on-hold forever! (If nothing else, I know what I'll be doing tomorrow evening--sitting by the phone for several hours!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for "venting"--all I want is the software which I'm due!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do recall that I attempted to sign up for the E-Mail notification at some point, but was unsuccessful--I've seen numerous posts stating that the site was messed-up, so I didn't try again.&nbsp; Is THAT the problem?&nbsp; There's nothing about entering a special
 code or anything that I could see in the redemption screens.&nbsp; If SOMETHING in that "pre-registration" process was the key, do I have ANY recourse?&nbsp; According to the support tech from last evening, either that chat functionality or the phone is the only way
 to contact Micro$oft Support, no E-Mail (to which I could forward my online receipt).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, any assistance is appreciated.</p>

Yes, you have to install and activate your 2010 to qualify.<br />
<br />
No, you do NOT HAVE to uninstall 2010 when you install 2013, that is just the (MS) preferred default route, not manditory.<br />
<br />
No, AFIK the 2013 "upgrade" does not replace your 2010 license (unlike upgrades to 2007 and earlier), it is an additional "free" license. You will be able to run both 2010 and 2013.<br />

            The Link explains reasons for opening files in Protected View and what to do when that happens, which was helpful. However, it does not explain&nbsp;how a file can be declared unsafe because it came from the Internet when it did not come from the Internet.

            Yes. I did choose Outlook CSV format. I even export to a feature phone (using vcard) which works out fine. But after I upload the file in Outlook it always runs into a problem at some stafe. If it manages to extract contacts there are several copies of
 a single contact. Tge importing never gets finished.&nbsp;

            Well, there is no setting or Preference in Excel that would enable/cause it to launch on startup of the Mac. Launching on startup is an OS X operation. The suggestions given cover the most likely cause but there are other possibilities. However, you've
 still not clarified your update level of Office 2008 nor mentioned your version &amp; update level of OS X, so it's difficult to be sure what to pursue.<br />
<br />
Start with the basics:<br />
<ol>
<li>Make sure your version of OS X is fully updated</li><li>Make sure Office 2008 is fully updated (12.3.0)</li><li>Repair Disk Permissions</li><li>Determine whether any Automator workflows may be involved</li><li>Check for any utilities/haxies that may be at fault</li></ol>
To pursue any further, though, you'll need to provide the missing info, the results of the steps taken thus far, as well as any additional details you can offer... I.e., Is it a specific file that opens in Excel or is it a new blank workbook each time? Details
 are important.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Clutter, Conversation History, RSS Subscriptions Not Useful</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft.</p>
<p>I desperately want to remove Clutter, Conversation History, RSS Subscriptions form my Office 365 Inbox as they are useless clutter (ironic huh).&nbsp; I have my own folders that I use and these system folders get in my way.&nbsp; Paying customers of this product should
 have more options to turn off features not needed and get them out of the way.&nbsp; I have been a user of Office products for many years and have never been more dissatisfied with your product.&nbsp; The constant interference with useless features is truly frustrating.&nbsp;
 I believe a great software gets out of the way and lets the customer work in their best fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please advise when these features can be turned off and removed.&nbsp;
</p>

<br />
There is no future date for such features turned off and removed functionality is available at this time. Regarding the turn off feature please visit the link to request options,
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Suggestion Box</a> to leave your feedback or suggestion to improve our products feature. Many features of current programs have been designed and upgraded based on customers’
 feedback. <br />

Regarding this we would truly appreciate your kind understanding. <br />

            <p>Thank you for the response.&nbsp; I realize they cannot be turned off.&nbsp; My suggestion to Microsoft is to stop building in features that cannot be turned off.&nbsp; Your statement that changes are made due to customer feedback is what is flawed by research.&nbsp; The vast
 majority of users never give feedback, their feedback is "continued use and re-purchase of the product." telling the business that the product is good&nbsp;as it is.&nbsp; When changes are made, they should be optional to the customer so we can tailor the products to
 our needs not the needs of a few squeaky wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that these are SYSTEM folders and cannot be turned off is absurd.&nbsp; They were not there before and the product worked perfectly.&nbsp; Therefore the program engineers can figure out a way to make
 them OPTIONAL&nbsp;and thus be turned off and hidden.&nbsp; In this manner, you can make all of your customers happy and that is always a good thing,&nbsp; By the way, thank you for the link.&nbsp; It times out and does not connect so I will try again later to leave feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindest Regards</p>

            <p>You have to realize that the program groups at Microsoft have the notion that whatever they create is the next best thing since sliced bread. So why would we ever want to disable Clutter? It's so great and awesome! As you, and many have realized it isn't,
 but they are still going to think that way. So for now we are stuck with all those folders that we don't need or want as how could we not want to use them? Right? Yeah... right...</p>
<p>I believe (no facts) that their customer research is limited to Microsoft employees beta testing new features for them.</p>

            I have to agree, these folders are becoming a nuisance - especially when you can't hide them or deactivate them when they are never going to be used. You can't even drag them into another folder to hide them, they just pop out again! Sort it out Microsoft!

<p><span>I use the app outlook.com on my Samsung Nexus S, Android 4.1. </span></p>
<p><span>downloading of mails is not complete and I get for nearly EVERY mail an error-message ("connection failed error") -&gt; therefore mails seem not to be downloaded and I can not read the entire new mails;

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Further, the a</span><span>pp is not user-friendly compared to the old Hotmail-App regarding:</span></p>
<p><span>it is not easily visible when new mails are available as it was in Hotmail-App (e.g. new mails should clearly appear in a different colour to distinguish new from old mails);
</span></p>
<p><span>it is not possible to zoom in mails;</span></p>
<p><span>it is not possible to change/customize the character size, therefore on one glance it is not possible to see the complete sender or the mail itself. maybe there is a possibility to change the size but I did not find a way in the app to customize it.<br />

            I am having a related problem. Device is a Samsung Galaxy S 4G. The Outlook.com app will not logon my Microsoft account even though we have tried it probably 15 times. It works fine on 2 HTC phones we have. My husband is suspecting a problem with Samsung
 phones. It would be really helpful to resolve this.<br />

            <p>Hi MaryReynolds_RS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are also having the same issue about setting up your Microsoft account using the Outlook.com app. I would like to inform that our product specialists are currently investigating errors/bugs that customers are experiencing when using
 the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since they are still working on a resolution, we advise that you temporarily log in your account through any of these options:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Using your phone's default mail app (EAS)
</span></li><li>
<div>
<span>Your phone's web browser (m.outlook.com)</span></div>
</li></ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>At this moment, we were unable to identify if Samsung phones are causing this to happen. Should you have other queries about setting up your account through any device, feel free to post it here.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>Hi KR,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Per my understanding, your organization has discontinued Office 365 email services and is currently using third-party domain hosting service and email service. Now, you would like to use another third-party CRM and send emails from there. In this situation,
 we suggest posting the query in <a href="https://www.apptivo.com/community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the related support channel</a> here from the third party.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If anything misunderstood, please let us know with some related screenshots and a specific example of "Now we are starting to use Apptivo CRM and need to send emails from there as well as from Outlook Off 365".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Hi Frans,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the screenshot, it seems that the DNS records are not set up correctly. You may need to visit the official inmotion hosting website and find out the correct setup for DNS records in Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have gathered all the information you need to create Office 365 DNS records, please refer to the link below to verify the records:</p>

            <p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've received confirmation from MS that they can reproduce crashes when switching aspect ratios. I've got a feeling that the sporadic problem you are seeing, even though you are not crashing, is somehow related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do me a favor and use the Smiley control, change it to a frown and report what you are observing to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first reported the problem MS was not able to reproduce it. However, I told them to use the View &gt; Slide Size control and switch the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3 on a blank presentation. Then immediately go to Design &gt; Slide Master (note the aspect
 ratio will display as 4:3) and change it on the Slide Master contextual tab back to 16:9... and with that they saw their system crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention this because of inconsistent behavior of these controls. They should work the same whether they are invoked from the View &gt; Slide Size or Slide Master &gt; Slide Size. Since they do not, that could potentially indicate why upon opening an existing
 presentation something erroneously is happening with the setting of the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes... switching aspect ratios on existing presentation files can adversely impact image placements.</p>

    <title>Installing Windows 10 on the Nextbook 10.1 that is on sale at walmart. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessehill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows 10 on the Nextbook 10.1 that is on sale at walmart.</h2>
                    <p>PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS MAY NOT WORK.</p>
<p>THIS REQUIRES THAT YOUR TABLET HAVE A POGO KEYBOARD THAT DOESN'T USE A BLUETOOTH OR USB CONNECTION</p>
<p>BE SURE TO CREATE A RECOVERY USB DRIVE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are a few things that you will need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two 4GB USB thumb drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Micro-USB-OTG-Adapter/dp/B00BFYH11Q/ref=sr_1_12?s=audio-video-accessories&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421358264&amp;sr=1-12&amp;keywords=micro+usb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Micro USB Adapter</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and this zip file of drivers: &nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=538F95B4D0170556%213096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Non-Microsoft Drivers for NextBook 10.1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I recommend that you do is create a recovery drive using the recovery drive utility in Windows 8.1; use one of the usb drives. &nbsp;Once that is done you will need to download the 32 bit iso of Windows 10 and then unzip onto the second thumb
 drive. &nbsp;Once that is done unzip the drivers onto the second thumb drive as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that is done you will need to go to pc settings from the side menu and choose the recovery options. &nbsp;Choose boot from usb drive. &nbsp;Once the installer has loaded you will need to do a custom install and format the install drive. &nbsp;It will take about 15
 minutes for it to install. &nbsp;Once Windows 10 is installed you won't have access to your sd card, wifi, bluetooth, and touch interface among other things. &nbsp;Once you have logged in go to the device manager and then scroll down to where you see I2c controller,
 it should have a warning triangle on it. &nbsp;Right click on it and choose update driver and then browse for driver. &nbsp;Point the update manager to the usb drive and it will find the driver. &nbsp; There will be several unknown devices that you will need to do the same
 with. &nbsp;Once you have updated all of them you will have full access to everything again.</p>

            Please let me know if this works for you. &nbsp;My install was a little different, involving me having to install the bluetooth driver first and then force windows to download the updated drivers over a bluetooth tether. &nbsp;Hopefully, the drivers that Windows
 10 downloaded will all work for you.

            My Nextbook has an option for booting from an EFI usb stick, but when I try it, it says there is only one boot device to boot from, the image on the nextbook,, i.e. Windows 8.1.

            <p>Yes, it can see the drive until&nbsp; I try to boot off of it.&nbsp; I can run setup.exe, but that doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked Nextbook Customer Support for help.&nbsp; This is what they said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first reply said:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At this time I can not give any advice on how to install the Windows 10 technical preview as installing that does void the warranty. Also at the moment it does not appear that the tablets will
 be upgradeable to Windows 10 once it is fully released. I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also got a follow up email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Our technical support is only limited to warranty issues and does not provide any support for upgrading or modifying the OS, we don't have information for an external reference and we apologize
 for the inconvenience. Please refer to online forums or possibly a friend in the field as well for more insight.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span>So there you have it.&nbsp; A computer than can't be upgraded.&nbsp; I assume you are also limited on the types of Windows updates you will be able to install, although I haven't seen any indication of that yet.</p>

            I ended doing a recovery fairly early during my install attempt. &nbsp;That may have done something that allowed me to install it later on if you are still interested in installing it.

            I was not able to get it to boot through USB either. Just tells me it isn't available. The option appears in the BIOS but it never prompts me and the USB does not turn on until after.

</blockquote>
<p>I think I may have found the enabling driver, however there is a problem with it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I would like to thank JessieHill for the posting the driverset above..&nbsp; I received one of these tablets in from somewhere and since it had a messed up OS load on it I had no choice but to reload the OS (In this case, windows 8).&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able
 to get the OS to reload (I can explain more about how I got it to boot if anyone is interested) but for the life of me I could not get a lot of the hardware to work.&nbsp; I spent hours and hours and hours scouring around for drivers&nbsp;but in the end I could not
 get the touchscreen or audio to work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea where you got that driverset from (perhaps JessieHill you can tell me?) but without that&nbsp;there was no hope of reviving the tablet/mini PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving on... I found the auto-rotation enabling driver that installed and seemingly works here from the HP website:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;softwareitem=ob-140135-1</p>
<p>
</p><p>sp69308.exe -&gt; Kionix G-Sensor Enabling Driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that it installs and seems to auto-rotate the screen when you flip it around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bad news is that it auto-rotates the screen inverted.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it will always be upside-down when it is enabled..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it was installed and the screen was upside down, I was able to (carefully) navigate to the display properties and tell it that the screen was NOT inverted, however that only lasted until I flipped the screen around again and it went back to inverted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I un-checked the "enable auto screen rotation" in the display properties, and set the orientation up correctly, and that is where I am stuck...</p>
<p>
</p><p>.... Perhaps is there a way to somehow tell the tablet/pc to switch directions it rotates when the sensor detects a screen flip??</p>

            Do the following: In a new, blank document, press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S to display the Styles pane. Click the Manage Styles icon; in the dialog box, click the Set Defaults tab. Set Line Spacing to "Single." If you also want to change the paragraph spacing (=
 the distance added between paragraphs as you press Enter to create a new paragraph), do that by adjusting the values for Spacing After and Spacing Before. For example, if you want zero spacing, set both Spacing After and Spacing Before to zero. When you are
 done, select "New documents based on this template," and click OK.

<h2>            texts from one specific person vanished&#33;</h2>
                    I got a text from a friend today on my HD2&nbsp;and i noticed it said it was the first message. I figured I must have accidentally&nbsp;deleted all 700+ texts from my phone when&nbsp;I cleaned out my messages, but I went back to my My phone account&nbsp;to retrieve them,
 and they aren't on there either! they just vanished from my phone and from my account. has this happened to anyone else?? It was only this one friend; all the rest of my texts are here. please help!!!

<p>So ONLY one message (or set of messages) from this one person ar gone AND all of your other text messages are there.&nbsp; IF that is the case, it seems to me that it might have deleted accidently.&nbsp; I can't imagine that it was a software/device/MyPhone issue
 since it was only one person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just my thoughts....</p>

            Notes is available for sync on touchscreen devices only. The&nbsp;Q runs Windows Mobile standard, therefore you won't see it in the list of items you can check to sync.

    <title>Carmenu beta 2.8 - first impressions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blutarsky---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Carmenu beta 2.8 - first impressions</h2>
                    
<p>I have made it to install the awaited new BETA version of Carmenu 2.8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I wrote in the <a href="http://techjokey.com/nokia-carmenu-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mini review/bug list</a> and in 
this thread, I basically use my N96 phone in my car, in landscaped mode, horizontally, so I have tried again to use the landscaped version of Carmenu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for version 2.6, the landscape version, still doesn’t work when used on portrait phones, in landscape mode. So I have uninstalled the landscape version and installed the portrait one and launched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first visible change is that now the screen is not clipped anymore when rotating the phone, just because the application does not follow phone rotation anymore. The screen is kept in portrait mode whatever the phone rotation. Probably
 this was a choice of the dev team, simply to avoid on-screen clipping; as a result I can’t use this version in my car, if not using the phone loosing the tilt capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone application seems the same, I couldn’t notice any difference here, maybe someone can point out anything new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big disappointment in the music player: still the playlists are missing, I wish someone of Nokia staff could comment.</p>
<p>Another strange behavior: navigation by artist/album takes some 45 seconds between naviwheel button-pressed selection…..maybe a beta-related issue? No such problem when entering navigation, per track name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really couldn’t notice any other change, comparing this beta to version 2.6, which I’m reverting to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone testing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To help the developers, I'm posting here the buglist at present in version 2.6 and fixed/not fixed in version 2.8 beta:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm listing the bugs/wish list in 3 priority groups</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">High priority </font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">- No music playlists<br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">- Landscape Carmenu version&nbsp; <u>doesn’t work when using portrait phones in landscaped mode</u> (tilt); this is major issue because users that wish to use their phone in landscape mode, simply can't.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">- Doesn’t work with Maps 3 – Remote control commands are ignored in Maps 3 (it seems like Maps 3 hasn't got the focus; when pressing any phone button, Maps 3 menu do pop up; at that point remote control input is accepted)
</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">- Voice alerts in Maps 3 under Carmenu are being clipped, particularly when the audio to be muted is not being played on car stereo’s AUX input; Probabily a Maps 3 problem, I believe Maps 3 isn't aware about the gap it takes the Car
 Kit to mute Car stereo; the developers of Carmenu &amp; Maps 3 should study toghether a solution on this; almost useless now.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">- Under certain conditions, allow automatic BT audio pairing, avoiding automatic Carmenu loading, for example if red button on the phone is being kept pressed. Handy to skip Carmwenu load and just use BT audio streaming from other non-Carmenu
 apps</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Did you notice the disclaimers flood when using car navigators? C'mon, let users decide if they want to kill themself using drugs, abusing alcholics or playing TV in car. Moreover you're missing two points here: 1) passengers, NOT driving could benefit from
 this, watching TV if sitting in the front side of the car, hearing the TV audio in the rear.2) the driver itself could benefit from TV watching while the car is parked. Let's don't forget that Walkmans and iPods are being sold in countries where it is forbidden

<p>I'm sorry, but I simply can't accept your view "...let people decide if they want to kill themselves". Millions of people are killed around the year because they are hit by a moron who is not concentrating on his/her driving. Also, I've said this before
 and I'll say it again, many people still try to sue manufacturers of cars and accessories used in the car when they fail to obey simple road law, you cannot expect Nokia to put itself at risk of litigation just because a few customers have a ver irresponsible
 attitude to their social responsabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some safety campaigners who claim that sat-navs are dangerous, but you really only look at them occasionally just like you look in your rear view mirrors. Television is something that you watch closely, so having a TV where the driver can see it
 is downright dangerous, and no major multinational company in its right mind is going to condone this.</p>

<p>You see? There you are! Trapped by your self!</p>

<p>You're simply missing what "<em>de libero arbitrio</em>" is all about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia will be under fire regardless of the capabilities of it's devices, that's it. You can't change this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your perspective, Nokia is allready in danger just because it sells a device that holds a TV player that can stream audio via bluetooth on the car stereo (Carmenu or not) and this exactly is what I'm doing right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what now? Is Nokia in danger? Is Nokia "tempting" people having bad habits? Will Nokia remove the TV player from it's phones, because some users like me may use it in the car while driving?Is Carmenu itself a dangerous software? You could fold your self
 around a tree while driving and spinning your Naviwheel looking for a phone number. Did you think about this? No.</p>

<p>blutarsky and the tv-control *G*</p>
<p>Its not the first discussion for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Systemwide remote control is already there since, mmmh, ever. Just push CarMenu to the backround without closing and the clickwheel will work as up/down/enter, red and green are the same as the phone buttons, silver brings back CarMenu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have CarMenu running, it changes the settings of the profile which is loaded when a car kit connects. Vibration and the message signal will be disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my workaround:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>create a new profile, for example call it "car"</p>
<p>go to settings, phone, accesories, carkit and change the profile wich is active while connected to a carkit to "car"</p>

<p>Hi there haifisch,</p>
<p>there is no need to keep Carmenu open in the background to achieve that: remote control functionality just requires the BT connection to be active, so you can achieve the same result, just quitting Carmenu, while the BT connection to the car kit is still
 open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However your technique shows some conflicts with audio, probably because Carmenu itself kinda has "reserved" audio streaming in a way other non-carmenu apps have muted audio; keeping Carmenu backgrounded seems also using more CPU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the system wide remote control functionality, Carmenu running in the background or not, it depends on the application, being remote control aware: some of the will accept command from the remote, other won'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestions to the developers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A)</p>
<p>- Encapsulate in some way TV player and radio in Carmenu</p>
<p>- Use huge disclaimers, no responsibility for Nokia for bad use/misuse, as for Maps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;or</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B)&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Keep Carmenu "as is"</p>
<p>- Enable some functionality to quit Carmenu quickly as it is loading (as I wrote, if some button on the phone is kept pressed while Carmenu is loading, quit immediately) so users wishing to use other apps (TV, radio, blablabla) can access them quickly without
 having to wait Carmenu load &amp; exit</p>
<p>- Make remote control functionality system wide</p>

<p>As for the music player there should be a better tempo/timing/pitch technique. I have wrote about the woes in music playback in another thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last days I have identified properly the bad behavior:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Under some conditions, probably CPU stress, music playback BPM slows down, until BPM quickly increase to "rescue" back where it should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's like a group of friends doing jogging, suddenly a runner gets a phone call and slows down a bit while the group keeps the pace ahead, until the phone call ends; at that point the runner quickly recovers the leading group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's horrible while listening music, I understand that phone devices have to maybe too many tasks, but isn't there a better way to avoid this? Maybe giving a higher priority to the music player?</p>

<p>Another tip for the dev team: <u>improve messagging system view in Carmenu.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is, once you receive a message, pressing the naviwheel, opens the message in "standard" phone view (small characters). Would be nice to have an integrated system in Carmenu to view the message content with big large fonts....</p>

            I'm afraid your phone has been "bricked".<br />
<br />
One of the dangers of updating firmware via t'internet is that, if for any reason - and there are many - the connection is lost during the update, your phone is left with an incomplete operating system and therefore won't work - hence a "brick".<br />
<br />
Your only option is to take the phone to a service center where they will fix the phone for you .. usually free of charge if you're still within your warranty period.

<h2>            Bug Splat Crash Report Pop Up - What is the Source&#63; How do I get rid of&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I started getting what seems like a random Bug Splat pop up crash report box. The box offers me an option to send a report. I have not sent a report through this box since I have no clue where this came or what the source is.&nbsp; Not sure if its phishing.&nbsp;
 A Windows security scan does not identify any viruses.&nbsp; When I Googled this problem, the blogs talk about it being related to gaming, League of Legends, and some blogs mentioned it had something to do with Flash. I have no clue what this is about. I am not
 a gamer. Is this a Windows sourced file corruption? Or a virus? How do I get rid of this pop up, or fix it if it is a Windows sourced problem?</p>
