<h2>            OneDrive for Business not starting</h2>
                    <p>I have been asked to post this here as it has been suggested that this is an Office client issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use ODFB with staff and I have come across a couple of people whose OneDrive isn't starting up correctly and not working. It worked fine up to a point but this has just started recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they start their Windows 7 machine, OneDrive doesn't start and if they attempt to access their local OneDrive folder the system seems to start loading something and the loading circle just continuously animates
 against the cursor. If I go into their task manager there are 2 or more instances of Groove which just seem to stop and start and I cannot stop them because if I select the service it just disappears then reappears as a new service! It is very frustrating
 and I have reinstalled Office manually and by using the Fix It that Microsoft provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they try to open a document from their local OneDrive folder the document will not load but the program will just showing the default start screen (open document.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other document from any other local folder other than OneDrive works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as I am out of ideas other than rebuilding the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Rollover of ADFS token signing certificates - O365 federation metadata - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pb3000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rollover of ADFS token signing certificates - O365 federation metadata not updating</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question wrt the rollover of ADFS token signing certificates.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past I used the Microsoft O365 Federation Medatada Update&nbsp; Automation script which works with AutoCertificate Rollover to autmate this annual task. &nbsp;This utilty basically sets
 up a daily </p>
<p>scheduled task on the primary ADFS that enumerates all federated domains in the tenant and runs "<strong>Update-MSOLFederatedDomain</strong>"
</p>
<p>against each. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now updated Microsoft guidance a:t&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj151809.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj151809.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>states that you no longer need to use this script with ADFS 2.0&nbsp; or later as "<em>Office 365 and Azure AD will automatically update
</em></p>
<p><em>your certificate before it expires</em>". This requires ADFS <strong>AutoCertificate Rollover
</strong>to be set to True and the federation </p>
<p>metadata must be available on the public Internet.&nbsp; The ADFS servers also need to have the latest updates applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this time around I disabled the scheduled script and monitored the rollover to see whether it would work seamlessly. The new certificates were generated on the primary ADFS server at the start of the 20 day grace period. 5 days later the new certificate
 was promoted to primary. There was no interuption to service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good. However running <strong>Get-MSolFederationProperty</strong> against the federated domains continued to show outdated certificate data for the Microsoft end of the federation. I continued to monitor for the next few days until just before
 the expiry of the old certificate - but still no change on the Microsoft end. Eventually given&nbsp;this was&nbsp;our live environment, I lost my nerve and manually ran
<strong>Update-MSOLFederatedDomain</strong> against each federated domain. After this the Microsoft end of the federation was shown as up to date as far as the certificates were concerned..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I subsequently ran through the whole cycle on our&nbsp;UAT environment and observed that the Mirosoft end of the federation never updated after the certificate rollover cycle. ADFS continues to work normally, however it is now 4 days past the expiry of the
 old token signing certificate! Running <strong>Get-MSolFederationProperty</strong> against each federated domain continues to &nbsp;shows the correct primary and secondary certificates on the ADFS side of the federation, however the Microsoft end is shown with
 the old certificates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone come across this behaviour? Is this something that I should be worried about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Pb300,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After consulting, since the ADFS works fine, this indicate that the
<span>TokenSigningCertificate values </span>for <strong>
Source ADFS server </strong>and <strong>Source: Microsoft Office 365&nbsp;</strong>match.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To get the cmdlet result of TokenSigningCertificate values for
<strong>Source ADFS server </strong>and <strong>Source: Microsoft Office 365&nbsp;</strong>match, I would suggest you restart the local server or run the“Update-MsolFederatedDomain –DomainName” cmdlet in order to get the latest information from cloud side.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h3> steveliddlesk  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to transfer ownership of office 2013 suite from my hotmail to another account</h2>
                    <p>Recently upgraded my gaming pc to something with a titan X superclocked with AIO water cooler, had no real need for the old gaming PC and then realised that the company Dell laptop could not handle 4 mb autocad files from clients, but the old PC could. Boss
 suggested getting a decent workstation from Dell would be the best way, looked to be about £2500K for something comparable to my self built pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boss said could I sell him the PC ?, we agreed a price and I installed office 2013 suite for outlook, word and excel etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally use webmail on the phone and my current pc and use libreoffice 5.0 as it does what I need it to and is free :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wanted to transfer ownership of the work's pc office suite from my hotmail account to another email that I would set up, was told that was not possible.</p>
<p>Can they access my hotmail account if they have access to the pc, much like if someone stole it ? yes of course they can was not the answer that was looking for :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that I am stuffed and will have to leave it to my boss to work out, he asked for client files recently, so uploaded to hubic and gave him the link to download, but what he meant was a usb stick in a jiffy bag and posted to him, so not very technical
 :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help ?</p>
<p>Office is installed where it is needed, there is no new device, just a new owner<br />
</p>
<p>Not willing to give up my hotmail address as have had about 10 people with the same name as me from as far away as australia send irate emails to various clients who then reply to "me" and then I either reply straight away or with one muppet from nearby
 leave it for a few months :)</p>

Hi, thanks for visiting Answer Desk! I'm Judy S.<br />
I am your &nbsp;Accounts and Billing dedicated specialist for today.<br />
me - how do I transfer ownership from my hotmail account that i do not want to lose to another ?<br />
Are you referring to the Office Home and Business 2013 that is linked to your account?<br />
me - correct, tried to do a listing and it kept trying to find it and gave up<br />
Steve, we do not have the option to transfer office from one account to another.<br />
However if you just want to transfer the office to another device we can absolutely do that.<br />
me - personally use libreoffice and webmail, so no need for it, but the ex boss likes outlook and the office suite<br />
me - it is on the device that I have in the room, the device goes back to the office and afaik that means my onedrive will be shared with whoever has access to the pc<br />
me - essentially want a way for them to take ownership without the hassle of losing my hotmail account<br />
Okay, to transfer the office to another device<br />
we just have to uninstall it to the device where it is currently installed<br />
me - no, to keep the office on the device it is installed on is the question<br />
then install it to the new device by going to this link https://office.com/myaccount<br />
me - the whole pc is owned by the company. I installed office. they paid for it<br />
And make sure to sign into your account.<br />
me - you misunderstand, it is already installed where it needs to be installed<br />
me - i want to separate the office account from the office install<br />
me - there is no new device<br />
Oh, so you want to transfer the office to another email address?<br />
me - correct, can easily set them up with another hotmail account, that way they can manage the office suite, have their own onedrive etc<br />
Oh, Steve as f0r that we do not have the option to transfer office from One account to another<br />
me - We can only transfer it 30 days prior to its purchase<br />
Where did you purchase it?<br />
me - what options are there ? i have no use for outlook or office. purchased it online, but when I try to check my purchases the thing keeps spinning, was checking for 10 mins and gave up, but guess a lot longer than 30 days<br />
me - I could wipe the one drive and go to hubic or something and let their tech support deal with it, is there any way for them to sign in to the hotmail account from office ?<br />
me - purchased early May, 2015<br />
If they have access to your account then they can absolutely do it.<br />
me - ok, they will not have access to the password or the hotmail on the device, wiping everything that could cause an issue. if they use office, can they access my hotmail account from within office and is there any way for me to sign out of office and for
 them to still use it<br />
me - got 2nd stage verification to my personal phone<br />
If the office is already installed to the device, they don't need to sign in to your account. And yes, they can access your &nbsp;hotmail account from within office<br />
me - sigh ! look the device is their pc, the only office client installed is on that PC. the pc goes to the office. what do I need to do to stop them taking over the account ? not care about onedrive and will wipe anything I have there<br />
me - as in I will lose access to the pc/ device / office suite in 2 weeks<br />
Alright, for the install option it would be best for us to consult our Technical Support<br />
So they can further assist you with it<br />
me - ok can you contact them for me as thought YOU were tech support or give me the link so can post an edited chat to there<br />
I will be giving you the link where you can contact the,<br />
me - not need to install or uninstall as it is already where it needs to be<br />
&nbsp;
</p><p>If I ever wanted ms office in the future, suspect would find another way to do it, feel sorry for resellers :)</p>

</p><p>I created a PowerPoint presentation for school. I have to present it, but it is a distance education class, so I have to record my presentation in PowerPoint. I have notes for my slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I want to do is very simple. I want to record my presentation (audio of me speaking while going through the slides) while in Presenter view (so I can see my notes while presenting).
</strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>Presenter mode is disabled while recording (no matter what I do).</strong></span> I've tried with only my laptop screen, with an external monitor in Duplicate mode, and with an external monitor in Extend mode. None
 of this matters. Presenter mode is disabled no matter what I do when recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's extremely aggravating. I can use presenter mode, just not when recording. I've seen articles that say to edit the ribbon and add the recording tab. I've done this and it changed nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I record my presentation while viewing notes on the same screen? That's all I want to do, and it seems like this is a basic need.</strong></p>

            Hi PastorBr549,<br />
<br />
About the issue, may I know if you can’t open a Publisher document in SharePoint library with Publisher 2016? If so, could you follow the steps below to check the result?
<br />
<br />
1. Start Publisher application on your computer and sign in with your current Work/School account to open it.
<br />
2. Log into Office 365 portal and check if you can see the document in SharePoint library.
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, could you confirm the following details? <br />
<br />
1. About “Microsoft 365 2016 can not find the Publisher document when I click on it”, how do you open it? Do you open it from Publisher 2016 or click open on it in a SharePoint teamsite? Could you share with us a screenshot?
<br />
2. Could you share with us a screenshot about the error message telling that it can’t be found?<br />
3. About” it can be opened through another computer.”, can you open it with Publisher 2016 with your own Work/school account on other computer?
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley

            Hi PastorBr549,<br />
<br />
From your description, I can see that you open the Publisher document in SharePoint Online with the browser. Therefore, please follow the steps below to check the result?
<br />
<br />
1. Open the SharePoint library where the files store and tick Keep me signed in when logging into the Office 365 portal.
<br />
2. Start the Publisher client and sign into the client with your current Work/school account via FILE &gt; Account &gt; Switch Account &gt; Add Account.
<br />
3. Click Open &gt; Site-companyname &gt; Browse. <br />
4. Copy the URL of the site into the address box to open the Publisher document in SharePoint Online.
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, to move the case forward, please share with us the result of the suggestions above and the following details:<br />
<br />
1. A screenshot about the error saying file cannot be found. <br />
2. Does the issue occur on other browsers? <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley <br />

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10 error 80240020</h2>
                    &lt;p&gt;This computer has been upgraded twice this year to windows 10 (build 10240 and build 10525).&amp;nbsp;Then i reverted back to windows 8.1 single language with bing because I have some issues with the builds. Now, I want to test build 10565 too see whether
 i can use it or not, but after 3 tries at upgrading to windows 10 I gave up. The methods I used are simply typing wuauclt.exe/updatenow (unsucessful) , then tried deleting the contents of SoftwareDistribution windows subfolder then tried typing the command
 twice. So is the win 10 upgrade unavailable because i had reinstalled it too many times or is there something wrong with the way I handled the issue? I use a prebuilt Asus K30AD withadded DWA-615 wireless n card for connectivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 word isn't autocapitalized unless I type something, and then backspace. But the biggest issue is that now my phone turns off sporadically, and if I was in the middle of a text conversation when the phone turned off, the last sent and received texts get deleted.
 Has anyone else been having this issue? If so, how did you fix it?&nbsp;

            If your phone behaves like this it is likely a hardware issue. I would recommend taking it back to the point of purchase for a replacement (or fix). Sporadic restarts may indicate faulty hardware.

<p>Which version did you buy?</p>
<p>Office Home and Student comes with a trial of Office Pro - which provides trial versions of Outlook and Access. If it is that trial that has run out then Uninstall the trial from (say) Word &gt; File &gt; Help &gt; Trial Product&nbsp; &gt;Microsoft Office Professional 2010
 &gt; Licensing Options &gt; Remove Trial.</p>
<p>Otherwise did you have a pre-existing trial version of Office when you installed the purchase version? That would conflict with the validation process and should be removed - after which you will probably need to repair Office 2010.</p>

<br />Without any other info, going to assume that the formula being copied over is returning a zero value if the cells to which the formula refers are empty. If that's the case, the process to do what you want is described in

<p>Nokia N86 SMS and Greek language</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a problem with my Nokia N86 phone. If I select new SMS, remaining characters are 120. When I press the first letter, it goes at 60 chars. While typing Greek Characters, it seems to use double characters. This happened when I installed v30.009 from
 Vi Suite.</p>
<p>If I use English characters there's no problem, but I don't want to use "Greeklish" because I use T9 service. Please help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want some help.</p>

            Unfortunately the standard SMS alphabet is limited to a particular set of characters. To send Greek characters (or most non-Latin languages and special characters) the phone has to switch to a different encoding, which uses twice as much data per character.
 All SMS services have this limitation, e.g. on Android and iPhone. Some phones work around it by sending the messing in "Greeklish" and translating "Greeklish" messages in return or other tricks, but this varies.

<p>Try Messaging -&gt; Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Text Message -&gt; Character Encoding. It should read "full support", which seems to be the UTF-16 mode. Switch it to "Reduced Support". It should let you use 160 characters per message.<br />
<br />
I guess they changed the default when they did the update. With "full support" it'll use UTF-16 and you have half the characters, but all receivers will be able to represent the text correctly. "Reduced support" doesn't work with all recipients but gives you
 more characters.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this doesn't work ,a bit of searching suggests it doesn't work reliably on certain handsets.</p>

<h2>            Fixing Excel data connections &#40;analysis services&#41;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My team has a workbook used and edited by multiple individuals. Each person has their own data connections set up via analysis services, but we do run into situations where a user will open the workbook and connection property dialogue shows the connection
 file with a path that is only valid on someone else's machine. I have been unable to change the connection path on one target machine today, and it crashes every time the data connections are enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to learn more about what is going on, so we can put in place both short-term and long-term solutions. Are there any good web references or books that have explanations on how Excel uses these connection file paths, how to update/change them, etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Keith</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t open Zoom box in Access 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidgyoung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open Zoom box in Access 2010</h2>
                    <p>I am using 64 bit Access 2010 on Windows 7 (64 bit).</p>
<p>When I try to open a zoom box in Access I get a message saying the Utility add-in is missing and I need to run Microsoft Office Setup to reinstall it.</p>
<p>It was working fine until a day or two ago and the only thing that has changed is that I installed the latest monthly Microsoft updates (March 2016) this morning.</p>
<p>I've run the Office installation repair but that didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>I've removed then added back the relevant folder (Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\ACCWIZ) as a trusted location in the Trust Centre settings - didn't help</p>
<p>Is anybody else having troubles since the latest MS updates?</p>
<p>If not, any other suggestions on how to quickly fix this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David Young</p>

            <p>Just an addendum to my earlier message.</p>
<p>I've just checked another computer this time with 64 bit Access running Windows 8.1 that also had the monthly updates installed this morning.</p>
<p>The Access zoom box has stopped working on it too as of today (after the updates installation).</p>
<p>It really looks to me like there was a problem with the latest updates.</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer to the Microsoft kb article.</p>
<p>I had a look and there were over 60 Office 2010 updates installed that morning. I didn't want to spend hours checking each one to see if it was the culprit and hoped MS would figure it out.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call it a "bogus" update. It was designed to fix a problem with Excel 2010 and had unintended consequences with Access. Here is one of several blog articles that explains:&nbsp;http://blog.fmsinc.com/2016/03/</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar issue and it turned out to be due to incorrect Trusted Location setting (File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Trusted Locations).
</p>
<p>I'm using 32-bit Access 2013 on Windows 7 64-bit and the wizards are installed in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\ACCWIZ". Note the "(x86)" in the path for 32-bit programs.</p>
<p>The Trusted Locations was pointing to "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office15\ACCWIZ" without the "(x86)". Updating the path made Zoom work immediately without restarting Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try checking your Trusted Locations setting for the wizards location.</p>
<p />

    <title>Horizontally stack column arrays - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul domaskis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Horizontally stack column arrays</h2>
                    I eventually want to be able to extract a subset of columns from a formally defined table.&nbsp; I can then use that subset wherever an array or range argument is needed.&nbsp; It would look something like:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; { myTable[FirstField], myTable[ThirdField], myTable[FifthField] }<br />
<br />
where the braces delimit an array.&nbsp; If column arrays cannot be abbutted side-by-side, for some reason, then I planned to transpose them into rows, stack them, then transpose back.<br />
<br />
Being new to array formulas and array notation in general, I started small.&nbsp; This array formula works, if I select the right sized range of cells (2 high, 3 wide):<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ={ TRANSPOSE({1;2;3}) ,&nbsp; TRANSPOSE({1;2;3}) }<br />
<br />
However, these doesn't:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; = TRANSPOSE( TRANSPOSE( { 1,2,3 ; 4,5,6 } ) )<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; = { TRANSPOSE({1,2,3}) , TRANSPOSE({4,5,6} ) }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; = { {1,2,3} ; {4,5,6} }<br />
<br />
It seems that when you are building an array using curly braces, the elements within those braces cannot be arrays themselves.<br />
<br />
Is there a good way to horizontally stack column arrays, without having to delve into VBA?<br />
<br />
I guess the same question can be asked about vertically stacking row arrays.&nbsp; But my immediate interest is in the former.

    <title>Has anyone ever found a way to sync one drive in windows 10 latest - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard-sync  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has anyone ever found a way to sync one drive in windows 10 latest update&#61; todays date is 4.16.18</h2>
                    <p>Yes I have the latest windows 10 unless your updates are useless. Yes I have paid for office 365 for the next 2 years and it is up to date if your updates are not useless. Yes I have the latest OneDrive unless your updates are useless. I have sync issues
 that are confusing me. In the forum I see others with same problem and no answers of any use coming from moderators. How about a tech who knows something about office 365 2018 version for home pc's and or OneDrive answer the question? Why does OneDrive suddenly
 refuse to sync Documents folder but sync everything else. The only thing that is important for me to sync is the Documents folder and I need a real answer. Pausing sync is useless, One Drive Desktop App helped sync all other folders but not the Documents folder.
 If this is an update problem please be honest and tell me that a fix is pending or something. My OneDrive worked fine syncing until about March of 2018, then this issue became noticeable. The syncing problem is also causing trouble for my Microsoft Desktop
 Mail App which syncs sometimes. My desktop is running an ICore-7 processor and is top of the line HP.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi <span>Neftali,</span></p>
<p><span>First let me thank you for a TECH response that was well thought out. I do not wish to risk losing everything I have in OneDrive to solve this. Nor do I feel I should have to make copies of
 all my important docs when OneDrive's purpose is to make my files available from any device at any time. The only reason I use OneDrive over Google is to avoid all the issues related to owning 7 devices that have access. I believe that you are telling me to
 perform this action on 2 desktops and 3 laptops- and who knows what about my 2 smart phones. Microsoft can do better with the update process so I should not have to try your suggested solution. If your update has caused OneDrive to have issues, you can't think
 that the average user would even try to use command prompt. I have enough knowledge to know that this is a risky at best solution that may not work at all due to the changes made by Windows update. Also please bear in mind that in Windows 10 OneDrive seems
 to have alot more control over how your pc or Laptop runs. When OneDrive is not synced or up to date Windows 10 does not run smoothly at all. Please find a more user friendly solution that will help me and the average user fix the sync issues. Command prompt
 procedures are not a normal user activity and most people will not even try what you have offered as a solution.</span></p>
<p><span>thanks,</span></p>

            Hi RICHARD-sync,
<br />
<br />Sorry About that, you can forget about command prompt and manually uninstall One Drive client, Restart the PC and Install it back.
<br />
<br />I suggest that way because ill uninstall and kill service  from One Drive app at once
<br />Do a backup file for those might not be in the cloud.

<p>Hi <span>Neftali,</span></p>
<p><span>First let me say that you have proven that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>it is possible to get TECH feedback</strong></span> and not have to wait for any extended period for an answer. Thank you so much- I will consider your new "more user friendly" solution for a bit since the issue may not be resolved by fixing one of
 my desktops. I am assuming that each device must be done one by one since the update may have made different changes to each OS. Also I did not see any Smartphone advice so I wonder if you noticed I mentioned 2 Smartphones with the OneDrive App. The phones
 "appear to be up to date" but if the App has trouble on Home devices after the windows 10 update I wonder about the Android OneDrive App.</span></p>

<p>Hi <span>Neftali,</span></p>
<p><span>I believe that a sync solution to all of my devices has been found through trial and error method over the last few hours. Inspired by your Android OneDrive App-(which should be your CROWN JEWEL OF APPS)- I tried using the OneDrive Desktop App as a
 solution. I did not uninstall anything from any device and my files are now synced in Edge Browser mode and on the Desktop OneDrive App. I found that on some devices the OneDrive desktop app will not start automatically even when set to do so. Older and less
 expensive devices have this issue. After doing the following steps I synced my folders easily:</span></p>
<p><span>1.= Type OneDrive in the Cortana search box and the first choice will be the OneDrive Desktop App</span></p>
<p><span>2.= Click the OneDrive App choice in the top of the dropdown menu from Cortana search</span></p>
<p><span>3.= Watch the App start and it will show the folders you have given permission to sync</span></p>
<p><span>4.= If you see any folders missing just choose which folders you want to sync by right-clicking in the OneDrive folder and choose settings from menu.</span></p>
<p><span>5.= Under account tab pick choose folders and you will find all OneDrive folders in your account</span></p>
<p><span>6.= Choose your folders to sync by selecting or de-selecting the check boxes then click OK to close folders and OK to close OneDrive</span></p>
<p><span>7.= Wait for several minutes depending on&nbsp; your device and processor speed to see all folders synced</span></p>
<p><span>8.= Restart your device and see if the changes worked- on 2 of my devices I had to pin the OneDrive app to the taskbar for ease of access since the OneDrive Cloud icon still does not show up after each restart.</span></p>
<p><span>9.= I still manually start the OneDrive Desktop app from the taskbar on my 2 older devices to ensure the syncing process is up to date.</span></p>
<p><span>The Documents Folder is the last one to sync for me because I have the most data there. I do not store many pics or videos in OneDrive- I use removable storage to speed up my OneDrive startup process. The key I have found is that OneDrive cloud appears
 to rely on the App as the fastest way to update each account. All of my devices now start much more quickly and seem to run much more smoothly after the syncing process through the Desktop App. My oldest device had not synced properly for many&nbsp; months so it
 took the longest. One side note is that the more data you store in OneDrive the longer it takes to sync after each startup. This process was done on an I-7, I-5, I-3, and 2 AMD processors all running "the latest Windows 10 OS" and has been tested after multiple
 restarts of each device.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that this can help somebody to fix their sync issues without any uninstalling or re-installing of the OneDrive Account or App. Thanks again for
</span><span>Neftali and his hands on help that inspired me to find a solution.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck to all,</span></p>

<h2>            How Do You Capture Unplanned &#34;Soft&#34; Hours in MS Project&#63;</h2>
                    <p>They way we create our schedules today are based on physical work that is easily tracked.&nbsp; We have hours required to produce drawings and documents, lead times for procured items, weekly meetings, milestones, etc.&nbsp; What we seem to be missing are the unplanned
 "soft" hours.&nbsp; We want to be able to track them and show how they impact the overall project progress.&nbsp; By soft hours I mean activities like: unscheduled meetings with suppliers or customers; issues arise during production and time needs to be taken follow
 up; excessive&nbsp;time spent responding to comments,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is a good way of handling this within the schedule? </p>

            I would add the unplanned meetings etc to the schedule as they occur and book the actual time against them. &nbsp;As they are unplanned I don't think it makes sense to try to predict them.

            Whilst you can't predict a particular meeting, you can predict an average number of hours spent on "soft" tasks per week. So if a resource averages 10h/week on soft tasks, only allocate them at 75% for all other tasks and 25% to a generic soft task.<br />
This is the only time you might assign a resource to a summary task, as the time expands/contracts to match sub-tasks (not wise for beginner schedulers!).<br />
So some weeks you will get ahead of schedule and other weeks behind. Track the average hours per week and update remaining soft tasks accordingly.<br />

            I've stuck with the old adage 'when in doubt, leave it out'. &nbsp;Meetings and extra tasks don't belong in a project schedule. &nbsp;They can interfere with critical path, allocation, etc. &nbsp;We always keep an 'action item' list and a communication plan separate
 from the schedule. &nbsp;You can keep this on a simple list in SharePoint or some other collaboration tool. &nbsp;Remember, a project schedule is not a task list. &nbsp;When you focus your schedule on deliverables and WBS specific items you will get much more value out of
 it. &nbsp;Good luck. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Could a resource add the soft tasks on the time sheet portion of MS Project Server?&nbsp;Would this negatively impact the overall schedule?</p>

<p>Yes, team members could use the Add New Task functionality in Project Server to track the unplanned tasks on which they work.&nbsp; When the team member creates the task, he/she will need to give the task a name, pick a summary section in the project, enter a
 planned Start date (which is probably the date they actually started the work on the task), and enter either a Finish date or the number of hours they need to work on the task.&nbsp; The PM will need to approve the task in the Approval Center in PWA, then open
 the project in Microsoft Project and decide if the task should be linked with any other tasks.&nbsp; From there, the PM can see the overall impact of the team member working on the unplanned task, and if the task causes a resource overallocation, the PM can level
 the overallocation appropriately.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

            Normally I am in 100% agreement, Joe.&nbsp; However Stephanie said she needed to track them.&nbsp; Certainly if they are billable as part of the Project, they do need to be accounted for.<br />
