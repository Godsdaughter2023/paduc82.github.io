    <title>E71 not remembering options set in the App Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> algotechie---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E71 not remembering options set in the App Manager</h2>
                    
<p>I've set options for many apps (like to always allow the network access, to ask for reading user data the first time, etc.), but when I start the app, those options are not in effect. As one specific example, for Opera Mini, I set the option to always allow
 network access. But when I start this app and choose to open a link, it asks for the network access. Same for reading the user data. I checked the settings in the App Manager and they're fine, but just not in effect. I restarted the phone; still the same thing.
 The settings are present there alright, just not working. What else can be done to tell the phone to use the options set through the App Manager? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having the same problem. My phone always asks me for permission for the app to use the network to send/receive data. I have tried your suggestion of opening the app and still can't find anything in options to allow me to change this. Sorry if I'm being
 a bit stupid but could you list the steps you would take to do this.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            I tried to connect my Nokia 6080 using a CA-42 USB cable. The phone says "Enhancement not supported."<br />
<br />
My windows 2000 PC with all service packs cannot find drivers for the cable. PC Suite Connection manager doesn't recognise that the CA-42 cable is connected. I can connect fine with InfraRed, but I'd prefer the stability of the cable connection.<br />
C:\Program Files\Nokia\Connectivity Cable Driver folder has various .inf files none of which contain reference to a 6080.<br />
Ive tried using different USB ports &amp; rebooting the phone.<br />
I've tried Miksu's suggestions in post:<br />
/discussions/board/message?board.id=pcsuite&amp;message.id=11445<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the problem is that nokia have not updated there cable drivers for the Nokia 6080

            Hi there,<br />
First uninstall Nokia PC Suite from the machine, run the latest registry cleaner from the link:
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4144912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4144912</a><br />
install ca-42 drivers from this link: <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4144937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://europe.nokia.com/A4144937</a><br />
then install PC Suite and check if the connection is working fine.

            I uninstalled PC Suite &amp; used PC Cleaner to remove all files. Restarted.<br />
1st installed Only the cable driver. No luck.<br />
2: Installed PC Suite 6.82.27.0. Restarted. No Luck. Ran the .bat file from Miksu's advice to register all .dll files. Rebooted. No luck.<br />
<br />
When I connect the cable to the phone, the phone displays:<br />
i Data Enhancement connected<br />
i Enhancement not supported<br />
<br />
When Windows 2000 prompted to install the cable. It could not find a suitable driver. So I chose "Have Disk" and browsed to<br />
"C:\Program Files\Nokia\Connectivity Cable Driver"<br />
<br />
Many Nokia **** USB Modems were listed.<br />
*NO driver for Nokia 6080 was listed*<br />
That is why I conclude that Nokia has not created support for the 6080 in their cable drivers.<br />
I tried Nokia 6085. It installed, but the cable no-longer shows up under connected USB devices and the "modem" would not respond. uninstalled that.<br />
<br />
Has anyone with the 6080/CA-42 had success?

<br />
I am using a 6080 with CA-42 cable and it is working awesome no problems till date. You said that "Enhancement not supported" error. Are you able to use a headset without any problems?

            No problems with the headset.<br />
I have 3 devices listed under<br />
menu &gt; setttings &gt; enhancements<br />
- headset<br />
- text phone<br />
- charger<br />
<br />
does your list also include the cable? Mine doesn't.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is the softmware on my phone. When I connect with InfraRed, PC suite file manager is unable to browse to my Text Message folders. I can browse to my Contacts and Gallery folders. I'm considering finding a nokia service agent to re-load the software
 on my phone.

            Tried that. I got the same "Enhancement Connected" and then "Enhancement not supported" messages on the phone even before I connect it to the PC.<br />
<br />
I reckon as long as those messages appear on the phone, the PC will not be able to install drivers as it relies on the signal from the phone to identify what type of driver to install with the cable.<br />
<br />
Should I have mentioned I'm trying to use a generic CA-42 cable? I'll try to borrow a genuine Nokia CA-42 to see whether I get the same response.

            Here’s some troubleshooting steps you can take one by one to see if it corrects your problem: 
<br />
<br />1) Make sure you have the latest version. Please check here for the versions:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/update-history-for-office-2016-for-mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/update...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Uninstall and then reinstall Office using these directions:

<br />
<br />3) Roll back to a previous 16.xx version that did not have this problem.
<br />
<br />If you do roll back, when an update comes out, please update to see if your problem is corrected.

            I did all of these yet, the problem persisted again. I am worried that all my images have gone. What could be the problem in reality?. How can I get back my images that I inserted?. This is so weird at this critical time.&nbsp;

<p>All this uninstall/reinstall and revert advice is simply terrible. These people being paid to slap junk boilerplate replies that don't fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what version you currently have. Let's get you up to the current general release version coming out this week. It's version 16.14</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see which version you currently have by going to the PowerPoint menu and choosing About PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, you can update to the 16.14 build easily by joining Office Insider and choosing the Insider Slow option. AutoUpdate will (hopefully) take care of everything for you.</p>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-Office-Insider-f4208185-b63a-4b68-9c7a-9a32d2411c16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>What is Office Insider</strong>? -
<strong>Office</strong> Support</a>
<p>
</p><p>If AutoUpdate can't bring your Office install up to date, which might happen if you have mixed versions of Office components after following the reversion advice, you will probably have to go through the whole uninstall/reinstall ritual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get the 16.14 build successfully installed, please open the presentation and see if the pictures are OK and reply. Thanks.</p>

<p>I have updated to the version (16.14) as you suggested in your earlier note. However, I still couldn't get my images back to the powerpoint. The images remain as they were before. See the attached file. What next to do to get my images back?.</p>

    <title>Posting Ovi Store Reviews &#61; Nokia Account TERMINATION - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bitflung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Posting Ovi Store Reviews &#61; Nokia Account TERMINATION</h2>
                    
<p>Here's the short version of my story, which is directly summarized in the subject above (and yes, my account is being terminated against my will).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;create nokia account, use it to sign in to Ovi Store</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;post reviews for applications</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;have at least 6 of your reviews flagged with the "report issue" link</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;recieve notification that your account is terminated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: "Why did you post so many reviews that were flagged using 'report issue'"?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;My reviews were non-abusive. &nbsp;One such 'removed' review simply stated that 'Compass Touch' was a nice application and 'did what it said on the tin'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;"Why not alert Nokia that reviews were being removed unjustly early in the process and avoid this final terminal fate"?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;I tried. &nbsp;review removal notifications are sent via email, from the address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;Replying to this address resulted in email delivery failure notices: the account is dead and undeliverable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;"So why not contact Nokia Customer Care directly"?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;I did. &nbsp;After a multitude of emails I gave up: they are idiots. &nbsp;I never got them to understand that my issue was with REVIEWS being removed rather than APPLICATIONS being removed. &nbsp;The email chain has some of the most expressive and distressed language
 I have ever written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;"Wait, so the account is closed. &nbsp;What does that mean"?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;It means that I cannot buy more apps from the Ovi Store. &nbsp;In 3 months I spent $75 at the Ovi Store and now that revenue stream is cut off by Nokia themselves. &nbsp;All applications I have purchased are now irreversibly detached from association with any
 Nokia Account and I cannot re-register for an account with my username OR my email address for 6 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;"Big deal, 6 months, so what"?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;Well, it is a big deal. Now I will almost certainly not buy anything ever again directly from the Ovi Store (loss of revenues to Nokia). &nbsp;If I do, I certainly won't post reviews of any apps (loss of quality control and PR for Nokia). &nbsp;Also note that
 I am developing 3 applications for S60v5 at the moment - and I am seriously finding it difficult to see a future for these applications on the Ovi Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;"Who cares if you don't post reviews anymore, your reviews were abusive"</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;No, they weren't. &nbsp;I can't stress that enough. &nbsp;My reviews were far from abusive and most of the reviews that were flagged were short, accurate and POSITIVE reviews. &nbsp;Moreover, as a user I was PENALIZED for posting MEANINGFUL REVIEWS. &nbsp;We've all seen
 the gobs and gobs of **bleep** reviews on the Ovi Store, right? &nbsp;The poor language, the obvious and crude Nokia bashing, the iPhone fanboy posts? &nbsp;If legitimate users with meaningful things to say are penalized for posting proper reviews, all we will have
 left are those **bleep** reviews that never belonged there in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;"Wait, what apps are you developing anyway"?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;They aren't ready for public consumption, but will be released under the GPL when I am done. &nbsp;'Bibliotouch' will be a free ebook reader with automatic bookmarking and social reviews that ties into the Gutenburg Project for free Public Domain books. &nbsp;'NighPhone
 WebApps' will be an 'appstore' of sorts, providing an interface to search, test, and install widgets to launch iPhone WebApps on your Nokia device - complete with social reviews and 2 levels of installations (local bookmarks and local widget generation/installation).
 &nbsp;Finally 'NagNagNag' will be a Location Based Service that watches where you spend your time and allows for location based time budgeting, allowing you to setup alarms such as [nag me if i work more than 50 hours a week] or [nag me if i don't visit family
 at least once a season].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;"Hey those are good ideas for apps, can I steal the ideas and make them myself"?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;Sure. &nbsp;Go for it. &nbsp;I'm still gonna write them myself too, and release them as open source projects, so do whatever you want to. &nbsp;Just be forewarned that Ovi Store might be a horrible horrible horrible place to distribute them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>i was quite angry when my negative review was deleted, my mentality being that if they're removing the criticisms then the reviews section becomes obsolete because it would be entirely untrustworthy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe they're using a badly written automatic system to moderate reviews?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could also be that the human moderators do not understand the deranged and incoherent babbling of the brainded users, and think they're good commentary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or maybe the moderators understand them, because they are also deranged and incoherent babblers, and it all makes perfect sense to them? In short: It makes no sense to me, if rational reviews are deleted, but incoherent babbling is left there.</p>

i, too, think that removing criticism depreciates the reviews section. not only does that result in users buying apps on misguided advice, it also results in developers targeting their audience based on misguided advice.</blockquote>

i have a theory, and&nbsp;<span>vandelay you might want to include this with your message to the Ovi Store Team.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>Here, i'm assuming the the Ovi Store mobile client offers the same functionality as the Website (see only comments in your language) and that this is enabled by default (i don't see the option anywhere). &nbsp;This theory provides a reasonable explanation
 for the original removal events without requiring a villain - but still the responsibility falls on Nokia to prevent this from damaging the users experience and the Ovi Store itself.&nbsp;</blockquote>

            another thought has&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to me. there have been a number of occasions when i've&nbsp;inadvertently&nbsp;clicked the 'report issue' link on the touch screen of my n97 instead of the 'next' button at the bottom of the reviews page of the ovi store. i've always
 noticed this and clicked back, but i guess it would be pretty easy to then accidentally press 'send' at the bottom of the report issue screen. &nbsp;if they are automatically deleting reviews which are reported rather than manually looking into it, this could be
 a reason positive reviews are also being removed.

<h3> ale2999  say:</h3>
<h2>            WP8 Error 8103010d</h2>
                    I updated the Weather app on my lumia 920 and the download stopped half way. and gave an error. In the download page it states"Attention Required. Tap here" When I tap I get the error "There is a problem completing your request. Try again later. Error
 Code:&nbsp;8103010d"
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the following:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Cancel the download</li><li>Unistall the app (unistall option is greyed out)</li><li>Rebooting the phone<br />
</li></ul>
<div>Nothing works, and now I have the app on the app list and it can't be run (tapping on it takes you to the download page of the store) and it can't be removed as unistall is greyed out.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
Can someone please assist?</div>

            Ok so Microsoft says its Nokia and Nokia says its Microsoft..... So no now what?? If I were a salesman for AT&amp;T I would tell the customers to stay away from the windows phone for simple reasoning that it is not worth the time and effort. If the companies
 want to know why the widows phone don't sell I have found their answer. All I want is to update an app that I use instead I get finger pointing. I have 14 days to return the phone and I might just do that. It aggravating. Someone should find answer other then
 us on message boards. It's their responsibilities not ours.&nbsp;

<h2>            &#91;5800XM&#93; New e-mail notification icon doesn&#39;t disappear when you have many e-mails in a msgbox.</h2>
                    
<p>Problem observed by me on any firmware version, I'm using actually v 50.0.005 in my 5800XM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have over 200 e-mails in your mailbox on server and you have downloaded them into the phone (even only e-mails headers) then icon in upper right corner (that envelope with @ sign) doesn't want disappear. Only phone turn off then turn on is solution
 which is not so funny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? Magic spells? Wake up developers! This bug? is very irritating. :(&nbsp;</p>

            the only way to work around this annoying issue is to hard reset your phone. read the below carefully and use last option, follow it to your phones specific key assigment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With all these operations I recommend you TAKE OUT MEMORY CARD and DO A BACK UP OF YOUR STUFF!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: In front of the hash key ( #) there is also a STAR key that people often miss and state that the code does not work.<br />
<br />
1.. *#7780# - Restore factory settings - resets all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data) Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default code for ALL operations listed
 here is 12345.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2.*#7370# - Reformat your phone (out of the box, tho keep in mind that most newer nokia phones at least n series, e series and s60 based phones have udp - user data preservation so not ALL data may be lost. still it is a good idea to always do a back up of
 your stuff.)3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default code is 12345)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. hard reset - hold the following buttons * (star key), 3 (number button) and talk/green key. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons until you see the Nokia boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while
 still holding all three buttons ( for Nokia 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a hard reset, /GREEN/RED/CAMERA keys pressed all at once on power up. this will only work on 5800's that have firmware version 20... and up. ) For Nokia N97 (unofficial version
 but works) is SHIFT /SPACE BAR / BACKSPACE while holding the power button. Again do not let go until you see the handshake screen.<br />
<br />
If these codes are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your Nokia Care Center/Service for assistance.<br />

<p>Exactly same issue here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The only way to make notifyicon disappear is to retrieve full email and open them one by one (Check all as readed wont work) or restarting device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had a lot of problems with Nokia messaging service aswell, everytime i have tried to install and run it, only&nbsp; the configuration assistant comes out, on either icon of the application I try (The red @ icons). I don't see any change on my device as
 the mail is yet managed by 5800 self email manager (On messages icon)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love a solution that doesn't imply a hard reset</p>

<h2>            Prevent recent files from showing in O365 activated with account</h2>
                    I bought O365 for someone and had to activate it on their computer by signing in. I then realized that this person now has access to all my recent files in Office on their PC. I switched account to their Windows account so that my recent files do not show
 but what if the person clicks around and eventually switch account back to mine? Will the person be able to open my files? How do I prevent this?

            If you installed Office 365 on their computer using your account, chances are yes, they will eventually stumble upon your recent documents. Best practice would have been to install Office 365 with their account, which would keep your documents separated from your documents.

<p>That I just realized. So now I'm wondering if there is a way to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way that it can be linked to the person's account even though I activated it with mine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought it under my account since I was using my CC so I wanted to maintain that control - but now it seems I've lost control of my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if it was the Home version with 5 users, would all users have access to each other's files?</p>

            If you have 5 licences, you should be able to remove your account on their Office install, then add your's. Which would maintain separation of files. You should be open word, create a blank document, click file, choose account. On the upper left you'll see "switch account". This will give you the option to log into their account. If they by chance happen to click there, and try to switch, they'll be prompted to log in. 
<br />Worst case scenario, would be having to uninstall Office, log into to their account on the portal.office.com site, and install from there.

            So I chatted with MS Support. The solution is to refund the purchase and purchase O365 under a different account. I'll use the person's MS account instead.

<p>I believe that article only applies to Win 7, 8.1 and those that aren't on build 10240 yet.</p>

            <p>We are on the same page, only the subversion changes.</p>
<p>But as mrhappy and the article points out, the RTM subversion is 16410.</p>
<p>On my system it's still 16384. So I hope there is a patch still coming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it does not look like :-(</p>
<p>The review from Walter Mossberg also points out that there are still bugs left. So I am at least not alone.</p>

            A repair upgrade replaces and fixes broken Windows 10 system files while preserving your apps, files and settings.

<br />You need to use the Media Creation Tool to download the ISO file, learn how:

            I don't know if this fixed my problem, because I cannot open windows defender at all.&nbsp; The cursor just flutters all over the place.&nbsp; That aside, I am very upset with Microsoft and their updates.&nbsp; I was told that all my files would remain, well after the
 upgrade, all my subfolders are gone again.&nbsp; This same thing happened to me on another machine just a couple of days ago and no one seems to know anything about it.&nbsp; The case number for my other machine is #1410527043.&nbsp; Just like my other machine, everything
 is gone from this PC.&nbsp; I sure hope someone has a better idea as to what is going on with your updates.

    <title>Haptic Alert duration and persistence - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robmart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Haptic Alert duration and persistence</h2>
                    My complements on&nbsp;Band 2&nbsp;innovations and refinements.&nbsp; This is an elegant, well-crafted device.&nbsp; The primary reason I bought it is notifications.&nbsp; I keep my phone on vibrate alert&nbsp;most of the time.&nbsp; When active I frequently miss the brief and singular
 alert for incoming calls and messages.&nbsp; The haptic alerts on the band are similarly brief and easily missed (as when holding a steering wheel while driving).&nbsp; May I request options be added to Haptic Alert that would allow vibration duration to be selectable
 between brief (as it is now), intermediate and longer and for&nbsp;vibration characteristic to be selectable between solid and intermittent?&nbsp; May I also request that options be added that would include Haptic alert continuation until dismissed or acknowledged.&nbsp;
 These additional options would greatly increase the usefulness of my new Band and hopefully elevate its appeal in the marketplace.&nbsp; Thank you

            I have certainly noticed that characteristic of calendar alerts.&nbsp; I also notice I seldom miss those notifications, nor do I miss the alarm alerts that&nbsp;I set to remind myself&nbsp;of tasks through out the day.&nbsp; They also have a longer duration.&nbsp; I think we have
 identified a pattern.&nbsp; Thanks so much for supporting this discussion!&nbsp; Maybe it will prompt an address of our function requests!

    <title>Okay get ready... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> familiaherraiz garcia de guadiana  say:</h3>
<h2>            Okay get ready...</h2>
                    <p>Okay, well I installed Windows 10 without a problem and it looks pretty nice. I know you guys (Microsoft) are looking for some constructive criticism so I'm going to help you out with what I think needs some refining. Obviously, this is a very rough draft
 of what the final product will look like. First of all I wanted to point out thathave an HP Touchsmart (Desktop, not laptop) and when trying to open the METRO start with all the tiles, using my finger, the Mouse Start pops up. So I would like to see the tile
 base software if I have a touch based computer. Secondly the design team looks like they are shooting for a flat more retro looking UI, therefore I suggest that this style is across the board. For example, the "File Explorer" with the&nbsp;folder icon which is
 pinned to the taskbar looks great, but for example Control Panel and all the icons like Videos, Picture etc. are the same as Windows 7 and 8.1. So, what would I do? I would try to make the UI have a more uniform design, personally&nbsp;the retro style is working
 for me. Having a uniform UI will make other customers more comfortable with the supposedly "2-worlds interface" (METRO and Desktop). This problem is also seen in the taskbar, when programs are open the shine they have when scrolling over them is very Windows
 7. MAKE AN EXECUTIVE DECISION IN THE DESIGN UI! Thirdly, the windows seem a bit choppy when moving them around and snapping them on the sides, but I liked the idea of suggestions to snap in other apps. Thirdly, the Search that is pinned to the taskbar is really
 nice, I would personally add Cortana from Windows Phone 8.1 including suggestions personalized for the user. But ultimately the Search feature has to be improved. I no longer get the awesome search profiles that I got in Windows 8.1, I would definitely make
 this a feature drawn to Desktop scale users.&nbsp;The "Trending Now" on the side of the Search window is very lame, and if you add Cortana this could expand to become what I mentioned above. Another thing I am missing is the Brightness setting and Notifications
 command that I use to find under Charm Bar&gt;Settings. Another discomfort is when clicking the ellipses on the upper left hand corner the old Settings from the Charm Bar pop out. When the app is in windowed format having the settings all the way to the right
 is unexpected and uncomfortable. Finally, when I have several tabs open in IE and I scroll over the IE Icon (which needs an update, design wise) I get a preview of the tabs, but again, it is just a nostalgic look of Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't be afraid of polishing the software not only efficiency wise, but decide on a UI, don't have a mix of reflecting icons and deco/METRO icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this massive review helps, and as I dig in deeper I will be back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pablo (Life-long Windows User)</p>

            <p>Hi Mario,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are getting error message "Content on this website is&nbsp;unsafe" . The issue could be if there is some add-on causing this or security software restricting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First try to run the fixit provided in the following article and see if it helps you to fix the issue. This fixit diagnose and repair IE problems that make IE slow, not secure, unstable or crash, caused by add-ons not working or inappropriate security
 settings. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Fix Internet Explorer issues to make IE fast, safe and stable</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Fixit doesn't help, let’s try these methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There could possibly be a problematic add-on which might be causing the problem. Let’s try the following to see if an add-on is causing this issue. We can do this by running Internet Explorer in
<strong><span>No Add-ons</span></strong> mode. If the problem is not present in No Add-ons mode we can diagnose that it is an add-on that is causing the issue, and from there we can take steps to locate and disable the add-on. To open
<strong><span>Internet Explorer</span></strong> in <strong><span>No Add-ons mode</span></strong>, please do the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open the desktop, and then tap or click the Internet&nbsp;Explorer icon on the taskbar.</span></li><li><span>Tap or click the <strong><span>Tools</span></strong> button, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Manage add-ons</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Under <strong><span>Show</span></strong>, tap or click <strong><span>All add-ons</span></strong>, and then select the add-on you want to turn off.</span></li><li><span>Tap or click <strong><span>Disable</span></strong>, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Close</span></strong>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</span></strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more clarification you may refer to the link provided below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</strong></span>
</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Delete the browser cache and check. Follow these steps to do so.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Start Internet Explorer 10.<br />
b. On the <strong><span>Tools </span></strong>menu, click <strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong>. If you can't see the Tools menu, press Alt to display the menus.<br />
c. Click the <strong><span>General</span></strong> tab.<br />
d. Under <strong><span>Browsing History</span></strong>, click <strong><span>Delete</span></strong>.<br />
e. In the <strong><span>Delete Browsing History</span></strong> dialog box, click to select the following check boxes, and then click
<strong><span>Delete:</span></strong><strong><br />
<strong><span>Temporary Internet Files , Cookies , History</span></strong></strong><br />
f. Click <strong><span>Close</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>OK</span></strong> to close the
<strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong> dialog box.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue persists and the issue is specific to some websites then&nbsp;I would suggest you to open that websites in compatibility view and see if it helps.

<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to have cleared up magically when I pressed the individuals for specific information on the security&nbsp;in their workstations regarding their Internet Explorer.&nbsp; They never replied back to me directly regarding their issue, but&nbsp;they&nbsp;have closed
 the problem ticket that was generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender Goes To Sleep</h2>
                    <p>When I start up Windows Defender to run a full scan, it goes to sleep when the monitor goes to sleep (blank screen).&nbsp; It has been&nbsp;"running" for over 12 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have to wake the monitor up before Defender will continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen other posts about this, but have not been able to find what to do to correct this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone have an answer ?</p>

<p><span>You can just extend the sleep timeout in Power Options, and then set it back again if you’re conscientious about saving energy – or you can run your scans with a batch file that automates the power-saving settings for your Full Scans. I think these
 old batch files will probably still work for this:</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To run scans that will prevent the system from idling to sleep, but that won’t shut down the PC at the end of the scan, just omit the shutdown line.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>

            Thanks for the information.&nbsp; I will try it the next time I do a full scan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems like MS could come up with a more straight forward way of doing this.

    <title>Skype add-in causes Excel to paste value instead of formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radar369  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype add-in causes Excel to paste value instead of formula</h2>
                    Excel on my desktop has stopped pasting formulas correctly.&nbsp; I highlight a cell, hit control/c, select the cells to paste to and hit paste.&nbsp; The value of the original cell appears in all the cells, although if I click on the individual cell, it shows the
 correct formula in the edit window.&nbsp; The posted solution suggests that a Skype add-in is the problem and suggests downloading a corrected version of a "click to call" add it.&nbsp; Instructions say to follow an included link and click either a "download now" button
 or a "click to call" button.&nbsp; Neither appear in the page from the link.&nbsp; I've tried installing Skype again, and deleting it.&nbsp; The problem remains.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Radar369,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to better understand your concern, kindly provide answers to the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What specific add-in are you pertaining to? Is it from Microsoft as well?</p>
<p>When did you install the add-in?
</p>
<p>How does this add-in works?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly try to create a sample document in Excel and check the copy-paste function. Check if you will get any issues. This will help us to see if the problem exist within Skype or Excel.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your reply.
</p>
        </p>

<p>I did an on-line search for a solution and one that came up in the search said that the problem occurred because of an add-in called "click to call" in Skype.&nbsp; I tried their procedure to remedy the malfunction and the web page referred to in the dialog did
 not match what opened when I clicked on the link they provided.&nbsp; The buttons they referred to were not present, at least, not where I could find them.&nbsp; I did not specifically install the add-in.&nbsp; The solution implied that it resulted from a Skype update.&nbsp;
 The website said that a repaired version of the add-in was available, but I couldn't find it.&nbsp; Instead, I uninstalled Skype and the problem persisted.&nbsp; I reinstalled Skype hoping it would contain an updated add-in and the problem persisted.&nbsp; Now I don't know
 if this add-in is the problem or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clips:</p>
<p>I create a formula, and copy it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then paste:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It pastes the value of the copied cell in the subsequent pasted cells, instead of the result of the formula.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, if it can run Win 8, it can run Office 2013&nbsp; (don't call it "13", you make the MS marketing guys cry &lt;grin&gt; )<br />
<br />
There is a "feature" in 2013 that drove me absolutely up the wall. They call it "animation", I called it laggy or the "rubber band effect".&nbsp; Until I found this fix I was ready to throw 2013 out the window for just this one defect (incredibly stupid, too much
 time on their hands, dumb programmer trick!) <br />

Any security software still installed?</p>

<p>
Please review the following:</p>
<p>
A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>

You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

My recommendation, after reviewing the above and taking action to remove conflicting software and addressing any other potential issues with your setup, is to uninstall MSE:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a></p>

Then install from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure to select the correct version for your operating system and also the language, if that applies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>We are receiving a 'long running script error' when loading Office 365 Files pages in either Edge or IE11. Chrome and Firefox do not appear to have the same issue. Is anyone else seeing this behaviour? Has anyone found a resolution other than using another

    <title>How to get removed from Outlook blacklist&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gemannihilator  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get removed from Outlook blacklist&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After cleaning out out email on our own mail server by testing and removing invalid emails, we couldn't send emails to anything Microsoft anymore, hotmail, outlook, msn, live. We would get an error report stating that:</div>
<div>
<div>"host mx4.hotmail.com[65.54.188.126] said: 550 SC-002</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (BAY0-MC4-F25) Unfortunately, messages from *Ip Address* weren't sent."</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Looking up the error code tells me that we have been namespace mining, which is true in a way I suppose, but now we're in a situation where we can't send emails to 12,000 customers who want to recieve our emails. After filling out a form where we send
 our IP in to be checked, we got another email stating:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"We have completed reviewing the IP(s) you submitted. The following table contains the results of our investigation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>More information needed</div>
<div>*Insert our IP address*</div>
<div>There are indications that the above IP(s) are engaged in namespace mining. Outlook.com is blocking all email sent from this IP.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Namespace mining is a method commonly used by malicious senders to generate lists of email addresses. This approach uses automation to sift through possible email names seeking to identify valid email addresses, e.g., *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, and
 *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You must correct the problem and you must stop the behavior described above. We recommend that you work with your email or network administrator to review the logs of your email servers. Check the sending log files and concentrate on logs that are sending
 to nonexistent @hotmail.com, @live.com, @msn.com, @outlook.com?with multiple tries and failures."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And ending with:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"There is no silver bullet to maintaining or improving good IP reputation, but these programs help you proactively manage your email eco-system to help better ensure deliverability to Outlook.com users.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Outlook.com Deliverability Support"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, this is all very well and good, but there is no solution to our problem here, no-one to contact or anything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After this we tried phoning up Microsoft support, only to get bounced around in circles throughout the system as no-one there seemed to know what was going on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help that provides results would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>This too has affected my company. I run a WISP with over 3000 customers, over 5000 email accounts. I run a tight ship on email. Their accusations have cost me customers and their lack of response is utterly unmentionable. We have filled out their on line
 form 16 times!! The last time we actually receive a response, also stating we were guilty of namespace mining. What they are seeing as namespace mining is just active, real, live email, coming from 5000 separate users, all with friends and companies dumb enough
 to use Microsoft email services. Any good email service should be forced to allow the end user to whitelist or bypass their, at times, faulty anti-spam technoligies. Mine does! I host banks, businesses large and small, school systems, county government, state
 run facilities, and I have lost 10 clients, equaling a monthly loss of over 1500.00 just because they have me blocked. I have been a Microsoft Certified Partner for over 12 years. I am Microsoft Certified, a member of their Action Pack, and other long term
 affiliations. This is ridiculous! The fact that it took them 14 tries, almost a month, to get back to me is unforgivable and absolutely no way to run a "business". I have customers who are mad, frustrated and ready to leave me just because of this. Who is
 going to help me? Nobody at Microsoft can even route me to the correct department. I am not namespace mining and my system, logs, outbound queue, auditing can prove it! I will join any free email system they want me to, if it will help, but thus far no resolution,
 no temporary unblock to check my system, no contact whatsoever! I can only say this: their are a lot of anti-spam organizations that can protect your email, and a lot of free email providers, I have always been a staunch supporter of Microsoft, but run dont
 walk to another provider for these type of services. </p>

            <p>Eugene, I have run into the exact same issue as the starter of this thread. The link you provide is the same as I have used. You can enter your information and your sending IP and the only response you get is, hey you have been namespace mining and you need
 to fix that (the same message as the starter of this thread got).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message has no link to contact support any other way, no option to get removed from the blacklist, etc. Basically is says, to bad, you have to sort out your stuff and maybe, someday, you will be able to send messages to @Hotmail.com, @outlook.com, @msn.com
 or @live.com addresses again. I am sorry, but that is no way to run things. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am stuck with a worldwide company that no longer has the ability to reach its end-users or dealers using any of the addresses associated with Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has to be another way to get this sorted!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other&nbsp;way of contacting Outlook.com Deliverability Support it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            nokia 6300 contacts problem</h2>
                    This is what happened to my phone. I was just changing the themes when suddenly my phone restarted. When I looked up my contacts, they were all gone! However, when I checked the memory status of my phone contacts, it still says 57% used and 43% free. It
 means that the contacts are still there however, I can't access them!<br />
<br />
I tried to sync my contacts with the newest version of the Nokia PC suite. My phone says that it is sending 576 contacts but it always fails. When I look up the contacts in the pc suite, only the first 27 contacts are shown in my pc.<br />
<br />
Where are the rest of my contacts? How can I recover all of them?<br />

            here is something that you can try may or may not work<br />
go to contacts, settings and check memory in use..; if sil memory is in use set it to phone memory and then check how many contacts you have if they appear fine if not put the sim memory in use and COPY th econtacts over and do not move them only copy them
 over and explain the results

            I also have the same problem . All of the sudden the mobile restarted and the theme was blank. When i looked in the contacts it was empty but when saw the phone memory then it was 65%. Then i copied the entries from phone to sim then i showed the contacts
 which is not complete, i.e, some contacts are missing and also the recieved calls and dialled calls are not stored in Call log.<br />
Could any one please help me?

            heyy, try to sync your contacts with outlook using a pc suite. if that fails then it might be a possible software crash!<br />
you can also try resetting the phone, this job only restores the settings so your data will not be lost.<br />

    <title>Combine two Skype accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabrielema_12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combine two Skype accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Skype 12.10.572.0 on my desktop, Windows 10. I have my all my contacts here but lately I am unable to use the camera when I Skype. I get the message : other application is using camera. I have turned off all camera uses in settings except for Skype
 and have gone through all the other possible fixes. Since nothing worked, I have now installed Skype classic as well. Since this is all done through my Microsoft account, I have a different profile and I am unable to combine the two Skype accounts. The new
 version gives me a new user name and also won't show my contacts. How can I combine this two Skype accounts on my computer. All I really need is a setting to use the camera. Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I beleive the Map data for N900 is still being processed by Nokia. What I could advise though is to try installing Map Loader on your PC and transfer the Map of Georgia from there. I cannot guarantee though that it has a detailed map since N900 is fairly
 new and unlike other Nokia phones it runs in Maemo Operating System. You could download the Map Loader application from
