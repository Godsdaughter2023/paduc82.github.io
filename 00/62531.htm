<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit slow to copy and open folders</h2>
                    
<p>System is very slow when copying files and opening folders. The "Discoverying" dialog box is up for an extremly long time. Every time I open a folder there is a green bar that runs across the address like it is scanning, that takes a long time as well. Seems
 like this happened in Vista and I was able to disable something that allowed fast copying of files. Anyone know a fix for this problem in Win 7.</p>

<h2>            Accidentally canceled windows 10 setup on windows 7 when it was installing it, now windows setup says my product key isn&#39;t valid.</h2>
                    I was trying to upgrade my computer to windows 10 from windows 7, and it had just started installing the update when I accidentally canceled it. now I think I've used up the product key and it wont let me install it (setup has failed to validate the product
 key) when it worked fine before, as it had gotten to the installation part.

<h2>            Every exe file I open gives me a &#34;file corrupt...run chkdsk&#34;, but virus and malware scans are clean&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am completely stumped here. When I booted my computer up today I got a notification saying one of the startup programs's exe file was corrupt. I think "uhoh". Then my antvirus software doesnt start up with the same and I get the notification that I am not
 running and antivirus. Then I realize every exe file I click gives me the error "file is corrupt...please run chkdsk" popping up in the task bar. At this point I'm thinking virus or malware.</p>
<p><br />
Some of the programs still run even with the corrupt message, but every exe, whether it is old or newly downloaded, will give me this corrupt message. Futher, when I tried to reinstall my antivirus, it would not run. (I am running Avast Internet Security Pro).</p>
<p>I wound up downloading AVG free and for some reason that exe is not being corrupted. So I atleast have an antivirus running&nbsp;program now.</p>
<p><br />
I scanned my entire system with AVG with the latest virus definitions and it shows no viruses. I run Malwarebytes with the latest updates...nothing there either.<br />
<br />
My computer is clean? To me this seems unlikely, but is there something that is not a virus or malware that could cause this?</p>
<p>Also, I booted in safe mode and it performs exactly the same.Every exe is corrupt when I open it.</p>
<p>I am all out of ideas, except to reformat.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<h2>            Unable to access my account because of Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yesterday I finaly decided to buy GTA 5... was having fun then I got this error.</p>
<p><em>"Sorry, This profile cannot connect to Xbox Live on this console. Please download it again.</em><br />
<em>Error Code: 80151006"</em></p>
<p>When I restarted my Xbox it asked me to add my email and password, did that, said it was already added so it looped me back to add email.</p>
<p>Decided to just stop playing for the day and try to wait it out. Today I was able to log in again, play yet again and then out of the blue the same</p>
<p>error pops up again after signing me out of Live...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas in how to get this fixed?</p>

<p>Hi InfernoWolfNLD, im having the same thread since ive changed my GT.</p>
<p>It starts the download and says: "Hi Manza BR" (thats the new GT) but stops in 40MB and pops the message "Sorry, unable to download profiles at the moment. Please try again later. 80151006".</p>
<p>I have tried to clean the cache a couple of times, restart the console, delete the 40MB profile but nothing works. Curiously when logging in my PC or Ipad, the social profile in live.xbox.com says i was seen online playing xbox, so i understand it recognizes
 i was connected somehow with the console though i can not log in in xbox live with the console, complete the profile download and neither use my saved games...</p>

    <title>100&#37; disk utilization on Windows 10 Home 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mahesha999  say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; disk utilization on Windows 10 Home 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>My machine is Dell XPS 15 l502x. I have licensed Windows 10 Home 64 bit. It was working all fine for several months until suddenly it got slow. When I tried to find whats going on bad, I realized that the disk utilization is 100% as can be seen in screeshot
 below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87d0c060-b71e-46d5-8185-d137ba5549f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87d0c060-b71e-46d5-8185-d137ba5549f1" /></a></p>
<p><br />
However in Processes tabs, I cant see much % disk utilization:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96a22c5f-11ae-4d0e-95c5-251f56a74937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96a22c5f-11ae-4d0e-95c5-251f56a74937" /><br />
</a>There are many threads online discussing this issue. Uptil now I have tried this:</p>
<p>chkdsk, turning of several processes (windows search, superfetch, BITS etc) from sevices.msc, nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I came across this MIcrosoft page which requires me to modify some registry:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/3083595/task-manager-might-show-100-disk-utilization-on-windows-10-devices-with-message-signaled-interrupt-msi-</p>
<p>mode-enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>It asks to modify this registry:&nbsp;<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\ &lt;AHCI Controller&gt;\Device
 Parameters\Interrupt Management\MessageSignaledInterruptProperties</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But I can find the same in my machine:<br />

<h2>            Blue Screen pops up&#40;windows10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, every one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using 8.1 and just upgraded to W 10 about one week ago. At first, everything seemed fine and I was satisfied.</p>
<p>However, recently, annoying blue screens appear quite a lot, saying my laptop has an error whose code is "qcamain10x64.sys"</p>
<p>Am I the only one who suffers from this thing?</p>
<p>I would appreciate any advices regarding this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope all of you understand my problem because English is not my mother tongue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Regina.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Regina,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Sorry to know that youâ€™re facing this issue, however Iâ€™ll glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow few methods in order to fix this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Try to boot the computer in Safe mode and see if the issue still persist. Safe Mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows
 from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode.<br />
</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Perform a Clean boot. Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article
 mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: If the same issue occurs then restart using the
<strong>installation DVD.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Insert the Windows 10 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from DVD". Press any key.

    <title>Windows 10 Activation on Virtual Box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation on Virtual Box</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 home via the OTA update from years ago, so no product key, just the license associated with the computer.&nbsp; I initially was interested in dual booting win10 alongside ubuntu 18.04 so I went through the process of using windows media creator
 to make a bootable disk using the iso file for a clean install.&nbsp; My goal was to get the clean reinstall of windows, then try ubuntu via the live usb to verify my system could handle it, then I was going to install alongside win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reinstall of windows 10 off the bootable disk went well - no problems and windows was activated.&nbsp; After playing around with the ubuntu live usb I decided I didn't really feel like dealing with a dual boot ad was gong to install ubuntu (I use it at work
 so it wasn't a hard decision) and get to windows via virtualbox.&nbsp; I'd go 100% linux but there are a couple of apps I use that will only work on windows, so I needed access.&nbsp; The ubuntu install went fine, installed virtualbox and proceeded to get windows going.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the iso file directly to my drive, added the machine to virtualbox and got it installed.&nbsp; I found out very quickly I could not personalize anything due to the activation problem.&nbsp; Letting windows troubleshoot did not resolve the problem.&nbsp; I
 went through this process twice and got different error codes each time - forgot the first one but the second one is 0x803F7001.&nbsp; In both cases a google search points to the same thing - can't find license/product key/etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think part of the problem has to do with my clean install and not knowing what my windows account information was.&nbsp; I set something up to install and moved on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually had a number of problems having to do with username and passwords because I never
 had any of this with my prior version so I didn't what it might be and so on.&nbsp; When I tried to install win10 via virtualbox the first time I had to change the password because I couldn't enter what I thought was the right one properly.&nbsp; A mess.&nbsp; I don't need
 a password!&nbsp; This is my personal laptop and there is nothing relevant on it.&nbsp; Anyway, I think this partially screwed me up somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere in my win10 settings (can't find it now!) I saw that there are 2 computers already associated with my account.&nbsp; Names I do not recognize and they are different.&nbsp; I have a suspicion that each is associated with my two virtualbox installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can I even install win10 via iso on virtualbox (according to the internet and a lot of articles, yes)?&nbsp; If so, how do I get to recognize my machine?&nbsp; Absolutely nothing has changed with the hardware - same box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- laptop with previous ota windows10 install</p>
<p>- successful clean install of win10, no activation problems</p>
<p>- overwrote clean install of win10 with ubuntu 18.04</p>
<p>- 2 failed installs of win10 on ubuntu via virtualbox (won't activate)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything I can do here other than going back to clean install (and dual boot to ubuntu) if even possible now, or purchasing something I already own?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p><span>Hi Iawaz,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We understand your concern. Depending on how you got your license for Windows 10, you'll need either a 25-character product key or a digital license to activate it. Without one of these, you won't be able to activate your device. The product key or
 digital license can't be substituted for one another.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to go through the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thanks for the replies, but they are not really addressing my problem.
<p>
</p><p>I have a win10 digital license on my laptop and can successfully do a clean install of windows 10.&nbsp; The problem only occurs when I install ubuntu and try to install win10 virtually - it doesn't see the license.&nbsp; I tried a number of times and activation was
 always a problem.&nbsp; I have a dual boot working well, so that will have to do. </p>

<p>Hi LT,</p>
<p>I suggest going into the BIOS and changing the boot device from whatever it is (looks like floppy drive) to the hard drive in the list of bootable devices.</p>
<p>You may have to read the manual that came with the PC for further instructions.</p>

<p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for updating us with your reply. Sorry to hear that you're still experiencing issues with your Fallout 4 disc not having the license recognized. If you haven't already, it may be worth your while to try the troubleshooting available in our support
 article entitled <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/errors/error-code-0x803F8001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Error 0x803F8001 occurs when you launch an Xbox One game</a> as this is typically the error code associated with the message you received.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anything, you can also attempt to install the game in <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/using-xbox-one-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
offline mode</a> then take the console online for updates to see if it then becomes recognized. I would also recommend giving the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
removal and then re-addition of your profile to the console</a> to refresh your licensing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give the troubleshooting a try and please let us know the results.</p>
<p>I hope that this helps out a bit more!</p>

    <title>winsrv was not found - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ritchie888w  say:</h3>
<h2>            winsrv was not found</h2>
                    Before you say it, I have done a search and done many of the solutions to the titles problem, however nothing has worked.
<br />
<br />
This is an XP home edition laptop, I have the CD.<br />
<br />
Trying to fix my mums computer. She attempted to do a defrag the other day and after restarting she got a message stating c_1252.nls was missing. Having done some searching I found out, using the XP disc and the recover console, how to copy that particular
 file from the disc and into system32. After doing this a couple of other files popped up saying they were missing (c_437.nls and l_intl.nls) and I copied them across from the disc to system32 in the same way as before.
<br />
<br />
Now I'm getting the XP logo appear, but then immediately a BSOD stating that winsrv is missing (C0000135). Not winsrv.dll, just winsrv. Having searched many forums and Googled this question they all seem to suggest the same thing of copying the file from the
 disc to system32, almost identically to how I solved the first issue above. I have done this, but all their suggestions say to copy winsrv.dll across, which was already there. I copied it over anyway, from the disc, but still the error is there. Unless the
 BSOD is suggesting another type of winsrv is missing (not .dll) then I'm not sure what to make of the error message. Lots of people have an error message specifically stating that winsrv.dll is missing, mine just says winsrv.<br />
<br />
I've done a CHKDSK (both /p and /r). /p was fast and said there was errors. /r was slow, but completed it eventually, and after a reboot the same BSOD error. Safe mode does nothing either, same error appears. Can't seem to restore to an earlier point, and when
 using the XP disc to try and repair the OS the option isn't there, so I can only do a clean wipe.
<br />
<br />
I've taken the hard drive out and put it into a desktop so I can view the files on the HDD. All I'm trying to do is save some pictures from the HDD, I don't care of fixing the issue after that. What's really weird though is that the HDD states that 50% of the
 disc is full, as I know it is, but when going to the picture folder I'm seeing the correct folder structure but no files inside. Why is this? Permission access? some security measure? The OS didn't have a password or any other security measures, so I was hoping
 I could just grab the data off the HDD and then give up on the computer (as it's very old) but no luck so far. Tried this method with the HDD inside the laptop and using an Ubuntu Live CD to check the hdd, same problem with the folders all being there but
 no files. All looks good, just no files!<br />
<br />
If someone could give me a solution to either issue, either get the computer booting again or a way to access the files off the HDD, I'd be really appreciative!

            The files you mentions are included in the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after, so they should never be missing and it takes extra effort to delete them on purpose.&nbsp; If they are missing, they were probably quarantined (effectively deleted)
 by your unspecified antivirus/antimalware application and you should tell us what that is.<br />
<br />
That ideas from XP ROCKS may be right if you just installed Service Pack 2, but if you have Service pack 3 installed, you already have that fix since it is included in SP3, but it is worth a look.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, if you try to install it on a SP3 system you will see this message:<br />
<br />
Setup has detected that the Service Pack version of this system is newer than the update you are applying.&nbsp; There is no need to install this update.<br />
<br />
This error is easy to fix:<br />
<br />
STOP: c0000135 {Unable To Locate Component}<br />
This application has failed to start because winsrv.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
I hope you will let us know what happens or wish to pursue if further, then you need to tell us what your installed Service Pack is and if the CD you are using is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack.&nbsp; If you have SP3 installed, you might not
 want to be replacing missing files with SP2 versions (or worse) from an old CD.<br />
<br />
If you moved the HDD to another system to copy off files, you probably need to "take ownership" of the folders that you can't open or see the contents (even though you know they are there).&nbsp;
<br />

Thanks for your reply. <br />
<br />
Like I say, I don't get the 'winsrv.dll' error message appear, purely 'winsrv'. <br />
<br />
The laptop was up to date, so SP3 was installed. The disc I'm using was an .ISO I found online for a retail version of XP home, SP3 also. Seeing as this laptop never came with a disc it was a nightmare to find a disc to get the recovery console.
<br />
<br />
Antivirus installed was microsoft security essentials, the problem started when my mum
<i>allegedly </i>was defragging the computer. She's not a techno wizz so a virus is plausible, but I know she was defragging at the time, I just don't know what else she did! I can't see how a defragging would cause this.
<br />
<br />
I will try the 'taking ownership' option though, thank you. <br />
<br />
XP ROCKS; first of all it most certainly does NOT rock at times like this, secondly I had seen that link and read through before, but disregarded it due to being on SP3. Thanks anyway.<br />
<br />
MERRY CHRISTMAS! Please don't feel the need to reply today, this problem isn't that important.
<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />

    <title>Skype account name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michelaaru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype account name</h2>
                    Time ago, I created a Skype account using a name. Today, I created a new account but it was only possible using e-mail or phone number. I don't like this: if I want to give people an univocal ID to contact me on Skype I must use the "live:xxx_xxx" ID,
 which is the first part of my e-mail address and 6 numbers, and that's not easy to remember. Not like a name, anyway. Is there a way to go back to the "old way"? Thank you.

<p>
</p><p>It is correct that the option to create or choose a username before is possible, however, due to ongoing changes, this has been removed. Right now, when you sign up an account in Skype, you'll be asked to provide your Microsoft account or mobile number and
 the system will provide you a pre-define username.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: Skype names and pre-defined usernames cannot be changed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're concerned that your contacts will not be able to memorize it to search you in Skype, you can provide them your email address or mobile phone instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your question if the option to create or choose a username is possible again, I can only suggest to leave a feedback regarding this, so we'll know how this impacts you, here is the link:

    <title>Windows 10 not activated, device showing in my account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric_m_97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not activated, device showing in my account</h2>
                    <p>I recently changed out my motherboard, CPU, and RAM, due to damages. I linked my digital license to my account before the hardware change, as I'd read to do so online. However, after the hardware change I can't get the digital license to reactivate. When
 I called customer support they asked for my windows 7 key, but that's something my dad bought 6 years ago and I've no way to find it. It was not an OEM, it was a full version and a legitimate copy which never had issues, neither when I ran Windows 7 nor when
 I upgraded to Windows 10. But he bought it from a vendor and doesn't remember who it was nor have records of it. In my Windows 10 account devices list, it shows the desktop with the correct name and the info is up to date, and it doesn't have any issues marked
 out like you'd expect since there's no activation of Windows on the device. Similarly, the activation troubleshooter correctly showed the current device, but when I mark it as the device I'm using right now it then fails to activate and tells me to try again
 later. The customer service rep I was connected to adamantly refused to help me without being told a key first, even though not a single support article says I'd need the key from my last version and all imply the digital license has such info attached to
 it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what do I do? I really, really don't want to pay for a new copy of Windows 10 when I don't think I should have to. But the threads I've read say to just call customer support if the troubleshooter doesn't work, and customer support could look through
 your account and activate it on your device. But customer support denied me service for a reason not mentioned in the articles I read. Please give advice.</p>

            Hi,
<br />unfortunately if you do not have a key you cannot activate Windows on new hardware. Digital license is valid only for old hardware and you may activate Windows on that old hardware without a key. But you need a key for new hardware.
<br />May be your Windows 7 box still lying around somewhere in your garage?
