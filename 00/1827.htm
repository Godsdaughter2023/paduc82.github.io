<h2>            Auto-Fill the from Field for Shared mailboxes that are added as additional mailboxes &#40;Not accounts&#41;</h2>
                    <p>We have users working with several mailboxes that are added as additional mailboxes (User has full access and sendOnbehalf permissions)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that every new email that is generated, even when working in one of the added mailboxes, it&nbsp;is using the main account "From" instead of the shared mailbox "From". Main account here being the users account, so the "From" field is autofilled
 with the users email address. </p>
<p>It works fine for replies and it works fine for forwards, but not for new emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anybody aware of a configuration or a 3rd party product that would support autofilling of the "From" field for shared mailboxes that are added as mailboxes (Please note, we do not want to add them as accounts for other reasons).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is very much appreciated.</p>
<p>kind regards</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<h2>            Vlookup on multiple sheets - &#35;REF&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a VLookup to find matches between two sheets, IDMS and MLD. Then I want to post the info from Column Z on MLD in the cell. The following formula works only when the column index number is 1, but changes to #REF! with any other number (even though
 there is data, no formulas, in several columns after that):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(IDMS!C1995,MLD!$A$1665:$A$2988,1,FALSE)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been looking for a couple hours for a solution and can't find one. Ideas? Please and thank you!!</p>

            First of all, the only way I know of that you can get a #REF! is if the tab names are not as represented in your formula. So please check again for leading and/or trailing spaces or other characters.<br />
<br />
Second, if you are looking up a value associated with the value in column A of MLD, then you need to include more columns in the look up range and specify the column containing the desired value. For example, if the desired value is in column C then:<br />
<br />
=VLOOKUP(IDMS!C1995,MLD!$A$1665:$C$2988,3,FALSE)<br />

            <p><strong>Can't open .jpg's. in Outlook.com</strong></p>
<p>1- I know what Gmail does, for now the only way is to save it to your HD, then open it.</p>
<p>A real pain and a giant step back to the days of DOS.</p>
<p>2- You can't insert .Jpg's&nbsp;either into your Outlook e-mail as Gmail does.</p>
<p>3- When I get home I plan on installing my Microsoft Expression, HTML Editor.</p>
<p>My plan is to create the layout with text &amp; pictures, then copy and past via the HTML outlook E-mail option. I know this works because presently I copy the HTML from Outlook&nbsp;to Word to remove the Blockquote's from the forwarded e-mails, then paste it back,
 works great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4- Lets not talk about the almost worthless Start Screen in Windows 8, properties????</p>
<p>5- There is a possibility that full Outlook functionality will only work once you purchase Office 360?</p>
<p>Remember the addition purchase of Win 8 Pro to your basic Win 8, so some thing would work.</p>
<p>6- Overall Outlook is a big improvement, <strong>and once they get these bug's out</strong> it will be the best in every way,
<strong>WHEN is the question?</strong></p>

            Ricktravel...I had exactly the same problem, but didn't discover it until someone sent me an attachment which was PDF. I couldn't open it at all...or save it for that matter. Also, a family member sent me some old family photos. I could view them, but
 that was about it. I then thought to myself .."what if I transfer the attachments (including the email) to another account, i.e. Yahoo.. It worked!!!&nbsp;
<div>I fail to understand just why Microsoft has done this to us. Hotmail was fine...yet Outlook is a royal pain in the a** as you said. Why fix something that isn't broken?</div>
<div>I'm almost at the point of closing this bloody Outlook email account, &amp; using another instead. What's the point in having something that's bothersome?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some explanations are that Outlook won't let you open something that could be potentially dangerous to your computer. If that's the case, WHY do we have anti-virus programs? If the attachment was dangerous or contained any virus..again, the anti-virus
 program would spring into action..at least mine would.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Changing Windows 10 to Insiders</h2>
                    <p>Have been an Insider for quite some time now, with installs on an old notebook and a VM. Decided to upgrade my other notebook from Windows 8.1 to 10, which went without a hitch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now wanted to convert this install to Insiders. Clicked all relative buttons, to change from local to Microsoft account. This was also done successfully. Then changed from the default slow to fast ring. This was all done yesterday morning. 24 hours later,
 I am still not being offered the Insiders install. How long do I have to wait? Or can I change some other settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notebook is a Sony Vaio SVS1512Z9E</p>

            Paragraph breaks are indicated by pilcrows (i.e. ¶). Similarly, tabs are indicated by →, and line breaks within a paragraph are indicated by ↵. The '¤'symbol is a table's end-of-cell or end-of-row marker.

<p>Thank for you quick feedback.</p>
<p>Please I beg for next version of Skype you can restore the setting for deleting all conversations or otherwise managing my storage size. Otherwise it leaves me no choice but to delete the app!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows Insider Build Crashed - Was only able to rebuild older &#34;expired&#34; version</h2>
                    <p>After the current version of Windows 10 insider crashed, I tried to repair it, and it reverted back to some variant not quite W10. I'm not sure what it is. No comms with Cortana is possible. The Window button is only functional with right click. When I try
 to update, I get 0x80248014 error. I no longer see the new settings screens. Instead I see an old W8-style control panel most of the the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get to the old-style Windows Update, it says "Windows Update is not set up for thsi PC. These settings are managed by your system admimistrator." Well, I am (was) the admimistrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe i'm EOL for Windows Insider. There seems no way to get updates running again. I have no restorable copy. That's how I got in this place.</p>

            <p>I was not as clear as I should have been when I first posted the question.&nbsp; To clarify, I have two POP email accounts (can't set up automatically).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried, using the Send/Receive options in Advance setup, to "send" email through our ISP hosting service but only "receive" through the gmail account.&nbsp; However, incoming mail does not show up.&nbsp; Here's what I have for my "outbound" email:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b90604b8-9b61-4d8b-bbbf-96a03f3f0057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b90604b8-9b61-4d8b-bbbf-96a03f3f0057" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>With this setup, I don't get any mail coming in to my Outlook Inbox.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Carl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, the “send mail items” and “receive mail items” are checked after we set up account in the Outlook client. So, we don’t need to change those settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, the root cause should be related to the “Incoming mail server”. Please make sure your incoming mail server is “imap.Gmail.com”.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account type: <strong>POP3/IMAP</strong></p>
<p>Incoming mail server: <strong>pop.gmail.com/imap.gmail.com</strong></p>
<p>Outgoing mail server (SMTP): <strong>smtp.gmail.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Under the <strong>Outgoing Server</strong> tab, click to select <strong>
My Outgoing Server (SMTP) requires Authentication</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Click to select <strong>Use Same Settings As My Incoming Server</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Enter <strong>995</strong> in Incoming Server Port if you are creating a POP3 account. If you are creating IMAP, enter
<strong>993</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Click to select <strong>This Server Requires an Encrypted Connection</strong>. For IMAP account, set the type of encryption to SSL.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Outgoing Server Port, enter the value <strong>587</strong>. Set the type of encryption to TLS</span></p>
<p><span>Click OK to close the dialog box.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            <p>Hi Toby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I went through my email settings and they are exactly as you outlined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you pointed out, by default the send and receive for each of the two accounts was checked.&nbsp; But, I don't want to receive email through my ".org" account (that account uses webmail, which results in a lot of spam that the Google account eliminates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have email forwarded from the webmail account to the gmail account in an attempt to curtail the amount of spam I get.&nbsp; With all the boxes checked in the "Send/Receive" it appears I'm only receiving email through the Webmail account (I make that
 assumption since I do not get duplicates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Carl</p>

            <p>Hi Carl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the issue is a little weird, to confirm whether the root cause is related to the Gmail account or Outlook client, could you change to another Gmail account and check if the issue persists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Before setting up account in the Outlook client, please check that whether the IMAP is turned on.
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>On your computer, open Gmail Web page. </li><li>In the top right, click Settings.</li><li>Click the <strong>Forwarding and POP/IMAP</strong> tab.</li><li>In the "IMAP Access" section, select <strong>Enable IMAP</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Toby -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent some time experimenting and can report some progress.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, as you suggested, I went to my Gmail account and checked the settings.&nbsp; And, immediately found that POP/IMAP was NOT enabled nor had I set up forwarding (DUH!!).&nbsp; So, with those checked and enabled, I sent a test message and got two emails - one from
 Webmail and one from Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I went to Outlook advanced options and, under Send/Receive, unchecked the "receive" box for the Webmail account.&nbsp; Then I sent another test message - nothing came through.&nbsp; When I rechecked the box, I got both emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I feel we're making progress but not quite there yet.&nbsp; I still want to stop receiving the email through Webmail and get it from Gmail.&nbsp; But, still want to send through Webmail.&nbsp; I know it's weird but I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again - your help is much appreciated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that. To provide the further investigation, I’d like to collect the following information?</p>
<p>1.Is the “Webmail” account an Office 365 Business account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.How did you configure the account in the Outlook client, via IMAP, POP3 or Exchange autodiscover?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.What is the version of the Outlook client? Click File &gt; Office account &gt; update options to check it. I suggest you upgrade it to the latest.</p>

</p><p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; our webmail account is not an Office 365 Business account, it is through our web hosting service and uses our domain (bethanymadison.org)</p>

<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; We have the most current version of Office 365 (the version of Outlook is 16.0.6965.2092).&nbsp; To be sure, I clicked on the "update now" and it came back with "you're up to date."</p>

            Hi Mohammed,
<br />Unfortunately  Outlook does not record the time a rule was created, you won't find it on the pc. It's not available using powershell either. (I just checked my own rules).

    <title>Resolved my Start Menu, Cortana, Project Spartan Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quilnux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resolved my Start Menu, Cortana, Project Spartan Problems</h2>
                    <p>First, I'm going to say, It's a doozie. A lot of you probably aren't going to like it.</p>

<div>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Back story</p>
<p>Before I jump into how I resolved my problem I want to give some back story leading up to the fix. (If you don't want it you can jump to the Resolution Section, but the backstory might help ensure your situation is similar).</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Like many of you, my experience started with Windows 10 Preview back in October. I didn't use it for too long but did play with some of the 98** builds. For what they were I didn't have any issues. I reverted back to Windows 8.1 Enterprise back in November
 2014. In January I re-engaged myself into Windows 10 TP with 9926. I've been running Windows 10 TP Enterprise ever since.<br />
</p>
<p>I noticed in build 10041 that Cortana was having some fits getting me to show her UI to do searches. That never did get resolved during that build. Everything else was working as expected. When build 10049 came along, I started noticing that Cortana's voice
 wasn't playing (at all). I would still receive her UI and reminders but when I would say "Hey Cortana ...." she would only respond with text in her UI, no voice response."<br />
</p>
<p>After build 10049 came, (Project Spartan FTW) Cortana no longer functioned. I was still able to get searches working but that was it. No reminders, nothing. Not even if I typed them out the way she likes it. Project Spartan worked just fine although crashed
 a lot. Lets get to build 10061.<br />
</p>
<p>After Build 10061 was installed I noticed Project Spartan was no longer functioning. When I would open it, it's loading UI would appear only long enough to see that it would show up but would crash before the brain could process it's existance. (200ms maybe?).
 After several attempts to "repair" it thru powershell, I decided to try the Profile method thats been recommended by everyone. So I created another profile (admin) and proceeded to login to it. Project Spartan started working! However, soon after trying I
 noticed that my start menu wouldn't open when clicking the start button. Cortana also wouldn't work. So I tried some other powershell scripts that were recommended for the start menu on the forums but still had no resolve. After re-creating another user account
 (this time local, admin) and still receiving the same result I decided a refresh was in order. Unfortunately the refresh provided no resolution to the problem. I did a few more "work from home" things (running things from task manager is hard work if you can't
 remember where everything is at. lol) and before going to bed decided a hail mary was in order. I decided to do a Factory Reset on Windows 10. I want to be clear, I did not reinstall 10049 from ISO then update to build 10061. I went to Settings &gt; Recovery
 &gt; Remove Everything and reinstall Windows. Why? Because I thought that there might be a upgrade issue between builds. If there was, I didn't want those issues to re-surface.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Results of Findings</p>
<p>During the course of trying to find a fix for the problem I was able to come up with these findings:</p>
</div>

<div>1. After trying to use the "Create new Account" method, I determined that the Project Spartan issue is a profile issue.<br />
2. After using the "Create new Account" method, I determined that the start menu and cortana problems may be related to new account creation. It's possible that systems being upgraded between builds might cause the system to corrupt new profiles during creation
 (starting ISO build was 9926, final build upgrade thru MU was 10041-10061)<br />
3. Start menu and Cortana issues (after build 10061 upgrade) are system issues, not profile issues. This was determined since a new user account was created which caused the issue to surface. (profiles that were created from previous build that were upgraded
 to build 10061 were not affected).<br />
4. Refreshing the system does not resolve the issue. It seems the affected system components are not reset during this process.</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Resolution</p>
<p>In order to resolve the problem the use of "Remove everything and reinstall Windows" must be used. It's important to say that this was only tested on build 10061. Furthermore, I should say I did not reinstall Windows 10 TP from an ISO and upgrade to build
 10061. This was run directly from build 10061.</p>

<h3> dabad123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Customize how Excel 2016 opens workbooks and sheets</h2>
                    <p>There are no instructions on how to set the template in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you save using the "Save as Template" under "File", it saves a copy, but when you open excel it takes you to the old one. &nbsp;You have to go to "New From Template" and then hit "Workbook" rather than "Blank Workbook" for the new formatting to show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;does anyone know you can set the default font for charts? &nbsp;Even if you change the font for workbooks, charts don't follow suit, at least that was the case if Office 2011 for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Though I have changed the template for sheet as well, &nbsp;the new formatting does not appear in new workbooks either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts much appreciated!</p>
<p>

            <p>It sounds like you're storing your custom Workbook &amp; Sheet files in the default Templates folder. That makes them available in the same manner as any other template but doesn't enable them as the Excel defaults. They need to be stored in the following location:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Startup/Excel</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know of any way to change the default font used for Charts. A formatted chart can be saved as a Chart Template, but that doesn't change anything about the formatting of the built-in chart templates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might post that as a separate question so that it is more likely to catch the eye of someone who can offer other information on the subject.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this; I saved a copy there, but the problem remains. Any thoughts? &nbsp;It's also in the TEmplates folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the same User Content folder, btw, there is a subfolder titled "Chart Templates," but has nothing on charts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post the other question separately, good suggestion, thanks.</p>

            <p>Well, since it works fine here it would be best to review exactly what steps you've taken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make certain that you have your installation of Office 2016 fully updated - 15.21.1 is the current version. Restart your Mac &amp; see if the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although not absolutely necessary, IMHO it's best to save the Workbook file using the .<em>xltx</em> (.<em>xltm</em> if it contains macros) file type.</li><li>After saving the file, the name of the file must be edited in Finder to remove the
<strong>.extn</strong> from the file name leaving it only as <strong>Workbook</strong> or
<strong>Sheet</strong>. Excluding the extension when saving the file is not sufficient - the extension will be appended automatically.</li></ul>

            <p>I don't know what more to suggest other than seeing what happens if you start from scratch with a new blank workbook file. Make some simple changes, save it as a Workbook template &amp; see if you have better results. At least that may indicate whether there
 is some sort of problem with the file you're trying to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another minor consideration - If you're running OS X 10.10.x or earlier, launch Disk Utility to Repair Disk Permissions followed by a Restart of your Mac.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Website not scrolling on mobile device</h2>
                    
<p>I just created a new Office 365 website. It looks fine on computers. On mobile it is mixed. On Internet&nbsp;Explorer some pages show properly (though with space since it is in 2 column format) and some don't scroll (e.g. "Publications" is fine, but "Radio and
 Video Programs" doesn't scroll. On Google Chrome browser on mobile, all the pages are frozen and don't scroll down at all. I have gone to the Site Master Page Settings and tried to toggle the Any Mobile Device box on and off. When off, it displays as a regular
 webpage (too much text) and then when it goes back on, the pages are frozen. Website is
<a href="http://www.illinois-business-lawyer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.illinois-*******-lawyer.com</a>.</p>
<p>I have clicked the "Reset all subsites to inherit this site master page setting" and that didn't do anything - no real subsite, just multiple pages on the one site.</p>

<p>I finally found a solution. By the Any Mobile Device area. I switched away from the "Oslo" setting and chose the "Berlin" setting. For some reason that seems to have fixed the issue.</p>

<h2>            ovi store n8</h2>
                    
<p>I am having problems buying angry birds from the ovi store with the new ovi app.&nbsp; I want to purchase it with credit card and not my phone bill..&nbsp; Does anyone know how to get that setting changed because I can't find a way to enter my credit card information
 in instead of using the phone bill?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>1. I go to angry birds full version</p>
<p>2. press buy</p>
<p>3. it takes me to a screen with angrys birds on top 6.71 MB and roviomobile then the price of the app</p>
<p>4. then it says confirm purchase</p>
<p>5. below that it says say phone bill in a box with 2.99 as the price plus tax</p>
<p>6. below that is a blank gray box with a check box that is checked and highlighted green and I can uncheck it and it just become gray again. it doesn't state what you are checking or unchecking i've tried both doesn't change the phone bill default charge.</p>
<p>7. below that empty box is my two email addresses which i assume is to choose which email account i'd like the receipt to be sent to.</p>
<p>8. under that is the next button</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now when i press the next button it just takes me to a screen warning me that my phone bill will be charged and i stop right there because I don't want to accidently charge my phone bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does any know how to fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've talked to Nokia they said they have to look into it.&nbsp; I'm hoping someone on the board can help me faster than Nokia can.&nbsp; I've purchased app's on my n900 fine with a credit card including angry birds and on the n8 all of the apps that you have to purchase
 are defaulting to phoen bill.</p>

<p>Hello anniepham1986,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both billing options are not always available depending on service provider, location, or even application.&nbsp; It could be that billing by credit card is not an option based on anyone of those reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps,</p>

<p>Service provider: AT&amp;T same when I had my N900 and was purchasing apps without problems.</p>
<p>Location: Tried same location same problem.</p>
<p>Application: Tried to purchase any other app on the N8 still came up with the phone bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I see that is anything different is the phone and the app that is included on the N8 and the fact that I have to use that app to purchase items.&nbsp; Now from what I know the app on the N8 is new.&nbsp; Is the app defaulting that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone else have the N8 and tried to buy things and gotten the option to choose phone bill or credit card?&nbsp; Maybe it's my phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also try going to the store via the web and decline installing the app, you can still sign in and download things, I do it all the time as Ovi store app takes too much of the phone memory of my crippled N97 .</p>

<p>I can't find anywhere to change the default payment card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to account on ovi.com it takes me to the nokia account but it only shows basic information i can modify and my mobile number tied to the account and visited services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I go to the ovi store and go to account it takes me to another screen of just basic information no credit card information and a place to change my password if i'd like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried several searched to change credit card payments with no such luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i get onto the N8 it doesn't have anywhere to change my information or credit card information it just gives me the option of changing my password through the store app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did try going to the store.ovi.com and purchasing through the web and it doesn't give me the option through the store.</p>

<p>I have the same problem exactly. Apparently it is an issue with the N8-00 on AT&amp;T in the USA. I do not want my phone bill charged either, I want to use my credit card, and there is no option at this time. Hopefully they will come out with a patch or something
 soon to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>So far, the only way I have found to purchase items at the Ovi store with an N8 on AT&amp;T in the US is to turn off the phone, remove the SIM, turn on, connect with WLAN to Ovi store and click "Buy." It will then run through the User Name and Password and the
 purchase will be made with my stored credit card info. Even though I click "remember me" everywhere, as soon as I put the SIM back in the phone, it reverts to "Phone Bill" as the only option for payment. I called AT&amp;T and they confirmed that Ovi purchases
 cannot be made through an N8 to an AT&amp;T phone bill. This is a time-wasting workaround and I sure hope Nokia comes up with the proper solution.</p>

                    I keep getting delogged from skype, because it says that I am underage and need parent's consent(I am an adult). When I go to account.microsoft.com as it instructs me, and click on "I am an adult" it gives me the following error: "<span>The

<h2>            Locked out of account for &#34;suspicious activity&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I recently became homeless. I started logging into my Hotmail account from a few different wifi sites in town. After two or three days, I got a "suspicious activity" notice, and now my account has been locked down altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, except for the locations where I logged in, nothing has changed. I'm still sending email to the same places as before, and receiving email from the same places as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is odd, since the whole point of web-based email is to be able&nbsp;TO LOG IN FROM DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring access is a huge problem for me. I don't have a phone or any other email address (I've already been locked out of Gmail and YahooMail under similar conditions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the Support/Chat function, and learned I would have to wait an hour for service. After an hour, I got a notice that my chat session had ended and a prompt to fill in the feedback form. I was offered no communication or assistance whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**** is the matter with you&nbsp;people?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Why is this NOT on the sub-topics list below?</p>

            Hi Live
<br />
<br />By publishing layout, do you mean you want to see your pages side by side?
<br />
<br />If so, on the View ribbon (tab), click 'Multiple pages', then use the zoom slider at the bottom right of Word to zoom your document until you have side-by-side pages . . .
<br />
<br />If that is not what you are referring to, please let me know what you need and I will provide a solution
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, on the Mac version of Office you would not have had the Publisher application that is included in Office, when you have time, you should have a look that that application, if you main use of Word is for publishing documents, Publisher is a really good application to do that in . .<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a237bed-b7a3-46ab-9c80-ba870fd1a4fa?upload=true" />

            Actually, Publisher is poorly suited to "publishing documents" since it is page layout rather than text flow software. Using large quantities of text (as in a book or report) is much more complex in Publisher than in Word. For noncontinuous text (as in
 a magazine where an article continues on a back page), Publisher is more suitable, but it is very poorly equipped to handle, for example, documents with scholarly apparatus, and for publications such as magazines, more powerful dedicated publishing software
 is recommended.

<h2>            Pagination in Word 2010 keeps changing</h2>
                    I have a friend who's been working with a long document in Word 2010, who says that the pagination and length of the document keeps changing.&nbsp; It will be 413 pages long, and then he'll leave it alone for a couple hours and come back to find that it's 420
 pages long.&nbsp; And then it will go back to being 413 pages long.&nbsp; The pagination is also different in that he'll have a sentence at the bottom of page 100, and then when he comes back it's in the middle of page 104.&nbsp; There are no blank pages in the middle of
 the document and it appears as though the margins are the same in each version of document.&nbsp; The word count also remains the same in both versions of the document.&nbsp;&nbsp; The best I can guess is that Word is somehow reformatting the document in a way that changes
 the pagination, but I don't know how to stop it from happening.&nbsp; I also know he recently upgraded to Windows 10, and I wonder if that has anything to do with it.&nbsp; Any ideas of what's ha
