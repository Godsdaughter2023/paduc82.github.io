<h2>            Computer was locked down and I was asked to call number to fix.</h2>
                    My whole laptop was locked up with a window to call microsoft tech support. &nbsp;My mouse was blocked and only showing the red circle with a slash through it when I tried to click okay or any other button. &nbsp;I called and the company said they are an online
 tech support company for Apple and Microsoft. &nbsp;They wanted me to go to www.fastsupport.com and let them take over my computer to fix this. &nbsp;The man was very articulate and well spoken, but it didn't feel right.Is this a scam?

<h2>            multiple One drives - sync issues.</h2>
                    
<p>I am administer our office 365 gov accounts.</p>
<p>One drive for business was working fine then they all go the sync errors with yellow triangle. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So I started wokring on the Win 7 machines. &nbsp;Updated windows and downloaded the new one drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The one drive for business app was still there with the yellow triangle. It seems like it might still be doing my sharepoints?</p>
<p>I have a new one that seem ok with One Drive and my tenant name. &nbsp;It is just doing my one drive and not share point?</p>
<p>Today, my personal one drive on this machine just acted up and said I have 2000+ sync errors. &nbsp;My new one drive with the tenant name has a personal one driver button to add it, but it is grayed out.</p>
<p>I have somewhere around 4 more Win 7 machines, 3 8.1, 5 or so Win 10. &nbsp; I am lost on how to fix them correctly.</p>

<p>The new onedrive client is not supporting syncing of SP libraries. It only syncs your OneDrive. The functionality is under development with the aim for it to be released at some point in this year.
</p>
<p>You can however have both clients running side by side (if this is what you want) but if I were you I would revert back to the old one and wait for the fully functional one to be released.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>As for your questions, here are my replies:<br />
<em>1. The one drive for business app was still there with the yellow triangle. It seems like it might still be doing my SharePoint?</em><br />
OneDrive for Business can sync files from your SharePoint library. The yellow triangle in the client indicates that there are sync issues.<br />
<em>2. I have a new one that seem ok with One Drive and my tenant name. It is just doing my one drive and not share point?</em><br />
The new one is OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client, which would sync files from your personal site (OneDrive site).</p>
<p>About the issue you encountered in both clients, we would like to confirm the information below:<br />
For NGSC, could you please provide a screenshot of “have a personal one driver button to add it, but it is grayed out”?<br />
For OneDrive for Business, could you please provide a screenshot when you point the mouse cursor to the OneDrive for Business icon?<br />
To insert a screenshot, please click on <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and select the
<strong>Insert Image</strong> icon.</p>
<p>Besides, here are some troubleshooting steps for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-OneDrive-for-Business-sync-problems-e12c6a8b-4bbe-4391-9c23-1a52b55a1967?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Yoga you couldn't be further away from the truth. </p>
<p>Richard has the NEW CLIENT. The new client DOESNT support SP libraries sync. Read the question in full before providing answers that are erroneous. If you are not aware then I would suggest you read the documentation.</p>

<p>@Richard you may need to take a look at the suggestion from Yoga on the "Fix OneDrive for Business sync problems". If that doesn't work, we will move proceed to reach out to you to collect logs to identify the cause of this issue.</p>

            Hi tsampikos<br />
<br />
Some more information would be useful...<br />
<br />
Where did you get the music from?<br />
How did you transfer the music to your device?<br />
Does the same problem happen when you try to play the preinstalled music?<br />
Which software do you have (*#0000#)?<br />
Which country did you buy your Nokia N78 in?<br />
Did you buy your Nokia N78 from an operator?<br />
If so, which?<br />
Are you still using the pre-fitted 2GB memory card?<br />
<br />
Hope we can fix this.

<h2>            &#91;Nokia N8&#93; Security Code not working&#63; Help appreciated..</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings to all..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a strange problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 days ago, everything from my internal memory (videos and pictures) disappeared!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 4 hours of work and almost nerve breakdown i managed to save 90% percent of material by manual transfer to PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequences:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- 1,5GB of memory not avaible</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Phone is not working properly (everything is kinda slow)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried 8 second reset but it didn't solve anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My next step is to try factory reset but none of usual security codes (12345, 0000 or 00000) doesn't work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cellular phone is 18 months old and i still have 6 months warranty ( i can prove it because i have a bill for it)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next problem,heh..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I live in Pula,Croatia but my phone is from other country ( Slovenia) and i am not able to make 100km to service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you advise me what to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to all..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. If you need more information or&nbsp;some&nbsp;evidence that i'm a owner of phone, no problem.. beacuse i have all papers..</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/30D82964-F46B-4EAB-AAE7-97AD2A7443E5">surfer711</a>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Nokia forum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A hard reset and software update will make sure that any bug that caused this to happen will be cleared from the device.</span>You do need the security code for the reset, this is 12345 by default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If 12345 doesn't work and you can't remember the edited security code, please visit a
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">local Care centre</a> where the unlock code can be reset for you. A phone bought in Europe will have warranty in any European country, so if you bought the phone in Slovenia you will be
 able to bring it to a Care centre in Croatia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When the security code has been reset, please follow the instructions below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connect your phone to <a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/product/nokia-pc-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite</a> and make a back up via Tools &gt; Back up. Don't tick the Settings box as this will back up the bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the back up has been made, disconnect the phone from your PC or laptop and enter *#7370# and the now default security code 12345 into your phone. The phone's data will be erased when the phone has rebooted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now connect your phone to Nokia Suite once more and click on the green arrow where you will be able to update the phone's software. If no update is listed, please reinstall the current software. This option is displayed in blue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the software has installed, please go to Tools &gt; Restore to restore the back up onto your phone. Your phone will now work correctly and any bug that caused the internal memory to erase itself will be erased off the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make sure you won't lose any data in the future, I recommend making a back up&nbsp;<span>with Nokia Suite&nbsp;</span>regularly .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please get back to me if you manage to resolve the issue, otherwise I can provide further support.</p>

<p>As a last resort you can carry out the "three finger" hard reset (pressing volume down + camera key + menu key and pressing power button) upon the Nokia N8-00 device (wait until Nokia "Shaking hands" logo appears) avoiding need for lock code input; in addition
 to erasing user content upon C:\ remember that similarly data upon E:\ mass memory would also be deleted by this process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If the default 12345 code doesn't work it may have been changed by the network operator (assuming you got the phone on a contract). If so, check the box the phone came in for the IMEI sticker and look for any other number on there. It won't necessarily
 be labelled as a PIN or security code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Incidentally, the three fingered reset should only be used to try and revive a dead phone because it will remove some pre-installed apps such as Maps and Nokia store.</p>

            Greetings to all<br />
<br />
I'm in desparate need of assistance, please help.<br />
<br />
I bought my nokia n8 3 months back. I've been using an antivirus on my phone, (last night) i switched back to fsecure. After installing my phone restarted but then after getting to the homescreen it kept restarting. Eventually, within the few seconds it takes
 to restart, i restored my phone to factory settings. It worked with only one problem. It asked me to create a security code but keeps on responding with a code error. I've tried using the default codes and all code combinations i could use though i've only
 used 2 codes. Basically, i'm desperate. I tried the three button combo and also pressing the power button for 8 seconds all in desperate attempt to reset my phone but still. Please, please, please help :'(

<p>As you now know you need to release power button only after first vibration, whilst keeping other three depressed until Nokia "Shaking hands" logo appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Other users please note that this is procedure to be carried out as a "last resort" to restore telephony function to device as a pre-cursor to visit to Nokia Care facility for entire software to be re-installed; several applications such as Nokia Store
 and Nokia Maps will be non-functional as well as media supplied with device upon mass memory also being deleted.</p>

<p>Hi DonnaYoung2,<br />
<br />
The main query is to export the directory in file explorer as texts then copy to Excel. You may use some 3rd party tools, customize powershell scripts to accomplish it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following command in CMD:</p>
<p>cd<em>&nbsp;Downloads</em> &nbsp;(specify a desired path)</p>
<p><span>dir /T:W &gt;<em>export</em>.txt</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, here are some related threads for your reference:</p>

            Hi Jensen,
<br />Try a Quick Repair. 
<br />
<br />To repair your Office installation, right click on the start menu and choose Apps &amp; Features, find and select the Office installation. Choose Modify then select the Quick repair option. Use the Quick Repair option first as it will fix many things and complete fairly quickly. 
<br />
<br />If it doesn't help, use the Online Repair option to uninstall Office and reinstall Office. It will not delete your existing Office settings or your Outlook profile and data files.

            Hi&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0f3089bc-6b12-40f6-a006-77441609ba6d">Tisino</a>;
<div><br />
<div>I started to create a mockup that only allowed one selection for the first four and two selections for the second but I was using macros and realized somewhat belatedly that macro-enabled workbooks are not always well received in a general distribution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I finished that one and converted the functionality over to another non-macro based workbook as best as I could using more complicated formulas and a fair bit of conditional formatting rules. In this macro-free workbook, multiple selections (e.g.
<i>X</i>'s) can be made but are not displayed and their prices are not recorded. If a second&nbsp;<i>X</i>&nbsp;is applied to the
<i>Entree</i>&nbsp;group, only the first one (from the top down) is displayed. The second one remains an invisible
<i>X</i>&nbsp;and if the first one is cleared then the second becomes visible and its pricing replaces the first.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On both sheets, I've used named ranges for the five serving categories to tighten up code and formulas. Look in View, Name Manager for more details on these. These would also facilitate adding more meal items to the groups by adjusting automatically to
 an inserted row.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwerwew.sn2.livefilestore.com%2fy2ptxCJUpnW0wfROlYLfoeit4qSmQqKYB84prIyv60kH0JoVsKm4PCMBwS2AjwwuQjp2kBKtJ6X9HYmIouWxfnrPZ2Fi71Bh5M74qd1SCTFo1pavcwTi_pIMY-u-edV4q6d%2fMeal_Ticket.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></div>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 - Emails and Folders are gone. How do I get them back into Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    Outlook 2011 - Working in emails and associated folders most of the day. Went to grab a bite to eat, came back and restarted Outlook. All folders and emails had disappeared from the windows. Have tried a few things to no avail, really need to get this
 stuff back as am in a frantic race for client in getting things for them finished. HELP!&nbsp;

            What is the type of your account, POP3 or IMAP? If this problem is with IMAP account, the following steps should fix it:
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>In Outlook, select Tools &gt; IMAP Folders...</li><li>Using the resulting Folder Browser window, navigate through all your folders looking for any that are NOT bold (the missing folders).</li><li>Highlight any missing folders and choose to Subscribe (click the Plus button in the upper-left)</li><li>Close the window and your missing folders should reappear!</li></ol>

            <div>I did as you said and just some folders and emails returned, but very few. I have emails going back at least 3-5 years (use them for reference to customers' information and detailed reference).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I believe I had a "division folder" entitled "My Computer" in which there were many titled folders with subfolder and emails. After my problem, that folder never came back. How do I get that back up and visible?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Okay, one more thing, after the Outlook "collapsed" did the Spotlight thing that DianeofOregon suggested. That seemed to work. But the next day, after shutting down that night, when Outlook opened all the folders were gone again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is what I have in the OPEN ID Box:&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have 2 MAIN IDs folders, one of which has is current and has 174.9 Mb on it, and, the other which is dated 9/8/13 has 213.1 Mb on it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;The next Main ID folder is dated 9/11 has 325.7 Mb of data on it; followed by another dated 9/10 with 325.7 Mb on it. These two must have all the missing files, folders and emails I am looking for.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;After that, the next "Main Identity" is dated [2012-02-14...] with 291.9 Mb, and followed by 7 additional "Main Identity" folders.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first 4 folders had a "Data Records" folder and a file called "Database". The fifth folder, Main Identity [Backed up 2012-02-14...], has these 2 items plus Mailing Lists, Rules, and Signatures.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there a way to consolidate all these databases and other files into one new master file? Or, Taking the Main ID [Backed up 2013-09-08...] and getting all the added emails from 09/08 to current date included so I can have everything together?&nbsp;</div>

            Your data is NOT stored in the database file, it's stored in Data Records.<br />
<br />
It sounds like Outlook opened in the wrong Identity. Use Database Utility to "Switch Identity".<br />
<br />
Your questions about consolidate is no for the database and not to Data Records.<br />

    <title>Bing Overcharges on Daily Basis - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timford2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing Overcharges on Daily Basis</h2>
                    <p>I have had my Bing Ads account for just about a decade. My daily charges are set to $27/day. However Bing charges my credit card $50+ every day. Also my keyword bids are set to Manual, all set to 0.75 per click. However I have to log in to my account every
 few days or once a week at least to change my bids back to 0.75 as they mysteriously go up by themselves. Sometimes they change themselves to automatic, which is catastrophic. I have tried speaking to a Live Chat rep but they simply rush through a script and
 do not look into detail. Therefore nothing changes. I can only assume that Bing Ad reps are raising my bids and overcharging my card, hoping I will not notice. For example - in 10 days time, my account is set to spend $270. However Bing charges me $500+ in
 that time frame, and with alot less clicks due to the mysterious raise in bids.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having an issue like this?</p>

<p><span>Hi TimFord2,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to us with your question, we’re happy to help!
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our apologies for your current experience. I completely understand your concern and it is my goal to find the root cause of this issue so that we can make the appropriate changes to fix it. Unless
 you have granted permission to our support representatives to make changes in your account on your behalf, they won’t go into your account to make any changes as it is against our policy.
</span></p>
<p><span>The only way that your bids would change is if you had your bid strategy set to Enhanced CPC, Maximized clicks, or Automated bidding. You can find out more about our bid strategies, on our
</span><a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56786/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Let Bing Ads manage your bids with bid strategies help article</span></a><span>. With this being said, your daily budget
 setting is only a target, so your actual spend might be higher or lower. This is because, regardless of the budget type you choose, Bing Ads always calculates a monthly budget and then the actual budget limit is calculated for an entire month. Daily budget
 types simply help you make sure that your budget is spread out over an entire month, and not used up in the first day. In the unlikely event that your campaign’s spend goes over your monthly limit, Bing Ads will refund the overspend at the end of the month.
 You can learn more about our budget options on our </span><a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51006/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">What are my budget options help article</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seeing as this is an account specific matter, I will need to investigate this personally to determine what the exact reason is for this. I have sent you a private message with details on how to proceed.
 Please check your private messages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Srimadhwa;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>- I acquired the phone on the day I sent the original message for help. The same day, I added an email account, the me.com (iCloud) account, to the phone. I was able to sync the calendar and contacts with the iCloud account.
</p>
<p>- When I acquired the phone I set it from the beginning to use my outlook.com account. The same day, I set up my computer to sign in using the outlook.com account.</p>
<p>- The outlook.com email address was already set up on the computer. I added the iCloud email address to the computer today. The iCloud email address had been set up as an alias on my Microsoft account earlier in the day.</p>
<p>- Contacts appear to sync although some information&nbsp;seems to be missing, even within the Microsoft account,&nbsp;and I receive iCloud email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, I don't see the iCloud calendar items when I log on to my Outlook account remotely. It would be nice to have all possible locations show all of the same information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I'm corresponding with you, do you know if there is a way to add multiple email accounts labeled "personal" or "other" to Windows 8.1 (PC) contacts? The app on my computer only seems to allow one of each type: personal, work, other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have explained myself well enough. Please continue with your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't believe that the solutions suggested in the posts you mentioned are the issue. The icloud account is set up for mail in the email app on my PC -- and it receives mail fine, however, the same icloud account simply doesn't exist anywhere in the calendar
 app on my PC. As such, there is nothing to select to sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, there doesn't appear to be an option to add&nbsp;icloud accounts to the PC calendar. Only&nbsp;outlook or exchange type accounts may be added to the computer, yet on the phone, there was no problem adding icloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Strangely too, when I access my outlook account calendar remotely, the icloud email address is listed under settings, options as one of the registered&nbsp;accounts for calendar notifications, however, those icloud notifications don't show up online either. The
 aforementioned location is the ONLY screen where the icloud account is mentioned at all. Again, there's no option present to sync the icloud account. There is only one "primary calendar".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's&nbsp;odd that there are such differences in options and functionality between devices using Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your continued help is appreciated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the need to give users access to sync Calendar and Contact to their WM device, but not email.&nbsp; If I have my guys set a user up that way there seems to be no way to prevent the user from going in later and adding email sync...even though the user is
 a member of a restricted group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone found a way to restrict this change?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Microsoft does not offer the level of control that you want.&nbsp; With ActiveSync you cannot restrict whether a user can sync e-mail or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your company want's to place security restrictions on users, they should look at System Center - Mobile Device Manager which has additional security options.</p>

<h2>            credit from old account becoming inactive</h2>
                    I have received an email about credit on one of my pre existing skype accounts before Microsoft bought it. I have no access to my old account as it is not recognised as it had no email log-in.I have tried in vain for months to get access to this account
 but can't as I don't know how as I have only one msn email address which is now linked to a new account.I have asked this in the past but have no sensible reply.Why can't I just have the credit applied to my active account as I can't access the original as
 Microsoft appear to have blocked it.

<h2>            Deleting the original Hotmail Account on my Lumia 510</h2>
                    Can anyone tell me how i can delete the Hotmail account i used when i set my phone up? This email account was hacked &amp; subsequently closed by Microsoft so i set up a new one which i have added into my phone. However, it seems the original account is still
 the primary one despite the fact it is no longer in use. I need to remove it from my phone as i can`t download any apps or music. When i try i get a message stating i must be signed into my Windows account....which obviously i can`t. I`d appreciate any help
 given...thanks in advance.

            <p>Hi MichaelDunlop,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks for posting to the Microsoft Answers forums!&nbsp; The original Hotmail account on your phone can be removed from your phone by performing a factory reset on the device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; The reason for the reset is that this primary Microsoft Account is used to light up all live services on your phone, such as your SkyDrive storage and access to the marketplace, as you mentioned.&nbsp; In order to use a different account for these services,
 you will need to set up the phone again so that the device can register with the new account. For more details about the effects of changing your primary account, we have some helpful information posted online here:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2430020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2430020</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; You can Reset your phone form your Start screen by swiping to the Apps list, then tapping
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>About </strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Reset your Phone</strong>.&nbsp; This will delete the personal data saved on your device so it's important to sync any Photos, Video, Music, etc. to your PC before the reset.&nbsp; Details on backing up your

<h2>            Unable to upgrade from Windows 10 Insider Build 10166 to TH1 Professional 10240</h2>
                    <p>I have tried this now several times. I'm using the Win10 Insider Build 10166 and am trying to upgrade to TH1 Professional 10240.</p>
<p>The update downloads and installs just fine, but it doesn't manage to upgrade. After rebooting the upgrading screen with the progress circle appears. My system reboots again during or after the first part of this upgrade (the one on the bottom left), it
 then shows a safe mode screen for a few seconds before telling me that it's restoring the previous build. The computer reboots again and I'm still on 10166.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this? I unfortunately never got any error message except something like "Failed to upgrade", without any real information. So if there is any log file with information on it that I just don't know of, please let me know.</p>
<br />
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Patrick</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I already tried several solutions that are provided in other threads like DISM, no firewall and AV, removing all the graphics drivers, but none of them worked</p>

            <p>I think that sometimes there are partition layout issues.&nbsp; Is your hard disk GPT or MBR initialized?&nbsp; Does your computer support UEFI BIOS mode and Secure Boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In earlier builds I had to completely disable my built-in network adapters in BIOS or the upgrade to a new build would not succeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any previous build ISO's 9926 to 10130 that you could install?&nbsp; They were still able to activate by product key recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach is to test install if build 10162 will auto-activate after a clean install to another partition, without entering a product key.&nbsp; You can shrink a partition to make 20GB of un-partitioned space to install to for testing this.&nbsp; But you need
 bootable install media for build 10162.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to upgrade from activated 10162 to activated 10240 by using the ISO for build 10240.&nbsp; I mounted the ISO and ran setup.exe, chose to keep Windows settings and files and did not enter any product key at any time.</p>

            Use the latest version of PC Suite and backup only the messages, contacts, calendar and notes to the computer and then do a firmware backup.. I suggest not to use the full backup as some old settings might create problem with the new firmware.<br />
Upgrade and restore all that I mentioned above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, something I want to mention to all NOkia N80 v5 firmware users is to do a *#7370# just after upgrade and seeing the standy by screen. The fresh upgrade as some process in background which just seems to eat memory and battery. After the hard reset,
 your cell piece is new and freah as ever.

<h2>            Reminders still happening for deleted Calendar events</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a email group in Office365 (I think 2013 version) for group of co-workers so I could send out messages to all easily, set up a shared calendar, etc.&nbsp; Well, the calendar did not go as planned so I have tried to delete all events/appointments/everything
 from the computer.&nbsp; At first they wouldn't delete, then they "cancelled"&nbsp;but showed up as cancelled requests or appointments. Now I have managed to get them all of the calendar but reminders continue to be sent to all co-workers for these cancelled events.
 Any ideas? I have tried everything I can think of.&nbsp;&nbsp; I call the online support but no one will talk to me since I am not an admin for my workplace (but I did create the Office 365 group and manage it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously it is annoying to me and my co-workers to have reminders pop-up all day for cancelled events. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
