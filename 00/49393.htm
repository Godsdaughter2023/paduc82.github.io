    <title>How will Windows Server 2016 function within the WaaS model&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james m2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How will Windows Server 2016 function within the WaaS model&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have not been able to find any solid information regarding how the WaaS model applies to Windows Server 2016. I've read on multiple answers questions (that I now can't find) that the Creators Update does not exist for Windows Server 2016. Is this true
 in the sense that Server 2016 won't get bi-annual "feature" updates, it won't be specifically getting the Creators Update, or is it that this particular update is lagging behind the rollout of Windows 10 CU (1703) in general?</p>

    <title>Windows explorer hangs when opening any Office files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dapsf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows explorer hangs when opening any Office files</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Surface Tablet 6 with windows 10.</p>
<p>When I try to open a Word, Excel, Powerpoint by double clicking on the file, Windows Explorer just hangs with the spinning wheel. I can open the files if i do it from the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files have been tested from onedrive and from the c:\ and the same issue happens.</p>
<p>i am on version 10.0.17134 Build 17134</p>
<p>I have tried a clean boot and run safety scanner and the issue remains.</p>
<p>This started occurring since the last set of windows updates.</p>

            Hi Daps.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />2) Next repair Office at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Modify &gt; Repair.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />5) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Same issue on Dell XPS 13 with 1803 updates on 10.0.17134.&nbsp; Thought it was always hanging but tried .pdf and .jpg and they started correctly, so actually seems like Office was involved.&nbsp; I did the suggestion of Repairing Office doing Start &gt; Apps &gt; Apps
 &amp; Features.</p>
<p>At that point you see the list of apps on the screen.&nbsp; Scrolled down to "Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016" and clicked it.&nbsp; On expanded entry, clicked on "Modify" button.&nbsp; Then chose "Quick Repair" which completed quickly and fixed part of problem...
 I could now launch Office Apps but File Explorer still was hung when I finished the app.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Then did same the same but after "Modify", chose "Online Repair" which took two hours but completed without more actions, and now both Office &amp; File Explorer are normal....&nbsp; YEAH!!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Been 4 months of grief, had to use third party Explorer++ instead, okay but not as good</p>

            Hi GarthGourlay ... the lights might be disabled by default to help preserve battery.
<br />See link below on how to get that working.
<br />I know the link is not for your model but there is a link in the support article to go to the accessories and get the drivers for your model by searching.

    <title>Language switching indicator lagging - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Language switching indicator lagging</h2>
                    <p>When I switch from one language to another with a key combination and try to type somewhere often I see that the layout has changed, but indicator on the panel shows the previous language icon. Few minutes later everything is ok but then something happens
 and the problem arise again. I have 3 languages (Belarusian - main, Russian, English), if it matters.<br />
<br />
UPDATE<br />
</p>
<p>I've found out that it happens only if Google Chrome windows is opened.</p>

            <p>Thank you for response.<br />
The problem occurred right after the clean installation of Windows 10 and it seemed that it was happening only in Chrome, so I decided to change it to Edge. But unfortunately today I've noticed that it happened in Edge, too. I did no changes on my laptop since
 it's a clean installation. I tried to reinstall Chrome but it made no effect, the problem still appears.</p>
<p>I'm really confused with such behaviour, looking forward for any help on this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            Lol no way man not without using a TON of system resources and all that jazz....the way to get those Effects in Linux is by using the graphics manager Compiz. basically it handles everything video on your linux system IF you install it and have it enabled.
 then there are endless tweaks and customization options to add to to make Your Linux Install look AMAZING. i dual boot Windows XP(Which OWNS Vista up the A) and Ubuntu. My XP install basically looks and behaves exactly like Windows 7, its pretty nice, looks
 great, and works better. BUT, it still is extremely boring and Arcane compared to my experience when i boot up in Ubuntu 9.10 and have Minmizing windows folding into paper airplanes and flying to my App Dock, Opening applications fade and wobble up, and closing
 windows simply explode. its awesome. then i also have 4 destops with different applications and whatnot open. AND it all runs perfectly smooth, using about 20% of my RAM, and 2% of my CPU. i have 1 GB of DDR2 RAM, and a 2.4 GHZ Proc

            I am aware that the thread is a bit old but I gotta say it in a simple way. THERE IS NO WAY to get wobbly windows on MS WINDOWS. The reason is simple, the top guys at MS HATE fancy and blingy effects WITH A ZEALOTY AND BIGOTED PASSION, and they get out
 of their way to squash any type of blingy effect that can be added to Windows (whenever such an visual effects app shows up, they reverse enginner it, find out what API's were used to do those effects and then they rewrite those API's the next patch tuesday
 so that the visual effects application breaks and stops functioning).

            It's only when I use the touchpad. I don't use a mouse. I tried looking for gesture setting but I couldn't find anything. I also noticed that it did it more when I swiped the touchpad on the right side.

            It says nothing about my touchpad... only the mouse. My laptop is a two in one tablet so the keyboard detaches. I'm not sure if that helps or has anything to do with it.

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community and showing interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to assist you better please help us with the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. From where exactly are you trying to open the image?<br />
2. Are you able to open other pictures with different format?<br />
3. Which application are you using to open photos?<br />
4. Does the issue occur with all the .jpeg files on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile I suggest you to perform the methods given below and check if the issue persists</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>Make sure that you have set default program to open jpeg files on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>1</span></strong><span>. Open Default Programs by clicking the Start
 button, and then clicking Default Programs. <br />
<strong>2</strong>. In Default Programs Click on: </span></p>
<p><strong><span>a)</span></strong><span> Associate a file type or protocol with a program.
 Use this option to fine-tune default programs based on the file type or protocol.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, you can have all .jpg image files open using a specific program, and .bmp image files open using a different program.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>b)</span></strong><span> In the list of file extension look for&nbsp;Jpeg
 files and make sure that you have program associated with it like&nbsp;Windows photo gallery.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run the
<strong>apps troubleshooter </strong>and check if it helps with the issue. Refer to the following article and run the Apps troubleshooter:
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the issue still exists, try the next method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try to run a
<strong>System File Checker </strong>(SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;1.</strong> Press <strong>Windows key + X,</strong> click Command Prompt (Admin).<br />
<strong>&nbsp;2.</strong> In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>I am sorry, but I really have problems with the instructions you gave below...AND IT IS A MATTER OF USING LANGUAGE....</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Make sure that you have set default program to open jpeg files on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>1</span></strong><span>. Open Default Programs by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Default Programs.
<br />
<strong>2</strong>. In Default Programs Click on: </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.ON MY COMPUTER, I "ASSUME" BY "START BUTTON" YOU MEAN THE LITTLE ICON OF A WINDOW IN THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER.&nbsp; OK SO FAR BY WHY WASN'T THIS MORE EXPLICIT EITHER IN YOUR INSTRUCTIONS OR ON THE SCREEN ITSELF?&nbsp;&nbsp; ie LABEL THE LITTLE ICON AS "START BUTTON".&nbsp;
 SIMPLE</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2.WHEN I LEFT? (YOU DIDN'T SAY) CLICK ON THIS ICON, NO "DEFAULT PROGRAMS" APPEARS.&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT DOES APPEAR AFTER MUCH SEARCHING IS "WINDOWS SYSTEM"...</span><span>WHICH THEN TAKES ME TO
</span><span>"CONTROL PANEL" WHICH THEN TAKES ME TO "PROGRAMS" WHICH THEN TAKES ME TO "DEFAULT PROGRAMS"...NOT THE SAME AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR INSTRUCTIONS</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In any case I got to "Programs" (which by the way mentions "Unistall a program" but does NOT mention "Change Default Settings".</span></p>
<p><span>By random clicking I got to </span><span>"Change Default Settings"</span><span> which the allowed me to get to "Set Your default Programs"&nbsp; which then allowed me to choose the program "Photos".</span></p>
<p><span>I then chose to "Set This Program as a Default" and chose "OK"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then chose "Chose the Defaults for this program"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I made sure that the box was checked beside "jpg" and "jpeg" and that the "curr" (presumably current default" was "Photos"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I saved this and exited.</span></p>
<p><span>I still have files that are recognized as jpg but will not open, although others will.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is it possible that it has something to do with the file name or extension?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the same folder I have other photos which will open.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Call of Duty 2 Mouse Lag Issue &#40;not fixed by recent patch&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, i'm having trouble getting Call of Duty 2 to work on Windows 8.1. The single player section seems to load up perfectly, but then i receive occasional and massive amounts of mouse lag while playing. I've faced a similar problem with another old game
 recently and finally managed to get that one working by employing Microsoft's mouse lag patch + regedit workaround for older games. The problem is that the same workaround won't have any effect in COD 2.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The issue was sorted for vanilla windows 8 users by changing the in-game settings to DirectX7 or 9. Again, this doesn't seem to have any positive effect in Windows 8.1, so what i'm basically asking for is what might windows 8.1 have changed that makes
 this old fix suddenly unworkable, and how can i use that knowledge to sort out my 8.1 edition? Thanks for any help you can offer.&nbsp;</div>

The next version of Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703 is another release users will need to prepare for before upgrading. The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that.

    <title>Problems running FFXI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neilmccluskey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems running FFXI</h2>
                    I have been getting a crash to desktop problem with playing Final Fantasy XI and tried numerous so called fixes but nothing as worked as of yet and it's driving me insane. I must stress this is not an issue with playonline (the game client) crashing as
 it connects to the actual game&nbsp;like many of the existing posts on the net. I get&nbsp;in to the game no problem.&nbsp;Basically it just randomly crashes to the desktop with no warning accompanied by the message "playonline encountered and error and stopped working"
 with no error code which makes it infuriatingly difficult to detect what the problem is. There are no warning signals like an r0 (that can happen if the microwave is on for example) it just happens. It can happen after 5 mins or an hour, or 5 hours. While
 it appears to be random based on that I've noticed it seems to happen&nbsp;more often&nbsp;if I go afk. I disabled all sleep/hibernation settings that may be causing monitor/gpu resets&nbsp;and they are now set to either "never" or the max value I can put in. The most recent
 thing I tried which I hadn't tried before was changing to a wired connection instead of a wireless one but as you've guessed I still get this crash.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyway after yet more hours of digging/researching I stumbled upon a post to check my event viewer and found some very interesting things detailing errors and reports of various things and some of them look like culprits but I wouldn't have the first clue on
 how to fix them and really need help from people who do please. One of them actually names pol.exe (playonline) but I have a feeling that some of the others might be involved too. Here they are...<br />
<br />
<br />
1) a) Faulting application name: pol.exe, version: 1.18.13.0, time stamp: 0x4e3bcddc<br />
Faulting module name: KERNELBASE.dll, version: 10.0.10586.306, time stamp: 0x571afb9a<br />
Exception code: 0x40000015<br />
Fault offset: 0x000bdae8<br />
Faulting process ID: 0x658<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01d1bebfe1d94482<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\PlayOnlineViewer\pol.exe<br />
Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\KERNELBASE.dll<br />
Report ID: 49881814-ff4f-40c8-913e-780646c8ebcc<br />
<br />
--------I think the next one is related to the above so listed them together--------<br />
<br />
1) b) Fault Bucket 108151411850, type 1. Event Name: APPCRASH. Response: not available. Source: Windows Error Reporting. Even ID: 1001<br />
<br />
2) The network interface Intel Dual Band wireless AC 7260 has begun resetting. There will be a momentary disruption in network connectivity while the hardware resets. Reason: The network driver requested that it be reset. The network interface has reset twice
 since its last initialization<br />
<br />
3) WLAN autoconfig detected limit.connectivity. performing reset/recover adapter. code: 8 0xc 0x0. There are quite a few entries of this nature with different codes<br />
<br />
4) TCP/IP has chosen to restrict the congestion window for several connections due to a network condition. This could be related to a problem in the TCP global or supplemental configuration and will cause degraded throughput<br />
<br />
5) The browser has forced an election on Network\Device\NetBT_Tcpip because a master browser was stopped. The letters "BT" co-incidentally happen to be the name of the people who supply my broadband or am I overthinking this one?<br />
<br />
6) Name resolution for the name wpad timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded<br />
<br />
7) The server (long ID) did not register with DCOM within the required timeout<br />
<br />
8) The application specific settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM server application with CLSID (long ID) and APPID to the user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM SID (long ID)<br />
<br />
9) The user data_access, the user data_storage, the contact_data, and the sync_host services (all the same ID) have terminated unexpectedly<br />
<br />
10) I ran the troubleshooter for every network tab I could and everything came up clean except for "Incoming Connections" where it said this "Problems Found: 1 or more network protocols are missing on this computer". It then asked me to "try these repairs as
 admin" which I agreed to and then it said "fixed". Whatever this fixed it had no effect on the crash I get with Final Fantasy XI<br />
<br />
Sorry for the kinda long post but this is really starting to bug me as I've spent over a month now trying to fix this. Just a little recap...I recently performed a repair install of windows 10, a fresh install of FFXI and playonline (As in a brand new bought
 copy), and a fresh download/install of windower4...the 3rd party application used to launch Final Fantasy XI. My directx version is 12 even though final fantasy XI apparently only runs on 8.1, and my GPU is NVidia GTX980M. On a side note I've played Morowind,
 Oblivion, Skyrim, The Witcher 3, Everquest, Guild Wars with no problems at all

 DPI (whatever that means) and it crashed on open again. I basically "reported the problem to Microsoft". It then said this...<br />
<br />
Issues found<br />
Incompatible Program Detected (yellow triangle with black exclamation mark) &lt;&lt;&lt; this symbol shows up in the boxes for each character on character select btw<br />

Considering the compatibility modes for earlier windows versions all crash playonline/windower before it connects to the actual game this is odd. A few things about this anyway....I know people who play using windows 10 and said they don't get this crash. Secondly
 if the program was incompatible wouldn't it just fail to load altogether? (I get on to the game itself 100% there are no initial connection issues).Thirdly this crash also happened when I was using vanilla to launch the game (playonline itself not windower4),
 and I've read reports of people getting the same crash, or a similar crash on windows 7 and 8 tbh. Let's assume this troubleshoot message is correct how would I go about "finding and fixing problems running older programs on this version of windows". I mean
 the windower4 is hardly an old program imo and the dev team are pretty up to date with current lua codes for the game so I'd be very surprised if their program was not compatible with windows 10 &gt;&lt;</p>

            <p>I think it's safe to say it's not a Windows problem. I don't know much about internet problems, or what</p>
<p>issues are inherent in <em>Play On Line</em>, or <em>windower4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; but... </p>
<p>If POL crashes while on line that could lead to the other internet related errors.</p>
<p>I gather you have been to the FFXI community forums, but they would be the best place to find
</p>
<p>fixes for issues that come with Play On Line, or the game. </p>
<p>If others are reporting instability the issue may stem from a recent update to the game.</p>
<p>- No mods installed in the game ?</p>
<p>- It could be a problem with the server you are playing on. Are others on the server having problems with stability ?</p>
Your ping to the FFXI server is good ?
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Long shots....</p>
<p>- Have you tried setting the Power Managment Mode to&nbsp; '<em>prefer maximum performance'</em> in Nvidia Control Panel&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>On a laptop it would be best to use the Program Settings option and create a profile for FFXI so you can keep</p>
<p>it on adaptive when using the battery or not playing a game.</p>
<p>(I have an Nvidia GTX 770 that randomly drops out to one of several different blank screen colours if I use adaptive.</p>
<p>The main difference in this instance is it never drops out while gaming, only when not under load, so I had</p>
<p>to use the Global Settings.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Maybe your ISP has overloaded the port your account runs through, which can cause the speed to drop dramatically during 'busy' hours (A problem I had for a while ) ? This could cause your connection to
</p>
<p>the game to drop out.</p>
<p>- Have you tried using different cables to and from the modem (maybe they can't handle
</p>
<p>the extra traffic while gaming&nbsp; ) ?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Compatibility settings are a bit over rated (and over recommended). While worth trying if a game does not
</p>
<p>launch properly, they don't often help. As the game has been regularly updated since first release, I
</p>
<p>doubt using compatibility for an older OS would benefit, and it could cause less stability.</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p><em>"I then tried ticking the box about high scaling DPI"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- DPI (dots per inch) scaling has to do with the size of your desktop icons, and text. You can find the option in
</p>
<p>Display Settings &gt; Advanced Display Settings &gt; Advanced sizing... items &gt; Change Size of Items &gt;</p>
<p><em>set a custom scaling level .</em></p>
<p>I use a 120% DPI setting which caused some games to not fit the screen correctly (off set to right and bottom)</p>
<p>when I first upgraded to Win10.</p>
<p>This was mostly with old DOS&nbsp; based games, but affected a couple of DX games (didn't launch) as well.
</p>
<p>Win10 was always wanting to use the 'disable high DPI' compatibility on games that didn't have an issue</p>
<p>with it too, but this has not been a problem for me since the 1511 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"My directx version is 12 "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>btw - Win10 has DX9,10,11 &amp; 12. The game selects which DX version and which DX files it requires.
</p>
<p>There are 19 DX9 d3dx .dll files. 10 DX10 and 2 DX11 &amp; 12 (and other non-graphics related).</p>
<p>

            <p>Why its asking me to sign up again here to reply is ridiculous and if it does it again i wont be creating a third new email but anyway thanks for the reply. I cant reply to everything right now and most have them have already been tried anyway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However what do you mean by there are so many dx files? Whenevèr i try to add an earlier dx it just tells me that there is no need cuz im up to date. This would suggest i have all the necessary files with dx12 (as in dx12 is dx8 too as contains all dx8 files)
 ? For example with .net framework files i heard you need all the older ones too as just using the latest version isnt enough. But with that you dont tet a message saying youre already up to date. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>- Yes, the new Sign In every time is a nuisance. Used to sign in automatically until the past couple of days.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; The other games, and your general Windows functions aren't having any problems, so I reckon the
</p>
<p>problem must have to do with the game, PlayOnline, or Windower4 (all three in combo ?) .</p>
<p>Their interaction with your internet/network connection could be the issue, but the crash may just show up</p>
<p>in Event Viewer that way because you are on line when the game crashes.</p>
<p>- Can you run the game off line ? Does it still crash ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Another troubleshooting option that may be worth trying is to run in <em>Clean Boot</em>. This will help determine</p>
<p>if a <em>Service</em> or <em>Starup</em> program is conflicting with the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------</p>
<p>- All versions of DirextX are independent of each other. DX12 does not 'contain' any other versions of DX.<br />
- All DX12 signifies in Win10 is the highest level of DX that Win10 can use.&nbsp; Similarly Win7/8/8.1 showed DX11.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of recent release games that can actually use DX12, and DX12 is irrelevant to FFXI</p>
<p>&nbsp;(As are DX10/11 - but maybe not DX9 ?&nbsp; ). </p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of games have options for DX10/11 effects which can be selected in the games graphics setup,
</p>
<p>but the game will run mainly on a specific&nbsp; DX9 dynamic link library ( .dll file ),&nbsp; eg- d3dx9_28.dll.</p>
<p>In the past few years some games have been exclusive to DX10 or DX11, but while DX9 is on the way out</p>
<p>the majority of games are still capable of running on DX9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ One thing I am not clear on is how games released for DX7/8 are still able to run on DX9. It may just be</p>
<p>these games are DX9 but the game specs state DX7 or higher graphics cards ?&nbsp; </p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EDIT:</span></em> I've been playing around with this.&nbsp; Some (most?) older games have options
<em>OpenGL</em> as well as </p>
<p>DirectX, or 3DFx, so these games may be using OpenGL in the absence of DX8 in Windows</p>
<p>(assuming the game does not install a DX file in the games folder, as some do ) ?
</p>
- Note that most games also have an installer for the version of DX the game uses on the games install disk,
<p>but after running the DX8 setup on my MOH-AA disk I see no new files in Windows. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The &nbsp;<em>d3d8thk.dll</em>&nbsp; is the only&nbsp; DX8 file in Windows from Win7 on<em>,
</em>but the game may install a d3d8.dll </p>
<p>in the games folder.</p>
<p>Judging by the error it may come with PlayOnline, so it may be in the folder this is installed to.</p>
<p>If the d3d8.dll file is corrupt reinstalling&nbsp; PlayOnline should have fixed the issue though.
</p>
<p>- You could also try downloading a d3d8.dll&nbsp; from&nbsp; a .dll download site. If you do, be sure to scan the file
</p>
<p>with your AV and crosscheck that by scanning with Malwarebytes, as .dll download sites have a somewhat
</p>
<p>bad reputation.</p>
<p>If you can find a d3d8.dll file in one of the folders that the game or other two components are installed to,</p>
<p>replace that file with the 'new' one. Otherwise you can pop in into System32 and see if that helps.</p>
<p>You will need to register the file as well. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-DLL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-DLL</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- I would have thought that if FFDXI is still active and has been kept up to date that it would be running
</p>
<p>using DX9 by now. The game was released on PC in '04 which was already well into DX9 era.
</p>
<p>I can't offer any suggestions regarding issues with FFXI, as I've never had any involvement in this game.<br />
But as I said previously - The game selects which DX file it needs, not Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Your search shows that you do have all of the DX versions and files, except -
<em>d3dx11_42&nbsp; &amp; 43</em> (maybe you</p>
<p>missed them when typing the list, but it would not affect this game regardless ).<br />
</p>
<p>Two options for updating and reparing DX:</p>
<p>- You seem to have run the DX Web Installer - <em>" no need cuz im up to date."</em></p>
<p>When using a 'clean' Windows install it's advisable to run the <em>DirectX Web Installer</em> to 'update' DX.<br />
Note that the Web Installer only installs 'missing' files and does not overwrite corrupt files as does the
</p>
<p>full <em>DX Redist (June 2010)</em> installer.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>
<br />
<br />
- The DirectX Redist (June 2010) is what you need when there is suspicion of a corrupt DX file.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Details - Microsoft Download Center - DirectX Redist (June 2010)</a>
<br />
<br />
Note - The installer first unpacks files to a location of your choice. You then open the folder<br />
and find the <em>DXSETP.exe</em>&nbsp; and run that to reinstall DirectX.<br />
Once the reinstall is complete you can delete the folder the files were unpacked to.<br />
<br />
- Another reason for DirectX errors is if your graphics accelerator (either Integrated graphics or graphics card)
</p>
<p>does not meet the specifications of the game.</p>
<p>- If your graphics processor is overheating there is also a possibility of a DX related error when the game crashes</p>
<p>- Corrupt graphics or audio driver installation can also cause DX errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>- On the very long shot of ISP speed.</p>
<p>If your ISP is at fault you have to make a complaint to them. You can determine if your speed drops
</p>
<p>dramatically when you are play FFXI by checking the speed with&nbsp; <em>Speedtest.net.</em></p>
<p>There is a small chance that a game would crash while playing online if the speed dropped suddenly and
</p>
<p>dramatically while a lot of activity is happening in the game. Bad lag in the game is more likely than crashing
</p>
<p>though. Too high ping is more likely to get you kicked from the game vs the game crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you test the speed before starting the game, and again immediately after a crash you can get some
</p>
<p>idea of if there has been a big drop in speed.</p>

            There has been no solution as of yet. No one here has been able to help and i was sick of spending all day and night troubleshooting various thing via google research/forums etc. I just gave up in the end and subbed to a newer MMO that doesnt give me any
 problems. Since playing that and all the other non mmo on my laptop ive had fun...playing XI just turned into an anger management exercise. If you find a fix let me know. Its sad this is how i end a game ive been playing 15 years tbh.

 </blockquote> <p>I attempting to search the error code through Error &amp;&nbsp;Status Code Search page and was unable to located anything pertaining to that error code. This means one of two things. One, the error code is related to the game itself and not your Xbox or the Xbox Live Services, or, two, the game download was corrupt at some point during a recent update. Possible fixes? As M3tal Daz3 mentioned, uninstalling the game from the console may help remedy the issue. If it does not help, I recommend you contact Activision directly - I'm assuming&nbsp;Xbox Support will not&nbsp;be able to assist you with the error code as I mentioned, may not have anything to do with the Xbox itself.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was trying to mute my speakers while in a meeting and since like Skype for businees does not care about the status of my MAC sound settings, if you don't go to the skype app preference nothing change, so not sure why the skype app still using my laptop
 built in speakers (at full sound) even when I mute it ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is this a bug or an expected functionality ?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi JorgeFernandez6,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for posting your question here. To troubleshoot this issue, may I know if you have&nbsp;installed&nbsp;multiple sound output devices on your Mac?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, when you mute, you may only mute one output devices and the rest are not. So, to check this, please go to Sound Preference &gt; Output &gt; unmute all output devices and mute one by one to check this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition,&nbsp;If you can mute the sound by directly clicking the mute button in the meeting, please kindly use it as a workaround.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to let me know if you need further assistance after check the Output devices of your Mac and provide us following information for analysis:</p>
<p>1. A screenshot of your Skype for Business client version.</p>
<p>2. Do your coworkers have encountered the same issue?</p>
<p>3. When does this issue occur? If it happens recently, do you make any changes before this issue occurs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<h2>            Data lost due to installation of Win10 over previously installed win10 via boot menu</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>My Dell Inspiron laptop was running windows 10 and I did another USB installation of windows 10 over it via Boot Menu(where we press F12 after powering up). After complete installation the windows, I could see all my previous files (Desktop files, Documents
 etc.) but I was unable to OPEN them or COPY them to another location. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
After a few days, my C drive has shrunk down in size. <em>It was originally 50GB but now it shows as 20GB. 30GB is lost somehow.</em> It doesn't showup as
<em>unallocated space in 'Disk Management' either.</em></span></p>
<p>My valuable pictures and videos are lost in the process. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Is there any way to recover them?</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I hope my question is clear. If further clarification is needed, please ask and I would explain it.&nbsp;<strong>ANY HELP
</strong>would be much appreciated!</p>

            Hi Mubashir, this is happening much too often at the moment, you are logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around
<br />Restart your PC 3 or 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />With regards to the missing hard drive space:
<br />Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let us know so we can advise on what is safe to remove . . .

            Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

 a windows' protective step in order to protect data(user files, desktop files, etc.) I hope you can see through the problem and suggest me any possible solution.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />chkdsk found a problems, so the disk logical structure was damaged.  And the drive is almost full really.
<br />The best but very expensive way is to bring a disk to data recovery company. 
<br />If you want to try recovering itself, firstly you need to make a sector-to-sector backup of entire disk using third-party software, than trey to recover files using third-party programs, e.g. Recuva..
<br />The simplest way is to run chkdsk /f command but it can not guarantee saving you data, just correct future disk using.

<div><strong>&nbsp;We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers
 were loaded, and what was responsible.</strong><br />
<em>You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.</em><br />
<strong><br />
The procedure:</strong><br />
<em>* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
&nbsp;*Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive or"Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.</em></div>

* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />
