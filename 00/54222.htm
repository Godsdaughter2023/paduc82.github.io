<h2>            Duplication &#40;Should it be patched&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I was just interested in hearing your thoughts on duplicating items on Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition. I'm not going to give instructions but I can confirm that there is still a working duplication glitch as of July 18, 2012. Personally, I think they
 should leave in the glitch until Creative Mode is released, because duplicating items doesn't really affect anyone who doesn't play on your world, and you will probably never accidentally come across the glitch, so there's no way it can bother you if you don't
 intend to use it. I don't have anything against people who do it (including myself) as long as they admit it, because I like to see my server as a Creative server. Plus, without the glitch, there's no way that my friends and I could build the gigantic structures
 that we do. Your thoughts?</p>

<p>Yea I've duplicated many items because I always want to make sure my brother and my friends have plenty of items to build with when they come into my world. I don't mind mining, but sometimes I just wanna build and not have to worry about it and that's why
 I do it. </p>

<p>I personally don't care, I prefer to collect my resources, then build what i need. It prolongs the gameplay, and most of the people i play with are the same way.</p>
<p>But if i was to be the one making the decision, I'd leave it until there's a creative mode, Afterall, It's only really impacting the person playing (assuming those that do not wish to make use of this glitch leaves the game/kicks the person glitching)</p>

<p>I don't mind it on someone elses world. I like to mine everything and know I built it because of what I accomplished, not because of what I dupped. It is upsetting when someone comes into your world and does it though, as the dupe glitch can now be done
 with just one person. I have found though, that if they dupe, I can burn their house down, and put in a lava disposal and just trash everything. For some reason, they then decide it isn't fun playing on my world and usually just stick to their own.

<p>i don't mind it sense it's a nice replacement until creative mode comes, this glitch actually in a way helps to have more supply's to help build bigger things in the world of Minecraft heck it's the most useful glitch in Minecraft.</p>

<p>I'm against it.. in my world. I enjoy going through mines stripping them of their resources. But after a week of building slime spawners and not seeing one slime, I gave up and went searching through caves to find one. After a whole day of searching when
 I finally found a slime I duped it. I thought I worked hard enough that I deserved to dupe it.</p>
<p>I just don't like when I join a friends world and they have structures with gold and diamond block scattered through out it and they are super proud of it when all they did was find a diamond and duplicate it.. I don't see what the point of playing is then.</p>

<p>I like being able to duplicate things because there is no creative mode yet. I had no idea there was still one that worked though. 4J will probably patch it though because it really isn't supposed to be part of the game like that.</p>

<p>I won't use it, but I'm an old school gamer so as long as it's not causing problems for others or allowing people to cheat other players, I don't mind it if THEY wish to use it. Gamers use to love finding tricks and glitches back in the off-line console
 days and entire magazines were devoted to these types of tricks and glitches to get the most out of your games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that however, I have to disagree with that being the only way to create massive structures. Probably three days into owning the game I constructed a tower that reached the maximum height limit in-game without duping complete with a staircase
 and everything. Granted it's only a tower (goes straight up into the air) but I've since created a massive mansion underneath it, a huge castle complete with a subway system that takes you to it, a seaside community, and two suspension bridges as well as one
 tree preserve. OH yes and my wife built a pyramid in her spare time and is currently clearing land for a sphynx to go along side it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No offense to those who like to dupe, but it's just so much more fun for me and my wife knowing we built everything ourselves from scratch. The most frustrating thing is when people come and see our creations, and assume we've duped thanks to all the dupers
 out there. All of our hard work is immediately devalued. Still, I don't save any games where people enter our world because of this. I don't want anyone to dupe something on my seed without my knowing and it getting saved accidently by me.</p>

<h2>            Using Windows 8.1 Firewall with Norton 360&#39;s Firewall, but with Auto Protection OFF&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One month new, running a DELL Inspiron&nbsp; with Windows 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Have Norton 360 and Spybot with AV.&nbsp; I am using Spybot's Live Protection; turned off Norton's Auto Protection and all seems to be running well with no notification from Action Center nor My DELL app.&nbsp;
 My question is this:&nbsp; should I be using Norton's Firewall since I have Auto Protection OFF or turn Windows Firewall ON and turn Norton's OFF?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate a response, thank you.</p>

            <p>What version of Norton are you running - the trial version that came with PC or the fully&nbsp;paid up version??</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the post you mention (3) AV apps, <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">you only need (1) one</span></em>. You need to decide which one you want to use!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using more than one or a combination of several is not recommended, as it will cause conflict and give false positive reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions: </p>
<p>1. If you are using the trial version of Norton, suggest uninstall Norton using the 'Uninstaller' available from Norton website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Uninstall 'Spybot's Live Protection'</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Use 'Windows Defender' with 'Windows Firewall' as your AV protection.</p>
<p>With Window Defender set to automatically update, you should be adequately protected AV wise.</p>
<p>(Have been using Windows AV protection for several years now, on &nbsp;all PC/Laptops (approx 8) with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download and install 'Malwarebytes Anti-malware' and run this occasionally (Once a week) to supplement your AV protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The opinions/ suggestion are mine alone, I am in no way affiliated with MS.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>We would suggest you to use Windows Defender and Windows Firewall. If you use Norton antivirus that automatically disables Windows Defender. As you already have two antivirus applications
 (Windows Defender, Norton), you can uninstall Spybot antivirus. Make sure the Norton antivirus is updated daily.

Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.<br />
<br />
Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).<br />
<br />
More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.<br />
<br />
3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.<br />
<br />
If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.&nbsp;

<h2>            Win 10&#58; All app downloads in Windows Store stuck on 0.0 MB out of XXX</h2>
                    <p>After a lot of research, I finally managed to get OneNote, Mail and Agenda back on the download list of the Windows store (they were all just displaying their splash screen and then.. nothing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, any app I select to install in the Windows store to be installed on my PC is stuck on 0.0 (or 0.3) MB of XXXMB. I tried with OneNote and Mail and Agenda, they remained on 0.0 for over 1.5 hours... I tested it with a small game, and that is now (after
 30 mins) on 0.3 MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the store overloaded? Given the number of fails reported, and thus the number of people having to download again (a few apps or the entire build), this may be very well the case. What is really annoying is that MS is up to it's typical haughtily and stiff-necked
 behavior again: total silence.</p>

<p>Try this. It worked for me.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Press<strong> Windows key+X.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Windows PowerShell(Admin).</strong></li><li>Copy this by selecting the text in <strong>italics</strong> and then pressing
<strong>Ctrl+C</strong>,&nbsp; <em>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</em></li><li>Paste it into the PowerShell with <strong>Ctrl+V</strong>.</li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong>, and wait for the script to complete. You will know it is complete when you see the "PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; _" appears at the bottom of the window.</li><li>You may see several Red Errors around 3 or 4, ignore these- they are normal.</li><li>Close PowerShell.</li></ol>
<p>Hope it helps. Don't forget to click <strong>Helpful</strong>. :)</p>

            <p>I do not know what happened, but the store seems to work now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very strange, as I gave up 2 days ago. I was resigned to work with a half-working system for a month or so, and then see what could be done. I did reboot a couple of times for other reasons, but the store did not work, and windows update gave an error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I could not help myself, checked store again (was previously stuck in splash-screen). And it seemed to start. As I had problems with update also (error), i tried that as well, and It worked... It did state that there had been no upgrades in
 the last week or so, and that there had been no check for that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After forcing the check for new updates, 2 updates installed without any problems. The process was just a bit slow at some moments, when changing screens, &nbsp;so that I was afraid the updates were stuck, but it all continued on in reasonable time. After the
 mandatory reboot, I tried the store again, and it worked. I have received no info from MS, and &nbsp;yet the store now works: &nbsp;after "check for updates" it downloaded 2 apps (camera and Mail &amp; Agenda) in no time, and installed those. ... Strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not be too glad though... mail and agenda still do not sync with outllok.com, but that is something I have to look into now, i guess.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot for that fix. That did the trick. After doing what you said, I went to the Windows Store, clicked 'Install' on Jetpack Joyride, it kept saying 'Something is happening on our side' for some reason for a few seconds, and then the miracle happened.
 That JJ app was 9.8 mb downloaded already and continuing!</p>

            This screwed up my Apps completely. I can't do anything now. Store and other apps won't open, normal Programs work. A restart did not helped. How can I reset this? I can't reinstall my tablet, because there are no drivers for it.

            Dear TusarJit,<br />
I tried the steps you mentioned above. But it was not helpful and instead the store application and the applications downloaded from the store stopped working as well. Is there a fix for this, or do I have to reset Windows?<br />
Thank You

We where not given any notice of ban. &nbsp;I have a feeling that one of the enforcement players got mad because I purchased a car in auctions with payout instead of making a bid. If this is the case. Forza need to screen there enforcement player better. Gamertag: heavy993</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Reserved but no update notification&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I used this guide here to get the windows 10 icon and reserve my upgrade as I have Windows Embedded 8.1 Industry Pro:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/dreamspark-windows-embedded-81-industry-pro/804efa0c-39a0-4a4c-9e0a-7fccf0d21642?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used that method about 2 months ago at least and have recieved no update notification, why is this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Can I use the media creation tool or the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant still or do those programs not work not that windows 10 is not free, even if I have reserved my upgrade through the icon.</p>

            <p>That seems kinda sloppy of microsoft. I forgot to mention that I reserved my windows 10 update via the w10 icon before July 29th, so that should help right? I would think it should because it shouldnt be my fault that microsoft never gave me my windows 10
 download. Unfortunately I don't think it even matters because even if they update
<em>sh</em><em>ould </em>come eventually I don't think it will considering I reserved windows 10 at least 2 months ago.<br />
</p>
<p>Also here is an image of the windows 10 updater/reserver, and it says and has said since I first reserved windows 10 two months ago, that I will get a notification for install AFTER july 29th, which is why I wasn't bothered about the fact that the windows
 10 would stop being free after july 29th.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f583a591-8c35-4948-8f09-beffc8dab3be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f583a591-8c35-4948-8f09-beffc8dab3be" /></a></p>

<p>I purchased the season 6 pass before the new season started and episode 2 shows up on my xbox saying "ready to watch", but when I click on it I just get a preview and a prompt telling me to purchase the episode. I didnt have any issues with the first episode
 of the season. How do I solve this? Also, episode 2 doesnt even show on my laptop on the xbox video app. Whats up with that? Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Abnormal Program shut-down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim damer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Abnormal Program shut-down</h2>
                    
<p>When I close an email in Outlook (2007), the whole Outlook Program closes; same with Word docs. Not just MS Office programs, this happens in other programs as well - eg Copernic Agent Professional: close down a search and the whole program exits!</p>
<p>Have run both virus and malware checks but nothing there. Only other possible clue is that the mouse pointer appears unduly sensitive (but can see nothing in Control Panel to reduce sensitivity). Am using single mouse click.</p>
<p>Any assistance appreciated . . .</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Desktop Zoom -How to zoom out</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows 7 Desktop Zoom.</p>
<p>My desktop was a perfect size and I could see the whole screen on my internet with just the up and down scroll bar and my&nbsp;home screen&nbsp;was fine and the icons were just right&nbsp;as well, then I lent on my laptop on the keyboard and&nbsp;track pad&nbsp;and my screen zoomed
 in. Now my icons on my desktop have become large as well as all the writing. My internet is bigger and i now have the up, down, left and&nbsp;right&nbsp;scroll bars. How can i change my sizing back to normal where the zoom level is at 100% but the writing is still visible,
 and not stupidly small?</p>

<h2>            windows taskbar &#47; search box not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few days ago i realised that my Windows app and my search box / taskbar search stopped working. After soome "googling" i found out that Windows Firewall service is needed, so i activated it and then restarted my computer, which solved my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today same thing happened to my laptop. Since i have encourted this problem before with my other computer, i knew what to do: i enabled windows firewall service, which had been inactive since early December 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solved the problem in my laptop too. But i started ask myself why this problem occured almost 2 months after i inactivated Windows Firewall service and why i even need it even tho i am not using windows firewall? Therefore i started to undo all the
 changes i had done today and yesterday (i always write down registry changes etc i do just incase). But this didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that you probably will write that i maybe changed something else that i may have forgot. But i haven't! as i wrote above i always write down every change i make in my computers and save it in a external storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After i undid every change i had done today and yesterday (which were pretty few) i realised that these problems started AFTER i installed these two updates: KB3216755 and&nbsp;KB3211320.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">So, can you tell me why one of these updates have changed some settings, such that the Windows Firewall service must be running if we want to usesearch box and Windows applications like calculator can
 work? Why would we even need that service to keep running if we don't even use windows firewall nor windows defender?</span></p>

            <p>I do apologize for what happened to your computer and thank you for raising this issue to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In order to fix the issue with that searchbox / taskbar we have two options for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. You need to create a new sample user account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. You need to download the Windows 10 from our website.</p>
<p>2. In order to create a new sample user account:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Press and hold Windows logo on the keyboard together with R.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. On the Run command please type in: netplwiz</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. The user accounts window will open. Click Add and then a new window will appear.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Please click the option at the bottom part that says "sign in without a Microsoft account (not recommended)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. On the next screen please click Local Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Provide a username like "sample" but you don't need to create any password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Hit next and then Finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. Going back to user accounts window, you need to left click the new account and then click properties. Click&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; group membership and then select Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. Click Apply then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j. Then on the keyboard, press and hold Windows logo together with X. Left click Shutdown or Sign out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; k.&nbsp;Then select Sign out instead of Shutdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l. Left the new account then click Sign in. Wait until you are able to see the desktop environment then try your searchbox if it is working. If not, you need to proceed with the second step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Go to this Microsoft website: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Follow the instructions on how to create an .iso file of Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Once the download is already finished, you need to right click the Windows 10.iso file then left click Mount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. You will see another window that will open and please look for "setup.exe"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Right click that and left click OPEN</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. It will load the file and just follow the on screen instructions. It will fix all the corrupted files that is affecting
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your taskbar and searchbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi and thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Searchbox does work properly now and so does Windows Apps. As i wrote above the "thing" that caused this problems were &nbsp;Windows Firewall service: it was inactive and not running so i had to activate it and restart my computer. Therefore i don't see why
 i would need to create a new sample user account or (if the first option doesn't work) reinstall windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seems to be common for many users and most of them solved it by enabling windows firewall service. Since this occured after i downloaded
 properly? Is it due to new security updates in </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB3211320 or&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB3216755</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have ran both sfc /scannow and DISM too but none of them found any corrupted files which means that i don't need to do the second option?</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>before i solved my problem i tried SFC, DISM, troubleshooting and checking if windows search service was running. The results i got were following:</p>
<p>- sfc and dism found none corrupte files</p>
<p>- troubleshooting didn't find any problems</p>
<p>- windows search servive was set to automatic and was running. i also did reset my indexing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some googling i found an solution and it was that i must enable Windows Firewall service. Fortunately this solved my problem, but i don't see why i must keep Windows Firewall service enabled (and running) so i can keep using Windows Apps and Searchbox?<br />
</p>
<p>After some research and comparing my windows updates in my laptop with my other PC i found out which update made this problem:
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB3211320,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">hence this must be the one that changed something such that Windows Firewall service must be running so Windows Apps
 and Searchbox can work properly.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Could you please check this and see if my assumption is right (i haven't tried to uninstall the update etc)? and if it's right, why would the update make such change? I don't see any reason at all to
 have Windows Firewall service running when i don't have windows defender (and it's firewall) enabled (i am using 3rd party firewall).</span></p>

            <p>I have read that article but it doesn't say so much except from that it's an stability improvement for service tracking (which i don't what it is. Could you send an article about it?). I have still not got any answers about my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous to this update i had Windows Firewall Service disabled for atleast one month and had none, i repeat, none problems with Windows Apps nor Searchbox. But after i downloaded this update and updated my computer, i could no longer use Windows apps nor
 Searchbox (but run window did work properly luckily). The solution to this problem was to enable Windows Firewall Service and keep it running, as i have been written many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why do we need Windows Firewall Service to be enabled and running 24/7 so we can use feautures like Windows apps or searchbox even if we DON'T use Windows Firewall nor defender (I have disabled both of them through controlpanel)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problems i have had so far (after that update) by having firewall service disabled are that windows app and searchbox are not working. Again, why is that? Why is firewall service so important to keep running?
</p>
<p>I don't want to activate services of something i don't use and make my computer use more resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>furtermore, by disabling windows firewall i thought windows firewall would be disabled. I don't want it to make any possible conflicts with my bitdefender firewall. But having the service active and running, isn't it like have windows firewall activated
 "in the shadows"?? I seriously can't see any reasons on why it must be running.</p>
<p>these problems are not due to corrupted files. None of my two computers have corrupted files and i have checked with SFC and DISM scans over and over again. Everytimes SFC says that it found none corrupted files and DISM says that everything went smoothly.</p>

</p><p>As of the moment the article that we have provided is the only article for the update.
</p>
<p><span>A firewall is software or hardware that checks information coming from the Internet or a network, and then either blocks it or allows it to pass through to your computer, depending on your firewall settings.</span></p>
<p><span>A firewall can help prevent hackers or malicious software (such as worms) from gaining access to your computer through a network or the Internet. A firewall can also help stop your computer from sending malicious software to other<span>

            <p>i do know how firewall (software and hardware) work. But that wasn't my question. My question is why i need to have Windos Firewall SERVICE set to automatic and keep running so that windows apps and searchbox can work properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do i need to have that service running even if i am NOT using windows own built-in firewall nor windows defender? I am using the built-in firewall in bitdefender total security 2017. hence will ithis not cause any conflict between my third party app
 firewall and windows own firewall when i have windows firewall SERVICE enabled and running??</p>

            Why is Microsoft un-willing to admit that they have tied the firewall service into the core functionality of the Win 10 OS. &nbsp;Which for the general user is fine and probably preferable. But for IT professionals it is not only annoying but problematic as
 there is software that is business critical that will not work with firewall svc on so to get the required functionality we just have to live with broken components in the OS. &nbsp;Also this change has affected thing on servers. &nbsp;So why would there be no option
 to run without windows firewall in a way that does not break the OS for the users. &nbsp;As a case in point one computer is running as the BDR and the backup software will not work properly with the firewall svc enabled. &nbsp;Also this computer is behind a hardware
 firewall and as such should not need win firewall at all.

<h2>            Latest May and June 2018 updates have caused &#8220;invisible apps&#8221; &#40;3CX voip phone&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Windows did an auto update in early June which caused one of the primary applications I use for my job to become inoperable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the 3CX voip software phone application. The app shows that it is running in the task bar. If you hover the mouse over the screen real estate where the application would normally be showing, you see the pop-up tips showing you what buttons the mouse
 is pointing at, but you cannot see the actual application. &nbsp;If you click when hovering over the tip bubbles, it performs the action the tip bubble shows, up to even accidentally dialing a phone number if you are not careful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried updating my laptop (HP Pavilion 17-G192DX) to the latest driver to no avail. &nbsp;Tried loading GPU specific drivers as well as the computer manufacturer drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only fix was to downgrade my graphics driver to the Microsoft Basic DIsplay Adapter. This brings the application back to full visibility on the screen. However I lose the ability to run dual monitors because the basic driver does not support multi-monitor
 setups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot even get a USB to HDMI adapter to enable multi-monitor displays because it still requires the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter to support multi-monitors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that the application you're using is not compatible with the latest update of the drivers. As you have mentioned, it only works with Microsoft basic drivers. I suggest that you
<strong>download and install the latest driver and then run the </strong><span>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</span>. It&nbsp;<span>Runs the program using settings from a previous version of
 Windows. You may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the same issue persits, I highly recommend that you contact the application developer so you would know what are the drivers that are compatible with the app using multiple monitors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do let us know if you have any other concerns.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>

<div>3cx app was running okay with Microsoft Basic Driver installed.<br />
<br />
Changed the graphics driver to the newest driver version I have downloaded, Intel 2018&nbsp;20.19.15.4963<br />
<br />
3cx App went invisible on the screen.<br />
<br />
Shut off 3cx program.&nbsp; Changed compatibility settings to Windows 8.<br />
<br />
Restarted program, still invisible.<br />
<br />
Ran the troubleshooter, it recommended running with Windows 8 compatibility.<br />
<br />
Restarted program, still invisible.<br />
<br />
Changed the graphics driver that it worked fine with on June 1st, Intel 2017&nbsp;20.19.15.4835<br />
<br />
3cx app sill invisible.&nbsp; Restarted app, still invisible.<br />
<br />
Changed the graphics driver to prior 2016 driver, Intel 2016&nbsp;20.19.15.4549<br />
<br />
3cx app still invisible.&nbsp; Restarted app, still invisible.<br />
<br />
Tried several of the other compatibility options, still invisible.<br />
<br />
Changed the graphics driver to Microsoft Basic, app became visible and worked normally.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It worked with Windows 10 fine prior to the June update with the 2017 Intel driver as well.<br />
<br />
June update did mention something about affecting Graphics Drivers, or they would need to be re-installed.&nbsp; I have done all that, the app is invisible and non-functional with anything but the Microsoft Basic driver.</div>

</p><p>If the issue persits even if oyu installed the latest update, I highly suggest that you go back to an update prior to this issue. The current udpate might not be compatible with the app. To remove an update, kindly follow these:</p>

<p>Unfortunately the updates to remove dont go back far enough on my system. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing the last 3 updates it showed from June but did not fix the problem. &nbsp;There were no more updates showing that I could remove.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the 3CX forum, someone mentioned they had the same issue with TeamViewer after the last update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He said this was part of their solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>“<span>Apparently Microsoft change something to do with hardware graphic acceleration.</span><br />
<br />
<span>TeamViewer Support got me to add a few keys in the registry and it fixed the problem.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Following is the an excerpt of the TeamViewer solution that may help you work out what the issue is with 3cx client for windows</span><br />
<br />
<em>Directory:<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TeamViewer]<br />
<br />
Registry name:<br />
"DisableDirectXRendering"<br />

<br />

"1"&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Value(both keys):</em></p>
<p><em>“1”<br />
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this for the 3CX registry but it did not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still in the same boat.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>File History unknown error. File History doesn&#39;t recognize this - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george-sb  say:</h3>
<h2>            File History unknown error. File History doesn&#39;t recognize this drive</h2>
                    <p>I figured out File History replaced the back-up option of Windows 7.</p>
<p>I ran it.</p>
<p>It created a file on my internal back-up drive.</p>
<p>I ended up deleted that folder when I thought I had to.</p>
<p>When I 'turned on' again to do file history, it gives me the above error.</p>
<p>My back-up drive is accessible and I can open other files.&nbsp; Why is it not just recreating another folder and backing up my files?</p>

<div>Update Services Privacy Statement</div>
<div>Last updated July, 2009</div>
<div>
<p>Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains the data collection and use practices of the Windows Update and Microsoft Update services (the "Update Services"). This statement does not apply to other online or offline
 Microsoft sites, products, or services.</p>
<div>What are the Update Services?</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Windows Update</span> is a service that provides you with software updates for Windows software and other supporting software such as drivers supplied by device manufacturers.
</li><li><span>Microsoft Update</span> is a service that offers you new software from Microsoft and provides you with software updates for Windows software, as well as other Microsoft software such as Microsoft Office.
</li></ul>
<p>Some updates available through the Update Services can only be obtained by users that have validated they are running genuine Microsoft software. Genuine Microsoft software validation is covered by a separate privacy statement that you can see by clicking
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=83561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the Update Services in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By accessing the Windows Update or Microsoft Update web site </li><li>By using the Windows Update feature in Microsoft Windows </li></ul>
<div>What data is collected?</div>
<div>
<p>The Update Services collect information from your computer that allows us to operate and improve the services, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Microsoft software and other supporting software (e.g., drivers supplied by device manufacturers) installed on your computer for which the Update Services have updates available. This helps us determine which updates are appropriate for you.
</li><li>Your Windows Update and/or Microsoft Update configuration settings such as whether you want updates automatically downloaded or installed.
</li><li>The successes, failures, and errors you experience when accessing and using the Update Services.
</li><li>Plug and Play ID numbers of hardware devices – a code assigned by the device manufacturer that identifies the device (e.g., a particular type of keyboard).
</li><li>Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) – a randomly generated number that does not contain any personal information. GUIDs are used to identify individual machines without identifying the user.
</li><li>BIOS name, revision number, and revision date – information about the set of essential software routines that test your hardware, start the operating system on your computer, and transfer data among hardware devices connected to your computer.
</li><li>Product ID – the unique product license identifier that is included with all Microsoft products.
</li><li>Product Key – the string of numbers and characters that comes with all Microsoft products, typically entered by you during setup to successfully install a product.
</li></ul>
<p>You can use the Update Services in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By accessing the Windows Update or Microsoft Update web site. </li><li>By using the Windows Update feature in Microsoft Windows. Within the Windows Update feature, you can choose whether to opt in for Microsoft Update.
</li></ul>
<p>When you use the Update Services, information about your computer ("standard computer information") is sent to Microsoft. Standard computer information typically includes information such as your IP address, operating system version, your hardware ID which
 indicates the device manufacturer, device name, and version and your regional and language settings. Using data provided by a third party, we may derive a general geographic area based on your IP address before we delete it. We use this information to help
 operate and improve our products and services, including the Update Services.</p>
<p>If you use the Windows Update or Microsoft Update web site to access the Update Services, in addition to the information described above, we will collect information about your browser version, the pages you visit and the actions you take. For more information
 about what data is collected and how it is used when you access these web sites, see the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=72007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Online Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
<div>How is the data used?</div>
<div>
<p>The data sent to Microsoft is used to operate and maintain the Update Services. It is also used to generate aggregate statistics that help us analyze trends and improve our products and services, including the Update Services.</p>
<p>For example, the Update Services use the GUID:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide customers with the best possible service, the Update Services track and record the number of individual computers that use the Update Services and whether the download and installation of specific updates succeeded or failed. The Update Services
 record the GUID of the computer that attempted the download and installation, the ID of the item that was requested, whether updates were available, and standard computer information.
</li><li>For versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista and Windows 7, the Update Services record the GUID of the computer if you provide responses about whether help and troubleshooting articles were useful in resolving your problem. This allows the Update Services
 to provide you with increasingly helpful and relevant information. </li></ul>
<p>Information collected by Microsoft software, sites, and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using Microsoft software, sites
 or services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union,
 the European Economic Area, and Switzerland. Microsoft may disclose this information in order to (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement
 of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers or the public. We may also disclose this information
 as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.</p>
<p>Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, such as providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of reports. Microsoft will provide these companies only the information
 they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
<div>Required Updates</div>
<div>
<p>If you turn on the Update Services, in order for them to properly function some software components on your system that make up or are directly related to the Update Services will need to be updated from time to time. These updates must be performed before
 the service can check for, download, or install other updates. These required updates fix errors, provide ongoing improvements, and maintain compatibility with the Microsoft servers that support the service. If the Update Services are turned off, you will
 not receive these updates.</p>
<p>Update Services are "turned on" if you choose one of the following settings: (i) install updates automatically, (ii) download updates automatically and choose whether to install them, or (iii) receive notifications about updates and choose whether to download
 and install them. Windows Update service is "turned on" and set to "install updates automatically" when you choose the recommended option during Windows Out Of Box Experience (OOBE) setup.</p>
<p>If you turn on the Update Services, regardless of which "turned on" setting you have chosen, required updates to some components of the service will be downloaded and installed automatically without further notice to you. If you would prefer not to receive
 required updates, turn off the Update Services.</p>
<div>Cookies/Tokens</div>
<div>
<p>A token is similar to a cookie. It stores information in a small file that is placed on your hard disk by the Update Services server, and is used when your computer connects to the Update Services server to maintain a valid connection. It is stored on your
 computer only, not on the server. This cookie/token contains information (such as last scan time) in order to find the most recently available updates. It contains information to manage what content should be downloaded to your computer, when that should happen,
 as well as a GUID to identify your computer to the server. Information contained in the contents of the cookie/token is encrypted by the server (with the exception of the cookie/token expiration time). This cookie/token is not a browser cookie so it cannot
 be controlled with your browser settings. The cookie/token cannot be removed; however, if you do not use the Update Services, the cookie/token will not be used.</p>
<div>About surveys</div>
<div>
<p>Occasionally you might be invited to participate in a survey about the way you use the Windows Update or Microsoft Update Services. Each survey includes a privacy statement that details the way Microsoft will use the information submitted with that survey.</p>
<div>View sample data</div>
<div>
<p>You can view a sample of the information Microsoft will collect from your computer on our
web site. Note the data provided is sample data only – individual results may vary based on your specific machine configuration.</p>
<div>Controlling the Update Services</div>
<div>
<p>You may change your Update Services settings after Windows setup via the Start menu. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, go to the Start menu and select
<b>All Programs</b>, then select <b>Windows Update</b>, then select <b>Change Settings</b>. In Windows XP, go to the Start menu and select
<b>Control Panel</b>, then select <b>Automatic Updates</b>. To turn off the Update Services (including required updates), select
<b>Never check for updates</b> in Windows Vista and Windows 7 or select <b>Turn off Automatic Updates</b> in Windows XP.</p>
<div>Security practices</div>
<div>
<p>Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of the information we collect. The Update Services use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect the information collected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example,
 when your computer is scanned to determine what software is on your machine, we use encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. The information collected is stored on computer servers with limited and controlled access.</p>
<div>Changes to this statement</div>
<div>
<p>Microsoft may update this privacy statement. If we do, we will revise the "Last updated" information at the top of the statement. To stay informed about how we are helping protect the information collected by the Update Services, we encourage you to periodically
 review the privacy statement.</p>
<div>For more information</div>
<div>
<p>Microsoft welcomes your comments regarding this privacy statement. If you believe that Microsoft has not adhered to this statement, please contact us by using this

            Hi EliGarden 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />1. Run printer troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; On the right side, Click Printer &gt; Run the troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Download printer driver from printer manufacturer's website and reinstall.
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.
<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center Doesn&#39;t Detect MS Bluetooth Mouse</h2>
                    Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center continues not to detect my Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000, nor my Dell Bluetooth keyboard, on Windows 10 Pro x64. On my Dell T5400 workstation, MM&amp;KC on Windows 8.1 Pro x64 resolutely refuses to recognize both
 the Microsoft Natural Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard 7000, or the Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 7000, although it does recognize one or the other. All these devices appear correctly in Device Manager, Manage Bluetooth Devices, etc. so the OS is doing
 its job; it appears that the Mouse and Keyboard Center is just not functioning correctly at all. This is annoying, as the customizations for these Microsoft products are not readily available.

<p>I don't use HP Image Zone, but this sounds like some Image Zone configuration settings are not standard.</p>
<p>If you can view the pictures using Image Zone, try right-clicking one, selecting "Properties" and see if it gives you a file name (it may only show photographic properties).&nbsp; Perhaps there's some other place in Image Zone that will let you see the file name
 of the stored image.&nbsp; If so, it may actually be somewhere other than My Albums (the pvm extension doesn't make a lot of sense).</p>
<p>If you believe that the files in My Albums are actually your images, try renaming one of them from abc.pvm to abc.jpg and then try to open it.</p>
<p>When you downloaded the files from the card in the first place, was Image Zone configured to delete the files from the card or leave them on the card?&nbsp; If the files are still on the memory card, you can copy them to My Pictures without using Image Zone.</p>
<p>If none of the above helps, your best bet is to post in one of the hp support forums. I'd suggest<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printer-All-in-One-Software-and/bd-p/Software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this one</a> .</p>
