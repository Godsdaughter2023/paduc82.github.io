<h2>            How do I find the driver for the Fosmon PC camera&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Fosmon USB 6 LED PC Webcam Camera Plus Night Vision, got another pc, and cant find disc. Where can I get the driver? I went to Fosmon site and no driver info listed, and no reply to request for info.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; BTW, I did check these forums and found one other old request for the same info, but the link in the answer is no longer any good.</p>

<br />Are these files you have been working on before you turn off your PC?
<br />
<br />Do you have your Library folders moved over to your D drive?
<br />
<br />What folder on your D Dive are these files disappearing from?

<h2>            Balanced Power Option now runs CPU at full speed ALWAYS after installing Windows 8.1 Update 1</h2>
                    <p>This has occurred on three separate systems running AMD and Intel processors.&nbsp;&nbsp; To get Windows to throttle the CPU, I must now run "Power Saver".</p>
<p>Alternatively, if I create a new power plan based on "balanced", that new plan will throttle.&nbsp; If I go back to "balanced", it seems to have reset and now runs like it did before the update.&nbsp; Weird...</p>

            <p>Hello Manolo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you,</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you changed the setting in BIOS?</li><li>Have you checked the issue by setting default power settings in BIOS?</li></ol>
<p>I would suggest you to&nbsp;default power settings in BIOS.</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;check for the issue by using the power troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer: <strong>Power plans: frequently asked questions</strong></p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Create a NEW Microsoft Account with your PRIMARY e-mail</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press “Windows key +C”.</p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>Settings </strong>
and then click on <strong>Change PC settings </strong>at the bottom of the Right panel.</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>Users </strong>
listed on the left.</p>
<p>4. Click <strong>Add a User </strong>
under <strong>Other Users.</strong></p>
<p>5. Type your PRIMARY Microsoft Account e-mail address.</p>
<p>6. Enter the required details.</p>
<p>7. Log off the computer.</p>
<p>8. Login into the newly created Microsoft Account.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>STEP 2: Transfer all your data onto the MS Account from the Local Account.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Windows Explorer to navigate to C:\Users to the account you<br />
want to COPY - Right Click on the Folders (and/or files) and COPY - go to the other account<br />
and PASTE where you want to put them. Repeat as needed. </p>
<p>NOTE: Do not delete the folders and files from the account they are in until you are sure they are duplicated where you need them.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>STEP 3: Once sure you are done with all your files copied, delete the Local Account.</strong></p>
<p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry, it's not possible to change the date of birth or age on a Xbox LIVE account. If you wish to do so, you'll need to make a new account. There's unfortunately no way around that.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows has detected an IP Address Conflict - erroneous message</h2>
                    I have a Windows 7 Professional desktop machine.&nbsp; I use an **** NVG599 router from AT&amp;T U-Verse.&nbsp; I looked at the router and the ten IP addresses assigned do not have duplicates among them - in fact, I would think it impossible for the router to tolerate
 this.&nbsp; I'm suspecting that recent Windows 7 maintenance caused this message to appear erroneously.&nbsp; I just checked Windows Update and no "important" updates are available - last updates were applied on April 13th.

</p><p>It may or may not be erroneous.&nbsp; Usually only happens if one or more of the devices are set to a static IP.&nbsp; If you re-boot all the devices (and the router) at the same time and the problem does not re-appear it may simply be a one off.</p>

            To close this issue, let me document what happened. &nbsp;It's true that one of the devices (a printer) has a static IP address, but still, this makes no sense to me in terms of explaining the behavior of Windows 7 when it alleges that there is an IP address
 conflict. &nbsp;I examined all the IP addresses and there were none assigned in duplicate - in fact, it seems unlikely to me that the router would do this, inasmuch as it uses DHCP (except for the one static address) and the whole point of DHPC is to assign an
 unused address to a new device. &nbsp;I concluded that Windows 7 is in error but I hadn't come to any conclusion as to what I'd do to solve it. &nbsp;Rebooting everything seemed the only alternative but I kept putting it off. &nbsp;Finally the message stopped appearing despite
 the fact that I did nothing. &nbsp;I chalk it up to a bug in Windows. &nbsp;Thank you for your assistance.

<h2>            My home Wifi &#40;alone&#41; is not showing up after upgrading from Windows 7 to 10 in HP laptop</h2>
                    <p>I am using a HP laptop. My home WiFi network alone does not show up after upgrading from Windows 7 to 10. All other accounts are showing up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows 10 it showed up and connected propery for 1 day and then from second day on wards my home wifi network is not showing up in the available list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My home wifi account was working fine in Windows 7. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 also the account is showing up in the "Manage Known Networks" list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to even configure this account manually using the "Manually connect to a wireless network". But it says that a network already exists and when I click on "Use the existing network" nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One point I want to mention is that earlier when I was using Windows 7, I had clicked forget once and then re configured this network. I think that Windows 10 has some bug with respect to wifi networks that were "forget" earlier bur restored later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is 3rd time I rolled back to windows 7 and tried to see if there could be any fixes in the latest version of windows 10 for this issue but there is no change. I really want to use windows 10 but this issue is really making me sad. I have no option but
 to roll back to windows 7.</p>

    <title>Laptop stutters and goes very slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angel.o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop stutters and goes very slow</h2>
                    <p>So these past few days I have been having&nbsp; lot of issues with my laptop and after lurking around the internet for a while I cant find any clear cut causes for the issues I've been having.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is a windows related issue or if my laptop
 is dying on me and I was wondering if anyone here knows whats happening. I will try my very best to explain everything that has happened</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Backstory/Info</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The laptop is a L755 Toshiba Satellite and it uses Windows 10 <br />
</li><li>There has been several times where I've gotten random blue screens </li><li>The problems I began to experience occurred randomly, as in I never downloaded anything and didn't do anything abnormal the day before these problems arose.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Issue</span></p>
<p>So as of recently (last weekend) my laptop started acting up. Everything seemed fine at first however, eventually my laptop began slowing down, and it continued slowing down to the point where it eventually froze. I turned it off and on several times but
 each time the same result occurred. I couldn't do basic tasks, applications took an absurd amount of time to load up, I couldn't use any basic features. (Pressing start, close apps, open apps) everything ran very slow. And as I stated before these problems
 arose without any warning</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The "Solutions"</span></p>
<ul>
<li>My initial instinct was to check for a virus however it seemed odd because as stated before I never downloaded anything, and to make matters worse I couldn't even load up malewarebytes or any of my apps. SO this led me to do some research(Im not a tech
 savvy type of person) and I found out about safe mode. When I entered safe mode everything worked perfectly fine, no faults, no staggers and no slow laptop. However when I used my 3 virus scanners, I came up with no negative results on any of them.
</li><li>My next thought was that maybe I missed an update however I found out I had all current Windows 10 updates on my laptop</li><li>After that I thought that maybe my hard drive was beginning to die on me however I figured if my laptop worked on Safemode then it wasn't the hard drive (Again I'm not a tech guru so I might be completely wrong on this)</li><li>Then I tried to reset my laptop to an earlier date and as you can guess, no success.

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Aftermath</span></p>
<ul>
<li>So now that I've pretty much started over from scratch the Laptop seems to be working MUCH better............however there are still issues. My laptop stutters inconsistently and at times freezes for a minute or two, it constantly slows down whenever I
 have multiple tabs open (this never happened before) and overall goes a lot slower. I can actually use it as of right now however its a shell of what it once was.
</li><li>With all that being said, does anyone know what a possible cause for these issues might be? And is there any way to get my laptop more optimized and running smoother once again?</li></ul>

</p><p>Im not a tech savvy guy so I dont really know how to check for this, however when I type in "System Info" into the Windows Search Bar I do see that I have some Hyper V terms:</p>

</p><p>I am not sure if I have any developer tools or motion and graphic systems installed/enabled and I do not know how to check for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmmm, I dont think they conflicted when they scanned although I am not to certain. I know Windows Defender conflicted with Spybot so I used Windows Defender first after no results came up, I disabled WD and used Spybot. And after that also came up with no
 results I used malewarebytes (again with no results).</p>

<p>So I haven't been able to respond since my laptop has been having issues again. Since we last talked my laptop began experiencing a blue screen with the following error "Driver_IRQL_not_less_or_equal".&nbsp; I got a warning from windows stating the AMD Catalyst
 needs attention so I'm assuming I'm missing a driver for whatever reason. However my laptop is going very slow an being extremely unresponsive so I cant really download whatever it is. Do you have any suggestions?</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:Actually as soon as I finished the pragraph above my laptop manage to download "AMD Auto Detect" which is supposed to automatically detect missing drivers however I get the message "We are unable to find a driver for your system". Im at a loss at what
 the issue could be and I'm really hoping you guys can help salvage my laptop. </p>

Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist</a> to check it's set up correctly, opimized for best performance, and any repairs get done.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I only had time to download the updates for Windows 10 with the "Windows 10 Integrity Checklist" step, and have not used my laptop since then. I was missing two updates and that was about it. I have not attempted to try any of the other suggestions as I
 have not had any free time these past days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop works fine on Safe Mode Networking. And I have uninstalled AMD Catalyst</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating I found out that I was missing updates for Windows Malicious Software Remover, Windows Defender, Cumulative Update for Windows10 Version 1511,&nbsp; and Security Updates for Adobe Flash. Which is pretty strange considering no updates popped up
 previously. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will go to Toshiba Support Download ASAP and I will attempt to do the previous suggestions. I will get back to you once I have finished doing those tasks or if I face any other new issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding, you're my last hope at the moment and it's really appreciated. :)</p>

            <p>I have tried most of the steps and here are the results</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates: As stated in my previous post I was missing a ton of updates. After I updated and installed all of them my laptop has been a whole lot better, however it still stutters occasionally. ( Everything becomes unresponsive anywhere from 1sec-1min)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Toshiba Support Downloads: Here is where I reached my first bump. When I enter my serial number the chipset link on the left handside of the website disappears which means I cant download any chipset drivers. I am not sure what that indicates in terms of
 the situation. Also what do you mean by "other drivers" and how do I check if my drivers are up to date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Install: I have not tried a clean install however I will try it if this becomes a hassle. (Unless if you absolutely recommend I do it right now)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows Install Integrity Checklist</span></p>
<p>None of my drivers have an (!) next to them and I am not sure how to check if I am missing any drivers</p>
<p>I disabled all freeloaders on System Resources and I removed all bloatware.</p>
<p>I scanned with Malewarebytes and AdwCleaner and came up with no major results</p>
<p>I am currently scanning for damaged files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is as far as I have gotten and I will keep you updated tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: My audio is no longer working, I was using it literally a couple of hours ago and have not done anything besides troubleshoot and browse Youtube(when my audio was working). I have a feeling something is seriously wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Critical Process died crash</h2>
                    Recently (not sure if after an update or not) my computer has been crashing with the error critical_process_died. This happens much more frequently when I play video games but still happens after a few hours of normal usage. I've tried updating all my
 drivers (to no avail) and so I'm at the end of my tether. Apparently I can send you guys a DUMP file and you can tell me what the issue is but I'm not sure how to do that so I'll see what you suggest. Thanks! EDIT: Crash logs if they're useful to anybody&nbsp;http://prntscr.com/j5eb2w

<p>Hey guys, new to the xbox forums. I came to the xbox from the pc thinking that more people would talking in game. I've played for about 13 hours now and have only found one person that would talk.... and he was a douche. I thought that in a team based game
 like this more people would be communicating, but that isnt the case. So i am wondering if any of you guys would like to play a few games. Im on now, so if you are too shoot me and invite. If not just send me a friend request or something saying you are from
 the forums. I look for to shooting some people in the face... with company for once.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 download terminated by thunderstorm, then installation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 download terminated by thunderstorm, then installation failure</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I explored my Windows 10 upgrade app in the system tray and started the download. I kept an eye on progress in Control Panel -&gt; Windows Update. When it reached about 75%, there was a power cut due to a thunderstorm. When I reebooted, I was informed
 that the upgrade had failed. There was an opportunity to "Try Again" but it was late so I left it until until the following day.<br />
<br />
When I look at Windows Update now, the failed download is listed:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbfd1194-504b-485c-95c8-902c82920b13" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the Windows 10 App thinks that Upgrade to Win10 is available:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12ca36ae-5784-4b78-9ebe-405b5670ff25" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on "OK Let's Continue, it hangs:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/686f4130-8251-44d4-b091-9d9a434e13f3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there seems to be no method of setting the clock back and doing a fresh download.<br />
<br />
Advice please.<br />
<br />

<h3> jp1801  say:</h3>
<h2>            Candy Crush Saga Keeps Reinstalling</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10, and am having trouble removing the pre-installed Candy Crush Saga application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's appears on my start menu as 'recently added', I right click and select 'Uninstall', but 1-2 days later it re-appears and I have to go through the same process again. I must have uninstalled it 20+ times already.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I completely remove this application? I do not use it, nor do I wish for other to be able to use it on my computer. The same problem also occurs on my computer at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks<br />

            This is just another reason why I am jumping ship away from Microsoft if they if get a decent non mac competitor.. I absolutely hate that every time I reformat I have to turn off all the bs that shouldn't be auto downloading on my pc. I don't want skype,
 I dont want candy crush saga, I dont want cortana.. the list goes on and on.. get your **** together microsoft or **** and let someone else take your spot.

<p>It appears Microsoft wants to annoy people who are not technically savvy and for those who are, drive them to using the registry even more (Beware, the registry has User Access Control on the keys now as well in Windows 10.) Microsoft is "tanking" its users
 to sow User Aggro towards them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to fix your problem, you'll need to do an Internet search on "<strong>DisableWindowsConsumerFeatures</strong>" (I recommend using Google for it.). You'll then be instructed on how to set the CouldContent registry setting to stop that Microsoft Pump &amp;
 Dump junkware on your computer.</p>
<p>

    <title>Win10 Reset This PC&#47;Recovery Drive fails, overwrites wrong - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rct0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Reset This PC&#47;Recovery Drive fails, overwrites wrong drive&#33;</h2>
                    <p>System: Lenovo Thinkpad P51, 2 drives, 1 x NVMe, 1 x HDD. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I replaced the NVMe drive and attempted to reinstall Windows using a USB Recovery drive created on this system before any problems.&nbsp; This failed and would have resulted in data loss if I didn't have other backups.&nbsp; From my perspective, there seem to be a
 number of critical bugs in this recovery environment for machines with more than 1 drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>booted from USB recovery drive </li><li>Select Troubleshoot</li><li>Select Recover from a drive</li><li>Select either <strong>Just remove my files</strong> or <strong>Fully clean the drive</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Result:</p>
<ol>
<li>Appears to be working, but fails at 77% in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Error message "<strong>There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made</strong>."</li><li>There was no prompt for which drive to use.&nbsp; The existing HDD was <strong>silently repartitioned</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; No changes were made</strong> is an incorrect statement.&nbsp; There was no windows install on the HDD.
</li><li>The repartitioned HDD was never made bootable. So the system still can't boot into Windows.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Problems/Bugs:</p>
<ol>
<li>No prompt for which drive to reset/install windows on.<br />
</li><li>No information about which drive has been selected before prompting to proceed.</li><li>Misleading information "No changes were made". when one of the drives had been repartitioned.</li><li>No information about what failed or how to get to any logs.&nbsp;&nbsp; How should someone attempt to troubleshoot the problem?</li><li>There doesn't seem to be an option to force a particular drive to be used as the system drive.</li><li>Some of the menus for Troubleshoot are lacking "Back".&nbsp; In some cases you need to select an operation before you get to a point where you can hit cancel.&nbsp; There are no assurances when you select those options that you will be given a chance to cancel.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the reset my PC / Recovery drive utility usable on a multi-drive system?</li><li>Without physically removing drives (the bios/uefi doesn't have a disable option AFAICT) how do I set which drive is the system drive to be installed/updated/etc.?<br />
</li><li>Should I be attempting to file any bug reports?&nbsp; </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I'm aware that I should be able to use the media creation tool on another system to do a generic Windows 10 install.&nbsp; However, I'd prefer to reinstall the factory environment with the OEM drivers already installed.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Check this link, I hope you can solve the problem.
<br />
<br />You could also check to see if there are some sectors of the hard drive damaged.
<br />After you correct the damaged sectors you can enter with Windows Virtual and backup your files and then reinstall Windows
<br />
<br />Take a look to the following link, there is a step by step guide 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-allinone-boot-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-al...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>
<br />
<br />Process: 
<br />1. Enter your USB drive or CD
<br />2. Enter Dos Programs 
<br />3. Enter Hard Disk tools 
<br />4. Enter HDAT2 4.53 (Test/Repair Bad Sector) 
<br />5. Then auto &amp; choose your keyboard United states (or wait it will do automatically here) 
<br />6. Press Enter &amp; Press Drive level tests menu 
<br />7. Enter Check and Repair bad sectors 
<br />8. And now it will start, it takes a lot of time, so wait until it finished.
<br />
<br />Or you can also use "Memtest86" to review a problem in Ram Memory, which is there in the same CD

<p>Thank you for taking the time to reply, but the problem isn't with the drive/hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is the Windows created USB recovery drive (Reset This PC)&nbsp; is writing to THE WRONG DRIVE.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just replaced the NVMe drive and have a brand new blank drive that I'd like to re-install onto using the USB recovery drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The NVMe drive never gets written to.&nbsp; Instead the HDD which is a data drive got repartitioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see on the HDD (the wrong drive) that the "Just remove my files" process:</p>
<ul>
<li>created a new partition table on the HDD</li><li>wrote about 22 GB of windows installation and logs.&nbsp; </li><li>never wrote the boot files so it isn't bootable. </li></ul>

</p><p>I replaced the drive.&nbsp; I have a new NVMe drive <strong>with nothing -- no OS on it</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to re-install with the factory image which was created with the create recovery drive option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for an answer that tells me IF is possible to tell the Recovery Tool / Reset This PC, which drive to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd prefer an option that doesn't require disassembling the laptop to disconnect the HDD in order to run the recovery tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose one possibility might be to:</p>
<ol>
<li>use a set of Win10 media to create generic install on the NVMe drive, </li><li>wipe the HDD so there doesn't appear to be a (partial) windows install there.</li><li>Try the Recovery Drive/Reset This PC to see if it can restore the system disk from the recovery drive to the desired (factory) state.</li></ol>

<h2>            Parece que alguien ha manipulado tu perfil. No se puede continuar</h2>
                    
<p>Buenas a todos. tras mi reciente compra del FM4 y viendo que tenía muchísimos tuneos del FM3, he ido a ver estos y no puedo iniciar el juego ma sale el error:</p>

<p>"Parece que alguien ha manipulado tu perfil. No se puede continuar"</p>

<p>Y me devuelve automáticamente al Dashboard</p>

<p>He llamado al SAT y no tienen ni zorra. Me han dicho que quizás sea por" Infringir los términos del juego"</p>

<p>A chorros me he quedado ya que ni tan siquiera he realizado vinilos aunque si comprados</p>

<p>¿Alguna idea?</p>

<p>Pd.- Jamás he modificado la consola y los juegos son originales</p>

<p>ese problema es por el juego . algun logo, vinilo o algo que le habras puesto al coche que haya infrigido las normas del juego. seguramente solo te pasa con ese juego verdad. el baneo puede ser permannete o temporal depende

<p>EJEMPLO si pones un vinilo de una tia desnuda o simbolo nazi o simplemente insultando .(son ejemplos)</p>

<p>El caso que ningún vinilo era ofensivo, es más; prácticamente no tenía vinilos y los que había comprado fue a través del marketplace tipo coche fantástico, de rally o bien de vehículo de emergencia</p>
<p>Espero que el baneo sea temporal. Llevaba sin jugar cosa de 2 meses y ayer cuando lo puse me salió eso</p>

            This sounds like the problem I recently encountered.&nbsp; Also, posted by ljsport in another thread.&nbsp; The following is a cut and paste of the answer I proposed to him.&nbsp; I hope it will help you.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I had EXACTLY the same problem that you describe.&nbsp; Since I am not a geek, it took me a while to solve it.&nbsp; Hopefully I can help you.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have an HP printer installed on your system, there will likely be two HP items in your "Startup" group under Programs.&nbsp; Delete them both.&nbsp; This solved the problem for me.&nbsp; Deleting one or the other is not sufficient to correct the problem.&nbsp; Both of
 them must go.&nbsp; Then reboot your system.&nbsp; It worked for me and I hope it does for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have just figured this out, I don't yet know how this will affect the operation of my printer and I really don't care because I have my PC back in order.&nbsp; Any printer issues are minor by comparison.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I must say that I am very disappointed in the total lack of response here from the geek community.&nbsp; What's the problem guys?&nbsp; Was this one too tough for you?&nbsp; Or maybe you just don't care about us struggling non-geek user types.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If my solution does not work for you, I am sorry.&nbsp; The only advice I can give is to try what led me to solving it on my PC.&nbsp; That would be a trial and error process of uninstalling various non-critical items from your system until you hopefully hit upon
 one that solves the problem.&nbsp; This is a very tedious and sometimes frustrating methodology, but it is what led me to a solution.&nbsp; I started by removing all the items from my startup group in addition to my three most recently added programs.&nbsp; Kind off a shotgun
 type approach but it led to a solution.&nbsp; Best of luck in finding the source of your problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I said, I am not a computer geek, but more than willing to help if I can.&nbsp; Feel free to contact me at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />

<h2>            Surface Go Very Weird &#34;No Internet, Secures&#34; Problem</h2>
                    <p>I purchased by Surface Go in the United States and the internet connection has been fine. I traveled back to China recently and I have had some troubles connecting to the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect to a home Wi-Fi, it says "No Internet, Secured". First, I have tried the troubleshooter but it only told me to reset the internet, which did not help. Then, I have also tried uninstalling the network adapter driver and reinstalling it. It
 did not work either. Lastly, I unchecked the ipv6 mark in the adapter settings, and manually set DNS, but no luck. The network is always showing "No Internet, Secured".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened Chrome and it surprised that I actually have internet access, but only with the plug-in "unblock youku" (a proxy that allows access to Chinese video sites) on. If I turn off "unblock youku", I will no longer have internet access on Chrome. I have
 no idea what's going on. I searched the internet but did not find anyone had the similar situation. I suspect it has something to do with the internet settings.</p>

            <div>In the past, we've seen issues with WiFi connectivity with Surface devices</div>

<h2>            Windowss 10 Update has bricked my laptop.  I havea no CD drive and no product key</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP laptop with a small solid state drive (approx. free space 5.8GB).&nbsp; The latest update needed 10GB+ so I followed the instructions and connected an external disk drive via USB.&nbsp; The system has not local CD drive.&nbsp; The upgrade failed after around
 3 hours and all automatic efforts to restore to previous versions fail.&nbsp; Either it loops or asks for me to insert the external media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a boot or recovery disk as no CD player.&nbsp; I don't have the product key as it was embedded on the laptop.&nbsp; How do I recover it as I now have an expensive paperweight or doorstop.</p>

            Hi Mark
<br />
<br />Is that like a HP Stream with a 32GB (29.1GB usable) SSD drive?
<br />
<br />If so,  honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you 10GB more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>So very over MS continuing to limit my control over my own machine. No secret the updates continue to irresponsibly buggy. Over&nbsp; the entire lifetime of my being a MS user, back to the start, every single version more limits the user's control over their
 own machine. And this constant forcing updates I do not want down my throat has me about one update away from changing to a Mac. Think about that. After 20+ yr as a windows user, I am going to through the hell of learning a whole new OS to get away from MS's
 increasingly arrogant totalitarian control over my machine. Had to take time to turn off Defender - dont want it. Had a power outage today - off course took the restart as the opportunity to shove another bad update down my thorat. Options were 'update and
 turn off' or 'update and restart'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last update the microSD I was using as overflow storage unable to be connected (Network drive wont connect, go to the page MS said to go to about, total gibberish). I called India for support (class act, hire some Americans) and he said 'cant stop the
 updates' (screw you basically) and tough s*** on the SD card, call THAT company for support, even though MS took something totally working, WITHOUT MY PERMISSION made it NOT work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So over you guys. I am on my way to buy a Mac. When I buy a machine it is mine. You really have the Silicon Valley totalitarian arrogance run wild. Cant wait for the govt to come down on all of you.&nbsp;</p>
