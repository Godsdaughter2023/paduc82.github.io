    <title>Lumia 920 Windows 10 Mobile issues encountered - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sodacycle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 920 Windows 10 Mobile issues encountered</h2>
                    <p>I've had a lot of issues since putting Windows 10 on my Lumia 920. My biggest issue is that typing a text lags severely sometimes with no sound for hitting letters, but here are some of my other issues;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Texts arrive out of order</p>
<p>New texts sometimes won't chime while the message is open</p>
<p>Random black screen while on a call when the phone is nowhere near my face</p>
<p>Can't change individual contact ring or text tones</p>
<p>Alarms failing to make any noise at all</p>
<p>Loading screen when opening messaging app</p>
<p>Deleted Skype messages reappearing in messaging app only minutes after being deleted</p>
<p>Color scheme randomly changing on it's own</p>
<p>Numbers lag when dialing</p>
<p>Messaging app crashing when opening from the toast notification</p>
<p>Cortana forgets that she's setupWeather app isn't auto updating the live tile</p>
<p>Picture backup isn't working even with picture sync when on wifi is enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be quite honest, this feels less like a solid OS and more like the earliest Windows 10 PC builds. I thought that upgrading to the latest insider build might cure some of these issues but so far nothing has changed for me, except for the day I first installed
 the upgrade to 10586.29 my phone went from 100% to dead in an hour in airplane mode. Before and even now I can go from 100% to 20% in around 16hrs with minimal use and 12hrs if I've really been doing stuff on it.</p>

            I tried the 10586.29 update but because of similar issues I dropped back to 8.1.&nbsp; I plan on waiting for the RTM for the 920.&nbsp; I hope it resolves my issues.

    <title>A fix for the MigrationPermanentException error when migrating from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kr15t1n  say:</h3>
<h2>            A fix for the MigrationPermanentException error when migrating from Google Apps to Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I've spent the last day trying to figure out why, all of a sudden, migration batches from Google Apps to Office 365 (via IMAP migration) have started to fail with the following error:</p>
<p><em>MigrationPermanentException: We had trouble signing in to this account. Please confirm that you‎'re using the correct user name and password.</em></p>
<p>I have confirmed, over and over (including password resets) that all credentials are correct. But, then I remember a new "feature" that Google recently auto-enabled (without any information being sent to Google Apps sysadmins about it) that disables "less
 secure" apps to connecting to Google Apps. Changing this settings to "allow less secure apps" resolved the issue. When I re-attempted the migrations that were failing, they now succeeded without issue. No more errors.</p>
<p>So, anyone out there migrating from Google Apps to Office 365 coming across this same issue, I suggest switching this setting to allow less secure apps to connect. There are two places you need to do this. First, in the Google Apps admin console, you need
 to "allow" users to change this setting. Then, (unfortunately), you need to go in, account-by-account (which is really frustrating if you have a large user base) and change this setting on the account level (so, might be best to send out an email to everyone
 with instructions on how to do this).</p>
<p>Why Google thinks Office 365 is a "less secure" app, I have no idea, but hopefully this helps anyone else in the same boat!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Kristin.</p>

<p>When you allowed less secure apps in the admin console and in the user setting did you have to wait for those changes to take effect or were they immediate? I have the same error and made those changes on the Google Admin / Settings side but still run into
 the same error. </p>

<p>The effect wasn't immediate. Once the change was made, on the user's My Account settings page, I had to wait about 10-20 minutes before the changes propagated across the servers—I assume this time could vary. But, you shouldn't have to wait *too* long.</p>
<p>If it makes any difference, I've abandoned Microsoft's built-in migration solution and have gone with third-party software for the migration tasks (as, once I sorted out this error, I ran right into another one). Microsoft's solution, while it worked for
 a handful of my mailboxes, is far too unreliable and is so lacking in all aspects (documentation, progress information, error details, support, etc.), that I just can't trust it for even the most basic migrations.</p>
<p>It's a shame that, with all the people/companies wanting to migrate from Google Apps to Office 365, that they couldn't put together some useful tools to make it as easy as possible for people (not that I was really expecting much from M$).</p>

<p>You should be OK. 2010 was the last version before MS '<em>improved</em>' the license terms in 2013 to allow install on only one machine at a time. Your 2010 pro plus allows you to install on 2 computers at the same time.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for their help.&nbsp; I do have another question though.&nbsp; Just fired up my new desktop PC that came with Windows 10. Installed my MS Office 2016 Plus which is working fine except the ability to print from my HP LaserJet M1212nf MFP printer.
 I found what I thought was the driver for this printer and downloaded it. However, when I try to install it, a box at the bottom of the screen pops up saying its "Installing" but winds up in a continues loop where the blue bar graph goes from left to right
 endlessly.&nbsp; Plus I can't find the printer listed in the printer box when I hit the print button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This shouldn't be that hard !</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions?</p>

<h3> accountingdepartmentwwc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2007- Print duplex</h2>
                    <p>Using a report to generate year end receipts by account. Report currently prints each account on a new page. Line items in each account can vary (as few as one page or as many as several pages). I would like to print duplex but don't know how to be sure
 each account starts on a new sheet/page. (Fred's account can't begin to print on the back of Mary's.) Boils down to multiply pages possible in the "group by" and duplex printing.&nbsp;</p>

            For this you need to include an account group header in the report, with its RepeatSection property set to False (No).&nbsp; At the very top of the group header add a page break control,&nbsp; In the group header's Format event procedure out code like this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [YourPageBreakControl].Visible = (Page Mod 2 = 0)<br />
<br />
If the page on which the group starts is at an even number a page break will be inserted causing a blank page to print and the group to start on the next page, thus ensuring that each group starts on an odd numbered page.<br />
<br />
Note that the 'blank' pages inserted to achieve this will still show any controls in the page header and/or page footer.&nbsp; To avoid the page header controls showing on the blank pages, two account groups, each with a group header, should be created.&nbsp; Put only
 the page break control in the first, and put the code in this section's Format event procedure.&nbsp; Move the page header controls to the second group header, and in the same section put any group header controls you wish to repeat on subsequent pages of the group
 below these.&nbsp; Set this section's RepeatSection property to True (Yes).<br />
<br />
If you have group header controls wish you wish to show only on the first page of a group, you can put these in a third account group header and set its RepeatSection property to False (No).&nbsp; These will be printed below the repeating header controls on the
 first page of the group only.<br />
<br />
Any page footer controls will still print on the blank page, but as these are usually things like page numbers, you might well want this to be the case.<br />

<br />
Although settings should enable Web access, you do need to check with network provider that GPRS is activated.

            <p>Well, that will work.</p>
<p>But it is <strong>NOT NECESSARY.</strong></p>
<p>You're going all around Robin's barn to do something that can be done much more simply: an Append query using the concatenated field. Just because you've learned the "Paste Append" technique doesn't mean that it's the
<em>only</em> technique!</p>
<p>But if it's working for you, and you don't need this table in the future, well... it does work, even if it's not the best way to do what you want.</p>

            <p>Hello Saeed &amp; John,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am going to talk about option B, you need to open any windows PC that have office, open new document, write something in Arabic and make sure that you change the text direction to RTL. Delete the arabic Text. Then Save the file. Then go to your Mac,
 open that blank file using Word, then from the top menu, click file, then Save as Template,&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0899a868-04fe-4ad3-8b5e-ee5d994c16f8" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, every time you want to create Arabic word from your mac, go to file, New From Template</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a476a705-4f28-4cd5-a4a7-e4a987590bb5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Chose Arabic as you see in the above screenshot, then you can write anything you want in the template file without any problem. See below screenshot</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf7996a7-c7e4-44e0-85d4-393274a1dc23" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have Windows PC, I can share with you the template named Arabic, you can copy it and paste it in</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac/Users/xxxx/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content.localized/Templates.localized</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the xxxx is your Mac User name, and&nbsp;UBF8T346G9.Office may change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if I help more in this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi JIM,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your valuable query on our community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, I understand while trying to access the website ‘Classmates.com/Memory Lane’ you get the error
 ‘you are using an unsupported browser’.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you answer few questions to understand the issue well:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were you able to access the page earlier?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined only to this website?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How did you try to open the website, (Classmates.com/Memory Lane or Classmates.com/MemoryLane)?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try to open the webpage in compatibility view.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer and click on Tools.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on View Compatibility settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on add to add your webpage to open in compatibility view.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try to open the link and check.</span></p>

</p><p>I also have this issue but with new account only. I mean any new user account is unable to use IE11. But old user account can use IE11 without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The solution was to update all windows, software, antivirus, etc on the computer.</strong></p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
As per your description, I have understood that IE11 is not working in administrator account while it works in standard and other accounts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It might due to the corrupt user account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To figure out the exact reason, let's try the following steps and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;No add-ons mode</strong></div>
<div>Follow the steps given Below:</div>
<div>a) Press Windows + R, Run Window will open.</div>
<div>b)&nbsp;In Run window type “iexplore -extoff” without quotes and press Enter. </div>
<div>This will start Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode.</div>
<div>Now check if it works fine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If this does not work, follow the next method.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Reset Internet Explorer</strong> </div>
<div>Refer to the link given below for resetting Internet Explorer.</div>
<div><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0563c1">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737/en-us</font></span></a></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Note:</strong>
<font color="#000000"><font><em>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental
 control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</em></font></font><font color="#000000"><em>
</em></font></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><em><font color="#000000">Still if it does not work, try to create&nbsp;a new user account.</font></em></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><font color="#000000"><strong>Method 3:</strong>
</font></span></div>
<div><span>Let’s try to create a new Administrator account and check.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7</a>
<div><br />
If it works fine new user account, then try to transfer the data from old account to the new one:<br />

Try to follow the steps and let us know if it is helpful. </div>

    <title>Linking excel data into a word userfrom listbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oliversloman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linking excel data into a word userfrom listbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi, a warning beforehand,&nbsp;I am using office 2003, but i can upgrade to 2010 if that makes things easier to solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to link an excel spreadsheet with a word userform listbox. I'm very knew to VBA so i will need a bit of help with it but here is what i would like to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a form in word with various text boxes.</li><li>When someone opens the form i would like a userform with a listbox to appear</li><li>From the list box i would like a list of names to dropdown (these names are on column 1 in an excel spreadsheet)</li><li>When they choose a name and click an "OK" command button i would like the textboxes on the form to autofill with information from the spreadsheet that correspond to the chosen name.</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">for example if "Dave" was selected,&nbsp;text box 1 on the form would fill in the name, box 2 the start date, box 3 the annual leave remaining etc, just for Dave:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>Start Date</td>
<td>Annual Leave Remaining (days)</td>
<td>Annual Leave entitlement (days)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Dave</strong></td>
<td><strong>09/01/10</strong></td>
<td><strong>12</strong></td>
<td><strong>32</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>John</td>
<td>08/02/09</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>34</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bobby C</td>
<td>07/03/08</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>32</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li>I would like to just have the names in the list box, i would like the rest of it to link but not be shown in the listbox of the userform</li><li>Finally, if someone updates the excel spreadsheet then&nbsp;I would like this to update the information that gets populated into the textboxes from the userform.</li></ul>
<p>i have the form finished, i the excel spreadsheet, i know how to create a userform. not sure how to get it to pop-up when the document is opened and the rest remains a mystery to me. Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>

            Hi Al:
My name is Ron.

We would need to know exactly which printer make and model and windows you are using to provide explicit steps. And the application.  

In general this feature is controlled by the printer driver. The specific location of the option depends partly on the application, mostly on the specific printer driver.  

For example, in Word 2010 in the print dialog under "Settings" there is a button with "Print One Sided".  If you click on the drop down arrow, you can select 2 sided.

IF that option does not show, just below the printer name there will probably be an option to click on a link called "Printer Properties".  In there, printer specific, there will also probably be another chance to select duplex, 2 sided, printing.       
        </p>

            Hi Al,

Forms are not designed for printing. You should be using a report based on your form instead. When printing the report, the Print dialog should allow you to select double sided if your printer supports it. This is usually selected from the Printer Properties button.

Hope this helps,
Scott&lt;&gt;

<p>Hello Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My bad. I am using actually a report. Since the outcome is called a "form" at the office, I used the wrong term.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What this particular report does is print a single record of a client &nbsp;information.&nbsp;I designed a button for it. All they have to do is to click that button on the record that they bring up via a form. The button on the form calls a report to print the single
 record. At this point there is no way that they can change the printer settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I was wondering if there are printer codes that I can place into my button event procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally got around to playing with your suggested command, I am getting an error message: "the report name "R101" you entered is misspelled or refers to a report that is not open or does not exist."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I placed the line&nbsp; Reports("R101").Printer.Duplex = acPRDPHorizontal under the&nbsp; "Else" portion of the if statement, as the first item, then tried the second and third item positions.&nbsp; &nbsp;It did not work. Being new to VBA, I cannot quite sort out what I am

 But after this the phone just stopped recognising the memory card. Now it does not shows presence of any memory card in the slot. Even nokia PC suit fails ans gives message that 'There is no memory card". Now there is a interesting thing when i put the original
 64 MB card that came with the phone box , the phone instantly recognises it. So i think there is no problem with the memory card slot of the phone. So what can be the problem ? how can i reset the NCP card if i am not able to access it ? Please help.

            I have seen a lot of 6280 where the memory card reader has a mechanical failure leading to the phone not "seeing" the card is in place. I would take it to a CNSP to "checked out". I think the security code is just coincedence!

            I strongly disagree to the fact that the issue is with the phone. Because i have get my phone serviced by a CNSP. But they told me that the Phone is perfect. But the issue is with the card. What I can guess is the card got encrypted with the password that
 I have set. But how to decrypt it to make my card accessible?????

First of all... sorry for my english, I'm Italian,<br />
I know a way to unlock minisd locked.<br />
I had the same problem with it, ther's a mobile (Nokia N70) can unlock your minisd. You only remeber your password. When you put in it, you can see a message sd locked! insert password, after you have to delete psw and insert again your sd in your 6280! it
 works again!!<br />
I hope you understand me and have good luck!

<h2>            use vba to find expired dates</h2>
                    Hi I have a worksheet that i use to track expiration dates of licences.&nbsp; What i would like for it to do is look at all the dates and if it finds a date that is past todays date +7. Is to copy the entire row to a new worksheet called expired. It also would
 be great if the format would be copied too.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1122bdfe-1311-4fda-93c3-f27d432f9522" /><br />

 overwritten making it look like we weren't dealing with dates correctly.&nbsp; Once I made allowances for that, everything went quite well.</p>

<h2>            How to get a file to &#39;remember&#39; the first saved file path only</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am creating a template that will be saved in many possible directories and may get saved more than once in a single folder, as updated. (I've worked out how to get it to save under an updated file name every day so as to give an audit trail if required).
</p>
<p>The file may get e-mailed back and forth (so end up in user directories temporarily) but I want the file to be saved (when required by activating a specific macro) to that first destination folder.</p>
<p>The file may leave the organisation and then come back later &nbsp;- will opening / closing with macros strip out any coding? I think it simply gets "switched off" but cannot remember.</p>
<p>Would something as simple as a For... ...Next loop work? I say 'simple' but I am not sure I could code it in VB - would the count default to zero every time the file is opened?</p>
<p>If the code can be stripped out by opening with macros disabled, would it be better to embed the path (one time only) in the worksheet itself so it could be 'picked up' later on when the file returns to the organisation? I am thinking that it may be better
 to write the macros into personal.xls which I understand is the 'home' (but hidden) worksheet - in which case I think the path would have to be stored somewhere in the sheet rather than in the accompanying macro.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Interesting query, so to deal with the simpler bit first...</p>
<p>The personal workbook is indeed normally hidden, but it is specific to every individual user, so won't travel with the file.</p>
<p>If the file leaves the organisation, then imposing code to be run or interveining with the saving of the file to a specific path&nbsp;could lead to difficulties with your external clients.</p>
<p>I assume that the first destination folder is on a network share, do all users have access to that specific network resource? the path of which could be stored in a hidden sheet of the file.</p>
<p>If the file is to be saved to a specific path and there are multiple versions around in user directories - if they use the save macro how are you distinguishing who has the latest version? or do you control the master version into the master directory?</p>
<p>What purpose is the counter for? the counter could be also be stored in a hidden sheet of the file...</p>
<p>More questions than answers I know, but a clearer defined approach would be required to help further.</p>
<p>I think you will likely need to place some constrained code within the workbook module in the 'open' and 'beforesave'/'beforeclose' events.</p>

            <p>Hi Rik,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The document is to be sent out as a questionnaire and then returned. It doesn't matter when/where it gets saved in the interim: I have created a macro that when run will save to a specific directory - as and when we want it to.</p>
<p>Running it 'before save/close' would apply the macro every time - and you've quite rightly pointed out that it won't work if not attached to the network. By making it run at the user's option, (as intended - i.e., as and when it's back with us on our network
 by button click), then we'll make it save to the network only when we want it to. But getting the user to save the file in a specific location on numerous occasions is inefficient if it can be taken care of automatically with a tailored macro.</p>
<p>The idea is that when the file is first saved off the template, our user will save it in the correct folder for that customer. It'll go to the customer, and back again, etc., etc. Then, when our user next wants a record of progress, he or she will click
 the macro, and it will automatically save itself to that customer's folder. The way in which our folders are constructed is logical, and theoretically you could work out where the file should be saved from knowing the name, etc., but it would take a fantastic
 bit of code because of the variables involved - name length, forenames, surnames, etc. So I figured that simply getting that particular version of the file to remember where it had first been saved, would be a lot easier.</p>
<p>So I want the file to 'remember' to which directory it was first saved and then, as and when the specific macro is engaged, re-save itself to that directory automaticaly.
</p>
<p>There are intended to be multiple instances of the file for different customers in different directories. That's why the path is important - there are thousands of paths and the number of sub-directories/folders involved is why we'd much rather automate.
 The template isn't a 'master' file: it's to be reproduced mulitple times for individual customers each year. The 'counter' is simply a date stamp so that we can track the original issues, and what was resolved when - I don't actually want the file to save
 over itself every time but to generate an audit trail of itself over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps... you, to help me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and regards</p>

            <p>Just some added food for thought, perhaps...</p>
<p>How about setting up a Very Hidden worksheet (this property has to be set in the VB Editor)?&nbsp; Then the first time you save the workbook to the path you don't want to forget, you have your code examine a particular cell on that sheet and if the cell is empty,
 you store the path into it.&nbsp; If it is not empty, you assume that a path was already placed there and don't overwrite it.&nbsp; The code would look something like</p>
<p>If&nbsp;IsEmpty(ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("VeryHidden SheetName").Range("A1")) Then<br />
&nbsp;... put the path into cell A1 on the very hidden sheet<br />
End If</p>
<p>When you get the file(s) back, your code looks in that same location to find the original path?</p>

            <p>Hi J,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your idea seems to deal with the 'for ...next' idea and potentially any issues that the customer might have with macros by inserting the unique information in the worksheet itself rather than as part of the VB accompanying the workbook. (I think some AV
 software settings strip out VB information permanently but I can't remember).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I should be grateful for further input as I still have a long way to go&nbsp;- for instance, what's the best way to get the directory path stored in a cell without the filename as well?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and I have no idea what a 'very hidden worksheet' is (although the name does
<em>seem</em> almost self-explanatory!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and regards,</p>

            <p>I guess I need to ask just how familiar you are with VBA for Excel? Can you get around fairly well within the VB Editor?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set the .Visible property of a worksheet in an Excel workbook to hide it completely from view and to keep it from appearing in the list of sheets that may be unhidden using the Format --&gt; Hide &amp; Unhide --&gt; Unhide Sheet option in Excel:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Go into the VB Editor and make sure that the VBAProject window and the Properties window are open for use.&nbsp; Pressing [Ctrl]+[R] and [Ctrl]+[G] will do that (or they can be selected from the VB Editor [View] menu option).&nbsp; Then if you click on a worksheet
 name in the VBAProperties window you will see the sheet's properties in the [Properties] window.&nbsp; The last property in the list is
<strong>Visible</strong>. Either set the value to 2 or choose "2 - xlSheetVeryHidden" from the dropdown list.</p>
<p>This can also be set/cleared in VBA like this:</p>
<p>Worksheets("Sheet Name Here").Visible = xlSheetVeryHidden<br />
or to make it visible if needed<br />
Worksheets("Sheet Name Here").Visible = xlSheetVisible</p>
<p>To save a workbook's path, once it has been saved to a folder (or opened from a folder, which implies that it was previously saved into it), you can use:</p>
<p>ThisWorkbook.Path&nbsp; which will save the path without the final "\" or its filename.&nbsp; Example, if you had a file saved in C:\Users\Me\Stuff\MoreStuff\mybook.xlsm&nbsp; then what would be returned with Thisworkbook.Path would be&nbsp; C:\Users\Me\Stuff\MoreStuff</p>
<p>Let me test some things and I'll get back to you with a suggestion on the mechanics of saving it to a folder and saving that path to the very hidden sheet without the code being attached.&nbsp; Basically, if you take a file with code in it (a .xlsm file) and
 save it as a .xlsx file, the code gets stripped off of the file.&nbsp; But until you actually close the file while named with the .xlsx extension, the code remains with it, giving you a chance to save it again (somewhere else?) as .xlsm with the code still in it.&nbsp;
 I have to run out for a few hours, so time is limited right this minute, but I'll work on it this evening and post again.</p>

            <p>MikiTin,</p>
<p>I've prepared a fully functional "Questionnaire Management" workbook that you should be able to download from:</p>
<p><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/view.aspx?cid=89A9AA36A708BB1D&amp;resid=89A9AA36A708BB1D%21129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/view.aspx?cid=89A9AA36A708BB1D&amp;resid=89A9AA36A708BB1D%21129</a></p>
<p>You can look through its code to see what all it does, although the basics are provided on the one worksheet in it.&nbsp; If you have any problem downloading it, let me know - I haven't used this often, so sometimes I get the setup wrong.</p>
<p>To use and test it:&nbsp; </p>
<p>Create a new folder just for testing it and put the downloaded file into it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Create a couple of folders under that one to act as customer folders where you might store the questionnaire files as time progresses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Put a copy of your basic questionnaire workbook into that test folder also.&nbsp; Add a worksheet to this test template file named SYS_USE.&nbsp; This will become the 'very hidden' sheet in the future - but you can leave it visible so you can see what gets written
 into cell A1 during the process.&nbsp; Your basic questionnaire workbook will not need any _BeforeSave() or other code to 'remember' the path - that's handled in the code in my workbook, so you might want to remove that code from your template copy before beginning
 testing.</p>
<p>Once you get those files into the top level test folder, open them both and choose the Questionnaire Management workbook to begin experimenting with it.&nbsp; There's a button on the sheet that pretty much does it all.&nbsp; Currently it could even be used to "manage"
 questionnaires as they are returned to you except that I don't have the code in it that you developed to change the workbook name(s) to provide the paper-trail tracking of different copies of ones returned to you.</p>
<p>======</p>
<p>I do want to return to your first post and more directly address a couple of questions you asked about:</p>
<p>"The file may leave the organisation and then come back later - will opening / closing with macros strip out any coding? I think it simply gets "switched off" but cannot remember"</p>
<p>If a workbook contains macros, simply disabling them when the file is opened does not remove them - they just won't be available for use.&nbsp; But if you want to "strip" the VBA code out of a .xlsm workbook, you can save it as a .xlsx file and the code will
 actually physically be removed from that copy of the workbook.</p>
<p>"Would something as simple as a For... ...Next loop work? I say 'simple' but I am not sure I could code it in VB - would the count default to zero every time the file is opened?"</p>
<p>I'm not sure how you'd planned to use the For ... Next loop, but.&nbsp; In VB when you run a macro, all variables are set to a "never been here before" state:&nbsp; numeric variables become zero; string variables become = "" (empty string); boolean values become False;
 etc.&nbsp; VB does not have a way to store a value within the VB code itself from one use of the workbook to the next -- that is, once you close a workbook and reopen it later, everything in VB starts from scratch; only Const values (which by definition cannot
 be changed in the code) retain their defined values.&nbsp; This is why if you want to "remember" anything between workbook usage you have to use some other way of remembering it such as storing the information on a worksheet, or (as Rick Rothstein suggested) creating
 a custom property, or defining a Name in the workbook and assigning it the value you wish to remember, or some other similar method that results in a persistent record of the data.</p>
<p>BTW: Rick mentioned this:</p>
<p>' Elsewhere in your code, you can retrieve this directory this way<br />
Debug.Print ThisWorkbook.CustomDocumentProperties("PrimaryDirectory")<br />
</p>
<p>I'm sure that was a minor slip of the pen on his part.&nbsp; Debug.Print simply prints the value into the Immediate Window of the VB Editor and those values are not available for use by the code.&nbsp; It's a way of showing you what the value is.&nbsp; In the VBA code
 you would do something like this:</p>
<p>Dim previousPath As String</p>
<p>previousPath =&nbsp;ThisWorkbook.CustomDocumentProperties("PrimaryDirectory")<br />
</p>

            <p>JLL,</p>
<p>Can't thank you enough. I can see that you have put a lot of effort into helping me and I am very grateful. Far more than I deserve. This must have taken you ages!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't understand what on Earth you have done!. (My fault, I know). It will take me a while to get my head around it. I understand the basic prinicple: check whether A1 is occupied; if not then drop the path value in. If it is then don't
 do anything. Therefore the first path value will be saved, and then nothing else. It's everything else that you are doing that I don't understand - and there's a lot! (And you've even explained what you've done - but I am a long way behind the curve.)</p>
<p>Thanks also for confirming/refreshing my memory about variables, etc. It's been a long time since I've had to do something this complex. (&gt;10 years).</p>
<p>I realise that you've had to do more work because you don't know our systems and have therefore made the solution more accommodating/flexible than it might otherwise need be.
</p>
<p>If the original template comes from a known (permanent) path, would it be possible to do a macro that will save the file broadly as normal, record the file path, compare it to the template path and, if different, write that path to A1 unless A1 is already
 occupied? Could that not simply be written into "on file save" for the file? The procedure followed by users should ensure that A1 is already occupied before it leaves our organisation because it will aready have been saved at least once to the correct location.
 So if that VB somehow got 'lost' before the return came back, it wouldn't matter because it would already have done its job: the path would be saved in A1 in the workbook.</p>
<p>(Although I do like the sound of storing it as a 'name' - like a named range? - instead of to a cell as that feels more tidy to me. This "Very Hidden Worksheet" caper seems a bit like overkill: I'm perfectly comfortable in the "make it invisible by using
 a white font" fraternity so using named ranges is a quantum leap I'd be very happy with!).</p>
<p>I can see that some of your work is checking that there's more than one workbook open. I am not sure why: I thought personal.xls was always open, "in the backround"? My idea was to get the macro(s) to work and then save&nbsp;them as&nbsp;button(s) on the user's toolbar.
 Then as and when required the user can run the macro sagainst the active workbook. Say one macro would create the entry in A1 if it can't be done using the 'on file save' routine. The other macro (run as and when required) would automatically save to the path
 specified in A1, in the active workbook.</p>
<p>I should stress that I really do appreciate what you've already done and I don't want you to think me ungrateful. I am grateful, just a little bit bemused!</p>
<p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>M</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am concerned you will spend more of your time explaining what you've done. Please don't - you have already done that in the file and I don't want you to feel obliged to do it again. I will get to grips with it over time and as I get to work with it.
</p>
<p>But if you do have time to discuss the specific questions/proposals above, then I shall once again be grateful.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

            <p>M,</p>
<p>I don't have a clear picture of your entire process of how YOUR workbook is handled and what it does or has to do while in the hands of the customers you send it to.&nbsp; But here is my picture of that:</p>
<p>The workbook is sent to various customers outside of your organization and not on your network.</p>
<p>The customers make entries and perhaps choices in that workbook and then send it back to you.&nbsp; I assume that
<strong>no macros are needed for whatever is being done at the customer end</strong> - therefore the workbooks could be sent out as .xlsx files so as to not "alarm" the customer when they receive the workbook for use.</p>
<p>So what I created is a workbook that is a "manager" for the actual questionnaire workbooks.&nbsp; Actually all of the code in it could be placed into your Personal.xlsm workbook, but it doesn't need to be and actually wasn't intended to be put there.&nbsp; I don't
 know how many people "handle" your questionnaire workbooks as they go out/come in, so I created a workbook that could be used by numerous people to handle those questionnaire workbooks.&nbsp; Quite a bit of the code in the long macro is code to do validity testing
 to try to make it as bullet-proof as possible: making sure that the type of file identified to be saved is one of your Questionnaire workbooks (by making sure that the SYS_USE sheet is in it), and similar tests to try to prevent runtime failures of the code.</p>
<p>This is the reason you see the portion of the code that looks for its own name and/or "Personal.xlsm" - it is excluding itself and anyone's personal.xlsm workbook from potential processing.&nbsp; It pulls together all the names of any other open workbooks and
 asks the user if any of those&nbsp;is a&nbsp;questionnaire workbook.&nbsp; As soon as "YES" is indicated then that workbook is then saved to a location that the user picks, and that path is saved in the SYS_USE!A1 location for that particular workbook and that workbook is
 saved in that location.&nbsp; Actually, now that I think about it more it would have probably been better to go through that entire list and save the names of the ones you answer "YES" to and then save them one at a time, asking where to put each.&nbsp; But I envisioned
 that you'd only have one Questionnaire book open at a time.&nbsp; The process would be something like:</p>
<p>Open the Questionnaire Manager [QM]&nbsp;workbook, open the Questionnaire template, choose the QM workbook and click the button and choose where to save it, then close it and perhaps open another Questionnaire book, then use the QM workbook to put a copy of it
 in another location - </p>
<p>OR to open the QM workbook and a returned questionnaire workbook and save it to a location based on the previous location - although I haven't made doing that as easy as it could be at this time.</p>
<p>Now back to your issues/questions:</p>
<p>Yes, if you have created a Personal.xlsm workbook, it is always automatically opened when you open Excel.&nbsp; But each personal.xlsm is unique to each user/system.&nbsp; If more than one person is going to be dealing with these questionnaire workbooks, then:</p>
<p>They all need questionnaire workbook handling code in them, OR<br />
They need access to/a copy of a workbook similar to the one I created, OR<br />
The questionnaire workbook template has to have code to save the first saved-to path built in to it.</p>
<p>The third option means that the questionnaire workbooks are going to have the macro code in them when the customer receives the questionnaire and they may not like that for one or more of several reasons.&nbsp; You certainly cannot be certain that they will use
 the workbook if it has macros in it, and you can be even less certain that they would enable the macros.&nbsp; By not even having any macros at all in those workbooks, you make it more likely they will complete the questionnaire and return it to you.</p>
<p><strong>Second concern.</strong></p>
<p>"If the original template comes from a known (permanent) path, would it be possible to do a macro that will save the file broadly as normal, record the file path, compare it to the template path and, if different, write that path to A1 unless A1 is already
 occupied?"</p>
<p>Yes, if we know where the clean, source template is for the Questionnaire workbooks is stored, we could modify the process to become even less complex: click a button to begin the process and just ask your people where to put the copy; open the clean template
 file, write the path into it somehow, and save the copy with the saved-to path in it in the saved-to location.</p>
<p>Personally, to me, saving it to a very hidden worksheet is a very simple method that has a minimum number of "moving parts" to break.&nbsp; It is less likely to be compromised by some part of the entire workbook file becoming corrupted, as might happen to a 'name'
 within it or a custom property setting.&nbsp; And it is away and out of sight from the end user (your customer) and so they won't easily be able to accidentally overwrite or delete the entry.&nbsp; This could happen if it were simply a white text on white cell entry
 with no protection from accidental erasure/alteration by anyone.&nbsp; As you can see in one point near the actual saving of the QM workbook, the management macro itself can handle making the SYS_USE sheet very hidden, so you and your people don't even have to
 worry about dealing with going into the VB Editor to accomplish that task.</p>
<p><strong>Final comment:</strong></p>
<p>Think of the workbook I prepared kind of as a personal.xlsm workbook that is not so personal, and one that doesn't require permanently adding buttons to anyone's Excel at all - the buttons needed for use are part of that workbook, which you could provide
 to any number of people for use within your organization.&nbsp; By being a separate regular macro-enabled workbook, its features are only made available when needed by opening the QM workbook, not always lurking in the background even when not needed at all.</p>
<p>Feel free to get in touch with me via the email address I intentionally put on the sheet in the QM Workbook.&nbsp; I assume you got the last copy I made available that does have that information on the worksheet in the workbook.</p>
