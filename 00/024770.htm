<h2>            URGENT - Refund and poor customer service&#33;</h2>
                    <div>Hi &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My concern:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I would like your office to check on this matter and refund the renewal fee of Apr 2014 to current to my credit card. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;ordered the Microsoft office Home (one time usage) on the 24/03/2014. However, it was&nbsp;a double purchase; order confirmation #12370729429 and #12370728829. I called the hotline 18008185224 on the 25/03/2014 at 2.30pm (Singapore time) to cancel one of the
 purchase and to STOP THE RENEWAL for the subsequent months on the office that was not cancelled. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lady who spoke to me did the refund of order #12370729429&nbsp;and informed me that it is a one time usage for a month and I do not need to do anything if I do not want to renew. Please&nbsp;retrieve the call log on the 25/03/2014. I used the mobile number of
 986xxxxx. &nbsp; We were shock to realise that the renewal fee has&nbsp;been deducting the fee every month! Please check and refund the renewal fee from Apr 2014 till current and stop deducting for the subsequent months. Thank&nbsp;you. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I had a&nbsp;web chat with <span>Naztassja D</span> on this matter on 30/07/2014. Initially, he mentioned he was SHOCK to see my detailed story of my issue and appears to understand my concern. Yet, after a long chat of 40 mins,
 he&nbsp;then understand my concerns. I have been repeating myself again and again.</div>
<div>Also, he offers to refund only a month of renewal fee when it is a mistake of your company staff who did not process the non renewal?
</div>
<div>My credit card has been deducted for the month of Apr, May, Jun, Jul and I presume Aug 2014 too.</div>
<div>
<p>He said it will broke his rice bowl if he refund? Oh my Goodness, if it is a mistake of Microsoft, definitely he has to escalate to the superior if it is not within his limit. Also, he ended the chat without me agreeing and with the promise&nbsp;that&nbsp;the supervisor
 will call me by 10 mins. It has been days. Yet, not even a call from anyone from the Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Please read through the web chat. I am sure the staff can handle much better in handling my issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, please come back to me on this matter soon. I do not wish to keep dragging this issue!

<h3> imaquila  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 10 Catalog Pages</h2>
                    I'm trying to put together a Booklet that has 17 regular pages and another 14 pages worth of "Catalog Pages".&nbsp; The problem is that&nbsp; although I can use the arrows in the Catalog Tools to view all of the catalog pages, they all use the same two page numbers
 and ONLY those two pages show up in the Pages side bar to the left.&nbsp; What do I need to do to be able to add all 14 pages to my project and with the appropriate page numbers?&nbsp; I tried just inserting blank pages after my catalog pages but instead of my catalog
 filling them, they remain blank.&nbsp; I also tried Merging to New document but I ended up with the same problem..<br />
<br />
I sure hope someone here can instruct me as to how to combine both my non-catalog pages AND ALL of my catalog pages in the same booklet without messing up the numbering..<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            With all of your pages added to the publication. Select the page that starts the catalog pages in the navigation panel. Right click and Insert Section. You can now number the pages in the new section independently of the pages in the first section.<br />

            Thank you so much for your quick response!&nbsp; I did as you suggested and instead of ALL&nbsp; of my catalog pages using either page "20" or "21", it renumbered as ALL&nbsp; left catalog pages "blank numbers" and right catalog pages as page 21.&nbsp; Note: that I opted
 NOT to number the first page. <br />
<br />
&nbsp; I think I wasn't clear.&nbsp; The problem is NOT that I want a separate set of page numbers for the the catalog pages. &nbsp; I just want them to continue numbering with 22, 23, 24, 25 etc.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I appreciate any suggestions you have to share.<br />

                    <p>I trying to do a Vlookup between two worksheets.&nbsp;Both worksheets has duplicate&nbsp;items (For Example:&nbsp;One employee has 2 garnishments so he's on both reports twice with 2 different case numbers and two different deducted amounts).&nbsp;Since I&nbsp;can only us 1 "Col_Index"
 for the deducted amount, it brings over just&nbsp;1 of the garnishment deducted amount&nbsp;(greater number) for both garnishments.&nbsp;It's correct for one&nbsp;of the garnishments but not the other.

<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this so the correct deducted amount to be bought to the correct garnishment.

<p>Instead of VLOOKUP, use SUMIFS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIFS(Garnishment column, Column of names, name, column of case numbers, case number)</p>
<p>
</p><p>like</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIFS(Sheet1!C:C,&nbsp;Sheet1!A:A, A2,&nbsp;Sheet1!B:B, B2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this solution is based on the Garnishments being numbers. If you need to bring over other non-numeric information, then that would require a different type of formula.</p>

AS of now, I lost my 33 dollars AND all contacts.<br />
Can you PLEASE help me regain both my credit and contact list?<br />

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Skype Contacts and Skype Credits is saved on your Skype account. If you sign in to Skype using the correct Skype account, the contacts and Skype
 Credits will show. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In your case, most likely you’re signed in to a different Skype account linked to your email address.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Enter your registered
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">email address here</span></a> to check the correct Skype account that you’re using.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you created your Skype account with a unique Skype Name, always sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address.
</span></p>
</li></ul>

<p>So i was on Yahoo&nbsp; news and i saw a story and Clicked it, it was a video so there was a flash video that should have loaded, but it didnt.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; when i right clicked it said movie not loaded and undeneith it said flashplayer ..(the latest update
 number, 11.1.102 or something).&nbsp; I am sure i have the latest version and my friend even checked it out who has a masters in computer sciences, he had no clue.&nbsp; Is it some thing wrong with flash(most likely not), or is it a firewall or safety or some other
 preferece that is inerfering with the movie?&nbsp; This happens alot by the way!&nbsp; IE9 is my browser</p>

<p>If you're having trouble with watching Yahoo Videos try turning off Tracking Protection. Go to the Menu Bar at the top of IE select Tools 3rd one down uncheck that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also you could turn off ActiveX Filtering as well. go back to the Menu bar, then Tools 4th one down uncheck ActiveX Filtering. See if that helps any.</p>

    <title>Edit running head - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claire bettag  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edit running head</h2>
                    <p>I have a long manuscript with 5 sections. I need running heads that change on the ODD pages within each section. All the MS Word tutorials / manuals say that I do that by going into the header tab and choosing "options" and then either select or deselect
 "same as previous."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find this famous "options" feature. Can someone point me the right direction?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Mac, Yosemite, using MS Word 2011.</p>

<li>On the View menu, choose "Header and Footer".</li><li>A "Header and Footer" tab will appear in the ribbon. &nbsp;Click it to open it.</li><li>In the Options section, ensure that "Different odd and even" is checked in each of your 5 sections. &nbsp;That's what creates the left header and the right header.</li><li>It is normal with a double-sided document to also check "Different first page" because you don't normally want either the left or the right header on the first page of each chapter.</li></ol>
<p>You need to understand the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a word document, all of the section-level formatting such as headers and footers and page size is contained within the section break.</li><li>The section break that controls your section is the one that FOLLOWS the text it controls.</li><li>Each section has up to six headers and footers: First, Left, and Right header, and First, Left, and Right footer.</li><li>When you cluck "Link to previous" you are linking to the previous header or footer OF THIS KIND. &nbsp;So if you enable Same as Previous on a Left header, it will attempt to replicate the LEFT header from the section before the one you are in.</li></ul>
<p>Once you have set this up, you can then choose to have left headers running through all of the document, while the right headers may be different in each section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to copy text out of the body into the header, you can use a StyleRef field. &nbsp;Set the type of text you want to copy (say, a sub-heading) in a style you are not using for any other kind of text (say "Heading 2"). &nbsp;Then insert a StyleRef field in
 your header (Insert&gt;Field...) with a parameter of "Heading 2". &nbsp;Each time a different subheading appears in the document, it will automatically be copied to the header of that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get this working, you really will be a Word Expert :-) &nbsp;Most people can't do headers or footers at all!</p>

<p>Thank you for that long, detailed message. Here's my problem. Your step #3 says: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the Options section, ensure that "Different odd and even" is checked in each of your 5 sections."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It's that "Options" section that I cannot find. I click on the header tab but all I get are 25 different styles for formatting the heading. I don't see "Options" anywhere. So I can't
 get past this step.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>In order to modify the Header &amp; Footer features you must be in the Header/Footer layer in the first place. When active in a Header or Footer the dedicated
<strong>Header and Footer </strong><em>contextual</em> tab will appear on the Ribbon (as John mentioned in step #2). That's where the tools are located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you're going to the Header and Footer presets gallery on the <strong>

            <p>John and Bob,</p>
<p>A zillion thanks. I&nbsp;<em>finally</em> found the purple contextual tab that gives those options. (I kept looking for a tab labeled "options!")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making headway, thanks to you! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have all the running heads for everything working well, EXCEPT for the very end of the manuscript. So now the problem is compounded by those section breaks. I think I understand what you've said about the section being controlled by the break following
 it, etc.&nbsp;But after struggling all weekend I just can't seem to make these sections behave properly: Appendix, followed by Notes, followed by Glossary, followed finally by Index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I figure out how to fix one section I mess up at least one of the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO...let's start with the Notes section...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the "suppress notes" box for all the sections EXCEPT for the Appendix, because that's the section that is supposed to be followed by the endnotes. And it does. But I want the NOTES (endnotes) section to begin a new section, on an odd page (so I
 can set its running head as "notes"). Right now, with "suppress notes" unmarked in the Appendix section, the notes do follow, but on the same page. I cannot get them to start on a new / odd page. Somewhere it was suggested I had to insert a section break&nbsp;<em>after</em>
 the heading "Notes" but the option to insert any section break anywhere in the notes section is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, please!?! and Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>OMG!! I figured it out! It only took three days! (smile / grrrr)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally figured out that the heading "Notes" was INSIDE the endnotes section. That's why I could not insert a section break to force it onto an odd page. So I
</p>
<p>1. suppressed the notes after the Appendix</p>
<p>2. inserted a section break</p>
<p>3. created a section with only the one word "NOTES" on it, styled like the other section heads, but not actually INSIDE the endnotes area</p>
<p>4. inserted a "continuous" section break so the actual endnote section would follow immediately on the same page</p>
<p>5. inserted another section break before "Glossary"</p>
<p>6. inserted another section break before "Index"</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHEW!!!!!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            WhatsApp&#47;WhatsApp Plus is not working in my Nokia X</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using Nokia X since last 3 months. I have downloaded whatsapp, used it. One day an error came, I downloaded WhatsApp Plus. It was working fine till yesterday. I had an updated version of WhatsApp Plus i.e 6.0<br />
I updated it yeasterday itself... aftter updating I used it...then suddenly it stopped working.<br />
<br />
I loved Nokia, always prefered it.<br />
Now I just wanna know, whatsapp is going to work on nokia or not? Or should I accept that its over now for Nokia/Microsoft. Let's move on to Android Phone(The real One) ?<br />
<br />
If there is any method to operate whatsapp, tell me?</p>

            For the working of whatsapp plus, you must contact its developers.<br />
And if you want to know workaround to use whatsapp, check this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/44A54CF0-32F8-4EEA-9D44-E11759131FB7">

<p>thanks for your reply ... i kno whatsapp plus and whatsapp are 2 diff s/w and i guess u are not interested to discuss about whatsapp plus...it's ok ...but it is also an android app... if it is not working in nokia x ...people will post there complain here...<br />
anyway coming to the point, the solution u provided is not working either, i tried it ...<br />
some how i managed to install earlier version of &nbsp;whatsapp and its working now...<br />
for people who are suffering from the same prb can use whats app by this method...</p>
<p>Follow these steps carefully:-<br />
Uninstall your whtsapp if you have installd it. set your system date to 26.04.2014 and restart phone, (unmark "automatic time zone and "automatic network time"), downld whtsapp(from nokia browser) from this link and install,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now select your date to 26.06.2014 restart phone again, now while opening whtsapp you will get message like ‘your whatsapp version is absolete, click on ‘download’ option showing there then select your Nokia browser option (do not click on any other mobile
 market) after download completes go to your download folder and click to install(click on ‘OK’ to allow to replace your previous version of whtsapp) and get register and verify yourself. Now come back to setting turn your actual date and restart phone again.</p>
<p>Now, you can enjoy your whtsapp through fastlane (not from whtsapp icon)</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; if you don’t have any message or notification on your fastlane and u need to open whatsapp immediate go to any contact and click on message and then click on whtsapp to get enter into whtsapp messenger.<br />
<br />
if the message is coming like this "your device is not supported"<br />
one other option:-<br />
after installing all this what i said above.<br />
you can download "whatsapp launcher for nokia x" from Nokia Store.<br />
now by whatsapp launcher u can go to the contact list then select one of your contact...<br />
<br />
enjoy :)</p>

            having watsapp plus+ on nokia x,x+ and xl is very much easier way i find......just some steps<br />
* first install watsapp(official) to you device. fill up all the settings required and register your number..<br />
once you done with it a popup will appear saying that DOESNT SUPPORT TO YOUR DEVICE .....if this appear means you are on right track<br />
* then you need to create a backup of your watsapp(official) in your watsapp settings.<br />
but the problem is that as you will turn on watsapp it will pop unsupported ..<br />
* so to create a backup make an watsapp widget to your screen ..from there try to run watsapp.<br />
OR<br />
tell your any friend to text you on watsapp..<br />
once he text you a notification will appear on your fastlane ..try to run watsapp from there it will definately be working..<br />
*now once watsapp started go to your watsapp settings create backup .<br />
*once backup created uninstall watsapp(official) .<br />
*now install watsapp plus+ ..run it then it will ask you to restore the backup files<br />
so click to restore<br />
once restored it will take few minutes<br />
n here you go watsapp plus on your NOKIA...<br />
just the thing is dont update your watsapp plus<br />
it will run fine no need to update it...<br />
i have done this 2months before and it is running smoothly till now without any issue<br />
:-) :-) enjoy....happy to help you

anyway coming to the point, the solution u provided is not working either, i tried it ...<br />
some how i managed to install earlier version of &nbsp;whatsapp and its working now...<br />
for people who are suffering from the same prb can use whats app by this method...</p>
<p>Follow these steps carefully:-<br />
Uninstall your whtsapp if you have installd it. set your system date to 26.04.2014 and restart phone, (unmark "automatic time zone and "automatic network time"), downld whtsapp(from nokia browser) from this link and install,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now select your date to 26.06.2014 restart phone again, now while opening whtsapp you will get message like ‘your whatsapp version is absolete, click on ‘download’ option showing there then select your
 Nokia browser option (do not click on any other mobile market) after download completes go to your download folder and click to install(click on ‘OK’ to allow to replace your previous version of whtsapp) and get register and verify yourself. Now come back
 to setting turn your actual date and restart phone again.</span></p>
<p>Now, you can enjoy your whtsapp through fastlane (not from whtsapp icon)</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; if you don’t have any message or notification on your fastlane and u need to open whatsapp immediate go to any contact and click on message and then click on whtsapp to get enter into whtsapp messenger.<br />
<br />
if the message is coming like this "your device is not supported"<br />
one other option:-<br />
after installing all this what i said above.<br />
you can download "whatsapp launcher for nokia x" from Nokia Store.<br />
now by whatsapp launcher u can go to the contact list then select one of your contact...<br />
<br />
enjoy :)</p>

<h2>            My site got removed from the bing index</h2>
                    Hi, i have a problem with my website <a href="http://www.dancestar.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">dancestar.org</a><br />
<br />
Bing indexed it a few days ago and it appeared on the search normally, but now it is gone. Why would this happen? Anyone have any ideas?<br />

            The site is now visible in bing search, for some reason it wasn' t a few hours ago, that s why I posted the original question, I thought that maybe for some reason bing removed the site from search index, but everything seems normal now.<br />
<br />
And to answer your question, the site was indexed within 24 hours.<br />

            From my Bing's perspective, your site comes in third (fourth ...?) after&nbsp;<span>dancestar</span><sup>dot</sup>com and dancestar<sup>dot</sup>net. They may simply have better site
 relevance than yours. Of course, this could be a 'grey hat' attempt at a little subtle SEO. My apologies for implying that if I have been presumptuous in your intent.

<h2>            Open Letter To Microsoft</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Dear Microsoft,</span></p>
<p><span>I am a technician of 20 years experience. I must say I am at my wits end with Office and trying to support it for my customers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have just spent 3 hours on the phone trying to sort out a customer who bought and installed Office 2016 HOME AND STUDENT. This automatically deleted their
 copy of Outlook 2013 STAND ALONE.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have a website that states that in this circumstance you will upgrade the standalone copy of Outlook 2013 to Outlook 2016 for free.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I explained this to at least 5 of your customer service staff. After 30 minutes with each one I would be transferred and do the same again. No one could help.
 The last person hung up on me!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How do you expect us sales people and technicians to recommend your product. I don’t make any money from your software you just cost me hours and hours of my
 time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also have a copy of Office 365 5 user licence that will not connect to the microsoft account that was created for it. After 4 hours calling your support with
 no help I gave up and bought the customer a new one. I can’t afford to do this. Your support is atrocious.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In every circumstance where I need to recommend an office product what do I tell customers ??? I cant afford the time to setup microsoft accounts for every customer,
 I cant make up all their details like birthday and security question, I cant stay on the phone for hours at a time to get help with activating or installing your products.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Brad</span></p>
<p><br />

            <p>Here follows my own open letter to Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I am saying this on behalf of many disgruntled PC users. I am not sorry to share with you that I have officially washed my hands of your products. Just this past weekend, I came to my own wits end and physically destroyed my PC. Then I went straight
 to the store and bought a MacBook Air. I have no intention to use any more Microsoft products again. I will be trading in my Surface 3. I am a Sony PS person and will never consider an X-Box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got tired of fighting the excessive updates that take hours to install, often without warning. Even if I preset times for systematic updates (more like daily updates) these updates can still creep up on me during business hours. The computer turns itself
 on in the middle of the night even after being shut down. iTunes is slow and unresponsive. No cloud server seems to sync properly, not even your own OneDrive, which I struggle with syncing between my laptop and my Surface. Overall, Any 2-hour productivity
 session can easily become a fruitless 5-hour fight trying to get your programs to work rather than actually working on the programs. Every session feels like an endless struggle to caulk leaks on a ship that will never leave the harbor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and recently your Office 365 "expired" my account despite my account being a shared one with another paying account holder. I actually spent 4 hours, two of them with one of your customer service reps, trying to fix this mis-sync. He had to remotely
 access my system and couldn't find the solution. The only thing he could advise me was to pay for a new subscription( like that's going to happen in the face of haphazardly developed software). Who in their right mind would buy an additional something that
 didn't work to begin with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst part is my PC was less than 3 years old! When I bought it, it was set on Windows 8, then you guys forced the 10 on us. For the last few years, it has been nothing but update after update. Patch after patch until the system is clogged with all sorts
 of disparate patches no one can sort. I don't use my PC for much save for browsing, Office, and one mid-powered game (once every 3 months). Within the first year of owning this PC, everything slowed down too much, too quickly. Three years is way to short for
 this sort of usage pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you clean up your corporate act and actually start retaining some home-grown reasonably creative talent, I doubt your next ventures will do any better than your Microsft Stores did. Congratulations Micrsoft! You have just become one of Apple's best
 marketers!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's a health to the company and goodbye and joy to thee.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello Everyone! This is my last resort ! (insert Papa Roach song here). Else i will be forced to use another program...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to make calls (international, nation wide, local) for years in the same computer and last week i got the "Called Failed" (it is instant, click on the Call button and instantly i get the failed notification). Tried everything (i did work as an IT for
 years before :P ), nothing worked on the computer i used for years (firewall, anti-virus software, ports, etc.). Then i used a different laptop and normal installation was not working, so i used the "offline installer" and it installed but i get the "Sorry,
 we couldn't connect to Skype" before providing my username (and gave me the crying sad face). Mobile? Logs in in Android but nothing. Is this a new issue? The migration from Skype to Microsoft servers messed up something? I still have Skype credits i would
 like to use!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ok thanks and have an awesome day!</p>

<p>Had the same issue with outgoing calls (even to Echo).</p>
<p>What fixed my problem (Windows OS):</p>
<p>1) Go to 'Network and Sharing Center' (click on your Internet connection icon in the bottom right of your toolbar and click 'Open Network and Sharing Center')</p>
<p>2) Click on 'Internet Options' (shows up in 'See also' in lower left area of that window). Another window pops up.</p>
<p>3) In that new window, click on the 'Advanced' tab in the top bar.</p>
<p>4) Scroll down to the item 'Security'</p>
<p>5) There you see 'Use SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2</p>
<p>6) Make sure all of them are checked.</p>
<p>7) Press 'Apply'&nbsp; then 'Close' and then close the other 'Network and Sharing Center' window.</p>
<p>8) Try Skype again........</p>

<p>This worked for me. I guess Skype uses the settings for Internet Explorer instead of using its own. This isn't an intuitive fix but it did work.</p>

<h2>            IMAP accounts have started creating multiple pst files</h2>
                    My setup:
<div>PC, Vista, Outlook 2010.</div>
<div>Not running Exchange.</div>
<div>I have 6 email accounts, 2 POP, 4 IMAP</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Outlook has just begun creating multiple pst files with 3 of the IMAP accounts.</div>
<div>If I look at the Mail accounts in Ctrl Panel, for example, one of the accounts looks like this:</div>
<div>C:\Users\Tess\...\Microsoft\Outlook\Ciliopathy Alliance(55).pst</div>
<div>The number in brackets indicates the number of pst files now created in a matter of days.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I am unable to send emails from those accounts. I keep getting an "Outlook data file cannot be accessed" error message.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas on how to fix this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            I'd start over with a new mail profile and delete all of the extra IMAP PSTs.&nbsp; I'd reuse any that are fed by POP accounts.

            This tells me that there are either comments or unaccepted  tracked changes in the document.
<br />
<br />You may want to save a copy to preserve these, then accept all changes and delete all comments. These are under the Review tab.

                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are trying to create a macro in Excel 2010 that will download a file from our AS/400.&nbsp; When we record the macro, the steps that we would use (going to Add-Ins, choosing "transfer file from AS/400," then enter the AS/400 library and filename) are not getting
 saved.&nbsp; Is there a way that we can get the macro to save these steps?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>For Excel to 'Talk' to another program in code requires use of something called an API (Application Process Interface). The API in this case would have to be written by AS/400 and Excel VBA could use that. I am not sure if AS/400 is going to have an API
 but you can look into that. Another option would be to write a query against the Database tables of the AS400 system to extract the data you want. This requires an understanding of SQL and access to the AS400 tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case there is no easy solution to this.</p>

    <title>How to get the Classic 2003 menu back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ck7kk12  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get the Classic 2003 menu back</h2>
                    <p>Dear MS,</p>
<p>I want to be able to turn off the ribbon and revert to a 2003 classic menu style.&nbsp; I know the answer is going to be that MS isn't going back to the old menu...get used to the ribbon...it's the future...blah blah blah...</p>
<p>I also know there are paid add-in's you can use as well.&nbsp; I don't think I should have to install a third party add-in to get this basic function back.</p>
<p>Problem isn't just that I don't like the ribbon, which I don't, but there is a real issue here for people that use smaller laptops with smaller screens.&nbsp; I have a 12" screen measured on the diagonal, so the total height of the screen is only about&nbsp;7-7.5
 inches.</p>
<p>So for example, if you are using Outlook 2010 on this smaller screen and then you subtract space fot this huge&nbsp;ribbon, along with reading/zoom bar at the bottom of the screen, and the close/expand/minimize/quick access toolbar at the top of the screeen;
 oh and&nbsp;let's not forget the Windows&nbsp;7 taskbar at the very bottom of the screen.&nbsp;I am then only left with about a 4-4.5" tall reading area. Vey uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have the navigation pane open, your reading area really shrinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose you are going to tell me to toggle the ribbon when I need to use it?&nbsp;That is what I do! It is a pain and&nbsp;we shouldn't have to do it that way.&nbsp;The simple solution is to give us the Office 2003 menu back. The problem is then solved and you will make
 a lot of upset customers happy again.</p>
<p>This is not just an Outlook issue, the ribbon takes up a lot of space on my small screen in all Office 2010 Pro Plus applications.</p>
<p>So for me, it's a real estate issue...&nbsp; I am sure you sit at your desks developing these new features&nbsp;on 22" plus monitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;You probably never considered how the final product might work on a much smaller screen?</p>
<p>I know the ribbon has been a topic in your staff meetings and the argument is that you need to 'force the end-user to use the ribbon or they will never make the change on their own'...&nbsp; I don't like the philosophy, but I get it.&nbsp; Now with that said, it should
 be brought up in the staff meeting that you never considered how much space this monsterous ribbon consumes on a smaller screen and should allow the end-user the option to use the old menu style or the ribbon.</p>
<p>I am sure this is an easy fix? It is probably already built into the product, you just need to let us know how to unlock it?</p>
<p>If you read this and agree, tell MS you want the 2003 style&nbsp;menu back.&nbsp; Sooner or later they will get the hint that we want to be able to choose what menu/ribbon setup works best for our needs.&nbsp;They are smart people, but they don't know everything!</p>
<p>Oh BTW, I am sure somebody will tell me to buy a bigger laptop.&nbsp;Well I would if I could, but I can't, so please just let us have the older style menu back.</p>

<p>Why did you even try to answer this question?&nbsp;You must be&nbsp;running through questions and mailing in ridiculous answers to increase your rating?&nbsp;It does not make you an expert just because you put some random&nbsp;answer on hundreds or thousands of questions.</p>
<p>If you re-read my question, I already stated that I knew the procedure to toggle the freakin' RIBBON.&nbsp; BTW, it's minimize, not minimise and it is not an answer to my question...you just repeated something that I said I was already aware of.</p>

<p>When Gordon says "Minimize the Ribbon" he is referring to the &lt;CTL F1&gt; toggle shortcut. It minimizes the PHAT ribbon GOOEY to show just the tab titles. It is an approximate replica of the old menu.</p>
<p>Use &lt;CTL F1&gt; in combination with the &lt;alt&gt; shortcut. In the old versions you could press and HOLD the &lt;ALT&gt; key as you navigated through the rest of the commands. DO NOT DO THAT ANYMORE. Touch and immediatly RELEASE the &lt;ALT&gt; key to immediately display the
 menu access letters. The as you press the appropriate letter, the shortcut letters for the next level down display. Sure some of the old shortcuts still work. It is trial and error to figure out which are good and which aren't. So it may be better in the long
 run to start learning the new shortcuts. In the old menus, there were a max of I think 19 items in a menu. Now I've counted up to 70 commands in a single Ribbon. No wonder they need 2 characters for many of the shortcuts. I just wish I could have some of whatever
 it was they were on when they assigned the new shortcut letters ... wow, confusing.</p>
<p>That being said, I agree completely. The Ribbon Gooey is too much: too much screen real estate and&nbsp;too much change. 4 years later and I still STRONGLY resent the unilateral decision by MS to throw out all of MY PERSONAL INVESTMENT of time and MONEY in learning
 the Menu UI Shortcuts over the last 20 years. I have my favorites down to muscle memory. I don't have to think about them, they just happen.</p>
<p>Personally I'm still&nbsp;astounded and perplexed that MS didn't provide backward compatibility with the menu. It would have been a trivial effort to create a "menu tab" or an Option to toggle between Ribbon and Menu. That way they could have had the "best of
 both worlds". The new&nbsp;Ribbon for new customers/users, and the old menu for long time "power users". Reverse compatibility has been built in to the very roots of&nbsp;Windows and Office. So why&nbsp;was this change the exception.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the menu and the ribbon are simply shells on top of the underlying command that access the actuall functionality. The underlying commands did not change, VBA still works just fine.</p>
<p>PS: I too hope that selected comments from these discusson forums make it back to the development teams. That is why I too make similar observations and comments.</p>

<p><span>Listen, I am not trying to be a jerk.&nbsp;I am just so damned frustrated by this stupid RIBBON and was hoping for an answer, an answer that would give me what I was looking for. I do
 not want workarounds or shortcuts, although they have their place. I just want the simple option of using either the menu or the ribbon.</span></p>
<p><span>As Rohn007 stated, it is&nbsp;astounding that MS took this approach and "didn't provide backward compatibility with the menu."</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, your answer struck me wrong in my moment of frustration. I was wrong and I "<strong>Apologise</strong>". I just hope MS will see the frustration they are causing with this
 iteration of the Office Suite and provide a fix.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They need to know that change does not&nbsp;equal better.&nbsp;I don't know, maybe we are the ones who need to learn this lesson. I understand they have to keep&nbsp;putting out new products to keep their revenue stream going&nbsp;and I guess the real problem is, we buy into

<p>Although I don't speak for Microsoft, it is well aware of the complaints from some users about the ribbon, but it has now been around since Office 2007 was being developed some four years ago. Office 2010 expanded the use of the ribbon to some of the elements
 (such as Outlook) which previously didn't have it. There are no plans to revert to a menu driven version of Office.</p>
<p>There are third party ribbon modifications out there, as you acknowledge (some of them free) but they do not recreate the menu system. They merely create an illusion of menus from the ribbon tools and frankly get in the way of learning to use the ribbon,
 whilst failing to achieve the 2003 interface which was the intention. My friend Greg Maxey has a free one on his web site -<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Ribbon_Menu_Controls.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Ribbon_Menu_Controls.htm</a> and
 lots of information on editing the ribbon.<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Customize_Ribbon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Customize_Ribbon.htm</a></p>
<p>There is no answer to your problems because what you are asking for is not going to happen. If you want to stick with Microsoft's new product range, you will have to deal with the ribbon.<br />
Or you could install the old Office 2003 that you are familiar with,<br />
Or you could go for something else. Open Office is menu driven. An Office clone it ain't.</p>
<p>FWIW I too hated the ribbon when I came to it and reluctantly adopted it as I provide support for Word, but now, although I have Word 2003 (and 2010 for that matter) on my PC, I rarely use it. I find it easier to work with Word 2007, both as a vba programming
 platform and as a document editor. I have simply edited the ribbon to suit the way I work.</p>

<p>Apology accepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, there is technological&nbsp;life above the 49th parallel. It is too easy to mix spellings.</p>
<p>I can sympathise with frustration (both with the&nbsp;Ribbon Gooey &lt;sic&gt;&nbsp;and this forum). When I first saw your response, my frustrated response was ... .&nbsp; I've been getting&nbsp;other snarky responses from&nbsp;regular posters that have been getting under my skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;But
 why bother continuing a flame war&nbsp; ... it may save on heating expenses &lt;grin&gt;, but ultimately it's not worth the effort.</p>

<h2>            Failing to update to Windows 10 Insider Preview 14316, 0x8024200D</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had trouble installing the latest insider build. The update gets to stage 3/3 and then suddenly starts reverting. Looking in the event viewer I see a WindowsUpdateClient event with the message "Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following
 update with error 0x8024200D: Windows 10 Insider Preview 14316."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just before the installation failed I used to get "Session "ReadyBoot" stopped due to the following error: 0xC0000188" which I resolved by making the log file circular however now I get "Cryptographic Services failed while processing the OnIdentity() call
 in the System Writer Object" which I assume is unrelated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
To get the Preview builds you should be fully activated.
</p><p>
</p><p>If it is then I would suggest that you first update to 10586 using the ISO at the Media Creation Tool or the Tech Bench</p>
<p>Download the ISO put onto your computer and from there run Setup from the ISO.</p>

<h2>            Which is best as input device&#58; Surface Pro 4 versus digital writing pad&#63;</h2>
                    <p>

</p><p><span>Hello,</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I am using OneNote more and more as my main tool for notes / tasks etc. Right now I am using it in combo with a laptop and mouse.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>A lot of time I am using a scanned document where I made some notes with a pen or draw with the mouse on a digital document. This
 is not the best workflow. It would be better to make notes directly on the digital document.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Right now I am thinking about buying a Surface Pro 4 as an input tool because of the nice pen. But the Surface Pro 4 is expensive
 so I was thinking: perhaps I&nbsp;should buy a digital writing pad as input device. Of course this provides less flexibility but it will greatly decrease the costs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Any advice is welcome :-)</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can opt either of these devices to use OneNote. Since you are concerned about the expense, you can go with your own options.&nbsp;Digital Writing pad is&nbsp;like having a tablet PC - except the digital notepad is way more portable and way less expensive. The
 features in OneNote works the same way as it is with Surface Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other queries, feel free to contact us.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Unable to use Outlook to send mail from Endicia Dazzle. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to use Outlook to send mail from Endicia Dazzle.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not sure if it was an upgrade to Office 2010 or what but I'm unable to send my clients tracking info from Dazzle.&nbsp; Dazzle is saying it's a MAPI error from Outlook.&nbsp; I get a message stating: Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client
 cannot fulfil the messaging request.&nbsp; Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.</p>
<p>Of course Outlook is already set as the default mail client.</p>
<p>I then get :"Dazzle was unable to start your email client.&nbsp; You must have a MAPI compatible email client for this feature."</p>
<p>My older Office worked fine with Dazzle.&nbsp; Any info could help.</p>

            Have you checked with the Dazzle folks to see if the version you have is compatible with Outlook 2010?&nbsp; It may require an update.

<h2>            Unable to import table from Web into Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help with the following issue. I'm using Office365 on a Window 10 System. When I tried to export a table from a website onto the excel sheet, I keep having this error when choosing web view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"T<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">able Highlighting is disabled because</span><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">&nbsp;this
 page uses Internet Explore's Compatibility Mode."</span></p>
<p>The website in question is this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Any kind soul would be able to help? Been trying for a few days. Only able to extract the other table and not this table. I've tried it on Excel 2016 and it was working perfectly. Just not working on Excel365. Viewed it on IE without any issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Did you recently install Office or an update to Excel? Excel 365 and Excel 2016 are the same thing. Office 365 is a subscription to the latest Office apps, which right now includes Excel 2016. 
<br />
<br />There has been a problem with the latest updates which may be affecting you. I’d check for updates. You could also try doing a repair.

<p><span>Where did you purchase Office 2003?</span></p>
<p><span>To install any Office program on a computer, make sure you do not have any other version of Office pre-installed. If there are any
 versions of Office pre-installed, you have to uninstall it before installing.</span></p>
<p><span>Office Standard 2003 and Office Student and teacher 2003 contain the same applications, hence you can install it without issues.</span></p>
