<h2>            Using pictures in a excel document</h2>
                    I have embedded a picture in a cell and after saving the file, when I opened it again, the picture shows as a red cross. Why?

</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>From the problem description it looks like a picture embedded in an Excel file does not show properly and comes up as a Red X.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>These mostly happen, if you add a link to a picture that is located on a Web site, the next time that you open the file, the picture
 is displayed as a red X. This occurs because the application does not recognize the Web site path.
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>To work around this issue, on the Web site, copy the image, and then paste it into the Office for Mac application.</font></font></font></p>

            How did you insert the picture? Where was the picture file when you inserted the picture? When you inserted the picture, did you take the default, or did you choose to Link to the picture file? What file format did you use to save the workbook?

<p>
</p><p>I am seeing the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting etc. does nothing. I am loathe to delete/re-install Outlook, since my work email obviously has plenty of data, and don't want to have to set-up and download all of that again, if I can avoid it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Irony &gt; I did message the Support team in the Outlook app, and they seemingly replied. Rather, I saw the notification flash up, but when opening Outlook, the message was gone. Not there fault, seems my company's IT department have been too combative against
 possible spammers/junk/phising mails, and quite a bit a few messages are being yanked server-side, before I can read them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, the condition seems to be affecting my Fantastical widget as well, so not necessarily an Outlook issue only - it just appears to manifest worse in the Outlook widget. As in, I can see the Fantastical data, unless I tap on it - and am then often
 met with the same message. BUT - if I refresh the Fantastical data, it returns and is visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Outlook widget, if I tap once on the Outlook part at the top, it refreshes the data briefly, before returning the "Unable to Load" message. Nothing I do to refresh the data in the widget changes anything, the message remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: This is NOT happening on my 12.9" iPad Pro - there both Outlook and Fanstatical's widgets are working as expected.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Running iOS 11.2.6 on both iPhone 8+ and iPad Pro, but Outlook is on v 2.65.0 on the iPad (where all is working), and 2.66.0 on the iPhone, where the widget is broken.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi EruditeProfundity,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, this problem only occurs on version 2.66.0 on your iPhone 8+. It works will on version 2.65.0 on the iPad.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the problem is related to the Outlook for IOS application, and you have contacted our Outlook for IOS in-app support for help, we recommend that you keep contacting them for assistance. Based on what we know, this issue is related to the Outlook for
 IOS application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you can try to clear the browser's cache on your iPhone 8+, just as Shyamal mentioned in the previous thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and understanding.</p>
<p>Barry</p>

<h2>            Text messages just dissapearing</h2>
                    hi<br />
I have a nokia 6500 classic its worked fine but untill about a month ago its started almost with every text.<br />
When a text comes in most of the time it has "some text missing" what will happen is it will either 'update' the text and it will all appear or it will be recieved as another text.<br />
If it is recieved through another text the first half of the text dissapears even if i dont open the second half. this is most fustrating cause most of the time the second half only contains a few words.<br />
The second half can come in straight after or 10mins after, either way the first half always dissapears.<br />
I am on the optus network in australia.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if this is a problem with the phone or a setting turned off or something<br />
or a network problem<br />
<br />
thanks

            Sometimes I receive messages like you. But now it seems that they update immediately or in a few seconds. It's not frustrating like to get separate messages.<br />
Yeah and it happens only with those longer than 160 characters.<br />

                    We have several company word documents that were created in Word 2003. Now we have word 2010 and the colors are off when we print. If we open the document in 2003 and print the colors of the document are fine. If we print the same doc from 2010, all of

Go to the Printer manufacturer's web site and make sure that you have latest version of the Printer Driver.

<br />
If the above doesn’t help, please help answer a&nbsp;few queries below.<br />
1. Did all users have the same issue?<br />
2. Try OWA <a href="http://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>I have set up a web page that a user automatically goes to when they start IE by&nbsp;making it the default home page. But, when they get there, they have to enter a userid and password. These are trusted users in a secure env and I don't want them to have to
 enter the userid and password they use. The screen comes up and wants this filled in. If I fill it in how can I save it that way, OR, is there a way when this page&nbsp;is started to have&nbsp;these parameters&nbsp;passed to it?

    <title>nokia lumia 1520 - problem with microphone on phone calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jkiy  say:</h3>
<h2>            nokia lumia 1520 - problem with microphone on phone calls</h2>
                    My Nokia Lumia 1520 also has the same problem with Mic, caller can't hear my sound. It works when speaker is switched on or on bluetooth or headsets. From various chat forums,it seems many are facing this problem. Service centre visit also did not help.
 Surprisingly could not find any solution being spelled by Microsoft also. This anyways does not help Microsoft in their reputation . Otherwise I find the phone a very good one. Looking for a solution urgently. Can anyone or Microsoft please advice.

jkiy</a>. Before you have considered sending the phone for repair, were you able to check if this issue happens w/ a specific number on outgoing or incoming calls? How about recording a clip, and playing it? This will test your microphone and speaker capabilities
 in one go. BTW, is your phone up to date? Can we have its latest OS and Firmware version? We'll wait for your reply.

            <p>Thanks for the mail. I checked and the issue exist for all incoming and outgoing calls. And the case remain same for all numbers and not specific to one or few numbers. I did check by recording the voice and it works well. I did update my OS and checked
 the firmware and shows up to date. When I checked with the app Firmware update check' it shows Firmware up to date and OS is preview version of Windows. I don't know why so, as I updated OS through app 'Windows upgrade'. I upgraded through this app as the
 service center has reverted me to 8.1 and therefore could not upgrade through setting menu. If I have to change from preview version , please advice how to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>windows version- 10.0.10586.318</p>
<p>Firmware version - 02540.00019.15236.45004</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, when I visited&nbsp; the service center they said they don't have the spare and it will take about 2 weeks to come and said they will change a sub board with mic. It was their instant response and not sure if it is a diagnosed solution or trial
 and error method. I already paid advance for the spare also. As on recording&nbsp;mic is working fine, am not convinced that they changing the mic board will solve the issue. But currently I have no choice other than going by their advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the spare is not there, am using the phone now with a bluetooth device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An early advice will be highly appreciated</p>

            <p>Prior to this week, I had been running my semi recently repaired 1520 on WI-FI for tablety use. &nbsp;The "hey cortana" command was a real cool function that I was using. &nbsp;A couple of days after inserting the micro sd and the nano sim I noticed that I could answer
 a call and be heard with out being on speaker phone. &nbsp;Additionally I noticed that the "hey cortana" function or words being displayed in the cortana command line went "byebye" not to mention no answers or search results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting ready to pull the micro sd and sim out and see if the thing communicates verbally with cortana again.</p>

<p>For anyone who had their phone mic stop working after installation of a new screen, I've found out why this happened in my case. I tried all of the solutions in multiple forums and got nowhere. Cortana worked but I literally had to yell into the very small
 microphone slot that's at the bottom of the display. I had a look at my old screen and saw where the mic fit against a small black seal pad that matches up with the mic slot on the front. All looked normal there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then looked at my new screen and discovered a small blob of adhesive that perfectly plugged the hole in the black seal pad for the mic. With a very small flat screwdriver, I was able to scrape off the blob of adhesive. I reassembled everything and now
 my phone mic works again. I bought a good quality screen from an OEM supplier but obviously, they missed this quality problem.

<p>Look for the FOUND folder in your memory card. Delete it. Recopy your music from your PC to your memory card via mass storage mode. Overwrite all your music files in there, or better yet, delete all of them, refresh music library, then transfer the songs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above does not work, I'm afraid you'll have to format your card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For future issues, I would advice you to get hold of a third party backup software, like the ones included in Norton 360 and BitDefender Total Security, you can use them to fully back up your memory card. Do this when your memory card is functioning perfectly
 and do so regularly, so when you need to format the card, you have a backup. This would include all of your installed apps on the card AFAIK.</p>

<h3> josh g78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Open Files</h2>
                    <p>New computer running IE 10 and Windows 8.&nbsp; I can't open files from the internet.&nbsp; If it is a pdf or word doc for example and I click the file the yellow bar pops up at the bottom of the scree with options to open save or cancel.&nbsp; When I click any of those
 choices it just does nothing.&nbsp; I can't even x out of the yellow bar, I have to close out IE and open an new window and start over.&nbsp; Very frustrating given how much I just spent on all this.&nbsp; Here is what I have tried with no success already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disabled Norton anti virus.</p>
<p>Set all security levels to default.</p>
<p>Disabled add ons.</p>
<p>Posted ? on forums but no answers came back that worked.</p>
<p>Doesn't work from desktop mode or tile screen version mode.</p>

            <p>I have had similar problems opening .pdf files and, while I still haven't figured out what causes it, I have found a way to open the files.&nbsp; Two ways in fact.&nbsp; May not work for you but give it a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are in the METRO screen and you try to open a .pdf and nothing happens...right click on the blank screen and close the blank tab at the top.&nbsp; You will then see your form, document, etc&nbsp;&nbsp;with two blue boxes at the bottom..........
<em>open</em> and <em>download</em> .&nbsp;When you click "open" it will shift you to the desktop and open with
<strong>Adobe Reader XI</strong>.&nbsp; If you don't have this reader on your desktop download it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way I found to open an ornery .pdf is to right click the Metro screen and select "View on the Desktop" (wrench icon on bottom taskbar).&nbsp; Once you get the file to the Desktop it always opens.</p>

<h2>            All videos in modern IE 11 are lagging heavily</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a problem with modern Internet Explorer 11: all videos (youtube, engadget embedded&nbsp;videos, from Microsoft pages...&nbsp;literally all)&nbsp;are freezing, lagging, squares appears from time to time.&nbsp;It is irritating and makes it impossible to use IE for watching
 videos. Important: desktop versions of browsers are working fine (IE and Chrome).&nbsp;It is somehow related&nbsp;to modern apps only. By the way, I also have strange problem with Skype:&nbsp;it does not recognize my camera anymore&nbsp;(Surface pro 2 internal camera). In camera
 app it is working perfectly.&nbsp;On Skype forum, after checking my dxdiag.log,&nbsp;moderator said that it looks like a&nbsp;problem with directx, despite dxdiag says it is&nbsp;fine.&nbsp;But in windows 8.1 there is no way to reinstall or repair directx!!!! Maybe these two problems
 are related and there is some problem&nbsp;in directx and modern apps. Anybody, please help. With these problems my surface pro performance feels worse than my old PC where I left windows XP to leave it compatible with old scientific hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. All updates are installed. I tried to find ifixit for internet explorer problems, but it says that there is none for my windows version (Windows 8.1 x64).

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the reply and update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may run the SFC scannow tool and restart the computer to check if the issue persists. SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with
 the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary. Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to these steps to perform a SFC scan:</span></span></p>
<p><span>a) Press
<strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, select <strong><em>Command prompt (Admin)</em></strong> to bring up elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the command prompt type the following command:
<strong><em>sfc<span>&nbsp; </span>/scannow</em></strong> and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c) After the scan, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span>

                    Hey Peeps,<br />
<br />
I have been waiting for a version of PC suite to be released that will support x64 for ages. I have just downloaded it and tried to connect my phone via infared. My computer recognises that the phone is connected but the software won't connect to the phone.<br />

Is it that the software is only partially compatible with the x64 OS? Anyone any ideas or had the same problem (and ideally solved it).<br />

<br />
Control Panel -&gt; Wireless link -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Properties -&gt; Advanced One of the options in there should be max connect rate or speed limit, somit like that anyway. The max the phone works at i believe is 115.2kbps

<h2>            Duplicate Emails In Outlook 2003 from Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I setup my outlook.com email in outlook 2003. I selected leave a copy of the message on the server because when I travel I need the emails on the webmail. Outlook 2003 downloads all the messages in the inbox about every 5 minutes, not
 just the new ones. How come outlook 2003 cannot differentiate the duplicate emails which it has already downloaded from outlook.com? how is this problem fixed?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as an FYI, my outlook.com email is also setup on my blackberry and works well. No duplicates there.</p>

            <p>Hi AC119,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me help you with your concern regarding your duplicate emails in Outlook 2003. There is a possibility that you are using an outdated Outlook Hotmail connector. With Microsoft Outlook Hotmail Connector 32-bit, you can use Microsoft Office Outlook 2003,
 Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 or Microsoft Office Outlook 2010 to access and manage your Microsoft Windows Live Hotmail or Microsoft Office Live Mail accounts, including e-mail messages, contacts and calendars for free! You can download the latest update from
 this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.&nbsp;You can also try to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">re-establish the connection of your email account by removing the account and adding it again. There is a possibility that
 your account is out of sync with the server. </span>If the issue persists don't hesitate to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for not being able to respond sooner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are correct, please try to reconfigure your account on Outlook 2003 and check if this resolves the issue. You can check this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/outlook-connector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> on how to add your account to Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If reconfiguring the account does not work, we recommend that you post this question on the Office forums page since moderators there can best answer your question. You can click on this

<h2>            Excel Crashing when I try to &#34;add data&#34; to a graph</h2>
                    <p>This specifically happens when I try to CTRL+Click on data to add to a graph in Excel. This happens on multiple machines all have been updated and work properly otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally it is worth noting there are no add-ons of any kind active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also booted Excel into safemode and it works without issue. It also will continue to work after being booted up normally without a problem for a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my steps are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Click "design"&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Add data</p>
<p>-ctrl +click on data within another sheet in the same excel file&nbsp;</p>
<p>-excel crashes and restarts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple machines, different graphs, same problem.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi there, 
<br />
<br />Sounds like a very interesting issue you're facing. Have you tried rolling back the most recent update on one of the machines to see if it changes?
<br />
<br />Are each of the machines similar in hardware?  A colleague of mine had a similar issue, though it was only 1 machine, and turned out to be a registry key for the Video drivers oddly enough.

            Can you try to start your computer in clean boot mode and see whether this finds any program conflicting with this? This may take some time for you to test as you are saying that this works for some time after restarting.
<br />
<br />Refer to the link below to know how to start the computer in clean boot
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />Click on the link How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot and follow the steps
<br />Note: Ensure to restart the computer in normal mode once troubleshooting is completed.

            Thanks for the reply. I have checked the doc and still the issue occurs. We are up to date, no add-ins, no interference from the anti-virus, there isn't an issue with any of the formulas as it works on some machines just not others. Has anyone else run
 into this issue? This happens on 64 and 32 bit versions.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Eric!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems to be happening with multiple machines of varying model but they are all the same make. They are Lenovo. With that being said I work using a Razer Blade as my work machine and I do not have the issue. This does lead me to believe it could
 potentially be related to the video drivers so I am updating them. I'll update everyone if that turns out to be the case.&nbsp;</p>

            Looks like the issue persists after updating the display drivers as well. I tried it on an MSI laptop and had the same issue. What is really strange is that it works on some machines not all. Same amount of ram, same processing power same version of Windows
 and fully updated. This issue has me truly stumped. I have even reinstalled office on a test machine and the issue persists.&nbsp;

            Because Excel can perform this function when I run the&nbsp;<strong>application</strong> in safe mode does anyone have any ideas what this may be preventing from interfering considering we do not have any add-ins running at all?&nbsp;

SandipanDhani</a>. <span>Restart your phone by pressing and holding the Power and Volume Down keys simultaneously for 10-15 seconds. Release the keys and the phone will restart. After this operation, you may need to set the date and time on the phone.
 Once it's ready, try to install the update again. Tell us the result. ^_^</span></p>

            I am having the same &nbsp;issue with my Lumia 640XL when I got into Settings &gt; Phone Updates. It will download fine, do the install before rebooting, then when the actual install occurs the gears turn but the progress bar gets stuck very early, then after
 a few minutes the phone reboots and I get the same message Sandiphan gets.

raholco</a>. Are you connected to a stable internet connection? Did you download/install any prior to this issue? In the meantime, try performing a hard reset by going to
<strong>Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone</strong>. Ensure that you have backed up all of your files to avoid data loss. Let us know the outcome.

                    <p>I get the following error: The changes you requested to the table were not successful because they would create duplicate values in the index, primary key, or relationships. Change the data in the field or fields thaat contain duplicate data, remove the
 index or redefine the index to permit duplicate entries and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have two tables the main&nbsp;table:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;tblBrgAudits</strong></p>
<p>BrgAuditID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AutoNumber&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary Key&nbsp; YES&nbsp; Unique&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YES</p>

<p>BrgWKNumber&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text</p>
<p>BrgDate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date/Time</p>
<p>BrgName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>tblOuterDm</strong></p>
<p>IDOuterDm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AutoNumber&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>BrgAuditID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number</p>
<p>ODtype&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text</p>
<p>OuterDm1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number</p>
<p>OuterDm2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I need is to open a form created from tblBrgAudits to enetr basic details and have a subform tblOuterDm to enter&nbsp; values. So the subform will always have several rows of data to one record of the main form. So I need theses set of records to be attached
 to the BrgAuditID. But the ODType can be used often. Like I can do and audit on a ODType for 22211E today and do another tomorrow so i need to be able to enter this type again but on a new BrgAuditID?</p>
<p>I hope I have made some sense of this for you?</p>

<h2>            Putting &#40;or imitating&#41; MS RIBBON filter icon on form</h2>
                    <p>I imagine this is easy if you know.<br />
<br />
My form works well using the FILTER ICON in the top ACCESS RIBBON, but it would be easier and more elegant if I could just MOVE this filter onto the form itself (or duplicate its function).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I found an explanation somewhere on the internet, but can't get it to work. There was this
 code, but something is clearly missing.<br />
<br />
</span>Private Sub Command2211_Click()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;'????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdFilterMenu<br />
</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the missing code supposed to POINT to the field on which teh search is to be made? But that field is the one with the CURSOR in when you use the ACCESS funnel at the top.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Basically, I want the funnel symbol on MY form to function exactly as it does on the MS ribbon.
 In an ideal world, you'd just be able to seize and move it, but you can't!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Is there an easy answer? The source where I found the above code said you had to "set focus",
 but there is NO set focus command in the menu, only On Got Focus and Lost Focus.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Finally, is there a fairly simple manual that explains the use and function of the various
 comments under "event"? Most of them are a mystery!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Thanks</span></p>

            <p>What Ken posted should work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you using the Ribbon filter, then the user may well not have entered the cursor into the column you want to filter on – so using previous control may well not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest if your form is like this:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34d7b3fc-22db-4fd5-81d6-2c6b43d49738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34d7b3fc-22db-4fd5-81d6-2c6b43d49738" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then to filter on say lastname, use this code behind the filter button:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Lastname.SetFocus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdFilterMenu</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the resulting form will show this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Works perfectly. Thanks. I was missing the "Screen.PreviousControl.SetFocus" code. Obviously, I have to learn these things. I will check out your suggestion for doing so.<br />
<br />
My application works fine except for one last thing. ALL records can be marked as "favourite" by different users by typing their user code and number 1 into two fields (I will deal with the option of having a grading 1 to 5 later!)<br />
<br />
However, when filtering this in a combo box I get ALL the favourites of ALL users and not just those relating to a particular user. That makes sense, because the combo box is not linked to a particular user; there is currently no way of filtering favourites
 for a particular user and I have no idea how to do this.Well, as usual there is probably a way!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks again for the "filter on form" tip. A BIG advantage of this is that a popup I designed to open on clicking for a particular record can now go right to the top of the screen instead of me having to leave space to see the MS filter icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy your Sunday!</p>

            For future reference please do not introduce a different topic into an existing thread, but start a new thread in which the problem is explained in detail.&nbsp; If you need to refer to another thread include a hyperlink to it.<br />
<br />
To restrict the filter to the current user's favourites you would need to filter not only on the Favourite column, but also on the UserID, in a Boolean AND operation.&nbsp; However, I'm unclear about which table the form is based on.&nbsp; As I explained in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_access-msoffice_custom/access-filter-main-form-by-an-entry-on-linked/198fdc48-a83e-470c-838e-b91e5042e6e3">
your other thread</a>, if there is a many-to-many relationship type between users and favourites, as seems to be the case, this needs to be modelled by a separate table which resolves the many-to-many relationship type into separate one-to-many relationship
 types.&nbsp; In your other thread this was your Links table on which a subform was based.<br />
<br />
It would help if you were to post details of your model as an image of the database's relationship window, setting out the tables so that all their columns are visible, and the relationships between them are clear.&nbsp; The image below is from one of my online
 demo files, as an example.&nbsp; It models a simple ternary (3-way) many-to-many relationship type between students, courses and&nbsp; statuses:<br />

            <p>Thank you.<br />
<br />
Image 1 shows my three tables. Image 2 shows the combo box where the user inserts his or her teacher code to indicate a preference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works, By some miracle, when I enter a code in the userid field new record is automatically inserted into the "favs" table, and the user can also enter 1 to 5 if required, though it defaults to 1.<br />
<br />
So that part works.<br />
<br />
What doesn't work is a combo field to filter the items table (which has all the worksheets) by filtering the "favs" table by user. I managed to get it to filter favourites for ALL users, but not for individual ones.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I tried to rename all fields to lower case as you suggested but when I ran "Compact and Repair Database" it reset them to UPPER, so I gave up since it all seems to work as it is.</p>

            Before examining the question of filtering we need to consider the model.<br />
<br />
Can you explain the structure of your Items table?&nbsp; Why does it have a composite primary key?&nbsp; What do the columns F1, F2 and F3 represent?&nbsp; At first glance the assumption would be that these represent three instances of the same attribute, which would mean
 that the table is not normalized to First Normal Form.<br />
<br />
I would have expected the Items table to have a single column primary key ItemID, which would then be referenced by ItemID in Favs as part of the resolution of the many-to-many relationship type between Items and Users into two one-to-many relationship types.&nbsp;
 The PIC column in Favs would thus be redundant.<br />
<br />
Why is the FAV column in Favs a part of its primary key?&nbsp; Surely this is a non-key attribute by which each favourite item per user is 'ranked' 1 to 5.<br />

            <p>All my files are in a folder named "db" and individual worksheets are organised into numbered subfolders according to their category, So the path:<br />
<br />
d:/db/1/3/4/InThePark.pdf</p>
<p>
</p><p>is the location of a worksheet about activities in the park which is located in folder 4 of several folders in folder 3 of folder 1 of the root folder 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>F1 is the root folder in "db", F2 the first subfolder and F3 the second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tha rationale is to group worksheets together. For example: a fiworksheet based on the contrast between the past continuous and simple past (I was walking down the street when I fell over a bananaskin." would be in<br />
<br />
tenses = folder z:/db/1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>then past; z:/db/1/2</p>
<p>
</p><p>then mixed tenses = z:/db/1/2/1</p>
<p>
</p><p>alternatively explained:<br />
<br />
db:/1 = tenses</p>
<p>
</p><p>db:/1/1 = tenses present</p>
<p>db:/1/1/1 = tenses/present/present continuous</p>
<p>db:/1/1/2 = tenses present/present simple</p>
<p>db:/1/1/3 = tenses/present/mixed</p>
<p>
</p><p>and so on</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made them a composite key because it was the only way I found to get forms to show the files in the folder order. There is a command in the "Properties" sheet of forms which says "ORDER and than asks if you want it to "ORDER ON LOAD", but it doesn't work
 for me, even with the right square brackets, As it is now set up, it works, so whenever I click "REMOVE ALL FILTERS" all records are displayed in logical order. Also, when filtering each folder or subfolder, the order is preserved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the "items" table is keyed with an autonumber it will order by that number, which will not be in true sequence I would prefer when records are displayed. But I don't mind how it is done if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having each category of worksheet in a separate folder means that users can filter for a particular group of worksheets and thus look only at those sheets relating to a particular linguistic area. (tenses, lexical, games, problems, discussion topics, modal
 verbs and so on)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The FAV column being keyed does look redundant; I will remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to be so amateurish, As it stands, it all works well except for this last problem: users can enter their preferences and these are entered into the table called "favs", but for the moment I am unable to allow them to filter their own preferences to
 be viewable on the form. I can PRINT their preferences since it is easy to make a query where they enter their user number - but I can't do the equvalent on the main "items" form.</p>

            This is not good relational database design.&nbsp; Hierarchical structures such as your folder structure, and the underlying topic classifications which this represents, should be modelled as separate tables, one for each level of the hierarchy.&nbsp; Each table,
 bar that which represents the topmost level of the hierarchy, includes a foreign key which references the primary key of the next level above it in the hierarchy.&nbsp; The referencing table, Items in your case, should include a foreign key which references only
 the primary key of the lowest level in the hierarchy.<br />
<br />
You'll find a simple example of this in DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file follow the link to 'Bringing the model together'.&nbsp; You'll see that in the Contacts table, only a CityID foreign key column is included to map each row to the full location data of cities, regions and counties via the hierarchical chain
 of relationships.&nbsp; Consequently there is no redundancy, which would have been the case if all three has been referenced by columns in Contacts.&nbsp; The risk of update anomalies is thus eliminated.<br />
<br />
If you move on a couple of forms you'll find a form which illustrates how the location data is inserted into the Contacts table by selecting first a country, then a region and finally a city in three correlated combo boxes, only the last of which is bound.<br />
<br />
In the next form, which illustrates how to retrieve data from the database, you'll see that the report which is opened when a search is made in the form, brings the data from the referenced Cities, Regions and Countries tables together in a query's result table.<br />
<br />
Note, incidentally, how the two combo boxes on the right of the form allow the report to be filtered on the combined city and employer values selected in the controls, in addition to being filtered on only one or neither of the two.&nbsp; This is done by referencing
 the controls as parameters in the report's query.<br />

            <p>Thank you for this answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and opened the link to "Database Basics" but a message tells me that a link or reference to "Testbed.accdb" is missing, and I can't see that among the db files listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must confess to being confused about my db structure. I have around 1,000 files in about 20 categories, each with up to two sub-categories. All the files are shown/acccessed through an Access "webbrowser" field. The table "items" holds no data at all,
 only links to the data.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The other tables in the application are: </p>
<p>
</p><p>"users"</p>
<p>"favs": showing users and their favourite files</p>
<p>"folders": a list of folder and sub-folder titles (for user information when required)</p>
<p>"levels" - the language level appropriate for each worksheet</p>
<p>"formats" - a table showing the format of each file (worksheet, picture sheet, gap-filling, image and so on)</p>
<p>"books" - a list of the abbreviations and full titles if a worksheet is associated with a particular book</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main "items" table includes a field to enter a code for each of the last three elements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can see, there is no redundancy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it all works perfectly except for not being able to filter a user's individual preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I will read the information in "Database Basics" to try to understand all this better.</p>
<p>

            I've no idea how that reference came to exist in the file.&nbsp; You can remove it by selecting References in the Tools menu on the VBA menu bar, and then deselecting the reference.&nbsp; I've uploaded a new copy of the file to OneDrive, without the reference.<br />
<br />
As regards the model. It's important to bear in mind that this is what a relational database is; a model of that part of the real world with which the database is concerned, in terms of its entity types, the attributes of those entity types, and the relationships
 between entity types.&nbsp; So the first step is to define the referenced entity types which make up the reality to be modelled, and which will need to be related.&nbsp; In your case these are Users, Folders, ParentFolders, BaseFolders, Files, Levels, Formats, Books.&nbsp;
 Each of these is represented by a table whose columns represents attributes of the entity type which are functionally determined solely by the whole of the primary key of the table (see the Normalization demo in my OneDrive folder for more on this).&nbsp; Note
 that I've not included Favourites; I'll come back to those.<br />
<br />
Next, what are the relationship types between the above entity types? As a file can only be in one folder, there is a one-to-many relationship type between Folders and Files.&nbsp; Similarly there is a one-to-many relationship type between ParentFolders and Folders,
 and a one-to-many relationship type between BaseFolders and ParentFolders.&nbsp; There is consequently a simple liner hierarchy like this:<br />
<br />
Files&gt;----Folders&gt;----ParentFolders&gt;---BaseFolders<br />
<br />
But what if a file is in a second tier parent folder or a third tier base folder, not in one of the third tier folders?&nbsp; In a hierarchical structure this is handled by plugging the gaps by the insertion of a N/A row in Folders for each row in ParentFolders,
 so if there were 10 rows in ParentFolders there would be 10 N/A rows in Folders, each with a different foreign key referencing the key of ParentFolders.&nbsp; Similarly there would be an N/A row in ParentFolders referencing each row in BaseFolders.&nbsp; This parallels
 the geographical hierarchy in my DatabaseBasics demo, so the interface would be similar.&nbsp; There could be a situation for instance where a contact is recorded only by their region, not by their city, for which a N/A row in Cities for that region would be necessary.
<br />
<br />
As regards Levels and Formats, I'm assuming there are one-to-many relationship types between each of these and Files, so all that's necessary is to have LevelID and FormatID foreign keys in Files.<br />
<br />
With books, however, I would have thought that there would be a many-to-many relationship type between Files and Books, i.e. each file can be associated with one or more books, and each book can be relevant to one or more files.&nbsp; If so the relationship type
 should be modelled by a table which resolves it into two one-to-many relationship types, e.g.<br />
<br />
Citations<br />
….FileID<br />
….BookID<br />
<br />
The key is a composite one of the two foreign key columns.&nbsp; If you wish to record non-key attributes of the relationship type such as the page in the book number in the book relevant to the file this can be represented by a further column.&nbsp; If there can be
 more than one relevant page number per file/book the PageNumber column would also be a component in the primary key.&nbsp; This part of the model would thus be like this:<br />
<br />
Files---&lt;Citations&gt;---Books<br />
<br />
If you are recording the authorship of books then be sure to have an Authors table, and include an AuthorID foreign key column in Books, not the name.&nbsp; I once found three versions of my own name in a badly designed database as author of publications in my own
 field of work (environmental planning).&nbsp; If publications can have multiple authors, which is common in my field of work, the relationship type between Books and Authors is many-to-many, so should be modelled by table which resolves it into two one-to-many
 relationship types.<br />
<br />
Finally, how do we model favourites?&nbsp; This is a many-to-many relationship type between Users and Files, so again is modelled by table which resolves it into two one-to-many relationship types:<br />
<br />
UserFavourites<br />
….UserID<br />
….FileID<br />
<br />
The table's primary key is a composite one of both foreign key columns.&nbsp; Other columns can be added to represent non-key attributes of the relationship type, such as your 'ranking' of a user's favourites from 1 to 5.&nbsp; If you do this then the UserID and Rank
 column should be included in a single unique index to prevent invalid duplication of the Rank value per user.&nbsp; Dta entry would be via a UserFavourites subform in a Users parent form.<br />
<br />
With a logically constructed model like this the interface would be easy to build, and you would have little difficulty in querying the database in any way you might wish.<br />

    <title>Cannot install Office products - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install Office products</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to install Project, Visio, and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I had just the Click-to-run versions of Office installed. This was giving me trouble with my Visio install, so I uninstalled Office. I'm not sure what the uninstall left behind, but the uninstall was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I then installed 64-bit Visio (SW_DVD5_Visio_Pro_2016_64Bit_English_MLF_X20-42764)</li><li>I attempted to install 64-bit Project (en_project_professional_2016_x86_x64_dvd_69622</li><li>I get the following error message.</li></ol>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a32179c6-2c0f-443b-b9c6-b0a4cd912df6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a32179c6-2c0f-443b-b9c6-b0a4cd912df6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point nothing else office related has been installed. Both Visio and Project were downloaded today (20-Aug-2018) directly from our E3 license portal at Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to install Office after as well, and received the same message above (en_office_professional_plus_2016_x86_x64_dvd_6962141).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how to get the three of these working together?</p>
<p>

            Would suggest using the uninstall "fix-it" tool which will remove all things Office 365 (to be honest - not entirely sure how it applies to Visio &amp; Project so might be worthwhile to uninstall those first but only suggesting that as a precaution)
<br />
<br />Uninstall Office from a PC

<br />
<br />*** note this will also remove Outlook profiles so the email accounts will have to be configured again. if you have any IMAP accounts and data that you want to keep in folders with the description of "This Computer Only" be sure to export those folders to a PST file else that data will be lost.

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Maybe when you uninstalled office (I suppose you did it on Control Panel) some trace was left behind and you are getting that error because of that.
<br />
<br />Try to uninstall everything with this tool and try again.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/diag_officeuninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/diag_officeuninstall</a>
<br />
<br />Also is very important that you understand this article, only in case that you're installing Project and Visio MSI version.
<br />

<p>I did use the fix-it tool, with no luck. I also had a colleague here recommend deleting my profile on the laptop as it might be some corrupt data. I didn't see this solution anywhere else, but I gave it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like I've got old files floating around on my Surface, despite using the fix-it tool as now I've got Office 2016 MSI/64-bit installed but in installing these MSI/64-bit versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visio: I still get an error indicating click-to-run is present.</li><li>Project: I get the same error I posted before, claiming it is a 32-bit version.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have to put this aside for awhile, and will try again later.</p>

    <title>Best phone recorder for the Nokia E71&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjconrad---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best phone recorder for the Nokia E71&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Nokia E71 (Symbian) phone, and downloaded the Ultimate Voice Recorder 5.75.2. I tried it on two calls, and the recording is choppy in an unusual way. It is as if very tiny durations (e.g. quarter of a second each) have been collapsed out of the
 recording - these spots are empty, but are gone altogether. So, instead of hearing "How have you been", it might say "How have been?" The Ultimate Voice Recorder support people told me that this is a limitation of the E71, and that I should install the software
 and store the messages to phone memory. I did this, but the issue remains. Can anyone suggest either a solution to the above, or a better recording program?

            I have had the exact same problem. Did you ever get a fix for this or finder a better recording option? Still waiting on a reply from the UVR people. If it doesn't work with E71 they shouldn't say it does.

<p>No, I never got a fix.&nbsp; I asked them about it, and they said to use the phone memory for the recordings and the software.&nbsp; That made no difference.&nbsp; I would be happy to try another competitive product, but I don't want to waste money (there are probably
 free trials, but I've not taken the time).&nbsp; Money spent on this software was not spent well.</p>

<p>I've been using Ultimate Voice Recorder for a few years now, on various phones, and am fairly regularly in touch with the development team there (possibly to their annoyance! lol), I agree that the recordings can be a bit dodgy when using the AMR format
 - this improves when using the WAV format, but sadly I think that means the beep is active again during recorded calls...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They've always been good at replying, so I'm sure they'll take comments on board, and hopefully resolve the issue soon.</p>

<p>richcowell, have you used any voice recorders that have good quality?&nbsp; I've downloaded 2 apps and both performed the same, with bits of the recording completely missing exactly as cjconrad described.&nbsp; Granted this was on the e71x, which I returned in 2 days,
 but the phone in the AT&amp;T store performed identically.&nbsp; And, now that I'm reading this happens on the unbranded E71 as well, I don't think it's the branded version only having this problem.&nbsp; I contacted the developer and he suggested the same as thing that
 was suggested to cjconrad, send the recordings to phone memory.&nbsp; Nothing has helped and all recordings, independent of progammer, do not work.&nbsp; I've also read that the N97 has the same issue.&nbsp; I need a phone that records correctly.&nbsp; Have you had&nbsp;accurate recordings&nbsp;on
 any phone you've used?&nbsp; Suggestions?&nbsp; It's the only feature I'm looking for at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            cant get image capture on microsoft password reset right</h2>
                    <p>Hi I'm trying to reset my Microsoft password. Normally I can do this easily but at the moment I am having problems with resetting a password.&nbsp; The image capture for resetting the password is driving me mad.&nbsp; I have typed in several attempts of replicating
 the password I don't get it correct according to Microsoft and it doesn't verify. Obviously I've refreshed it several times, I've also tried the audio capture option and can't get that correct.&nbsp; It isn't that easy to hear, or there is the American spelling
 issue, or the accent issue etc etc. so that is harder.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something going on with image capture and password resets with Microsoft passwords I am sure I did this not so long back without a problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you Zoe</p>
