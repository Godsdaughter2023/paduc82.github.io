<h2>            Outlook not responding while syncing</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 running with Windows 8.&nbsp; When I start Outlook the send/receive function doesn't seem to complete, although it does download my emails.&nbsp; The status bar doesn't go away.&nbsp; Then when I delete an email. for example, it seems to get stuck synchronizing
 trash.&nbsp; Or if I send an email, it gets stuck synchronizing sent items.&nbsp; I have to close it and restart to be able to receive any new emails.&nbsp; It has also gotten into a Not Responding state, in which case I have to reboot the computer in order for it to work
 again.&nbsp; If I close and try to restart I get an error message, but I haven't been able to recreate that scenario today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate some guidance.</p>

    <title>Attachments in Email to OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Attachments in Email to OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with sending emails to OneNote. I am able to send emails from Outlook, they arrive in the correct notebook and section, and they include all the correct text and formatting, but the attachments are not working. Instead of seeing the
 attachments I am expecting, I see a single attachment called winmail.dat. This appears to contain some unreadable binary data, although when I save to disk and open in notepad I can make out some of the detail relating to the email at the top (for example
 the email subject is there) and then what looks like the binary file contents below. But the file cannot be opened in any application I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help with this please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Ok, so it turns out I didn't get it wrong earlier at all. When I went back and retested, I used a different email. The new one had three pdf attachments, which all came through to OneNote ok. But they came through ok whether I sent the email to OneNote as
 plain text, rich text or HTML. The original one that I used for testing, with one pdf attachment, always arrived in OneNote in the winmail.dat attachment regardless of the mail body format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Digging a little deeper shows that the problem is definitely caused by the body format, since the one mail that works was
<em>originally received</em> in plain text format. The others I have tried, all of which arrive in OneNote with the Winmail.dat attachment, were originally sent in HTML format. It seems then that it makes no difference what I set the body format to when I forward
 the emails, the result in OneNote is dictated by the format of the original message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like your answer is half right, Bernd P, but I obviously have no control over the format in which sender send their emails to me, simply changing the message format in the email I forward to OneNote doesn't work. I have also tried editing the
 received mail first, saving it as plain text and then forwarding, but that doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only happening from Outlook (2016). When I forward the exact same email from iOS, it comes through with the attachment appearing correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it happens, I have a workaround for this. The process I am designing allows anyone in my family to forward an email to my OneNote, but without having to add each of them individually as an alias to my Microsoft account, since (as far as I can see) this
 would give them full access to the account. What they do is forward any email to a specific address on my domain, which is registered as an alias on my Microsoft account. I have some code which runs in Outlook (yes, I know it's a client and really ought to
 be on the server, but I don't have access to the mail server, and my client machine is always on) to pick up new emails in this mailbox and forward them to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (if the sender is in a defined list). As a workaround, when I receive an email, I create
 a brand new email in plain text format, copy the details across from the received mail, including the attachments, and send the new mail instead of forwarding the original.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my code is now working ok, but if all I wanted was to be able to take emails I receive in Outlook and simply forward them to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, it looks like I wouldn't be able to do so without losing the attachments in HTML format mails.</p>

<h2>            Use Lastpass in Chrome. Want it in IE-11--HOW&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using LastPass in Chrome with an icon on the toolbar. IE-11 doesn't list it as an extension. Tried to launch it from Store, but says its installed. How do I get it listed as an extension so I can enable it with its icon on the toolbar?</p>
<p>This has probably been answered but didn't find it.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><em>Merged</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>LastPass was installed and worked just fine in Chrome; however,&nbsp;LastPass wasn't listed as an extension in IE-11. In Windows Store I could not launch it because it was "already installed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the&nbsp;<a href="https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&amp;id=385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Solution</a> I found. It worked for me and I hope it works for you. You don't have to read any further unless you want to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After jumping through some hoops I found the&nbsp;solution by accident. </p>
<p>I couldn't find&nbsp;a working solution&nbsp;on the LastPass website, which&nbsp;I accessed from my LastPass account. Later, I forgot to login&nbsp;to my account. When I went to the website, it wasn't the website that I&nbsp;normally experienced. This was the promotional Webpage
 that gave an overview of LastPass and instructions for downloading and installing. This
<a href="https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&amp;id=385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Solution</a> link provides a download&nbsp;to install&nbsp;LastPass&nbsp;on IE with no "already installed" message. Also instructions to add the icon to the toolbar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it appears that if you have logged in to your LastPass account you bypass the newbie pages of the LastPass website.</p>

<h2>            Account Locked&#33; Sorry for changing my phone number.</h2>
                    So I've noticed many people are having this issue. I get a new phone number. I go around to my online accounts and update my contact info. MSN locks me out because I can't receive the text message they insist on sending to my old number. Microsoft's response
 seems to be uniform: 'please visit our behemoth of a support page and navigate it's labyrinth of topics until you have confirmed that you are, in fact, being punished for changing your phone number. Don't worry, it's for your own protection. See you in 30
 days.' Why hasn't this been fixed. People get new numbers all the time. I thought that's what the security questionnaire was supposed be for.

<p>hi jonathan,<br />
<br />
could you follow the steps below and check the outcome?</p>
<p>1. stop syncing the current libraries and exit the onedrive for business sync client.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=685b15e0-9628-485e-b7cb-8018c454c356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d685b15e0-9628-485e-b7cb-8018c454c356" /></a></p>
<p>2. clear the onedrive for business cache with <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"easy fix" tool</a>. <br />
<strong>note</strong>: please backup data based on the instructions in the article before using the"easy fix" tool.<br />
<br />
3. remove the authenticated credentials from <strong>control panel</strong> &gt; <strong>
user accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>credential manager</strong> &gt; <strong>windows credentials</strong>. remove all windows credentials about office.<br />
<br />
4. go to the library in the browser and re-sync it. a sign in window will pop up when restarting the onedrive for business client and sign in with your current work or school account again.<br />
<br />
if the issue persists, to understand your situation better, i would like to collect the following information:<br />
<br />
1. which version of onedrive for business sync client are you using? to check it, please right click the task bar &gt;
<strong>task manager</strong> &gt; <strong>details</strong> &gt; right click <strong>groove.exe</strong> &gt;
<strong>properties</strong> &gt; <strong>details</strong> &gt; <strong>product version</strong>.<br />
<br />
2. go to the onedrive for business library in the web browser and capture a screenshot of the files which are not synced.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: to upload a screenshot, click use rich formatting under the reply box in the forum and click the icon of insert/edit media<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=717e30cb-6f6f-43af-b83c-d560e5df4916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d717e30cb-6f6f-43af-b83c-d560e5df4916" /></a>
 &gt; browse &gt; insert.</p>
<p>if you <strong>only</strong> want to sync your onedrive for business library, i would also suggest you try using the onedrive for business next generation sync client, please refer to the following:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-started-with-the-onedrive-for-business-next-generation-sync-client-in-windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">get started with the onedrive for business next

            Hi Tracy,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my test and search, it’s not feasible to track individual progress for multiple users in the same task. Changing the status of
<strong>Progress</strong> will change the status of the entire task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand it will be more convenient if we can track individual progress for users in the same task. It is suggested you submit your feedback via
<a href="https://planner.uservoice.com/forums/330525-microsoft-planner-feedback-forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Planner Uservoice</a>. This is the best way to let the related team hear your voice. Your good suggestions will help us perfect our products and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim</p>

 This image is a screenshot of what happens every time I open up Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; You can hit the OK button but it does nothing, I cannot even access the settings in Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; The only way to close the browser is to use task manager.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>How can I get rid of this virus??&nbsp; I want to be able to use Microsoft Edge again.</p>
<p>Anything that is easy to do would be great...&nbsp; I am not great with computers and just really need this working before school starts!</p>

            On the <strong>Print</strong> tab of the backstage, note what printer is selected. Is it "Send to OneNote"? If so, change to your Brother printer. If "Send to OneNote" is always the active printer when you start Word, you need to open the
<strong>Printers</strong> folder in Windows Control Panel and set your Brother printer as the default printer.

    <title>Call drop with Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 10581 on Lumia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allenchong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call drop with Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 10581 on Lumia 1520</h2>
                    <p>I was very happy when my Lumia 1520 was installed with the latest Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 10581 for about 2 weeks. Performance was very zippy. No lag whatsoever. Particularly, EDGE browser is Fantastic! &nbsp;Battery life was almost on par with
 Windows Phone 8.1 if you turn off all non essential background apps. Only some small issues which I believe will be easily sorted out by Microsoft when the next build is out. Here are the small issues :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Audio under Extra setting is not available.</p>
<p>2. Display under Extra setting is not available.</p>
<p>3. Storage sense is not working properly. Cannot select SD card or Phone storage for default save location.</p>
<p>4. Calendar view is totally different and cannot change view setting if you turn the display resolution too high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These small issues are negligible as a build in progress and I wish to continue this insider build until the next build. Windows 10 Mobile really rocks! I don't want to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 anymore. Kudos to Microsoft team of engineers. Windows Phone
 finally Shine among sea of competitors!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have been forced to revert back to Windows Phone 8.1 because I was suddenly unable to make calls. No matter what setting I have tried. Hard reset numerous time but to no avail. This is a BIG BIG issue which I cannot tolerate. Believe me, I have
 already done switching my SIM card to another phone and there was no problem at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until than, I guess I will have to be complacent with WP 8.1 while waiting for the next big build.&nbsp;</p>

 exception of Wi-Fi being a little quirky not being able to connect (power off and on fixes this one). the call drops and lastly while talking to people even though I cant here it people claim to hear dial tone sounds as if I'm hitting the dial pad while on
 calls. </p>

                    <p>I've created a lot of notes which are primarily images in OneNote on my Android tablet. I need to save these images into folders on my PC. It is much too time consuming to 'right-click, save-as' on the thousands of images and so I had planned to just transfer
 them from my tablet to the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the images seem to be stored as part of the app on the tablet and cannot be accessed when viewing the devices data on a PC. How can I quickly transfer all of my images stored in OneNote from my device to a PC?</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, moving the notes is not an issue. I wish to move the photo's which are stored in the tablet to my pc. Currently I have to save each image individually from within OneNote on my pc. As I said, this is much too slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The images are all saved on my tablet but they are stored in the app's data as opposed to being stored in the 'images' folder of my device. The data associated with the app is not accessible, either on the tablet or when the tablet is connected to a pc,
 and I therefore cannot access the thousands of images I have taken without viewing them in OneNote (but I need to use them outside of OneNote and so viewing them solely in OneNote is not sufficient)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for a way to move the images I have taken through OneNote and are stored on my tablet, to my pc, WITHOUT having to open them in OneNote and save each image individually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>I'm sorry to say that, but the problem you're fighting with has been created by yourself. Misusing Onenote as camera app isn't a good idea, as you see now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the reason was to find a way of mass transfer of pictures from an Android device to your Windows PC use one of the free File Apps (I'm using ES File Explorer which can connect to a Windows network share for copying &nbsp;pictures etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And: Use the standard file app on Android to look into <strong>Files/Pictures/Onenote</strong>; maybe you'll find your pictures there ....</p>

            <p>Bernd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have taken a lot of images, they all have notes associated with them. This is why OneNote could be so useful if the images could be accessed. Otherwise I would have to take images using a camera app and create separate notes in OneNote, referencing
 the image number from the other camera app. Obviously this would be very slow and cumbersome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be very excited to find my images in the file app but like my original post says, the images are stored in the app data and are not accessible through the file app.</p>

            It is possible to have many ToCs, but you may have to take extra steps to&nbsp;limit which headings, or TC entries, appear in which ToC. How to do that depends on where each ToC is getting its entries from, but my guess is that you should
<div>&nbsp;- select each document's content, in turn</div>
<div>&nbsp;- use Insert-&gt;Bookmark to bookmark the content of the document. use a different name for each document, e.g. docA for the first one, docB for the second, and so on</div>
<div>&nbsp;- use option-F9 to show the ToC field code, which might look something like&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>{ TOC \o "1-3" \h \z \u }</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;- add a switch that specifies the portion of the document to scan for entries</div>
<div>\b bookmarkname, e.g.</div>
<div>
<div><span>{ TOC \o "1-3" \h \z \u \b docA }</span></div>
<div><span><span>
<div>&nbsp;- select the ToC and press F9 to update the ToC content</div>
<div>&nbsp;- create your document from the component documents. You'll need to make sure the bookmarks that you created are there and in the right places, and/or re-insert them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;- update all the ToCs</div>

            Or you can create a master document, to visually combine all 10 documents, yet the documents will remain separate.
<div><br />
<div>I found no tutorials for Word 2011 (nor any Help in Word itself!), so here's a crash course:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Create a new document and save it</li><li>In the main menu bar, select&nbsp;<i>View &gt; Master Document</i>&nbsp;(you can type something here, like "Book Title" and perhaps a page break)</li><li>A new small toolbar will appear (called "Master Document")</li><li>Click on <i>Insert subdocument</i>&nbsp;(do for all 10 documents)</li><li>Save and close your master document</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>When reopening the Master document, you'll see links instead of file contents:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Do&nbsp;<i>View &gt; Master Document</i></li><li>The Master Document toolbar will appear</li><li>Click on the first icon, "Expand subdocuments"</li><li>Change the view to something else (Draft or Print Layout)</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>It is important to note that the documents will remain separate, yet any change you enter in them through the Master will affect them just as if you were editing them separately. Such changes will be committed when you save the Master.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want their respective TOCs to display page numbers as "1-1, 1-2... 2.1, 2-2..." etc., it can also be done.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are some tutorial videos available, but they are for Windows and unless you've already done this over in the Mac and have an idea of how it works, they will just confuse you. To wit:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYmGEQjrFBU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to quickly create a master document in Word</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/kYmGEQjrFBU?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/kYmGEQjrFBU?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>And here's a Windows recipe:</div>

<p>
</p><p>I am trying to create a schedule ,but every task shows on critical path due to dependency.But I want to keep a slack in few tasks.</p>
<p>So here is my question "Is setting early start finish and late start finish the only way to add slack?" .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be really glad If I can get a quick trick to do the same.</p>

            <p>Slack is the result of how you have linked the tasks and what the duration estimates are.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>It is not something that you can decide that you want, and how much of it you want and then type it in.</p>
<p>That's why you cannot just go to the schedule table and edit the data in that field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you make one task that has a duration slightly longer than the overall duration of the project, say by 5 days, and do not link it to predecessors or successors, then all of your currently critical tasks will have 5 days of total slack (float).</p>

            <p>Anand,</p>
<p>First of all, early start, early finish, late start and late finish are all calculated by Project and not user editable. Even if the user could edit those dates, it would not impact the critical path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all your task inter-dependencies are valid, then you want the critical path to be visible. Adding a buffer to some tasks won't necessarily remove them from the critical path but it will push out the end date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trevor gave you a suggestion for adding buffer to all tasks in the plan and that may not be desirable. You indicate you want a buffer on only a few tasks. The following approach will do that by adding a dummy buffer "task" in parallel with those tasks you
 wish to add a buffer. Visibly the real tasks will not show as critical (the buffer task will) but keep in mind that the buffer "task" has no resources assigned and is a placeholder for viewing purposes only. The nice thing about this approach is that you do
 have visibility on how much buffer each selected task has both in the Gantt Chart graphic and in the Total Slack field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this screen shot, I've added a buffer task in parallel with task c. The buffer task's duration is set to be the same as the real task's duration plus a buffer, in this case, one day. That results in a positive slack of one day for task c.</p>
<p>

            Hi Ooz, 
<br />
<br />Please follow this guideline: 
<br />
<br />If you need to switch the Skype camera on your iPad, click on the Video icon on the bottom, then select an option "Switch Cameras". 
<br />
<br />Write me back if it works or not. 
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />Andrew N.

    <title>Tagging files for searchability reasons - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tagging files for searchability reasons</h2>
                    <p>Hello Office gurus,</p>
<p>Is it possible to tag texts in the file name with i.e. subject or category markers - but unseen in the title?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets say I want to make a folder with a specific subject (let's say Youth Culture) for my students and allow them to search the files for a tag such as partying, sports, bullying, gangs, drugs, alcohol, etc. without that word being present in the text, but
 merely as perhaps an abstract theme so that they can find the relevant files to compare and contrast to. I could then have several of these folders full of tagged files and then search for let's say gun violence in all of them and students learning a course
 and teachers creating a course on i.e gun violence would get the files from the different themed folders that also relate to gun violence, and are tagged as such</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this make sense? I hope you can help, since it would help immensely and save a plethora of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank YOU in advance</p>

            <p>Keyword search in Word has been pretty much handed off to Windows, but you can certainly add keywords to files using the Document Properties. With a document open, click
<strong>File</strong>. The backstage will open to the <strong>Info</strong> tab. On the right side, under
<strong>Properties</strong>, you can add keywords by clicking on <strong>Add a tag</strong>. You can also add Comments, which may also be found with a Windows search. You'll have to test this, as I have no recent experience with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I just tried this, and in fact you can search within Word's <strong>Open</strong> window, and a search found a term I had added as a tag to a recently opened document.</p>

            <p>I have part of the answer from the MS perspective, and a personal work around.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">The "Official" MS Approach</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can add text to predefined "Properties" fields, including a "Tags" field, and also you can create custom Properties.&nbsp; This article provides an intro to properties:</p>
<p>http://www.kalliance.com/blog/tips-tutorials/using-properties-in-microsoft-word-2013/</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set Word to automatically prompt you to add properties:</p>
<div>
<p><a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=731710&amp;seqNum=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=731710&amp;seqNum=10</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get lucky, these tags will also be displayed in Windows Explorer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This similar question discusses the issue quite well:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/keyword-search-in-word-10-13/e0b8079c-2579-43ad-9385-1c079483bc34</p>
<p>
</p><p>Near the end of the discussion they talk about the Windows Search service.&nbsp; This is key!&nbsp; It has to run to 'index' all of the file names and properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">My Alternate Tagged File Name Search Method</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in the discussion, I too found using tags in Windoze rather flakey.&nbsp; I never got it to work satisfactorily. As a result, I came up with an alternate method that works works well enough for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start by using full LONG names.&nbsp; I started computing in the says of the 8 character file name limit.&nbsp; So I was over the moon when file name lengths were extended.&nbsp; Now, the starting point of my search process is using the full title of the document as
 the file name.&nbsp; I do use short forms of words in the file name ie Win8 vs Windows 8.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I found I could not trust file date properties, they seem to change arbitrarily.&nbsp; So, I use the publish date of the article in the file name.&nbsp; I use the all number YY MM DD format to ensure "appropriate" text sorting.&nbsp; I put it at the start of the
 file name so that I can see the chronology of the files I have stored.&nbsp; The next thing I do is add KEYWORDS to the file name.&nbsp; Not too many, but 3-5 fit well enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my file naming scheme becomes:</p>
<p>tag-&nbsp;&nbsp; one "primary" keyword tag</p>
<p>YYMMDD - numeric date</p>
<p>Long File name</p>
<p>-tag tag ...&nbsp; secondary keyword tags</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, while you can use the search function built into Windows Explorer, and the File Open dialog, I use a 3rd party "File Name Search" tool called "Everything" from Void tools (google for it, PS: I don't work for them)&nbsp; I find that Everything works MUCH
 faster than the built in search.</p>

<p>This is not Microsoft product and you should check with the application provider.</p>
<p>However, before removing registry, it is better to take a backup of it, to learn about how to get backup, take a look at:</p>

            I just checked it and saw it had complete control as admin and stuff and I denied all access, then it kinda deleted itself . I also just ran another scan with Spyhunter through the registry and it isnt there anymore.

<p>A registry key alone is not malware, so unless your scans also found other portions of an InstallMonster infection present, this was likely a false positive detection by a not well respected product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft detection for this software bundler that follows only indicates registry entries within the HKLM\Software section and none within the HKey_Users section that Spyhunter detected.</p>

<p>

Why do they waste all that space and make the keyboard small in landscape?<br />

<p>Hi whyisitsohard,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!<br />
<br />
Let's start with your concern on the keyboard size of the Lumia 900. Unfortunately, there's no setting on the phone to increase the size of the keyboard. Alternatively, I would suggest using
<strong>landscape mode</strong> when typing a text message. This is because the letters are wider compared when using it in a portrait mode.<br />
<br />
For the predictive text or auto correct tool, you can disable it by following these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong><br />
2. Tap on <strong>Keyboard</strong><br />
3. Tap on <strong>typing settings</strong><br />
4. Tap on <strong>Keyboard</strong>, which is located above the<strong> Typing improvement</strong> section<br />
5. Remove the check mark for the "<strong>Suggest text and highlight misspelled words</strong>". You also have the option to disable other keyboard settings.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 for Android TOC</h2>
                    On my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7" it came with word built in but I cannot insert TOC since there is no reference bar to do that. I had office 2013 on my old PC but the cooling fan blew up so i no longer have a computer only my tablet. Can someone actually
 explain how to inset a TOC on word 365 for android because i can change the heading but can't insert a TOC

            In this case, the "text to display" would be a chapter title or page number in the TOC (if you select it before clicking the button, it will be inserted automatically), and the "address" would be a "Place in This Document," that is, a bookmark. If Word
 doesn't automatically bookmark headings (which I imagine it wouldn't, as this usually happens when you generate a TOC), then you'd have to bookmark them manually. It may well be, however, that there's no way to insert a bookmark, either.

    <title>Is There a Way to Reduce the Vertical Spacing between Checkboxes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is There a Way to Reduce the Vertical Spacing between Checkboxes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to replace ActiveX checkboxes with Form Checkboxes in an existing template&nbsp;for speed and compatibility.</p>
<p>The checkboxes are stacked vertically with a cell of a Table and pretty closely align with lines of text in the adjacent cell.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that when I stack the Form Checkboxes they seem to take about 50% more vertical space than the ActiveX, even thought the checkbox symbol itself is the same size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to stack these closer together? </p>
<p>(Through search I found some techniques using symbols and macros; however I'd prefer a solution that doesn't require macros).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are using Office 2010 and the file is .docx format. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! </p>
<p>- Jerry</p>

            OK, now I see the cause.<br />
<br />
Word 2010 offers three different kinds of checkbox objects. The one you used to replace the ActiveX objects is not the "legacy form field" checkbox that I thought it was. Instead, it's a content control checkbox, which is new in 2010 (meaning that no one using
 Word 2007 or earlier will be able to use it as a checkbox).<br />
<br />
Every content control is surrounded by a bounding box, the blue box that appears when you select the control. That bounding box, which is larger than the control itself, is what is making the extra separations in the stack. You can make the checkboxes line
 up with the labels better by selecting each content control plus the paragraph mark to its right, and setting the point size to 9 pt -- the boxes will be slightly smaller than the ActiveX ones, but not too small.<br />
<br />
The other kind of checkbox is the legacy form field one, in the top row of items on the Legacy Controls dropdown in the Controls group. This kind has no bounding box, so it obeys the font size and paragraph spacing just like text. The difference is that, unlike
 the other two, it requires you to protect the document for filling in forms. That's most easily done by adding the Lock icon to the Quick Access Toolbar (you'll find it in the All Commands category in the Customize dialog) and clicking that button to toggle
 protection on and off.<br />
<br />
I added a section of legacy form checkboxes to the table and protected the document, and put the revised copy at

<h2>            Print to fit on page for Super B&#47;A3 &#40;13&#34;x19&#34;&#41;</h2>
                    We regularly print to 13"x19" paper from our Macintosh computers. This is a standard size on our printer. Other programs allow us to scale the print area to fit that sheet. When printing with Excel we can print to fit for Letter and Tabloid sizes but not
 for the 13"x19" sheet size. Instead, it prints the size to fit an 8.5"x11" sheet. In Excel, Page Layout/Size does not show our optional size although it does show some sizes not listed on our printer such as Legal and Japanese Postcard. We can print to pdf
 and scale the pdf when printing to fit the 13"x19" page size as a workaround. Has anyone found a way to add a page size within Excel or some other solution for sizing to the larger size?

            Actually, it was the answer from BradMartin1134, using the Paper Handling selection in the print dialogue box that helped. The Custom Paper Size produced the same results as simply selecting that page size from the list.<br />

                    <p>I was on Pinterest today and clicked on a Pin.&nbsp; I did NOT go to the site, but an Imgur.com ad popped up which was completely Pornographic, showing pics of male genetalia.&nbsp; I have my browser settings set on "strict" but I want to block this site from showing
 up in my ads column.&nbsp; How do I block my computer from showing content from this website altogether?&nbsp; It would be useful to have easy instructions on how to block a site in settings.&nbsp; I would rather the instructions come from Microsoft rather than another site.</p>
<p>Pinterest should be a safe place to browse.&nbsp; Please help!</p>
