<h2>            navigating to different sections of a sway</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a box at the bottom of the Sway that says "Navigate to different sections in this Sway". &nbsp;When I click this box the Sway fades to the back ground and I get a page that has my first panel on it and an icon that looks like a house. &nbsp;Once I get to
 this page all I can do is restart my Sway or go back to the Sway home page. &nbsp;I need to be able to sift through the slides until I find the one I need while I am presenting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>CD Donohue</p>

<p>Hi CD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the other response says, you need Heading cards in your Sway to break it up into different sections to have something meaningful to navigate in this view.&nbsp; You should be able to close it by clicking the X in the upper right, pressing ESC, or clicking
 on the one chapter shown or anywhere outside of it.&nbsp; Are these exit points not working for you?</p>

            V 16001.... and No File tab means you are using the free version of OneNote that comes with WINDOWS 10. The start menu tile icon will have a white "page" with a purple "N" on it.  The Office 2016/365 icon
<br />
<br />Tile on left is OneNote Windows 10
<br />Tile on Right is Office 2016 / 365
<br />
<br />Go in to one of the other Office applications and report the Office Edition, version and build numbers. 
<br />
<br />..........******************************************************
<br />************* Edition, Version &amp; Build Numbers **********************
<br />..........******************************************************
<br />.
<br />Although MS does not tell you, when you are asking for help, we really do need to know specific the Windows (or Office) Edition, Version AND Build numbers you are running. 
<br />
<br />Contrary to MS's wishful thinking, we are all NOT running the "most recent" version (actually Version AND BUILD!) .  Individual recurring, (obviously unfixed) Windows update errors cause people to be running older versions and builds. We commonly see people running versions of Windows that have fallen out of support because they are 18 months old due to unfixed update errors during that span of time. 
<br />
<br />
<br />****************************
<br />(Only) If you are having Office problems:
<br />.
<br />In any Office 365/2016/2013 application go to:
<br />File menu &gt; Account command &gt; About section
<br />ie Version 1803 Build 9126.2116
<br />

            Hello Bronwyn_LMU. Are you using OneNote or OneNote 2016? It sounds like you are using OneNote (aka OneNote for Windows 10). That is what I use and I included a screenshot of where Print is located. 
<br />
<br />You can swap between OneNote and OneNote 2016 (aka the Desktop app) with no problem.  Let me know if you have any other questions.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc806700-4523-4be2-b42b-2820963b1776?upload=true" />

<h2>            Is Pro-Care a scam&#63;</h2>
                    Today, my daughter's Surface stopped working a a message popped up to call Microsoft because there was a problem. We called the number and ended up purchasing network protection from Pro-Care. I'm just realizing that this may not be legit. Does Microsoft
 have third party support or was this a complete scam? &nbsp;Does anyone have any experience with this company?&nbsp;

<h2>            Flash causes FireFox to freeze&#47;crash</h2>
                    <p>original title: Firefox Flash Bug</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi guys, this has been going on for some time now. Every time I go to a Flash website on Firefox it crashes/freezes for a minute or two and when I load a flash website on IE10, it works perfectly. I disabled flash and the browser did not crash.
<br />
Everything is fully up to date (windows updated, Firefox is updated, even flash), I even tried the beta version of Flash 11.6, same thing still happened.<br />
<br />
And when that bug appeared two weeks ago it might of affected other programs as well; VLC takes a long time to open, i mean LOOONG, 10 minutes at times, so I'm forced to use windows media player. They have to be linked in some way as when that flash bug's not
 there (I system restored last week and everything was fine for a week till now) it works perfectly and now it just came back yesterday and BANG things aren't working properly :(<br />
<br />
Anyone else having this problem? Help would be appreciated. Thanks<br />
<br />
EDIT: Tried other applications as well, they seem to hang, like Norton is not even scanning, java took quite some time updating, etc.<br />
<br />
[I'm Running Windows 8 Pro 64bit, Firefox 17.01, Flash 11.5 and the latest VLC]<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firefox browser crashes and the programs in the computer run slow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programs in the computer may run slow because of some third party applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To verify, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: Run the performance troubleshooter</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><b><span>Hover</span></b><span> the mouse to the top right hand corner and click on search</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type <b>control panel</b> and hit enter</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If the icons are not displayed in large size, click on category which is above the list and select large icons</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now click on <b>troubleshooting</b></span></p>
<p><span><strong>e.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now click <strong>system and security</strong> and click
<strong>system maintenance</strong> and proceed further.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Clean boot</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When the computer is started in clean boot, non Microsoft programs will not be started and any interruption from them would be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the site mentioned:</span></p>
<span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span><span>, or Windows 8</span>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: </span><strong><span>Once you are done with clean boot, follow step 3 in the article to set your computer back to normal startup</span></strong><b><span>.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note: If in case you are connected through a wireless connection then when you start the System Configuration Utility to perform clean boot, click Startup &amp; Services tab one at time and ensure wireless related entry is Checked (Enabled).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To work with the issue with Firefox, I would suggest you to get assistance at Firefox support site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists or if you face any Windows issues in future, let us know and we would be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Performance on the computer is fine. Nothing wrong with that. My problem is that firefox freezes, everything else works but flash seems to make it freeze.
<br />
And VlC is not starting up at all now :(<br />

<h2>            Concatenate function within Access</h2>
                    
<p>I have a table "PD Profiles" that contains fields "User name" and "Authprofile"</p>
<p>User name field has duplicates to show that a single user has multiple "Authprofile"&nbsp; Neither field is a lookup value.</p>
<p>Searched around and found some coded functions to perform Concatenate, however I cannot get my desired end result.</p>
<p>My end goal is to display on a single line "User name&nbsp;&nbsp; AuthprofileA AuthprofileB etc"</p>
<p>Screenshot of access: http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y112/genkaku47/dbase.jpg</p>
<p>You will see that usernames repeat.&nbsp; For example, AAALDE001 is listed twice because Authprofile is both _LSO and _MSS.&nbsp; I would like to be able to generate a report that shows:</p>
<p>AAALDE001&nbsp; COMCAST_LSO&nbsp; COMCAST_MSS</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><br />
Suppose you used the fConcatChild function posted at <a href="http://www.mvps.org/access/modules/mdl0004.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mvps.org/access/modules/mdl0004.htm</a>&nbsp;, or a modified version of that function to separate the concatenated list with spaces instead of semicolons.&nbsp; You need a query that returns the unique [User name] values from the table, and the concatenated
 list for each one.&nbsp; Such a query might have SQL like this:</p>
<p>SELECT <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [User name], <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fConcatChild("PD Profiles","User name","Authprofile","String",[User name]) AS Profiles<br />
FROM [PD Profiles]<br />
GROUP BY [User name];</p>

Hi welshman123,</p>
<p>If Robert's suggestion doesn't help you in resolving the issue, then try resetting the Internet Explorer settings to default as some users have fixed this issue by resetting the Internet Explorer settings to default. To do this, try these steps:<br />
a. <strong>See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to reset Internet Explorer settings</a></strong><br />
b. Click Microsoft Fix it and save it on the desktop.<br />
c. Close all the windows, open the Microsoft Fix it present on the desktop and run it successfully.<br />
d. Open Internet Explorer and check the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</p>

<p>Thank you both.Tried both suggestions and no luck.</p>
<p>As this only affects a few of my regular web pages I can live with it but it is annoying though.</p>
<p>Surely I am not the only one with this problem?</p>

<p><br />
What problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestions involved&nbsp;you refining your symptom description.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g., what did bravenet suggest?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A problem with the diagnostic that you have so far is that it is too imprecise.&nbsp;&nbsp;It suggests that there was a crash or that IE once knew that there was a crash but it doesn't&nbsp;give you any details about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; My comment about Flash was a guess that Flash
 could have been involved in a crash at the site which uses Flash. &nbsp;Syed's suggestion to do a RIES should have removed any possibility of IE remembering that it had once had a crash on a site at least the first time you visited it after using that tool and
 BTW it would also have removed Flash, which would have at least changed your symptom initially on the site which uses it.</p>
<p>I suppose another thing you could do to try to change your symptoms (as a diagnostic) would be to disable Automatic Crash Recovery and retry (e.g. via Options, Advanced tab, Browsing section)</p>

    <title>Publisher 2000 font issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenkaplan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 2000 font issue</h2>
                    Need some help. &nbsp;I am using Publisher 2000. &nbsp;I have made my websites on this software for years. &nbsp;Now the issue is that the font in some, but not all of my text boxes is turning into a dark bold looking type when I preview it or publish it to the web.
 &nbsp;I am using standard fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman. &nbsp;I noticed something was sensitive when there were pictures in the same box, but not always, or even on the same page but not in the box...but again not always. &nbsp;I tried arranging all pictures to
 the background, but that didn't work. &nbsp;I tried moving all pictures to the sidelines, off the page, but that didn't work. &nbsp;I also have a few other boxes on the bottom of the page that have normal, clear font. &nbsp;This also happens in the table tool I have on one
 page. &nbsp;If anyone can help, below is a link to the website. &nbsp;I appreciate it.

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help. &nbsp;New but similar question, and since you are such an expert, thought I'd try asking you.</p>
<p>New website been working on: &nbsp;www.kapcoding.com</p>
<p>Tried separating all text boxes. &nbsp;Noticing the green text box 2nd from the bottom is overlapping with the main text box, unless I separate it by around .25 to .50 inches. &nbsp;It doesn't happen all around the page with the other boxes. &nbsp;So I am wondering why,
 and what is the proper distance between text boxes? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason you are getting the different results is because of the bullet list directly above the green box. Publisher chokes a bit on these lists and the spacing is not the same in HTML as the print version. If you want to use the list you can but you will
 have to increase the distance between the text boxes incrementally until a web page preview shows the spacing result you want. It won't look correct on your Publisher page but will render correctly when you generate the HTML version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As was discussed on the previous pages there is no absolute rule of the 'proper distance' between text boxes. Geoffrey suggested that in his experience it was "one and a half box-button in both directions". You found a circumstance where you need more space
 than 'normal' because of the inability of Publisher to always exactly convert print formatted media to HTML or web formatted media.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>In addition to Geoffrey's comments, here are some specific suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your home page if you left click and drag to try to select the text you will notice that you can't as the text has been converted to an image. If you looked in your web files before you uploaded them you would notice that one of the .gif files reflects
 this text. Also: <a href="http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/img1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/img1.gif</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that the reason the text has been converted is because of&nbsp;the 'click here and contact...' element. Do not insert that element or any image&nbsp;into&nbsp;a text box or overlap it with the text box. Both actions&nbsp;will combine the two elements into the gif
 file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your <a href="http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/CommonlyTreatedConditions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/CommonlyTreatedConditions.html</a>&nbsp;page you seem to have used a table which is again has been converted to an image:
<a href="http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/img9.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/img9.gif</a>&nbsp; You can not use tables in Pub 2000 webs...they will always be converted to an image. Try using two text boxes side by side, varying
 the width of the text boxes to simulate your table with each column in a separate text box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another incident of where your text is converted is your&nbsp;'bottom banner'&nbsp;text:
<a href="http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/img7.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/img7.gif</a>&nbsp;I suspect you have taken two text boxes with the addresses and overlapped them on another full page, color filled text box...or in some
 way you are overlapping text boxes such that you end up with an image. Though the text is legible it still cannot be read by a text reader&nbsp;nor will it be read and indexed by the search engines. If you view the source code you will see that that text is not
 visible in the code. Right click your home page (or go to View &gt; source code)&nbsp;&gt; view source code and you will see that neither the 'bottom banner' text or the text above that has been converted into an image, shows up in the code. UPi will see the rest of
 the text on the page. You should redesign that bottom banner such that the text is not converted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And though you didn't ask,&nbsp;your banner ad on each page has converted all the text:
<a href="http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/img0.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shangacupuncturecenter.com/img0.gif</a>&nbsp;. As you have used a special font and inserted the yin-yang logo into this I would suggest that instead of trying to convert all this
 to text that will not be converted you just save the img0.gif file from your html files as your 'banner.gif'&nbsp;and insert it into each page as an image. Then select that image and right click &gt; change picture frame properties &gt; and at the bottom of that dialog
 in the 'alternative text representation...' type in 'Shang Acupuncture Center - Auththentic...etc". Now when you publish your web files you can mouseover that banner and that alt text will show up in a tool tip. Furthermore text readers will read it, and most
 importantly the search engines will read and index that alt text. Once again you can view the source code to see how it is added to the image tag. Adding the Alt tag 'should' be done with each picture on each page...it will help your site being indexed and
 found by people searching for those words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

    <title>N95&#39;s Carl Zeiss Optics not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ekin1972  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95&#39;s Carl Zeiss Optics not working.</h2>
                    I'm now on to my 3rd N95 from Orange as the first 2 had major software failures. My 3rd was brought this morning by a courier from Orange.<br />
<br />
My previous hand set started having problems with the camera refusing to focus. Which then eventually lead to rebooting every 10 min and then total failure.<br />
<br />
My new handset which I have had for all of 5 min, also has the same problem with the camera refusing to focus on the second and all consecutive photos rendering the camera useless again and now Orange will have to replace this phone.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else had the same problems with the camera or whats more to point has anybody actually had a N95 that has actually worked properly for more than a day?<br />
<br />
If anyone could offer any kind of help I would be grateful as I'm now just in the mood putting the phone in the bin and forgetting Nokia ever existed!

            See, if you get a debranded version. Or do it yourself. The 95 sometimes has problems with autofocus if it is low on ram. Make sure you closed all other applications to test it properly.

            I have done a factory reset on the phone and it seems to have eased the problem although it is still not perfect.<br />
<br />
It now works most of the time but still not every time.<br />
<br />
I have also noticed that if I leave at least 10 seconds between each shoot it give the software time to stabilise. This is far from perfect and not what I expect from my phone. This still renders the sequence mode useless.<br />
<br />
I have also removed all the software from my phone that Orange had installed.<br />
<br />
The situation is still not perfect but as this is my eighth Nokia phone and only two of them were upgrades and rest rest replacements due to failure than I can't expect a perfectly working phone from Nokia!!<br />
<br />
Nokia produce amazing phones. Its such a shame they can't get them to work properly!!!!

            Orange are well known for messing up phones with their unstable firmware.<br />
<br />
I've had nokia's, samsungs and sony ericssons that have all had faults and have all been caused by orange's firmware.<br />
<br />
I now refuse to buy an orange phone.

            Yes, it's called debranding.<br />
<br />
I don't think nokia like people talking about that on here because debranding your phone will void your warrenty.<br />
<br />
If you google "debrand nokia n95" the top result is a useful how-to guide.<br />
<br />
But remember it will void your warranty.

            Many thanks for that info.<br />
<br />
After reading the info, i'm not sure if having the warrenty void is the way to go. It might be something I would try on this model after my next upgrade.<br />
<br />
I will just have to keep annoying Orange with replacements or a software patch.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
<br />

<h2>            Very slow inbox loading and email sending</h2>
                    <p>Hotmail (now Outlook Live, i.e. the web application) is very slow to load and open email. On top of that, recently it has started taking ages to send out emails. A bar under the tag Sending appears on the top right corner and shows the very slow progress
 the emails take to be sent out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the point of that? Is Microsoft trying to lose more customers than they already have? Cos switching to another provider takes seconds. Does anyone know what's going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried with different browser and different operating systems, including the ones from Apple.</p>

<p>No. The only changes are the one Microsoft makes when he updates the OS (Windows 10)</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My connection is stable. The same things happens wherever I am, not only at home. And as I said, I have the same issue no matter what browsers or OS I use.</p>

<p>no1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is that Microsoft is piling lots more stuff onto already creaking servers like games and news. It all takes massive processing and leaves poor old mail waiting in the wings to load. My guess is it's part of Microsoft's scheme to move
 into services which it will try to monetise in future. Shame is that they are leaving loyal customers out in the cold. The same thing happens in other big businesses - have you noticed how loyal customers always end up with the worst deals as they target new
 custom with juicy offerings? </p>

            <p>Hi JohnLynch_562,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You couldn't have put it better. We might be loyal customers (I have been using Hotmail since it came out) but we don't make Microsoft money so to them we are worth nothing.</p>
<p>And they think we are so stupid that we would pay for such a bad service. Whoever has paid for their Office 365 is currently buried with problems.</p>

            <p>Hi No1 and all you unhappy Microsoft users out there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only one way to help speed up Hotmail and that is to have an effective ad blocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the Firefox browser with Adblock Plus enabled. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry about any of the options you were given in earlier threads, resetting options in this or that - they are a waste of time.
</p>
<p>Make sure you have the latest version of Firefox for sure, but if Hotmail (Live) is slow to load then it's down to the Microsoft servers unable to process your request in a timely manner. As proof, just open a second tab on your browser and open Google or
 Ebay. If they open, it's down to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know anything about Office 365. If it's a Microsoft software package then it's most likely not worth the money. I have ditched Microsoft completely. I use Ubuntu Linux and Libre Office. It is FREE but the best thing about it is IT WORKS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, Microsoft Windows 95 was full of holes and wide open to viruses. Windows 98 and ME were no better but had a different user interface. Windows 7 was so flaky that the amount of fixes got completely out of hand. Windows 10 has been rebuilt so many times
 it now has millions of lines of code. Downloadable diagnostics from Microsoft can't find the problems and you end up in time consuming circles especially the eeeeeeeendless waits for updates that never complete. Write your own horror stories about Office 365
 here. </p>
<p>Do yourselves a favor and download Linux and start enjoying using your computer for the 1st time in years. Sheldon Cooper's favorite Linux version is Ubuntu. He knows what he's talking about!

    <title>Updated from build 10079 to build 10130, Insider Hub &#40;and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cybermonk78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updated from build 10079 to build 10130, Insider Hub &#40;and Spartan&#41; does not work anymore.</h2>
                    <p>I was using build 10079 and decided to skip build 10122&nbsp;because of the problems with AMD GPU in combination with Spartan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then&nbsp;build 10130 was released to the fast ring, so today i was too curious to wait any longer and installed it. (think i kinda regret that now, i had no problems whatsoever)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have to use Internet Explorer to get here because the Insider Hub crashes once i start it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Spartan does not work at all anymore. Spartan did open a few times, but refused to do anything but showing a blank page when i typed for example
<a href="http://www.google.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.google.nl</a>&nbsp;Now it just crashes immidialy&nbsp;once i start it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can live with Spartan not working anymore, thank god we still got IE hehe.</p>
<p>But its annoying i can't use the Insider Hub anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas if there is something i could&nbsp;try to fix it?</p>

            <p>Oops i placed this topic in the wrong sub-category so i moved the topic now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I allready just did a clean install, the first time Insider Hub crashed, but second time i opened it its working again. Also the issue with Spartan is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what caused the problem, build 10074 was working fine untill i updated to 10130. But i did not wanted to wait for the next build. And if the only current sollution is me having to reinstall all my software anyway i prefer to do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems the "new hub"&nbsp;is kinda unstable however since the layout changed? (i guess with build 100122 which i skipped)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my first visit to the hub and using it&nbsp;i couldn't open it again without it crashing. I had to logoff (with a lot of errors) and log back on to fix it.</p>

 builds before release. I had downloaded the USB tool but, understandably, the OS isn't registered and I have no key. I have been in the Insider Program since 9926 so I should be able to get my machine validated, right?</span>

<h2>            Font Compatibility Question</h2>
                    I have Word 2010 and downloaded Cicle Font. How can I know if this font (or any other newer font) will be readable to someone using an earlier version of Word? Thanks!

            All TrueType and OpenType fonts are "readable" by all versions of Windows and Office released in the last 12 to 15 years. As Cicle is a TrueType font, the version of the program isn't a concern.<br />
<br />
What you do need to think about, though, is whether others reading your document have that font installed on their computers. If they don't, then Word will choose a substitute font, seemingly at random. (Actually it does try to match certain characteristics
 of the font, but that doesn't always work well.)<br />
<br />
To make that font available with your document, you may be able to embed the font in the document file -- whether that's even possible depends on what "embeddability" setting the font designer specified in the font file. To try it, open the document, go to
 the Options dialog, click the Save tab, and check the box for "Embed fonts in the file". To minimize the size of the file, check the box for "Embed only the characters used in the document". Save the document and mail it to another computer where the font
 hasn't been installed, and open it in Word there. Go to the Options dialog, click Advanced, and click the Font Substitution button in the "Show document content" section. If it says there are no substitutions, you've successfully embedded the font.<br />

            TrueType fonts use a file extension of .ttf. OpenType fonts may use a .otf extension, or may also use .ttf because OpenType is an extension of TrueType. In a few cases you'll see .ttc, which is a TrueType Collection (multiple fonts in one file). In most
 cases it doesn't make any practical difference which of these classes any font belongs to.<br />
<br />
In older versions of Windows and Office, there were some "bitmapped" fonts. With that kind, you needed a separate file for each size, and they were mainly useful only for screen display. Current versions of Word won't let you use them, or even show them in
 the font list.<br />
<br />
Since you have Windows 7, the file manager (the Computer entry on the Start menu) will show you the font type information and more, for all the fonts you have installed. Go to the folder C:\Windows\Fonts. Set the display to Details. Click View in the menu and
 then click Choose Details. In that dialog, make sure at least these things are checked:<br />
Name<br />
Font embeddability<br />
Font file names<br />
Font type<br />
<br />
Then look through the list of fonts.<br />
<br />
The font embeddability tells you whether you can embed the font in a Word document -- "Installable" means the recipient can keep the font on their computer, while "Editable" means they can use it in your document but nowhere else. Avoid using fonts that are
 "Restricted license" in documents for other users. If there is no entry for a font, it may or may not be embeddable, and you'd have to experiment.<br />
<br />
The font file names will show the file extension. The font type shows whether it's TrueType or OpenType.<br />

<p><b><span>Error 0x80070424
</span></b><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968002</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>OR</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Since you didn't give us much information let's assume this is a new install...and you've had this issue since installing "over a month" ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Here's the generic fix for such issues:</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Be sure the PC clock and calendar are correct.&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Right click the clock in the system tray.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select Adjust Date and Time.</span></p>
<p><span>Verify and correct the month, day, year, hour, minutes and time zone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reboot if you changed any of the above.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>What operating system and service pack? MSE requires XP (32 bit version only) with
<strong>SP3 </strong>installed, </span><span>Vista</span><span> or Win 7…</span></p>
<p><span>Prior Security Software?&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>What about a trial version of an antivirus program that was pre-installed when the computer was purchased? McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro?</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes
<strong>remnants</strong> of prior security software will <strong>suddenly</strong> cause issues with your current antimalware program.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>A
<b>possible</b> reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Be sure you have removed <span>&nbsp;</span>all other security software from the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re not sure which security apps may have been on your computer try a scan with this security application detection/removal tool:
<a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.appremover.com/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, run the Remove Security Applications scan and then run the Clean Up A Failed

<h2>            File Retention in OneDrive for Business</h2>
                    <p>File Retention in OneDrive for Business is not behaving as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in the process of deploying Office 365 for a group of churches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to importing any files I have set up the SharePoint Sites I need and set up accounts for all key personnel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up File Versioning on all Libraries&nbsp; and I have set a Global Retention Policy for all elements on the site using the default retention period of 7 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By way of a test run I am now importing all my personal files into my personal OneDrive for Business folder.&nbsp; I have done this by first syncing the folder to my computer and then using File Explorer on my Desktop (I am running Windows 10) to move my files
 into my ODfB folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are all uploading as expected but they are also being simultaneously duplicated in the Preservation Hold Library.&nbsp; This is not expected behaviour.&nbsp; According to this Help file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Overview-of-retention-policies-5e377752-700d-4870-9b6d-12bfc12d2423</p>

            Hi Tech-Reader,<br />
<br />
I notice the SR is closed. I'd share the summary here:<br />
<br />
<strong>Issue Description</strong><br />
============ <br />
Use OneDrive to upload(sync) the files/documents to SharePoint Online/OneDrive site caused unexpected update for some files<br />
<br />
<strong>Assessment</strong><br />
===========<br />
Our product team confirmed these documents /files got updated even only upload them by OneDrive is expected behavior, as the sync engine will upload the file/document content first, then update the file/document metadata.<br />
<br />
*The metadata update will not generate new version, but as it really a update, so it will trigger the retention policy for copying the file to PreservationHoldLibrary, and there isn’t business impact in your side even the file/document has been copied to PreservationHoldLibrary.<br />
<br />
And they will consider to improve this issue in the future, e.g. use a new service to update the metadata which will not cause the update, but right now there isn’t any ETA for it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />
Jim

            First of all, it is recommended to contact or visit to that store from where Microsoft Office software was purchase, because they might have written details of that card or they may trace the registration number from any other resource. Also please check
 if you have received any email at the time of Microsoft Office Home and Student 2016 purchase.<br />
If that doesn’t help, it is suggested to contact ‘Microsoft Office Support’ from the link given below:<br />

<p>Hi MikeGibson6844,<br />
<br />
I understand that you got NDRs which said that the emails you sent out might be detected as spam. To further investigate this issue, I’d like to collect the following information:<br />
1. The entire NDRs.<br />
To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the tenant information. Here is the link to access it.<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations<br />
2. Where did you purchase your Office 365 plan, from Microsoft or other syndicate partners like GoDaddy?<br />
<br />
Besides, there could also be some settings on the recipients’ side to determine whether an email could be spam. So I would also suggest you contact the recipients’ side to help check this issue.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<p>Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information in private message.<br />
After analyzing the information in the NDRs, I found that the recipients’ side have rejected your emails as spam. And the settings in Office 365 side are all correct. So this issue would be related to the settings on the recipients’ side. Based on this, I would
 suggest you contact the recipients’ side to add the email addresses or domain in your organization to the allowed sender lists. Your understanding will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Thanks for providing the information in the PM.</p>
<p>Our back-end team have confirmed that all settings about your Office 365 email services are correct. Regarding the NDR reports you provided, it all indicates that the recipient’s mail servers are treating your emails as spam due to the contents scan. Would
 you mind contacting your recipients to see if they can add your email address as a safe sender, then check if the issue can be resolved?</p>
<p>Your time and efforts are appreciated.</p>

Hi Edwin,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
1. Did you upgrade to the latest Build 10049?<br />
2. Was Vertical scrolling working fine in previous Builds and Windows 8.1?<br />
3. Did you install all the pending updates?<br />
<br />
Microsoft have released the latest Build 10049. I would suggest you to upgrade to the latest build if you have not yet done. If you have already upgraded to the latest Build, then Make sure you don’t have any pending updates.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues With Windows in future.</span>

            sounds like you may have a carrier branded phone, and not a factory unlocked one.<br />
<br />
you may have to change your product code to the generic UK code, then it should work just fine.<br />
<br />
unfortunately i cannot give you those instructions here, but you can google "changing origin code on nokia e90" and you can also have a look at the
<a href="http://www.my-symbian.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.my-symbian.com</a> under the communicator section. if you create a user account, you can search for product codes and you should be able to find it.<br />

<p>Ok thank you very much for your help. To change the product code sound good but i think it is to risky to change my phone code, so for the moment i am keeping my firmware. Anyway thank you very much again for your help!</p>
