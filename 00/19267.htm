<h2>            &#91;Bug&#93; ActiveWindow.View.Zoom For PowerPoint 2016 VBA</h2>
                    <p>I ran into this bug while coding an add-in for PowerPoint. I am trying to store the current zoom level of a presentation by simply storing the zoom amount to a variable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a presentation with a standard zoom of <strong>100%</strong>, if I execute the following code in the
<strong>Immediate Window</strong> I get <strong>93%</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">?ActiveWindow.View.Zoom<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Similarly, the following code gives the same result:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">?ActivePresentation.Windows(1).View.Zoom</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is just a 2016 thing or dates back to earlier versions of PowerPoint. Are there any workarounds to this?<br />

<h2>            recurring weekly meeting skipping one week each momth</h2>
                    <p>We have weekly meetings on Wednesday. However, the 2nd Wednesday of the month is at a different time and different&nbsp;location. I can schedule that recurring meeting easily. How do I easily schedule the other Wednedays without having to do it individually for
 Wednesday? How do I *skip* the 2nd Wednesday?</p>

    <title>Word&#58; how to keep specific rows in a table on the same page&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deemzje  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word&#58; how to keep specific rows in a table on the same page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a program that uses Excel input to automatically fill a Word template to generate reports. In the report there is a table that spans numerous pages. This table has three columns, but every second row is created by splitting it&nbsp;off from the middle
 cell of the first row. As long as there is data, another row with three columns is added to the table, followed by a row which is split off from the middle cell of the newly added row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is: is there a way to keep every first and second row together on a page as a unit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details: Word 2010 on Windows 7.&nbsp;All rows in the table&nbsp;are not allowed to break across pages. The input for the cells in the table consists of unspecified paragraphs of text. I have tried using the paragraph.KeepWithNext property, but the problem is that
 by splitting off the second row from the middle cell of the previous row, two hidden paragraphs are created, one to the left of the split off row and one to the right. Chaining .KeepWithNext over the hidden paragraph does not seem to work.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I
 really&nbsp;need&nbsp;this particular layout of the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;in advance for your input.</p>
                </div>

<h2>            My mouse stops working when it wants &#40;build 10041&#41;</h2>
                    Well, i was using windows 10 finelly and yesterday an update happened and probably brought with it some bugs. After it, my mouse, when it wants, stops working (stays incapable of click/select something and moves slowly (like when a game is running as 10
 fps) and to every frame, he beeps). The only solution i've found was to log off or reboot the PC. I do not know if there is a process in the task manager for mouses (so i can reboot it every time the bug shows up) and i want to know to stop losing time rebooting
 the pc.<br />
<br />
I tested two mouses, the first one was an USB mouse and the second was a "ps/2", both with this bug.<br />
<br />
Sorry for my bad english, isn't my first language.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to boot computer in <strong>Safe </strong><strong>mode</strong> and check if issue persist.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in Safe mode.</span></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> &nbsp;To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the computer works fine in Safe mode, </span><strong><span>Perform a Clean boot</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span>

<h2>            How can I change my country on my account&#63;</h2>
                    How to change information in my profile in Windowsphone. com? Especially the information about my country . I'm from Bulgaria not from GB.
<br />
I can't change the country in Edit payment info panel when I chose a credit card. Why?<br />
<br />
Thank You!

<p>Thank you for posting at the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know Bulgaria is not supported Country for Windows Phone, so perhaps you had to use a neighboorhood country to set up your account. You can check your windows live id country through this link:

You will require VBA event code to lock/unlock cells when parameters are met.</p>

            <p>Have you checked the AMD web site to check for the latest driver availability? Most Windows 8.x drivers will work in Windows 10. Windows Vista and Windows 7 drivers can also be made to work, but may require manual installation through the windows device
 manager after running the AMD setup program. Here is link to another thread with some pointers contained within it on how to do that:</p>

<h2>            IE 11 &#40;Win 8.1 desktop version&#41; Stops Responding when using favorites</h2>
                    <p><strong>Issue: </strong></p>
<p>When a user attempts to navigate with favorites, IE stop responding as soon as they open the favorites drop down from both the Star icon and from Favorites menu item. Sometimes the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Random tidbit: </strong></p>
<p>When IE loads favorites, it attempts to show the websites' custom icon the left of the Favorite link. When the issue occurs, some (read: more than one) will have the standard IE blue/green globe to the left instead of the link's custom icon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Variable correlation to the users that are&nbsp;reporting the problem:</strong>
</p>
<p>-The favorites have been copied from their Windows 7 profile during intial setup of the new computer.</p>
<p>-Users who&nbsp;have reported the issue&nbsp;generally have many favorites (more than 20).</p>
<p>-Both machines have a local loopback proxy product (Webroot DWP), but even with it off the issue remains.</p>
<p>-User never had issues with favorites in IE9 on Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>Windows 8.1 x64 Enterprise</p>
<p>IE 11 32 bit</p>
<p>Add Ons: Adobe Reader Plugin for v11.x- all others are the preinstalled. Running in no-addon mode does not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Fresh build with all&nbsp;patches/updates via Windows Update.</p>
<p>I can replicate on a freshly built new system by simply copying the favorites to the appropriate folder.</p>
<p>Group Policy preferences (IE 10 Preferences&nbsp;under User policy)&nbsp;enforce:</p>
<p>-Homepage</p>
<p>-Launch settings (all metro links launch to desktop IE 11)</p>
<p>-Various advanced settings required by certain websites</p>
<p>-Trusted site settings</p>
<p>Even with GPO settings not applied, issue persists.</p>
<p>Group Policy enforces no favorites bar (disabled by GPO).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Steps taken to resolve the issue:</strong></p>
<p>-Load IE with no Add-Ons (no success)</p>
<p>-Reset Advanced IE Settings (no success)</p>
<p>-Uncheck/Recheck Use Software Rending instead of hardware (doesn't matter which configuration. Restarted after both changes. No success with either setting)</p>
<p>-Copied all favorites to a regular folder, navigated to all favorite links and made sure there were no broken links or redirects and cleaned up any that were unnecessary&nbsp;(no success)</p>
<p>-Deleted all IE temporary interenet files, including unchecking 'except for favorites' (no success)</p>
<p>-Exported favorites to bookmark.htm in IE11, Deleted all favorites under C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Favorites (including Desktop.ini), Reset IE Settings under Tools -&gt; IE options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Reset, then reimported favorites (no success).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a handful of other troubleshooting items that were performed as well. Unfortunately, none of them worked.

            <p>My initial reaction is to reject your assistance wholesale as the issue occured when migrating from 2 separate&nbsp;Windows 7 machines (with different payloads of software based on user job roles)&nbsp;that were not corrupt and did&nbsp;not contain any viruses (nor&nbsp;had
 ever aquired malware/viruses/PUAs)&nbsp;per Webroot SA &amp; Microsoft Defender; but, I realize you're attempting to help and do not have any previous knowledge or background with these machines so I am happy to give credence to the&nbsp;possibility that the favorites links
 themselves could be corrupt (even though they were happily working on IE9 in Windows 7.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method I use for migrating favorites is to copy the contents of the favorites folder - excluding the any non-user created subfolders - via SMB of a UNC. Example:
\\&lt;IP of Old&gt;\c$\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\Favorites to (new Computer) C:\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\Favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not exported from Windows 7 (IE9)&nbsp;and imported to Windows 8.1 (IE11). I have copied to 8.1 then exported from 8.1 and reimported back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll give that a try and let you know if it resolves the issue. </p>
<p>

            <p>I don't meant to be combative but that is not a helpful post; it lacks context. What feature - specifically -&nbsp;are you referring to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you suggesting I turn off and then back on IE 11? I'm not ruling out doing this but to consider this advice as a valid means for fixing the issue I would have to accept the idea that IE is sensitive (read: fragile) enough to be corrupted by copying sub-100
 favorites from a functioning IE9/Win7 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, for whatever reason the following has helped allieviate the issue:<br />
- Export the list to an htm file.</p>
<p>- On a separate system - so as not to interupt my user's workday&nbsp;- Open with notepad and manually navigate to each favorite.</p>
<p>- Recreate the favorites one by one</p>
<p>- Export list to htm file and transfer to user's computer</p>
<p>- Delete the favorites folder contents (C:\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\Favorites)</p>
<p>- Clear IE History for good measure</p>
<p>- Import the htm file (notice that the problem still perists by expanding favorites and clicking on a couple links - kill IE process&nbsp;when it does freeze)</p>
<p>- Navigate in Windows Explorer (now called File Explorer in 8.1) to C:\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\Favorites and simply view the folder (which will load the icon files). If none are the generice IE blue/green globe, close Windows Explorer and return to IE to see the
 issue almost completely rememdied (based purely on observation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no logical or reasonable explanation for why this helped in this instance nor am I confident that I can reproduce the results.</p>

<p>Is the Favorites folder indexed?&nbsp; And is AutoComplete for Address bar enabled?&nbsp; If so, you should be able to&nbsp;find and launch Favorites that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Related to the first question, other W8.1 users discovered that if the Favorites folder was not indexed, e.g. if it was not in a standard "library" that they could not see their Favorites.&nbsp; If that is what is happening here it is the first time that I am

            <p>Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Favorites folder is indexed by default in Windows 8.1. Autocomplete is also on by default.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That could be a viable way to access the favorites without having to actually open the favorites list (either from the star or from the menu bar).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears the steps I listed above have resolved the issue -&nbsp;I don't fully understand why. Maybe indexing was caught up at that point and when&nbsp;I recreated the items it indexed them between when&nbsp;I first imported them and when I browsed to the folder, viewed
 them and then relaunched IE. Unlikely but as good of a guess as I have for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time I see the issue,&nbsp;I will attempt to run a manually kicked off index crawl on the folder. My users can see their favorites in the list, but upon opening the favorites list IE hangs - sometimes when they first open&nbsp;favorites other times on the 2nd
 or 3rd opening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all cases where it froze, the linked icon file for one or more of the sites would show up looking like the blue/green generic globe icon similar to the following:</p>

            <p>This issue has not been resolved to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see it repeatedly with fresh builds and copied over Favorites. Because my users don't generate favorites lists instantly (meaning new hires don't immediately have 50 new favorites), I don't have a test case where the favorites have not been copied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that it is not related to the indexing issue described above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may well be our Webroot Desktop Webroot Proxy - it appears to be related at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been migrating users to Chrome when the issue arises while i wait for our vendor to release a supported IE11/Win 8.1 proxy.</p>

    <title>Build 16232 currupting Surface bios - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techjunkiesca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 16232 currupting Surface bios</h2>
                    After installing these builds on a Surface Pro 3 and Surface Book, I am unable to recover either device using the Surface Recovery USB image or the Windows 10 recovery media. I took the SP3 to the Microsoft Store where they were also unable to recover
 via their USB media, and for a minute, told me that I would need to purchase a new device. One tech had the idea of recovering the bios, which they tried, that fixed my issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I now am in the same position with the Surface Book. My questions are, do we have access to any bios recovery tools? Is anyone else having this problem? I really don't want to make the long trips to the MS store again. Thank you for any feedback.

            Contact the Surface support site on the internet. Surprised that the MS store told you that as the Insiders/Preview builds don't have any direct support from MS. Checking the Feedback Hub I didn't find much input using your issue, spelling corrected (currupting&nbsp;surface

<h2>            Reoccurring Update</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
the last update i got which is Windows 10 Insider Preview 18890.1000 (rs_prerelease). And every since i got the build i am having problem with updates. i am already using the DEV and it works well for me, but i got all of these when it update the first time
 in april but now that one build is continually trying to update over and over again, all day long. it is slowing everything down.my computer is still trying to update the same build over and over again.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
It would be nice if they would add a feature to the updates so we could stop some of the updates from continually trying to update to the same ones. we could take care of this error.</p>

<p>Do you know if you successfully upgraded to 18890, or is 18890 the update that is failing?&nbsp; To check your current build, look under Settings - System - About or run winver.exe and tell us your current build number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the update fails, what is shown as the reason or error?</p>
<p>

<p>You could also try running SetupDiag from Microsoft to try to analyse what is wrong, but the standard methods that RogerW2 has referenced will likely resolve whatever SetupDiag might find.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - crashed and does not start up saying something is wrong with one of your data files</h2>
                    <p>Hi, &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other night I tried to delete all emails older than 120 days on my home laptop using the 'clean-up' facility within the program. &nbsp;I set it running and it seemed to delete all emails but then it crashed and the Microsoft Inbox repair tool came up. &nbsp;I
 pressed OK, it processed for a while and said all was OK. &nbsp;I then restatrted Outlook and it failed to open giving me the message "Something is wrong with one of your data files and Outlook needs to close. &nbsp;Outlook might be able to fix your file click OK to
 run the repair tool" &nbsp;I've tried this and starting up in safe mode but neither works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to get it back? &nbsp;Should I delete the programme and reload it? &nbsp;If so how do I get it again (I am on an annual subscription)? &nbsp;Alternatively would it b ebetter to add the email account (a POP3) to my 'outlook - mail' which is also loaded
 on to my laptop &nbsp;(used at the momemnt for hotmail only). &nbsp;I am not really sure how this differs from Outlook 2016!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know your thoughts. &nbsp;Ivan</p>

    <title>Outgoing Mail is rejected from hotmail.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rph965  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outgoing Mail is rejected from hotmail.com</h2>
                    <p>I have sent emails for months to the same email address and suddenly they are being blocked from being sent:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From: postmaster+AEA-mail.hotmail.com +AFs-mailto:postmaster+AEA-mail.hotmail.com+AF0-
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Above is the postmaster blocking my account from sending to this person. I called them and they can get my emails through another server at a university. The email address I am sending to has not blocked my email and has my email address listed as safe in
 Spam Assassin. They have plenty of room for emails to be received and they quota is unlimited so no problem there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent the email bounce message to IT at the university who indicated it is hotmail.com postmaster who is blocking emails from being sent to this email address. I checked my spam filter and they are not in the spam filter. They are in my address book as
 a good email address. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I get this corrected and get your servers to reopen this domain so I can send emails out. I looked everywhere for a form for me to fill out to advise you that your mailserver is blocking my outgoing mail to this one domain. Please look into this
 and give the address of the form to go to fill out to get your tech team to fix this and either whitelist the domain I am sending to or the email address I send to. Thanks.</p>

            Hi Lord,<br />
<br />
It’s not feasible to achieve your goal via an inbox rule or transport rule. However, you can try the following as a workaround:<br />
<br />
1. Sign in to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Admin center</a> <strong>as admin</strong> and create a Distribution Group(DG).<br />
<br />
2. Add the Bcc recipients as the members of the DG.<br />
<br />
Next time when you want to add the recipient to the Bcc box, please<strong> add the DG in the Bcc box instead</strong>. In this way, the Bcc recipient can receive your email and you won’t receive an automatic reply from him/her.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: You need to turn on <strong>Senders inside and outside of my organization</strong> if you want to allow people outside the organization to send emails to this DG.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Violet

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can spellcheck with a macro. ALT+F11 to open VB editor, right click 'ThisWorkbook' and insert module and paste the code below in. Change the password (2 places) to your password and run the code.</p>
<p>2057 is the UK English disctioary and 1033 is the US</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Spellcheck()<br />
ActiveSheet.Unprotect Password:="Mypass"<br />

<h2>            Strange issues in Word 2016 comparing to Word 2013 regrading to unicode bi-directional control characters handeling in a RTL language</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Upon investigating on why some documents written in Word 2013, are not being displayed correctly in Word 2016, i came to conclusion that there are some dramatic changes and most likely bugs regarding to bi-directional text handling in Word 2016. I
 will try to explain the steps that i took and provide some screenshots comparing word 2013 and word 2016 in this matter.</p>
<p>The language that I'm using is Persian. however, its likely applicable to any other RTL language as well. I am also not an expert in bi-directional Unicode handlings and standards which is why I'm posting it here in hoping maybe someone could shed some light
 on it.</p>
<p>The best way to explain this is through an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After setting the paragraph direction to RTL, I'm going to type some characters in the exact order provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81e0460a-a757-4e36-8a3f-2954cd68525b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81e0460a-a757-4e36-8a3f-2954cd68525b" /></a></p>
<p>SP is for Space. Also note that typing will be done entirely while the keyboard is set to Persian and Numeral display is set to Context so they will appear in Persian too. for non-Persian readers, here's the Persian numbers from 0 to 9:</p>

</p><p><strong>Word 2013:</strong></p>
<p>typing the letters just as is will result in:</p>

<p>Placing an LTR mark between the 6th and 7th letter will result in:</p>

<p>Placing an LTR Embedded mark between the letter No. 6th and 7th and an PDF mark between the letter No. 28th and 29th, will result in:</p>

<p>Placing an LTR Override mark between the letter No. 6th and 7th and an PDF mark between the letter No. 28th and 29th, will result in:</p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c480a72b-717c-483e-be5f-3e74fa0bcfcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c480a72b-717c-483e-be5f-3e74fa0bcfcc" /></a><br />
<p>
</p><p>As you can see only LTR Override works correctly and everything is in the right ordering. the three other variants, hardly make any difference at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Word 2016:</strong></p>
<p>Some weird stuff going on in word 2016 which not only are completely incompatible with Word 2013, it also seems to not be possible to get the correct visual ordering without changing the logical ordering (which of course again in most cases makes it incompatible
 with word 2013).</p>
<p>1-typing the letters just as is will result in:</p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2419d9c-44ea-4da7-b452-41842ae78eef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2419d9c-44ea-4da7-b452-41842ae78eef" /></a><br />
<p>2-Placing an LTR mark between the 6th and 7th letter will result in:</p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/246fc231-9b31-4ee1-88fd-97cd956ec6a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/246fc231-9b31-4ee1-88fd-97cd956ec6a3" /></a><br />
<p>3-Placing an LTR Embedded mark between the letter No. 6th and 7th and an PDF mark between the letter No. 28th and 29th, will result in:</p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d563aa3-b7a9-4a1d-b698-2c0ceea5fd78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d563aa3-b7a9-4a1d-b698-2c0ceea5fd78" /></a><br />
<p>4-Placing an LTR Override mark between the letter No. 6th and 7th and an PDF mark between the letter No. 28th and 29th, will result in:</p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8888838a-e41b-4b87-8316-52be215d017c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8888838a-e41b-4b87-8316-52be215d017c" /></a><br />
<p>
</p><p>Now the first thing to notice is the incorrect handling of the '/' character. no matter what you do, it just does not want to play along. The '*' character also did not get affected by the LTR Mark (No. 2). Also notice the difference between handling of
 the decimal ( . ) character in the two Word versions(which is likely completely a different issue). Now let's save the file and reopen it again. suddenly Word 2016 stops even trying to correct visual displaying anymore. The normal(No. 1) and LTR mark(No. 2)
 paragraphs stay the same. however the paragraphs containing LTR Embedded(No. 3) and LTR Override marks(No. 4), are being displayed exactly like the LTR mark(No. 2) paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Also did try 'LTR Run'. however, Word seems to convert the Numeral to English which i do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to make sense of these results. Can anyone help please?</p>

            <p>Hello Sushma, sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you pointing out the feedback option and i just might do that, however, i hardly see this as an 'additional feature'. if you read my post, i did not ask for any new feature to be added, but rather those that are already there, are not working
 properly. this is more of a bug than requesting a new feature. for example, i do not see how wanting to not loose your visual ordering upon saving and re opening the file, or the huge incompatibility between this version of office and office 2013 regarding
 to unicode bi-directional handling, could be considered new features that would require feedback.</p>

            <p>Hi Nevam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can't reduce it's size and you can't move it.&nbsp; In a way you're actually lucky, because the MSE definition&nbsp;folder is much smaller than most of the other AV/AM products out there&nbsp;because it supplements it with SpyNet.&nbsp; But there are other ways to gain
 space and improve performance on your system.&nbsp; As you didn't mention, I'm assuming it's Vista or Windows 7.&nbsp; If XP, some of this will work but it may require different programs&nbsp; and different procedures (or it may not apply).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my little blurb on improving space and speed (you can ignore the speed ones if you want, but often they are closely related and it won’t hurt to address both anyway) in Vista or Windows 7 systems (and it also suggests other things of value that you
 can consider or ignore - the choice is entirely yours). All of this is your choice, actually - I'm just presenting some options that may help and that have helped many others (and that I pretty much use myself though sometimes I do procrastinate I'm sad to
 admit and there are some things I won't do no matter how beneficial - for example, I refuse to delete my cookies (but that's a personal choice as I prefer the benefits of having them when going to previously-visited web sites over the limited amount of space
 recovered and speed gained given their small size)). Much of this should be part of normal maintenance, but that includes some other things (like creating periodic system restore points - probably at least weekly as they don't necessarily improve speed, space
 or performance and may in fact even do the opposite in some cases) not addressed here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system. There are ways to handle this (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course
 the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at
 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM (well, almost 4GB, more like 3.5 actually) and the 64-bit version can use even more). If space
 is the issue, replace your hard drive with a larger one, add a second hard drive (if it is a desktop system), or add an external hard drive. Those are hardware answers (which cost money). We'll now discuss software solutions (which are mostly if not entirely
 free - at least the options presented here - there are 3rd party programs that provide additional options but they really aren't necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster or Enhancer, or Repairer or Fixer software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you have thousands of errors just to get you to download
 and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause). Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install
 to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise). Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
To improve your speed and space, do Disk Cleanup using: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</a><span> in Vista or </span>
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/818-disk-cleanup-open-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Disk Cleanup - Open and Use - Windows 7 Forums</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will
 harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files. If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then
 that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</a><span> in Vista or
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Optimize-Windows-7-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Optimize Windows 7 for better performance</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Do all of the options (or at the very least, consider
 them - many can help a great deal).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least once every month or so, run CCleaner <a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.piriform.com/</span></a> with as many options as you choose to delete (but be
<strong><span>careful</span></strong> because this program if not used properly and with caution and with you paying attention to what you are doing can delete important and even critical files that could cause a great deal of trouble).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clearing out your temporary files can also save you much space and improve performance and while some of the above will clear a lot of the temp files, they won't cover them all. This will. I recommend running it every month or two. It is TFC by Old
 Timer </span><a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/TFC-Temp-File-Cleaner-OldTimer-file187.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TFC - Temp File Cleaner by OldTimer - Geeks to Go Forums</span></a><span> and you should download and save it to your desktop. When run,
 it will close everything else, so be sure to save anything you're working on and basically close all your programs. If it asks (and when done even if it doesn't ask), reboot to complete the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced. It's a trade-off. The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points you will be able to retain -but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough to
 save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them). Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html</a><span> in Vista or
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/5482/make-system-restore-use-less-space-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/5482/make-system-restore-use-less-space-in-windows-7/</span></a><span> in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears. Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup. That will probably be the majority of items there - if
 not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient). This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup). When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary,
 I noticed startup was quicker, response times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster. Better still, download Autoruns
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you
<strong><span>can’t</span></strong> delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which
<strong><span>MUST</span></strong> not be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system). If unsure, leave it alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources). Windows Defender is a good AS program. The free Microsoft Security Essentials
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well. If you're using MSE, you don't really
 need Defender and MSE will deactivate it when installed (but you would with many other AV programs - though some of them also deactivate Defender). I would also suggest downloading
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a> and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Word 2016 for Mac - can&#39;t see images and charts when opening a doc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2016 for Mac - can&#39;t see images and charts when opening a doc sent to me &#40;but can in the preview pane&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I've just upgraded to Office 2016 for Mac in order to open a work doc that was sent to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the doc has images and charts in it - a colleague who has a PC can see them, and I can see them in the preview pave in Finder (this is probably because if I open the doc in the Mac Preview app they appear fine as well!). It's a .docx, and was sent
 from a PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first opened the doc Word 2016 opened it in compatibility mode - I have clicked File &gt; Convert but makes no difference, images still not there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? This is an important doc...</p>

<h2>            Error 80070490 Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble with the Error code 80070490 whilst setting up and synching my&nbsp;Microsoft account on my new Lumia 930 on RTM WP 8.1. I also have two other phones associated with that account that have no sync errors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the advice here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-sync/error-code-80070490-when-syncing-windows-live/0c5f4ebc-4afa-43a7-8a9d-2d8e7a7dac46">

<p>
</p><p>I've tried restoring a back&nbsp;up of one of the phones instead of setting up from scratch and I have the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also checked Xbox account and billing settings, checked my Microsoft account personal details, checked region is as it should be, disabled and reenabled backups, stopped and started email syncing, removed MS account links to Facebook and Twitter, changed
 my primary calendar, moved recent emails from my inbox,&nbsp;changed my MS password.... all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on a remedy for this, I'm at a loss to know what else there is to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hello jpnz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for posting in the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try a soft reset with your phone (hold the power button + volume down for around 20 seconds).</p>
<p>When your phone is turned on again make sure date and time are set up correct.</p>
<p>Then try again to sync your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if that helped,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            <p>I am also having this problem. I've tried the same remedies John has. Presumably we found the same answers when searching the web. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem began when I was forced to do a hard reset of my Lumia 635 yesterday to resolve an issue with WiFi Calling. (But that's a whole 'nother story.) With the exception of WiFi Calling, everything was working fine since I got the phone a couple of months
 ago. Now after the hard reset, neither my Microsoft account nor Twitter will sync on my phone. Twitter gives error code 0. The Microsoft account error is 80070490.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; I had it on my Nokia lumia 1020, then bought HTC one ME got same problem, battery drains in 5 hours.&nbsp; Clearly not a phone issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to find someone who can answer this issue and its frustrating to say the least.&nbsp; Im on with HTC now.&nbsp; All they can say is do a hard reset.&nbsp; I said how will that work, the phone was brand new a week ago fresh set up. Only thing in common was my
 MS e-mail account. Which has Twitter and LinkedIn tied to it.&nbsp; It synced the first time after about 4 or more hours. then it seemed fine till the enxt day when it just starts synching and keeps on syncing.&nbsp; Phone is burning 12.5% per hour no matter what.&nbsp;

            <p>Thomas, did the problem appear after updating your 1020 to WP 8.1? I have the same issue, and I'm suspecting Twitter account might be the culprit. I haven't got a chance to try it, but perhaps you can try to unlink the Twitter (or even LinkedIn) account
 and see how it goes.</p>

            <p>I, think the same thing but I can't get the account unlinked. Tried both deleting on phone, no luck, doesn't delete. And also disconnecting on live. Can't get it discovered there either. HTC asked me to try a hard reset, so I'm doing that now. If it down
 work I may create new life acct and hard reset phone again and use new account. Really frustrating what otherwise is a great phone.

            <p>OK so here is an update.&nbsp; Thanks for Thanksgiving and the time to try some things, I think I have figured out one of the big issues with phone battery problems on Win 8.1 and 8.0 before it.&nbsp; I will say I think only because THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE CAUSE
 BUT I WILL TELL YOU WAHT I DID AND THE EFFECTS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had an issue with battery drain on and off for quite a while with multiple Windows Phones and versions of Win 8.&nbsp; Starting with Lumia 925, then another 925, then a 1020 and most recently an HTC ONE me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first my phones would go for about 6m months and then go into some form of a loop and drain the battery.&nbsp; The first was some kind od data loop. and would just start to download data to the toon of abou 5gb in one 9 hour period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the phone back they gave me another 925. 6 months later the same issue but the loop drained the battery instead of running my phone bill through the roof.&nbsp; Not sure what it was but after the second drip they upgraded me to the 1020.&nbsp; Liked the phone,
 but from beginning there was poor battery life.&nbsp; In the past month or so it was down to draining in about 3 hours. nothing changed the problem, even loaded the Dev sys. Still in a few hours battery dead.&nbsp; Kept seeing the Microsoft account, and linked twitter
 and LinkedIn accounts synching all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another trip to AT&amp;T and a new phone HTC ONE me. Amazingly the same dame thing.&nbsp; Clearly not a hardware or battery problem.&nbsp; And again nothing changed the burn rate.&nbsp; I could turn off almost everything and still burn baby burn...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to think it was either the MSN account having some kind of puke problem or linkedin and/or twitter (I have about 19,000 followers so tried to delete them but It never would happen.&nbsp; They stayed linked.&nbsp; I tried on the phone and on live.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally yesterday, I spent turkey day redoing my Microsoft Account, trying, mostly successfully to migrate the data I wanted to the new account and then reset and reload the HTC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO before I did this, my phone would burn between a minimum of 12% and as high as 28% per hour.&nbsp; Once it started to heat up you could just watch the batter usage climb.&nbsp; After creating a new Microsoft account and starting fresh, It is like I got a new, phone
 and it works as I would have expected at the start, as opposed to the after the jaded attitude I developed because the recently experiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with GPS running now I do not go above 8%.&nbsp; IN regular operation it is about 2.8 to 3% per hour burn.&nbsp; I now believe it was one of these three things that was the issue(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Something messed up in my old MSN account (I have had it for many, many years - before Hotmail came to be and the domain names were all msn.</p>
<p>2.) The amount of twitter followers was straining the time it takes to sync the people data...&nbsp; Since I was not able to disconnect the twitter connection from the msn account or the phone I cant tell for sure, but that gives me some additional belief there
 was an account problem of some kind.</p>
<p>3.) LinkedIn account was causing a problem.&nbsp; Although I do not think it was LinkedIn as I do not have all that many connected accounts there - a few hundred. Although, it could be some combination of all three.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now going to reconnect the Twitter and Linked Account to the new Microsoft account and see if I can break it again, although I am only doing this now because curiosity has the better of me. This was a monumental pain in the ****. I do not really want
 to do it again but I do value, for some strange reason - I suspect is simple addiction - the connection of the account to Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post another update if I find anything out further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will make its way to Microsoft, particularly the Live guys and see if they can run down this problem.&nbsp; It no longer seems to me to be phone, Win 8 or 8.1, battery or hardware related.&nbsp; At least in my incidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time will tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I know, and even this surprises me!&nbsp; Good Luck, Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

            <p>OK it has been a few days since I effect3ed my changes to try to isolate and correct the problem described in the prior posts.&nbsp; I am happy to say they worked fine, albeit with displacement of my prior account and additional work to move e-mails and other
 information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the last post, I have reconnected Mt Twitter account and my LinkedIn account. My sync now appears to be working as I would expect it.&nbsp; I have been using my phone most of today in a typical business day and I still have 70% battery left at 6:40PM. By
 now, before the fix, I would have had to have charged my phone at least twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem, and I suspect others, with mysterious batter burn is stemming from a problem in the Microsoft Account.&nbsp; In my case the MS account would never complete the sync of its information and the linkedin and twitter accounts. Once I created a new MS
 account then all went back to working as described.&nbsp; I do see that the outlook.com address server is different from the old .msn account but other than that I do not see a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Twitter and Linked in only added about 1% to my battery drain.&nbsp; I can not assure anyone they have the same problem, but in my case this has been the only thing that worked.&nbsp; If it had not I was going to be forced to take my MS Phone back and get an iPhone
 - something I really did not want to do.&nbsp; I am happy to say all is now well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps someone at Microsoft can find out what the hell is wrong with the Live.com accounts and syncing???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Till that happens the prior post was how I fixed my issue and how it evidenced itself.&nbsp; Hopefully this will help others.</p>

            <p>It has now bee a couple weeks and my phone is getting great battery life, so far no further sign of any extraneous draining.&nbsp; I believe the issue is in old ms accounts&nbsp; and their links to facebook, linked and or twitter.&nbsp; After I made a new MS account and
 relinked those services no sync loops are appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think its in the phone or Win 8 or 8.1.&nbsp; I think its in the MS Account side.</p>

<p>Dear expert,</p>
<p>I have this formula which I want to use</p>

Here's a non-volatile formula.</p>
<p>Let's assume you enter the first formula in cell A1 and copy down column A.</p>
<p>=INDEX(E$7:E$35&amp;".",(ROWS(A$1:A1)-1)*8)&amp;INDEX(F$7:F$35&amp;".",(ROWS(A$1:A1)-1)*8)&amp;INDEX(G$7:G$35&amp;".",(ROWS(A$1:A1)-1)*8)&amp;INDEX(H$7:H$35&amp;".",(ROWS(A$1:A1)-1)*8)+J$25</p>
<p>Adjust for the correct last row: 35</p>

<h2>            How to activate Office XP on Windows Vista, will no longer let me.</h2>
                    Office XP will not allow me to activate over the internet, and there are no phone numbers on the phone activation option. &nbsp;I'm running Vista SP2. &nbsp;I formated the drive recently and re-installed the factory programs, and re-installed Office XP, which I
 had bought myself separately. &nbsp;I've done a few times over the years and never had a problem. &nbsp;Is there a way to activate this product again? &nbsp;Why won't it let me activate? &nbsp;Thank you, James

What can you do if Office product activation is refused?</p>
<p>If phone activation fails you can ask the same person for help though most likely it’s a mix-up with the activation code.</p>
<p>If you don’t get an activation code, Microsoft staff should explain why authorization can’t be given. If they can’t, then ask to speak to a supervisor. Try to find out exactly what the problem is and ask about further appeals process.</p>

    <title>Date Criteria in Access Query - Query Design - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drobcek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Date Criteria in Access Query - Query Design</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a query that has worked before and now is not returning records due to date criteria.</p>
<p>When I remove the date it runs correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data type of the field in table is "Date/Time" and my criteria in query is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Between #1/1/2014# AND #12/31/2014#</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seems to be setup correctly. When I change the condition to text I do get the expected error of data type mismatch so switched it back to the true data/time format, still 0 records when creating the output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the suggestions. I've tried the date criteria on other fields and it worked withouth a hitch.</p>
<p>I removed all of the criteria and started over with adding the date first and running it and then adding the rest on and it works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what it was, but deleting and re-entering one by one seems to work.</p>
<p>Thank you for your efforts.</p>
