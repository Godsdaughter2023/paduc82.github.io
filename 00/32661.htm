</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You don’t need to set up two user accounts to toggle between different languages.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to toggle the language on your computer:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Start.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “Region and Language” in the Start search box and hit “Enter.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Keyboards and Languages.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under “Display Language”, select the display language you wish to.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Apply.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You will be prompted to log-off for the settings to take effect.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Log-off and re-login for the new language to take effect.

            Is this for WIndows Update?  
<br /> 
<br />
<br />There's a lot of turmoil with Windows Updates right now, with problematic Updates being withdrawn and updated while a half billion PC's are being rescanned constantly to sort each them all out.  So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give it a few weeks to sort itself out. 
<br />
<br />If it is interfering or you don't want to wait then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:   <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Windows%2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search....</a>
<br />
<br />If Updates cause problems you can find out which one by checking at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and uninstall them there.  
<br />
<br />You can block Windows Updates and Version Updates:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-unwanted-windows-updates-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-unwanted-wi...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install this tool to tell you exactly your level of protection needed for the CPU threat that has lately caused some disruption, how it may affect performance, and what you can do about it:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You can get more control over Windows Updates with some new features in the last two versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update under Restart Options and set Active Hours when you don't' want to be bothered.
<br />
<br />As a last resort, you can set a Metered Connection or disable Windows Update service and only install the Version Updates twice a year when you are ready via the most stable method - which isn't Windows Update anyway, but by running it from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  All previous Updates are rolled up in the Version Update.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>The reply was an insult to my intelligence.&nbsp; Did you think that I didn't know that I could purchase a yearly subscription to not have ads?????&nbsp;&nbsp; REALLY? that was your answer........&nbsp; I will tolerate the ads if they did not play multiple ads 5&nbsp;to 7&nbsp; times
 before booting the game.&nbsp; I feel that is an abuse of my time..... as I said you lost me as a customer.......

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would also suggest you to start your computer in safe mode and check for the issue.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Advanced startup options including safe mode<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a></div>
<div>If it works fine in safe mode, try performing clean boot and check for the issue. Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program
 manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

    <title>Horrible predictive typing for Chinese input methods in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Horrible predictive typing for Chinese input methods in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I want to type traditional Chinese using Pinyin and Google Pinyin doesn't work on Windows 10. Two options I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Microsoft Pinyin, with "Character set" set to "Traditional Chinese"</p>
<p>(2) Microsoft Bopomofo, with the "Keyboard layout" set to "Hanyu Pinyin"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both allow you to type Chinese, but they are horrifically slow because:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- MS Pinyin turns off all personalization options when Traditional Chinese is activated, so the system does not learn your preferred character combinations. This is insane, and I can't see any good technical reason for it.</p>
<p>- On top of that, character prediction in both systems is *AWFUL* compared to any other input method I've every used (even old MS input methods on Windows 7 and before). What is going on here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>- Is there a way to get personalization for any Pinyin input method with Traditional Chinese? Are there decent alternative IMEs that do the same thing without bombarding you with spam or spying on you?</p>
<p>- Does Microsoft has a plan to develop less awful input methods? Entering text efficiently using a keyboard is a fairly important basic function for a computer...

            Google's Pinyin IME doesn't work on Windows 10 I guess, so I just started using Sogou Pinyin IME. There's a setting for traditional. All of the installation screens and settings are in simplified Chinese, so you'll need to know how to read Chinese already
 or use the Google Translate app's AR feature to see what it says (otherwise you'll install Baidu, Weibo, etc.) Once it's done, the predictions are better, there are themes for the prediction popup, you can switch to traditional, etc. It's a little bloated
 for what should just be a simple keyboard utility but it offers a better experience than Microsoft... which I think is terrible.&nbsp;

<p>I've tried out Sogou before, and it is was really efficient as an IME. However, as you say, it is really bloated (lots of cartoonish themes, adware, and what not).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much more importantly, it has an extremely sloppy approach to privacy. For instance, cloud prediction essentially sends your input stream to a server in the PRC. That was a deal breaker for me, especially since I am an academic working in Taiwan and use
 my computer for work (and for typing in passwords).</p>

    <title>Skype split screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p.lee007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype split screen</h2>
                    <p>I enjoyed using the old version of Skype as whilst I was on a call my screen showed the person I was calling plus a small box showing myself. When I needed to show an object or document to the person I was calling I could drag my small picture onto the main
 screen and it would change to half and half showing both parties in equal video size. This was most useful as I could then see clearly what I was showing to the person I was chatting to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in their wisdom Skype seems to have stopped that facility on Apple Mac computers but I know it still works on windows. Maybe this is another reason why I am hearing more often that people are leaving Skype due to the updates taking away all the good
 bits with Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone knows how to get the half and half look back please let me know.</p>

I read your previous reply Vijay and you obviously know nothing about Skype as I have been using split screen for a long while on my iMac and the person I am calling can also use split screen on his windows computer.

            Why are Skype making things worse - I am talking at the moment with someone in USA and he is able to see me on half of his screen and himself on the other half so he is able to see the object he is currently showing me - I asked him what version he is
 on and he is on version 8.40.0.70 so I have told him not to update as he would be worse off like me. I think we will all be leaving Skype soon as it seems to be getting worse and worse.

<p>You mention that the resize facility was available on version 8.40 and indeed I did enjoy using it when I was on that version - I have obviously made a mistake in updating to version 8.41 as the update seems to be worse than the previous version. &nbsp;Do you
 know if I can go back to the previous version ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that fewer and fewer people are using Skype now as I used to have quite a few people on my list to Spype and now I only have a couple of people and they are still on the previous version as I have told them not to update.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have received my Microsoft Surface Laptop today and I am more than happy with the laptop itself, working more than great, the only concern I have is that the power supply brick is making a whine noise ocasionally when the laptop is under load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still under shop warrany refund where i can bring my laptop back to my local retailer but i need to bring everything back rather than just the power brick. I'd like to know if Microsoft could replace me the power brick since i'm still under its warranty
 until 2021.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Does that also apply for a folder within the picture library because I have a folder with everything in it sorted by name but when I open up the folder in the photo app they are all in a weird order

            Would also appreciate a solution to this. Very upsetting as this seems like a very very simple piece of coding. Nothing worse than a product with unfulfilled potential - very unsatisfying. I've seen a MS response that there may be 3rd party apps out there
 that better support what kind of file organization this entails. So, I guess the best iteration of this operating system isn't 'Microsoft' Windows, but rather '3rd Party' Windows.

            <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>It appears that the Windows 8 Photo App sorts pictures by the "Modified Date &amp; Time" time-stamp in the photograph.<span>
</span>Would you like to force it to sort pictures by name or number -- and make yourself a little crazy in the process -- at least until Microsoft steps-up and includes a "Sort By" or "View By" option?<span>&nbsp;</span>Open your pictures in Explorer; select a
 picture; open "Properties;" and select "Details." Now look for and click on an option at the bottom of the dialog box that says "Remove Properties and Personal Information." The "Remove Properties" dialog box will open with an option to "Create a copy with
 all possible properties removed;" click "Okay."<span> </span>Rename the new picture in some organized way...I usually tag my photos with 001a&lt;Label&gt;&lt;Date&gt;, thus making the new one 001b&lt;Label&gt;&lt;Date&gt;...but any system that you are comfortable with works fine.
 Open the original picture's "Properties" and select "Hide" if you wish to keep it...this way it won't appear in the Windows 8 Photo App slideshow when viewing pictures.<span>&nbsp;</span>Your pictures should now sort by name or number when viewed in the Photos
 App slideshow...see below for further clarification.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>In order for this method to work, your pictures must be ordered in series by "Modified Date &amp; Time." So if the pictures in any particular folder or album were taken on different dates and with different devices, then it
 is necessary to "fool" the Photo App into thinking they were taken at a different time. When you use the method described above, the "Modified Date &amp; Time" becomes Today's date and time, in turn forcing the Photo App to sort by some other attribute, in this
 case by name or number. It is not necessary to re-do every picture in the folder, because this process truly is a pain in the neck.<span>&nbsp;However, i</span>t is necessary to modify every photo after the first one that is "out of sequence" so as to get every
 one else in line after it. Compulsive people will love doing this; "get 'er done" types will absolutely hate it. Perhaps Microsoft could make everybody happy just by adding a "Sort" feature to this otherwise handy app. And while they're at it, perhaps they
 can create the option to sort <u>Horizontally</u> and not just <u>Vertically</u> the way some of the other 3rd Party&nbsp;photo apps do. Many people, after all, still read from&nbsp;left-to-right.</font></font></font></p>

            <p>so really, as i am finding out, window 8 sucks. you can't do half the stuff you could do with xp. and not everyone has a bloody touch screen, for the working poor, those below poverty but have no choice but to buy a new computer because microsoft doesn't
 want to work with xp anymore, i find that so many simplified things are gone. any yes, what was the point of having a photo app if the pictures are messed up, out of order and all over the place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i guess the original question wasn't worded correctly for someone to give a correct answer, because i can't sort my photos in the photo app, only in the file explorer. but the pictures appear smaller, the photo they appear larger, easier to see. i want to
 eliminate any duplicates i might have.</p>
<p>but once again, microsoft has screwed me into paying them hundreds of dollars for what???? useless software!!!!</p>

    <title>LOCKED - Auto-renewal customer control only for Illinois - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            LOCKED - Auto-renewal customer control only for Illinois apparently&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Any apparent reason, outside of Illinois, &nbsp;having to call xbox to turn this off? &nbsp;I mean, its a complete pain. &nbsp;I have 3 accounts taht dont always get used every month cause I have friends over at my house all the time, because a lot of my buddies from collage
 have lan parties all the time, but we also go online. &nbsp;Well it is a bit on the stupid side that I have to call in every time or move to fricking Illinios, essentially, to get it to allow me to turn if off on the website. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, you really think your going to stop THAT many people from canceling vs the amount of calls your probably have to take because of this? &nbsp;And if you are that&nbsp;determined&nbsp;to have people call because you think you can talk them out of it at least give
 those of us who have mroe then 1 account to fricking turn auto renew off. &nbsp;Prepaid cards are not convienient and if you make any purchases with a CC with a prepaid card it gets the auto renewal anyway, so since I can make purchase of subscriptions online,
 you would think it makes ****ing sense that you can cancel it online. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand you're a business, and all, and you want to make it as time consuming as possible without going to far, to cancel an account, but I cant believe its worth it... I would have to think you guys get a lot of calls about this crap.</p>

<p>Ya, I figured I was not goint to get an answer to this... There really is no good reason to not have auto renewal, dunno why I was expecting a response, specially since I probably mentioned that Illinios can turn auto renwal off, from the website, I'm sure
 you don't want too many people knowing that.</p>

<p>if/dont/ ect... All I hear are excuses, not reasons. &nbsp;I made the subscription online, they already have options for certain states to take it off, it only makes sense to also let us turn off auto renwal online, heck they used to allow it! &nbsp;It is apparent
 that it is simply a means to discourage people form turning it off... </p>
<p>__</p>
<p>I get that they are a business, honestly, I do, and they wana make money, but it's just plain stupid to not let us do it on the website, if we are not in the "right" region. &nbsp;Now when I call they send me to a "member specialist" which then they try and get
 me to not turn it off... &nbsp;I mean really? &nbsp;They are willing to spend that &nbsp;money on phone support just to prevent me from turning off auto renwal? &nbsp;</p>
<p>That makes sense to you? &nbsp;Sigh... Like it is going to change anything, I was hoping for the off chance that someone would have a good excuse as to why its no longer available online for most area's, outside of the obvious.</p>

                    <p class="contentHeader1" style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Overview:</strong></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">I have been experiencing many BSODs. These can happen at random and sometimes in high intensive video games. I say again sometimes because this can happen when just browsing the web. Many different Bug checks
 have appeared so instead of posting every one I will post one of each.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">
</p><p class="contentHeader1" style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Tests I have tried:</strong></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">At first I thought that my computer had bad hardware and as so I tried many tests and solutions. I did Windows memtest three separate times. Every time it was fine. I tried 3D Mark to test if it could possible
 be the graphics card, the computer got through the first test no problem (which was with no SLI - see specs below) but the second time I tried it with SLI the computer crashed. I thought it might be the SLI bridge. Replacing it with a spare solved the issue
 when I ran it the second time. I still suspect is might be the second graphics card though as sometimes the display driver crashes and recovers within two second. Still not sure.</p>

            <p>HI Robert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also receiving this issue when I load a game called Phantasy Star Online 2. I upgraded my system to Windows 10 and of all the games i play this is the first one to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the error message on&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ntoskrnl.exe+14dd00 thats the address its hit 3 times now.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I attempted to update the game to see if this resolved the issue. As my system runs 4 1tb HDD in Raid i don't want them to corrupt with&nbsp;continues&nbsp;crashes.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I plan to upgrade my graphics card soon and was hoping to hold out till i buy it to format the machine and start again. I think what i will test in the mean time is reinstalling the
 full game. I believe the crashes are directly related to bad drivers since the upgrade. Hopefully if this is a known issue with Windows 10 then it will be looked at.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I always found it best to do a clean install of a OS rather than upgrading so that would be my suggestion to you. Did you upgrade from Windows 7 or 8?</span></p>

            I did an upgrade from windoes 8.1, by the way I think you are right about it being a case of bad drivers. Around 3 separate times I had my display driver crash playing Fallout 3 and Borderlands GOTY. By the way I did clean out my old drivers.

<h2>            BSOD after reinstalling windows 7 64 bit. All tests run OK, 6 month old HP G62-435dx</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my cpu was running great until 3 days ago. It is a 64 bit AMDII P540 dualcore processor in an HP G62-435DX.&nbsp; First I recovered to a Factory mode using the D: drive which was a backup partition.&nbsp; HP kept telling me that it was malware, but i think
 something is wrong with the hardware.&nbsp; I reinstalled Windows and still kept getting blue screens saying Driver IRQL not less or equal, and others... So HP sent me 3 recovery cds to try a fresh install. I did it last night and the computer ran for about 3 hours.
 Eventually it went to a blue screen again.&nbsp; I called HP and they told me to run the memory test and the hard drive tests, so I did again for the 4th time.&nbsp; Everything comes up no errors.&nbsp; I did a full system scan with Malware bytes and Microsoft security essentials
 and they found absolutely no malware.&nbsp; i didnt think it was malware because I had reformatted the C drive before using the 3 dvds to reinstall windows 7.&nbsp; And agin blue screen. I have those in a zip file if anyone here is interested.&nbsp; Now i a running a memory
 test again, because the screen has frozen several times, however I have found no errors with memory or harddrive.&nbsp; I ran an sfc /scannow last night twice and they finished successfully with no errors found. Please help i only have 39 days left on my warranty,
 so I need to solve this this week, and I dont want to send it back to HP because all they will do is try to reinstall windows again, which i did 3 times and still am getting random blue screens!</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, let me know what else you need to know</p>

    <title>Windows XP stuck in safe mode - please help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows XP stuck in safe mode - please help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently had a 'blue screen' on my laptop and I have no idea why. I have not recently installed new programs.</p>
<p>Now my laptop is stuck in 'safe mode'. Every time I restart, it starts in safe mode. I have tried doing a system restore, but it won't let me do that (is it because I am in safe mode?). it also won't allow me to copy my files onto a separate disk so I can't
 even back my files up.</p>
<p>en</p>
<p>I have tried to carry out some suggested actions - I have ran msconfig, clicked 'general' tab and clicked 'normal startup' but windows still doesn't load normally. I don't know what this means. Is there a problem with my hard disk? I have tried to check
 by doing 'error-checking' but it won't let me do that.</p>
<p>please help! My laptop is fairly old but before it dies completely I want to get my files off it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance...</p>

<p>Retrieve your data by one of the methods listed below. You may have hardware failure but without knowing the text of the blue screen (Stop Error) or doing any hardware testing, there is no way for me to know. After you get the data safely off, you can do
 the hardware troubleshooting yourself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot</a><br />
<br />
A&nbsp;good troubleshooting step is to boot with a Linux Live CD. I like Knoppix, but there are others. This has two advantages: 1) if the system will run, you can back up any data that missed your last backup; and 2) running the machine with Linux helps to determine
 if the problems are caused by software or hardware. If the machine is unbearably slow and/or Linux can't run correctly, you know the hardware is at fault. If the machine behaves perfectly under Linux, you know that software (Windows) is at fault.</p>
<p>Retrieving data when you can't get into Windows:</p>
<p>1. Pull the drive and put it in a USB drive enclosure or use a USB drive adapter. Attach this to a computer running a working install of XP/Vista/Windows7. Use the working Windows Explorer to copy the data to the rescue system's hard drive and then burn
 the data to cd or dvd or copy it to an external hard drive. I prefer not to do this if I know the drive is infected because there is a chance of infecting the host system. In these cases, I use #2 below.<br />
<br />
2. You can boot the target computer with a Bart's PE (XP only) or a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu and retrieve the data that way. This has the additional advantage of telling you whether the problems you're having are hardware or software-related
 because if the computer behaves perfectly under Linux you know that Windows (software) is the culprit. Conversely, if the computer misbehaves under Linux you will know that there is a hardware problem. Here is general information on using Knoppix for data
 retrieval when you can't get into Windows:<br />
<br />
You will need a computer with two cd drives, one of which is a CD/DVD burner <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> a USB thumb drive with enough capacity to hold your data <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> an external USB hard drive. Download the Knoppix .iso and create your bootable CD*. If you are doing this in an older operating system (XP or Vista), you'll need third-party burning software like Nero, Roxio, or the free<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a>
 (Windows 7 can burn .isos natively). Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the CD you created and the Windows files will be visible in Linux. If you want to burn CD/DVDs, there will be a Linux burning program to use.<br />
<br />
*If your computer only has one optical drive and you want to use that drive to burn data or need to test the drive, you can create a bootable USB thumb drive running Linux instead of a bootable CD. This website will show you how to do that -<a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pendrivelinux.com</a>

<p>Sounds like you now have or have had some malicious software.</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<p>Let's fix your boot problem first so you can boot normally, then remove any malicious software, then figure out your Blue Screen of Death (if you still have the problem) on your cleaned up system.</p>
<p>Using Explorer to navigate, locate your boot.ini file in the root of your boot drive (usually C:\boot.ini)<br />
<br />
While in Explorer and browsing C:\ click Tools, Folder Options, and on the View tab:<br />
<br />
Enable "Show hidden files and folders"<br />
Uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types"<br />
Uncheck "Hide protected operating system files"<br />
<br />
Now you should be able to see the c:\boot.ini file - we need to see what is in it.<br />
<br />
Open the c:\boot.ini file with a text editor (notepad, wordpad, etc.).<br />
<br />
Select all the text (Ctrl-A = Select All)<br />
Copy the selected text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C = copy)<br />
Close the editor of c:\boot.ini file without making any changes<br />
<br />
Paste the contents of the c:\boot.ini file (it is still on the Windows clipboard) back here for analysis (Ctrl-V = paste)</p>

    <title>Windows Vista Themes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Vista Themes</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I was just wondering a few things.. this has annoyed me for SUCH A LONG LONG LONG time. Is there anyone who can give me, or find a theme for Windows 10 that brings back Windows Vista's transparency, color *the grey* and like how things loaded, and did
 things? *Like when you would delete a file, it would go and have the blue line flowing across the tab, and the green bar, you know, generic* Also, is there one to change the windows 10 screen to a vista logon screen? Lastly, is there a sound pack for ALL of
 the windows vista sounds, that can be used for windows 10? I tried searching, and failed.. thanks!</p>
<p>

</p><p>Edit: Here is a picture of what I am talking about:<br />
(For this picture, just pay attention to the little tab, the one with that nice, pretty, grey transparency.)</p>

<h2>            Code 43-USB Port Not Working&#63;</h2>
                    Today, I was about to use my headphones, and I accidentally&nbsp;plugged the headphone jack&nbsp;in the usb port. Now, I just realized that my USB port is not working. The ports are Intel(R) ICH9 Family USB2 Enhanced Host Controller - 293C and Intel(R) ICH9 Family
 USB Universal Host Controller - 2939. I used Microsoft Fix It, but that didn't solve the problem what should I do?

<p>I am using an ordinary DELL laptop, nothing special and not very old either. I unstalled and reinstalled the newest version of Skype, no result. Skype had always worked perfectly on this laptop, it suddenly has changed after the latest updating.</p>

<p>Did all that. Didn't dare to disable anti-virus and firewall though, I'm not that skilled you know.</p>
<p>No change. Everything else is working, can't see a reason why I can't make outgoing and incoming (video)calls.... Computer is fast enough, webcam and loudspeakers are working, connection is good. What's wrong?</p>

            Since SFC and DISM tools weren't able to resolve the issue, our final option is to reset your PC. The operating system may already be corrupted, thus causing this issue. We suggest reinstalling Windows will help fix the problem. Check out this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/17085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>and follow the steps on <strong>Remove everything and reinstall Windows
</strong>section.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>To prevent any data loss, we suggest backing up important files on your PC.

    <title>Computer Shuts Down During Windows 10 Installation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer Shuts Down During Windows 10 Installation</h2>
                    <p>I am able to download Windows 10. I can go to the Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download folder and delete everything in there and stuff. All goes well until I hit the main Windows 10 installation screen, where it has a circular progress bar in the middle,
 and three tasks at the bottom of the screen (Copying Files, Configuring Settings, and something else). At that point, sometime around 13% total Windows 10 installation completion, my computer just shuts down. When I turn it back on, it attempts to recover
 the Windows 10 installation, but it immediately reverts back to the older Windows OS, thus rebooting Windows 7. Hence, I have to run Windows Update on Windows 7, download Windows 10 again, and repeat the process. There are no error codes or anything like that
 (i.e. error code 80240020 nor error code 80070103).</p>
<p>
</p><p>SPECS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Computer: hp Pavilion dv6-7013cl</p>
<p>- OS: Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I had this same issue, instead I used the windows 10 update tool and my previous OS was windows 8.1. My computer shut down at about 15% and before that it was going extremely slow. Does anyone have any luck with this issue?&nbsp;

            Hello Ron,
<br />
<br />Windows 10 does not have an official iMessage app or function.
<br />
<br />However, you can link your iPhone through the Settings menu.
<br />
<br />In the bottom left corner of your display, click your Start Menu and look for the gear icon.
<br />
<br />That’s your Settings Menu, and under the Mobile icon you will be able to link your phone that way.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />
<br />-Brien

                    <p>Hi there, so I bought a HP Pavilion for gaming and I realised that I cannot press 3 buttons at the same time. I can only press 2. Or when I press 1 button and try moving my cursor while holding the button it won't work. Is there any fix to this? I don't
 want to use another keyboard or mouse. I don't know if I put it into the right category.</p>

<p>Thank you for the prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like what we mentioned in our previous post, your concern might be a hardware limitation from the device manufacturer. That being said, it is possible that an updated device driver can rectify this. It would be best to contact the device manufacturer through
 their support site. Only the device manufacturer can provide you with the latest device driver that is specifically configured for your hardware component.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Should you need further help with other concerns in the future, you're always welcome to post back.</p>

<h2>            Parental Controls in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded a laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I have installed&nbsp;a 'test' child's account in the user "Family" group to see how this new version of Parental Control functions. I have blocked access to Facebook, Twitter and Messenger in the
 settings. Access is blocked when using Microsoft Edge, but not when using Internet Explorer 11 (I want to retain use of Internet Explorer 11 until MS Edge is slightly more refined than it is now). Anyone know what I'm doing wrong, or is this a bug?</p>

                    I have a Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000 webcam and I am not very pleased with the microphone. When I play guitar the audio sounds very distorted. Usually I would go into the settings and lower the gain however I can't see any controls for the gain. I changed
 the volume of the microphone but that didn't help. How can I control the microphone gain&nbsp;settings.

            <p>This could happen because of missing boot.ini file. Try below steps and see</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Insert and boot from your WindowsXP CD.

</p>
<div><span>2. At the first R=Repair option, press the R key
</span><br />
<div><span>3. Press the number that corresponds to the correct location for the installation of Windows you want to repair. Typically this will be #1
</span><br />
<div><span>4. Type bootcfg /list to show the current entries in the BOOT.INI file

            It is extremely unlikely that your hal.dll file is missing or corrupt.<br />
<br />
The problem is usually going to be that XP just can't find the file due to corruption of the NT File System (NTFS) or an afflicted boot.ini file that might be telling XP to look for the file in the wrong place.<br />
<br />
Note that XP will boot just fine if the boot.ini file is missing - it will complain as follows, but will still boot (if there are no other problems):<br />
<br />
Invalid BOOT.INI file<br />
Booting from C:\windows\<br />
<br />
You need to start with a chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; from the Recovery Console first - sometimes that is all you need to do.<br />
<br />
If you follow those directions to rebuild your boot.ini without renaming the current boot.ini first, you will be building on top of your potentially afflicted boot.ini (not a good idea).<br />
<br />
You need to get your system of unspecified make and model with unspecified XP version and Service Pack to boot into the XP Recovery Console and make repairs.<br />
<br />
If you have no genuine bootable XP installation CD from which you can boot into the XP Recovery Console, you can make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required).<br />
<br />
Before embarking on your repair mission, It would help to know more about your system:<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
