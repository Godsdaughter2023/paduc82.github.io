<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I just got a new laptop (Acer Aspire 7738g) and after installing an update the dvd drive stopped reading ANY dvd or CD I put in! They worked twice, after installing a registry booster programme, but even so it was
 VERY slow and the following day it wasn't reading them anyway!</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Any idea what it might be? The drivers are fully updated.</span></strong></p>

    <title>Download ISO image after windows anytime upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toucki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Download ISO image after windows anytime upgrade</h2>
                    Hi, I have Windows 7 Home Basic x32 edition and now I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional x32 via Windows Anytime Upgrade program.
<div>I'm a software developer and I need to have 100% standard Windows 7 Pro x32 build in order to be sure that I have exactly the same OS as all other users. Also I'm going to re-install it frequently enough so I want to have standard&nbsp;genuine&nbsp;Windows 7 Pro
 x32 ISO in order to not deal each time with WAU and upgrade Home Basic to Pro each time I re-install my OS.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My questions are:</div>
<div>1. Does WAU let me download ISO of Windows version that I'm going to&nbsp;<span><span>purchase, e.g. Windows 7 Pro x32? I want to perform
 100% clean install of Win7 Pro x32 without any upgrade process after I&nbsp;performed it once.</span></span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>2. If the answer for the first question is «NOT», in case if I decide to re-install my OS is there any way to receive Win7 Pro x32</span><span>&nbsp;straight
 awa</span>y after installing OS&nbsp;<span>without performing WAU again?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>3. What will happen if I'll input my Win7 Pro x32 CD-KEY while installation from Win7 Home Basic DVD? Does it give me a Win7 Pro version or it just reject
 my key?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>4. Can I just take ISO image of Win7 Pro x32 (as installation distributive) from the friends and use it with MY own CD-Key?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks.</span></div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Toucki</p>
<p>The Anytime Upgrade does not include an installation disk.</p>
<p>Every install of Windows 7 includes all of the files for every edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you purchase an Anytime Upgrade product key and use it, this simply unlocks the components of the edition you are purchasing.</p>
<p>If you want an ISO of the edition you are upgrading to you can&nbsp;legally download these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the following post for the download links.</p>

<h2>            Error Code 0x800703EE &#58; Transferring 24GB video file to client&#39;s 32GB Flash Drive &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through several forums that deal with similar issues, but I have not found a solution from what was offered in those threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">video</span> that is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
23.6GB</span> which my client asked me to transfer onto their brand new <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
32GB</span> (really <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">28.8GB</span>) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
PNY flash drive</span>. The video file is saved onto my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
external hard drive</span> (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Seagate 2TB</span>) and I am simply copying and pasting it to the flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After first performing this transfer last night, the error message did not pop up until the majority of the file had been moved. It read:
<strong>"An unexpected error is keeping you from copying the file. If you continue to receive this error, you can use the error code to search for help with this problem...The volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer
 valid."</strong> This transfer was done overnight while I was asleep -- I didn't interact with any files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(SIDE NOTE, I reformatted the flash drive to NTFS -- the flash drive wouldn't let me add the file when it was FAT32 formatted.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After waking up to this error, I tried the transfer again with the message popping up much earlier in the process. After that, I went to command prompt and typed in
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sfc/scannow</span>, which didn't identify any issues. When attempting to scan for errors, the drive couldn't be found/accessed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I could try? At a loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>La-Rel</p>

<p>Try doing a full format of the drive, not just a quick format. It takes longer but looks for bad sectors. If that doesn't work then likely the drive is faulty. Since it was brand new can it be returned for a replacement?</p>
<p>Try ex-FAT format? (Shot in the dark.)</p>

<h2>            MICROSOFT SURFACE PRO 4 has been the biggest headache of my life</h2>
                    <p>I purchased my surface pro 4 in summer of 2016 and it has been nothing but a problem for me. The first issue it faced was problems with charging. I have purchased several official chargers, all of which seem to be very temperamental in their ability to charge.
 The second issue was the failure of the touch screen to work, having followed all the official advice online which failed to fix the issue I decided to just deactivate it as the pen touch screen was still functional, however this also failed after another
 couple of weeks. Considering this is 50% of the functionality of the device this was unacceptable and resulted in me having to use it as what is essentially a very unstable laptop resulting in it developing a crack in the screen when it fell from my bed. The
 third issue I faced (before the screen crack may I add), was a horrendous screen flicker that occurred during charging of the device, having put up with this screen flicker for a while (enduring several headaches), hoping a software update may fix it, I stumbled
 across a very well hidden page on the Microsoft website informing me that the device could be replaced within 3 years of purchase. Finally I thought I found a solution, however due to the cracked screen I couldn't redeem this fix.</p>
<p>This device has been the biggest headache of my life, encountering issues regularly. I find it despicable that Microsoft has used the screen crack as a reason not to replace it, as the screen crack developed as a result of the ENDLESS faults in this device.
 I will never be purchasing a new laptop from Microsoft and I will be informing everyone not to do the same. I am a student studying for my final exams and this has been a considerable set back, I hope Microsoft seriously work on this because I know I am not
 the only one to feel scammed by this.</p>

<p>OMG, I feel you! </p>
<p>My mom got this pro 4 for me Feb 2017 because my ASUS died and I needed it a computer for school immediately. Within the first month I had to switch it with a refurbished one because the one I got had hardware problems. But the problems persisted! The battery
 life sucks (it is pugged in all the time because it won't keep a charge). The wifi cuts out and so I can't use google drive properly. Office 365 of all things does not work at all on this device. Every time I redownloaded it, it still glitched out and crashed
 on me. On every office program. It crashes randomly. It updates for days or when it needs to update, the update does not finish. oh and it doesn't connect to printers. I mean I had to get a chromebook (fall 2018) because I could not work on this laptop. It
 just stopped working entirely. The screen would turn on showing the Surface logo but then go black screen. This continued for three months. I turned it on in December and it actually turned on. The only thing this is good for is when I draw with my Wacom tablet.
 That is it. And maybe typing (if it lets me). I don't even use this laptop for weeks at a time.
</p>
<p>I<span> went to best buy to get help and they have tried everything to get it fixed (for three years, constantly). They ultimately told me to ask Microsoft for help. You know what they told me, that it was too old to fix or it Best Buy's problem

<h2>            Firewall bypass for Network Location Awareness and DUN</h2>
                    
<p><b>From:</b>&nbsp; Remy&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I have a client who is about to deploy Vista to its business and one of its legacy desktop apps is a client dialer which uses DUN to connect to server services. The application works but NLA kicks in upon connection.
 The users of the application can only select the PUBLIC profile and what we would like is to bypass this prompt in the first place since it can only lead to confusion. I have had a look at the Firewall Policy and can't see anything there which would allow
 us to say "whenever this DUN connection is made" or "whenever a remote interface is connected" apply the public profile without prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that the profile being assigned is the most restrictive I was hoping there would be a way to bypass the NLA prompt?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All thoughts gratefully received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remy</p>

    <title>Storage Spaces Adding New Hard Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cornellseneschal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage Spaces Adding New Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a Windows 8.1 computer with three hard drives. &nbsp;The C: drive is the boot drive, and one internal 2 TB and one external 3 TB. &nbsp;I'm currently running the latter two drives in a Storage Spaces mirrored configuration, which wastes the additional 1 TB.
 &nbsp;If I add one more external USB 3.0 drive which is 4 TB, can I reconfigure the Storage Spaces to be a parity pool with all three? &nbsp;Or would I have to mirror the 3 TB to the 4 TB and lose the 2 TB? &nbsp;What would you suggest is the optimal configuration to set
 up, get a 5 TB drive and mirror between them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there a way to boot from a Storage Spaces pool? &nbsp;Or does the C: drive have to be NTFS and not be part of Storage Spaces?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

    <title>Disabled USBs can no longer be enabled regardless of settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ntsolo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabled USBs can no longer be enabled regardless of settings rollback.</h2>
                    Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I have gotten myself stuck in a difficult situation. I have applied some security policies on my domain so that USBs cannot be used.<br />
<br />
Here are the settings being pushed:<br />
Registry change:<br />
HKLM\SYSTEM\currentControlSet\Services\usbstor<br />
--Start , REG_DWORD , value "4"<br />
<br />
System file permission changes being pushed:<br />
%systemroot%\inf\USBSTOR.inf is given denial permissions for a global security group along with the SYSTEM account.<br />
%systemroot%\inf\USBSTOR.pnf is given denial permissions for a global security group along with the SYSTEM account.<br />
<br />
Reason for giving a denial access to System account : Users were still able to install the USBs even though they belonged to the global security groups with denial access to files.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
I now find myself with the need to revert these options from a few computers but for some reason I am still unable to install plug n play USB devices such as USB memory sticks and USB cdroms ( which have previously worked) after the rollback of the settings
 mentioned above.<br />
<br />
I have verified that both the registry settings and file permissions have gone back to default settings, I have also executed a Microsoft Fix me .msi that restores all systems files to their default file permissions just in case I had modified other files during
 the testing stages of these settings.<br />
<br />
I have also noticed that the files USBSTOR.inf and .pnf can be deleted from %systemroot%\inf, which is not the case with computers that are able to install plug and play USB devices.<br />
<br />
I have replaced the files USBSTOR.inf , USBSTOR.pnf and USBSTOR.sys files with original ones just in case they had gotten corrupted.<br />
<br />
I have re-installed the USB controllers and unistalled all hidden inactive USB devices from the computer.<br />
<br />
I have run the SFC \scannow command and rebooted multiple times.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am unable to figure out why Windows is not installing these USB devices ( I receive the Welcome to the fiound new hardware wizard window) and would apreciate if anyone would share any ideas as to why it seems Windows is still not using\loading the USBSTOR.pnf
 and .inf files.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
JP<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using WMP 11 on XP and Vista and good archiving programs for what I own. Exporting/Ripping onto the same drives (A western digital and a Seagate). My blu-ray player has more ease with DVD's than CD's sometimes. It's weird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some discs are faster than others even when they have more content and are longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any differences or similarities on Vista, Win7 or Win8?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;Pro&#41; Update Disabled the Creative Sound Card - No Sound</h2>
                    <p>Version 1803 disabled the sound on my Creative Sound BlasterX AE-5 sound card.&nbsp; No hardware changes nor cable changes were made between pre and post update.&nbsp; I followed the Windows 10 troubleshooter to no avail.&nbsp; I downloaded the most recent drivers from
 Creative and it did not fix the problem either.<br />
<br />
I had a [edit: Skype] meeting tonight which I had to cancel due to this inexcusable issue.&nbsp; I've never had an update from MS screw up my computer like this.<br />
<br />
THANKFULLY, I have nightly images made, so I restored the image from two days ago, so I'm back up and running on version 1709 where everything is working perfectly, or so it seems.&nbsp; Normally I wouldn't be writing but this nag screen I keep getting to apply
 the update is concerning me that eventually it's going to force itself on me and I'll be back in the same position.&nbsp; I don't know if there's a difference between Win 10 Home or Pro, thankfully I'm running Win 10 Pro so maybe I have a chance to escape this
 incredible screw up by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really disappointed and frustrated.</p>
<p>

            If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.

<h2>            re activate windows 8.1 after reset</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>I reset my windows 8.1 because it was crashing a lot( I&nbsp;thought I had a bug or a virus, but I now know it was bad ram).&nbsp;Now I am trying to reuse my windows 8.1 key when validating and it tells me my key is not valid.&nbsp; I have used this key on my pc before
 (since November 2017) and it validated. &nbsp;I have&nbsp;performed windows update and no problems before, so what is the problem?</p>

    <title>Seeking advice about an upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bl0ckeduser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Seeking advice about an upgrade</h2>
                    I have a computer than runs Windows XP.<br />
<br />
I have read on an Internet forum that if I do not upgrade from XP,<br />
I should "expect a massive flood of zero day attacks that people have<br />
already been hoarding, starting April 9".<br />
<br />
I have a "Dreamspark" subscription which gives me access to installers<br />
for Windows XP/Vista/7/8.<br />
<br />
Now, the problem is that I wish to do an in-place upgrade (to Vista,<br />
the only possible inplace upgrade target coming from XP),<br />
<br />
I've asked people on IRC, 4chan, and some "tech support" site that was<br />
full of ads about all this, and people there would just proselytize<br />
about inplace upgrades and Windows Vista being bad, and about having<br />
good backups (I do have good backups going back to over 10 years, but<br />
I know nothing about upgrading Windows systems!).<br />
<br />
The thing is that I have lots of files and configurations and programs<br />
spread out in all kinds of places and I'm completely unfamiliar with<br />
the way Windows organises configuration files and the like. And I don't<br />
feel like spending hours learning Windows' directory structure, moving<br />
documents and configuration files back to their places, and reinstalling<br />
programs after a fresh install.<br />
<br />
Hence my intent to do an inplace upgrade, as noted above.<br />
<br />
How bad can an in-place upgrade go ? Do I really have to fear it will<br />
eat up all my documents ?<br />
<br />
Also, do you think it would work well to do a backup image of my "C"<br />
drive with "clonezilla", and restore that, if the upgrade fails ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any input or answers.<br />

            I doubt there will be a flood of zero day exploits on April 9, 2014, but it is correct that as of that date Microsoft will no longer release any security updates/patches for Windows XP.&nbsp; As bugs/security holes are discovered and patched in newer versions
 of Windows, it's possible that people may use that knowledge to devise attacks against XP.&nbsp; Thus, the longer you use XP after April 9, the more likely it will become vulnerable.<br />
<br />
As you have discovered, there is no "direct upgrade" path from XP to 7.&nbsp; Assuming that your hardware and software will be functional on a Windows 7 system, there are only two ways to get there:&nbsp; (a) "in-place" upgrade to Vista and then "in-place" upgrade to
 7 or (b) custom (i.e., "clean") install of Windows 7 followed by reinstallation of all programs and restoration of all data.<br />
<br />
There are pros and cons for both paths.&nbsp; If you do a clean install of Windows 7, you know that you won't be transferring any potential problems from your XP system.&nbsp; The downside is that you will have to find installation media for all of your application software.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The "Windows Easy Transfer" utility provided with Windows 7 (see article below) is supposed to transfer "settings" from XP to 7 along with your data files, but I suspect that the "settings" that are transferred are primarily those related to Microsoft programs.&nbsp;
 And if you have "files and configurations and programs spread out in all kinds of places," it's likely that WET will miss things that are in non-standard locations.&nbsp; See this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/transferring-files-and-settings-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FAQ</a>.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have always done clean installs, but everything I've read about in-place upgrades says that it's supposed to work just fine -- but back up first "just in case."&nbsp; Your idea of making a clone of your XP system first is an excellent one.<br />
<br />
And, of course, you should run the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor</a> first to determine if your hardware and software will work in Windows 7.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here's a "how-to" for migrating from XP to 7:&nbsp; <a href="http://winsupersite.com/article/windows-7/upgrading-to-windows-7-upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://winsupersite.com/article/windows-7/upgrading-to-windows-7-upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7</a>
<br />
<br />
There are various scenarios discussed in other articles on that site.&nbsp; You haven't mentioned whether you're thinking of going to a 64-bit version of Windows 7 or from a "higher" version of XP to a "lower" version of 7.&nbsp; Those scenarios are discussed here --&gt;
<a href="http://winsupersite.com/article/windows-7/windows-7-upgrade-scenarios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winsupersite.com/article/windows-7/windows-7-upgrade-scenarios</a>
<br />
<br />
And I'm sure there are a few articles about going from XP to Vista as well, but I didn't look for them.<br />

<br />
I think the links you posted should give me all the information I need.<br />
<br />
I have run WIndows 7 upgrade advisor, and the results it gave were apparently fairly optimistic:<br />

            Good luck.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As I implied, when I went from XP to 7, I just did a clean install of 7.&nbsp; I also didn't bother with WET, but just manually copied my documents, music, photos, etc., over my network after the new system was up and running.&nbsp; Of course, if you're installing Windows
 7 on the same machine that has XP, you first have to copy all of that stuff to some external storage.<br />
<br />
The report shows that you have 47 GB of free space on your hard drive but doesn't show the total size of the drive.&nbsp; You might consider buying a new larger hard drive and an external enclosure.&nbsp; Clone your existing drive to the new one, then put the new one
 in the computer and upgrade.&nbsp; Your old drive will be the backup ... and once you know everything has transferred correctly, you can format the old drive and use it as a backup drive.&nbsp; Given that you said that you have been backing up your system for 10 years,
 you may well have thought of this, but I thought I'd mention it.<br />
<br />
If you do the in-place upgrades, you probably should uninstall all of your printers first.&nbsp; See, for example, this HP support article --&gt;

Hi bl0ck...<br />
<br />
I noticed in the list of software you have installed that you're running Adobe Acrobat 5.0
<br />
<br />
That application dates from May 2001 and by using it, you're exposing your system to many exploits circulating on the Web.
<br />
<br />
To give you an idea how bad the digital time bomb is that you're exposing your machine to, here's a list of Adobe Acrobat vulnerabilities dating from 2001 to the present day:
<br />
<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat-windows.html</a><br />
<br />
I'd recommend you either update to the lastest version which is 11.0, or switch to
<a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Foxit Reader </a>which also inludes editing functions.
<br />
<br />
I use Foxit Reader myself and prefer it to the Adobe PDF flavour. <br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi Xircal,<br />
<br />
thanks for the tip.<br />
<br />
I don't actually use that Adobe program and I don't remember how it got installed anyway.<br />
<br />
Since it is so full of vulnerabilities, I'll uninstall it.<br />
<br />
My fave PDF reader is `evince', it's not too bloated, it doesn't have any ads,<br />
and it's opensource.<br />

            Thanks for replying.<br />
<br />
It's good to know the whole "vulnerabilities" thing is not too big<br />
of a deal, and from a reliable source like microsoft.com. I've always<br />
been confused about how much of a big deal this kind of security thing<br />
actually this.<br />
<br />
(About two weeks ago there was this big debate on a Linux forum where some<br />
people were saying security updates of this kind were super-important<br />
for desktop users, and some people were arguing the opposite; this all<br />
left me even more confused).<br />
<br />
My computer has a 2.3 GHz CPU and 3 GB of RAM, which is apparently enough<br />
for Vista, but if it's too slow I suppose I can roll back to Windows XP<br />
as you suggest, provided the "cloning" goes well. (I got the computer<br />
in December 2007 which is about when Vista came out).<br />
<br />
EDIT: oh and I changed the videocard twice since 2007, for whatever<br />
reason it seems they keep melting. (i'm not a hardware expert),<br />
so it can probably run the fancy "Aero" graphical interface that is apparently<br />
the main bottleneck in Vista.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Ethernet Doesn&#39;t Work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skier654  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Ethernet Doesn&#39;t Work</h2>
                    Ever since I upgraded my desktop to Windows 10, ethernet has been extremely unreliable. It'll sometimes work, but sometimes it'll say no internet access for both IPv4 and IPv6. Other times it'll say that the the ethernet adapter is disabled. When I try
 to enable it, it says that it has been enabled, but it really doesn't. Wireless works fine, I have been using a USB wireless adapter, but I would really like to be using ethernet instead. My laptop, which I also upgraded to Windows 10, doesn't seem to be having
 this problem at all, both ethernet and wireless work fine on it. It's just my desktop having this problem. Windows network diagnostics doesn't seem to help either. The ethernet adapter on my desktop is&nbsp;Broadcom NetLink (TM) Gigabit Ethernet. Does anybody know
 of any solutions to this?

    <title>Account Security for Xbox LIVE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dirty loco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Security for Xbox LIVE </h2>
                    
<div>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Keeping your information safe</span></span>
</div>
<p>An Xbox LIVE account gives you access to Xbox LIVE games, game add-ons, avatars, and voice and text chat. If someone else gains access to your Xbox LIVE account, however, that person could compromise your privacy, make changes to your account and profile,
 or purchase items without your consent.</p>
<p>Here are a few guidelines that you can follow to help protect your Xbox LIVE account:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do not give your full name to strangers </strong>over the Internet or over Xbox LIVE. Do not put your full name in your Xbox LIVE profile.
</li><li><strong>Keep your physical address private. </strong>Telling someone what school you go to or what neighborhood you live in can be enough to locate more information about you. Think of all the personal information that you have likely posted to social networking
 sites such as Facebook, MySpace, or Windows Live Spaces that someone could use to pose as you. Do not put your full physical address in your Xbox LIVE profile.
</li><li><strong>Do not give out your Windows Live ID as an email address to strangers.
</strong>Set up a second email account at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hotmail.com</a>.
</li><li><strong>Receive notifications if someone tries to reset your password. </strong>
Receive a text message or an email message if someone tries to reset your Windows Live ID password. On your account, add a mobile phone number that can receive SMS (short message service) messages, or set up a secondary email address. Go to
<a href="http://accounts.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a>. </li><li><strong>Keep responses about your career brief or vague. </strong>In your Xbox LIVE profile, do not provide specifics about where you work or whom you work for.
</li><li><strong>Do not unnecessarily reveal information about yourself or your accounts.
</strong>Be wary of anyone asking you for information that they do not need. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What is unauthorized access?
<p>Unauthorized access is the use of your Xbox LIVE account without your knowledge and consent. Unauthorized use includes the recovery of your Xbox LIVE account on a console that is not yours and logging into your account via Xbox.com.
</p>
<div><strong>Important</strong>
<ul>
<li>The unauthorized recovery of your account to another console can result in <strong>
loss of your access to the service</strong> or other consequences that <strong>negatively affect your gaming experience</strong>.
</li><li>The unauthorized use of your account can also result in <strong>unauthorized charges for purchases</strong> made using your account.
</li></ul>

</dt></dl>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><b>Account sharing</b></span></span>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd>
<p>Sharing your Windows Live ID password is one of the most common ways to have your account compromised and is easily preventable by you. Help ensure the safety of your account by keeping your password secret.
</p>
<p><strong>Do not share your Windows Live ID password</strong> with friends, family members, or anyone else, regardless of the reason, as doing so allows others to access your account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b><span>Social engineering</span></b> </li></ul>
<dl><dd>
<p>Social engineering is the process someone uses, through seemingly meaningless conversation or other means, to manipulate you into revealing personal information about yourself or your accounts.
</p>
<p>Once the person has enough information about you, they can pose as you and attempt to obtain access or make changes to your account.
<strong>Do not reveal personal information about yourself or your accounts</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b><span>Phishing scams, emails, and websites</span></b>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd>
<p>Phishing is an Internet scam designed to trick you into revealing information about your accounts. This information includes your login credentials, such as your Windows Live ID and password, and details about you or your accounts that can be used to gain
 access to your accounts. Phishing is a common method that thieves use to steal accounts.
</p>
<p><strong>Phishing methods include:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Email messages that appear to be from a coworker or friend with links to a website or asking for information about you or your account(s).
</li><li>An instant message that appears to come from someone in your friends list with a link to a website
</li><li>An email appearing to come from Xbox or Microsoft. </li><li>In-game messages claiming to be from Xbox Support. </li><li>A "spoof" website, pretending to be an Xbox LIVE website with a Windows Live ID login page.
</li><li>Gamerscore-boosting websites. </li><li>Websites offering free points or achievements. </li></ul>
<p>Regardless of the phishing method, the single most important thing to remember is:
<strong>Do not reveal your login credentials or other information about yourself or your accounts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Free Microsoft Points!</strong> </p>
<p>You receive an email that appears to be from Xbox, offering 5,000 free Microsoft Points to the first 100 people who go to a website linked in the email. When you click the link, you are sent to a website that appears to be affiliated with Xbox which prompts
 you for your Windows Live ID and password. Once you enter your information and sign in, you are sent to a confirmation page. Later, however, when you go to Xbox LIVE Marketplace and attempt to redeem your 5,000 points, you did not receive them. You have just
 been "phished."</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong> </p>
<p>The email and the website were not from Xbox. Whoever is monitoring that website now has your Windows Live ID and password, and can use this information to compromise your account.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>If you still have access to your account, immediately change your Windows Live ID password.
</li><li>Change your secret question and secret answer for your account. </li><li>Change your alternate email address associated with your Windows Live ID. </li></ol>

<div>
Keeping your Windows Live ID secure
</div>
<p>Here are a few guidelines that you can follow to help keep your Windows Live ID more secure:</p>
<div><strong>Important</strong> Microsoft and Xbox will never ask you for your Windows Live ID password in email, through instant messaging, or over the phone. Enter your Windows Live ID password

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor won&#39;t hide while typing.</h2>
                    <p>I've been having this issue while trying to type: my cursor doesn't hide anymore. I just updated to windows 10 [[like an hour ago]], and I have an acer aspire V7. I've checked, all my drivers are up to date. I've gone into the settings and the 'hide pointer
 while typing' is on. I've fiddled with the delay, I've fiddled with the elan palm detection. I've turned my computer off and on several times. I've connected my tablet, I've disconnected it. The only reason I'm able to write anything coherent anymore is because
 I used F7 to lock my touchpad while I type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do, my cursor jumps all over the screen while I'm typing. It's really starting to bother me. Are there any solutions? Or is this something that will be fixed in an update?</p>

<h2>            Netflix streaming on Edge or Chrome Windows 10 version 1607</h2>
                    <p>When I stream Netflix on Edge or Chrome, I can't get HD playback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Netflix app (Windows 10 store app) I can. I can't playback 2.1 sound using the app because I am using a pro audio interface and pro audio speakers that don't work with the Netflix app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gotta use an Internet browser for 2.1 sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Youtube 1080p works fine. Netflix app plays HD.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Geforce GTX 960 drivers are up to date.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Netflix support tried placing blame on the ISP we use. ISP says it's not the OS or the ISP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else?</p>

            <p>In this case, we will perform the Clean boot on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot temporarily disables all third party applications as well as all Microsoft non-essential services so only basic drivers will run.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From <strong>Start</strong>, search for msconfig</li><li>Select <strong>System Configuration</strong> from the search results.</li><li>On the Services tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then tap or click <strong>
Disable all</strong>.</li><li>On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click Open <strong>
Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>On the Startup tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>.</li><li>Close Task Manager.</li><li>On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click <strong>
OK</strong>, and then restart the computer.</li></ol>

<p>I've never used DVD-RW before, always used CD-RW.&nbsp; Bought maxwell DVD-RW as no CD-RW availabe at the time of my purchase.</p>

<p>Your E drive reads and writes both CDs and DVDs, including DVD-RW.</p>
<p>Your F drive only reads CDs and DVDs.</p>
<p>Windows XP does not support burning DVDs.&nbsp; You'll have to get 3rd party software to do that.</p>
<p>Usually, drives capable of burning DVDs come bundled with some software that enables DVD burning ... look around in Start &gt; All Programs and see if you have anything like that.&nbsp; Otherwise, a Google search will turn up many alternatives, both free and commercial.</p>
