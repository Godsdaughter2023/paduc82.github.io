    <title>ATTEMPTED EXECUTE OF NOEXECUTE MEMORY while using a browser after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> divi_kb  say:</h3>
<h2>            ATTEMPTED EXECUTE OF NOEXECUTE MEMORY while using a browser after upgrading to Win10.</h2>
                    I am using HP pavilion G6 laptop and recently upgraded it to Windows 10 from Win8. Whenever I open a browser, my laptop hangs and shows up a blue screen with a message "ATTEMPTED EXECUTE OF NOEXECUTE MEMORY" and then restarts. I have read some posts suggesting
 to update the drivers. But everytime I try to connect to a browser, it hangs up. I would like to know what might be the problem causing this issue.

    <title>Cannot boot from SSD, get sent back to BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phinkton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot boot from SSD, get sent back to BIOS</h2>
                    <p>I have recently got a new SSD for my desktop and wanted to do a fresh install of windows and replace my current HDD, giving me a fresh slate. I go through the standard windows installation with a USB, and unplug the USB after windows has been installed onto
 the SSD, the computer will then restart and I get put back into the BIOS. My issue is that once i do this, every-time, no matter what I do when i try to boot to the SSD I get sent back to the BIOS, here is a list of what I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Changing boot order</li><li>unplugging every other SATA cable except for the one connected to the SSD</li><li>plugging the SSD SATA cable into the lowest number SATA port on my motherboard</li><li>Plugging in the SSD SATA cable into the port used by my disk drive</li><li>Enabling and disabling safe boot in the BIOS</li><li>enabling and disabling CSM in the BIOS</li><li>Setting the boot CSM to "UEFI only" (does not recognize the SSD anymore)</li><li>Installing windows from the USB with the SSD being the only drive attached&nbsp;</li><li>using the same SATA port as my unplugged HDD for my SSD</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When in the BIOS the SSD is the only possible boot device recognized by the motherboard, the BIOS does recognize the SSD as a bootable drive. I've checked the SSD when booting from my HDD and all the necessary windows files seem to be there. When attempting
 to boot i get a black screen with a single flashing white line in the top left, then it proceeds into the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what's wrong and I have found nothing that can fix it. if it's necessary here is my hardware:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS Z97-A </p>
<p>Intel I5-4670K</p>
<p>NVIDIA GeForce 1070</p>
<p>8 GB RAM&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sound card (if that's relevant)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Storage:</p>
<p>HDD: Seagate 1TB</p>
<p>SSD: WD 1TB SSD "3D NAND" (New Drive)</p>

            Hi Phinkton.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware, reset to optimal defaults.  Go into UEFI setup to set UEFI enabled, CSM disabled, Secure and Fast boot disabled if necessary until after install, Windows Boot Manager always set first to boot as it must be in a UEFI install at all times:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            The other hardrive is unplugged. The media was created on the computer using the windows media creation tool and creating a bootable usb. If i try to boot the ssd as a uefi device the motherboard does not recognize the drive, but will recognize the windows
 usb if that is plugged in, however, when installing windows in uefi mode the windows install will recognize the ssd but after windows has been installed the motherboard still does not recognize the ssd. The message i get when i try to boot in uefi mode is
 that the motherboard cannot boot from the ssd.

            Go into UEFI setup to check the following settings:
<br />
<br />UEFI (enabled)
<br />CSM or Legacy BIOS (disabled)
<br />Secure &amp; Fast Boot (disable if necessary until after install)
<br />Boot Priority Order (Windows Boot manager must always be first)
<br />
<br />
<br />If this will still not work, then try enabling CSM to see if it offers both a plain and a UEFI version of the flash stick to choose similar to the illustration below.  If so try the plain Legacy install, again deleting the hard drive of all partitions, highlight Unallocated Space to click Next

<li><strong>In</strong> Windows 7 <strong>Window Explorer, one cannot view the UserName folder

<p>Click Start, type C:\Users into the Search box, and press Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please list <strong>everything</strong> you see.&nbsp; If you would rather not reveal actual user names, use UserA, UserB, UserC, etc.&nbsp; Please mention whether view hidden files and folders is enabled or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the name of one (or more) users missing from the list of items?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigate to any document in the "UserName folder" that you can't see in C:\Users, then right-click and select Properties.</p>
<p>What is shown as the document's "Location"?&nbsp; Again, if you want to use UserA rather than the actual name, that's OK.</p>

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can’t find your recovery key, try to think back to when you set up BitLocker. You were asked to either write the key down, print it out to a piece of paper, or save it to a file on an external drive. You were also given the option to upload the BitLocker
 recovery key to your Microsoft account online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That key should hopefully&nbsp;be stored somewhere safe if you printed it to a piece of paper or saved it to another drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further concerns, let us know.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Do you remember making any changes to your computer after which the issue started?<br />
2. Do you have a wired or a wireless connection?<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you follow these steps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Test the issue in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode with networking</a> and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click "Start", input "NCPA.CPL" (without quotation marks) to Start Search bar and press "Enter".</div>
<div>b. Right-click the network connection and click "Properties".</div>
<div>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</div>
<div>c. Click to highlight "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)" and click "Properties".</div>
<div>d. Check "Obtain an IP address automatically" and "Obtain DNS server address automatically".</div>

    <title>System Recovery with error&#58; 10-fa11-0017 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allcheck  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Recovery with error&#58; 10-fa11-0017</h2>
                    I have been checking on other forums about this and wanted to check here to verify this.<br />
<br />
My laptop began having start up issues and would not load completely or allow me access to Task Manager a couple days ago. After trying evre avenue our IT administrator and myself could think of the only other option was to do a full recovery off the recovery
 disk included with the laptop. While the recovery was loading the CDC files it reached 33% and produced error: 10-FA11-0017. Other forums stated that this meant 1 of 2 things,<br />
<br />
1. error was bogus, restart computer and business as normal<br />
2. bad HDD, replace and re-load Vista<br />
<br />
After restarting, I found the error was not bogus and have settled with a bad HDD.
<br />
<br />
My question is, with everyone talking about the download off the neosmart.net website, can I use my recovery disk or do I need to use the neosmart download to put Vista on the new HDD?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.

            Is your system a Toshiba?&nbsp; That seems to be what the error refers to from what I could research.&nbsp; From what I read, it's either a problem with the recovery disk (perhaps a periodic thing) or with the hard drive (apparently especially if the error occurs
 with the second recovery disk) &nbsp;(or the problem is bogus as one responder put it after being successful after a number of attempts).&nbsp; The first step I would try would be to get another copy of the Recovery Disks from Toshiba claiming that the first ones were
 defective due to the error message - they should replace them for free given the error (but they may still charge you - you know how these big companies work).&nbsp; You need to use recovery disks from the manufacturer (not the Neosmart disks since they can't do
 a reinstall).&nbsp; Here's another source for manufacturer OEM Recovery Disks (and they include Toshiba):
<a href="http://www.oemsoftwaresource.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oemsoftwaresource.com/</a>.&nbsp; I don't know if they will be cheaper or more expensive than going through Toshiba since I haven't checked prices but I present it as an option.<br />
<br />
Do <strong>NOT</strong> do the solution of a low-level format with <a href="http://www.killdisk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.killdisk.com/</a>&nbsp;because that's not a viable option with today's hard drives and may cause irreparable harm to the drive.&nbsp; I saw someone suggest that in the other forums (which you may have read) and I wanted to make sure you didn't see it and try
 it.&nbsp; Then you'll have no chance of exchanging the hard drive.<br />
<br />
You could use the Command Prompt from the Neosmart disk to do a quick check of the hard drive with chkdsk /f /r (which will scan and try to fix bad sectors).&nbsp; It may not help if the drive is truly defective, but it can't hurt (and it may very well fix the problem
 - who knows).&nbsp; Here's more info on the chkdsk command: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67612-check-disk-chkdsk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67612-check-disk-chkdsk.html</a>.<br />
<br />
Is the PC/laptop still under warranty?&nbsp; If so, it might be prudent to use this error message to get yourself a new hard drive (since there will always be questions about it because of the error message even if you can get it to work).&nbsp; That may in fact be a
 better option than getting new recovery disks (if you can get them to give you a replacement hard drive for free).<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please post back and let us know how this all turns out.

            To replace the OS, you would need to first install the Hard Drive.&nbsp; Then you would use the Recovery Disks to re-install the operating system (following the prompts they give or instructions provided by the manufacturer - you may need to first install drivers
 but the manufacturer can tell you if that's necessary).&nbsp; Then you would install all your programs, reset your preferences, reset your network and email configurations, restore your data from backup,... (in no particular order). You may also have to re-activate
 Vista (though this is unlikely because you just changed the hard drive and not the motherboard).<br />

    <title>Computers trying to connect to my network using Vista cannot conect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tycobb2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computers trying to connect to my network using Vista cannot conect</h2>
                    At my place of work we have a secure wireless router for the convience of our guests to use while waiting or visiting. People using Windows XP have no problem connecting, but computers running Vista cannot connect. The ISP is verizon, westell router, and
 we use a Belkin N+ for the Wi-Fi. Windows XP connects normaly,(view wireless networks, chose network, click connect, enter password, and it connects). With Windows Vista when you click connect for the network, it asks for a pin for the router not a password.
 Belkin has been of no help in resolvcing this problem. This has happened on ALL computers running Vista. I have not tried to set up the router using a Vista OS computer as I don't want the whole system going down. I don't even know where to begin to trouble
 shoot this, even a starting point and some ideas as to the problem would be of help. Thanks in advance.

            Thanks for the info it was helpful, the problem is I can't do this to everyones computer that comes in. We provide the service free to our visitors and guests. Is it possable there is something (setting) in the router I can change and still keep it secure.
 Again, Belkin has been of no help with this problem, and the router was purchaced only 5 months ago by the employees, and they no longer have any of the setup info. I have access to the router and connect to it on a weekly basis to change the password. I havent
 tried to unsecure the router to see if I can connect but I can do this in the morning US EST. If you know of a wireless router brand and/or model that would be easer to set up for all users please let me know. We prefer to keep the router (network) secure.

<p>Try <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Vista Compatibility Center</a><br />
<br />
Before buying a new router, make sure that the old one really is incompatible. Test out the previous "fix" on a Vista computer that won't connect to your old router. If it connects after the fix, the old router is incompatible.</p>

            Tim Mawr thank you for your help in solving my problem. After checking the link to the windows compatibility center I found that the Belkin N+ wireless router that we are using is compatiable with Vista. Most solutions I found deal with changing lines
 of programing, and as I said I can;t do this to every computer that a user comes in with. For any others that see this post I'll leave a brief description of my problem and the solution. When using a computer running Vista OS when you click to connect to a
 secure wireless network you get prompted to enter a pin not a password. This is a pin number located on the bottom of the router with the S/N and defalt pass key. I had access to the router but this would be inconvient for guests. By going into the router
 setup menu and dissabling the DHCP the router will alow a Vista OS computer to connect. My understanding is that the router wants to assing the computer an IP address but Vista OS will not allow this, where as XP will. Dissabling the DHCP allow

            If it's asking for a pin for the router and it's a belkin N+ thats fine.&nbsp; All you need to do is enter the pin number on the bottom of the router.&nbsp; I had to do the same thing.&nbsp; It's just an initialization for that pc to recognize that router.&nbsp; And once
 you do it once, it forever recognizes that router.&nbsp; So, just keep a copy of that number handy for those people who want wireless connection.&nbsp; I am running one pc on Vista and one on Widows 7, and they both work fine with my belkin N+.&nbsp; They also both required
 me to put in the router pin.&nbsp; I hope this helps

            I had the same problem with a Belkin router and a Compaq notebook. It would only connect locally but would not connect to the Internet. I've tried to connect with two different Toshiba notebooks and they both connected successfully. I removed the security
 on the router and it was connecting fine on all machines. I also tried to enter the PIN and/or the passphrase. I even reimaged the Compaq but still no success. I tried to connect the Compaq to another secure router(Trendnet) and it was connecting. Finally
 I purchased a Netgear router and everything is working fine now. Something was wrong with Belkin router.<br />

</p><p>I understand that you are looking to activate Tablet mode in Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Windows 10 <strong>Continuum </strong>is Microsoft's new way of switching between tablet and desktop mode in Windows 10 as needed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To <strong>enable tablet mode on PC with multiple displays</strong>, press the
<strong>Windows Logo + P</strong> keys, and click/tap on <strong>PC screen only</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Click on <strong>Start </strong>and navigate to <strong>Settings
</strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Tablet mode</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Turn on <strong>Make Windows more touch-friendly when using your device as a tablet</strong> on the right side.
</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Under <strong>When I sign in</strong>, select <strong>Automatically switch to tablet mode</strong>,
<strong>Go to the desktop</strong>, or <strong>Remember what I </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used&nbsp;</strong><strong>last</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Under <strong>When this device automatically switches tablet mode on or off</strong>, select
<strong>Don't ask me and don't switch</strong>, </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always ask me before switching</strong>, or <strong>Don't ask me before switching</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

            I had already done that.&nbsp; It always comes back with a message saying that Tablet Mode is not available with multiple monitors attached.&nbsp; I WANT my main screen to still have the Start menu up.&nbsp; This works GREAT in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; It doesn't work at ALL in
 Windows 10.

            Not really.&nbsp; Even at full screen, as soon as you click on ANYTHING on screen 2 the Start menu disappears and you're presented with the desktop again on screen 1.&nbsp; This does NOT happen on Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I routinely have legacy programs running on screen
 two with Metro apps or the Start Screen on screen one.&nbsp; I prefer to be able to quickly view live tiles while still working actively on screen two.&nbsp; This is not supported in W10.

            <p>Okay, please follow along.&nbsp; All my non-test machines are running Windows 8.1--the far superior operating system.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 machines allow the FULL START SCREEN to be displayed and interacted with on monitor 1 while I can be interacting with legacy desktop
 programs on monitor 2.&nbsp; Doing work on monitor 2 in no way interrupts the Start Screen on monitor 1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10, it FORCES you to live 100% on the desktop.&nbsp; I do not want this.&nbsp; I want the Start Menu and its live tiles to be visible virtually all the time on monitor 1 while I do things on monitor 2, just like I CAN, with NO EXTRA, STUPID machinations,
 on Windows 8.1.&nbsp; However, first you have to go to a special setting just to have the Start Menu DISPLAY full screen.&nbsp; Then, if you only have one monitor, you have to go to other special settings to FORCE the stupid OS to function more like Windows 8.1 and
 its Start Screen.&nbsp; BUT, as soon as you connect a second monitor you completely lose all those settings because TABLET MODE ISN'T SUPPORTED WITH MULTIPLE MONITORS CONNECTED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that plain enough for you?&nbsp; Windows 10 SUCKS!!!!</p>

            <p>Oh, really?&nbsp; Then enlighten me as to how I can get the same functionality--as I clearly described--I have on Windows 8.1 on Windows 10.&nbsp; I have, from the very beginning of Windows 10, believed that Microsoft killed off features that were important to me
 (and I'm not the only one).&nbsp; When I submit feedback, I get the typical "well, you can emulate what you're looking for by forcing Tablet Mode..blah, blah, blah".&nbsp; As it turns out, you can't.&nbsp; This makes Windows 10 pale in comparison to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I was willing
 to compromise some with forcing Tablet Mode to get rid of most of the desktop garbage, but as soon as you connect a second monitor all of that goes out the door.&nbsp; So, YES, I'm angry!</p>

            Hi DexArrow,
<br />
<br />This type of functionality is not built into Windows unfortunately. 
<br />
<br />However, here are a few different ways you can do this with third party applications: <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/stealth-or-hide-running-program-from-appearing-in-taskbar-or-traybar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.raymond.cc/blog/stealth-or-hide-run...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />You may have to use a third party program for this or a batch file. Windows does not internally have it as an option, I believe. 
<br />

 would happen. I was also able to highlight over document and copy but when trying to find a place to paste it I had access to nothing. All desktop icons were gone as well as task bar at bottom of screen. That was when I hit the sleep button due to task manager
 not being accessible. Then wouldnt come out of sleep mode so I help power button down til system turned off.&nbsp;

<h2>            signed in with temporary profile windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My PC&nbsp; just told me it had encountered an error and needs to restart. Upon reboot it allowed me to signin but a pop up explained I'm signed in under as temporary account.</p>
<p>Tried to restore the PC under the repair options keeping data but it too came across an error and failed to restore.</p>
<p>This is the second time this has happened and the last time after hours of chatting with Microsoft help I ended up just restoring the PC from scratch.
</p>
<p>BTW, One problem with talking to Online help is they ask you to restart the PC and the PC resets back and when you sign back into Online Help you get another tech who wants to go through all the checks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a cure or a fix without resetting the PC entirely again.</p>

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all the measures listed above along with numerous measures from the internet but still could not get the PC back to normal. In the end I just decided to restore the PC from scratch, this started well until I had a power cut halfway through which
 left me " No operating system found"</p>
<p>I downloaded the media creation tool for installing Win 10 and it worked brilliantly. I keep all my files on a separate drive so I didn't lose anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would like to know if anyone has successfully recovered from the temp login. </p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alan</p>

<h2>            Windows updates have &#39;locked&#39; my computer</h2>
                    <p>Please can someone help me.</p>
<p>I have a Dell Optiplex running 32 bit Win 7 Professional.</p>
<p>I live in the UK and last night, 12 September 2012, &nbsp;at about 9pm when I went to turn off my machine and I got a message saying something like ‘Please do not turn off your machine, windows is installing updates.’ And I think it said it
 was installing 1 of 6 but I cannot be sure of that. So I decided to leave it running until I went to bed.</p>
<p>At approx. 11pm I went to check the machine had turned itself off but it was still showing the same message. I decided to leave it running overnight, hoping that it would clear by morning.</p>
<p>However on the next morning at around 8am the same message was still showing and the only alternative I was aware of was to hold in the power button and this turned the machine off.
</p>
<p>I waited for a minute or two and then turned the machine back on. When the machine booted up I got a message saying that Windows had not closed down properly and giving me several options of about starting the machine in safe mode with/without
 networking or normally. I could not select safe mode as the arrow keys would not move the highlight; so the machine started normally. Eventually, my desktop appeared and I noticed that the machine could not automatically logon to my router; nor could I open
 any applications e.g. Outlook, Word. I repeated the steps in this several times, including leaving up to 2 hours between switching off and switching on, and just leaving the desktop showing for an hour before trying anything. But all to no avail.</p>
<p>I’m currently down. Has anyone got any ideas?</p>

            Thanks for your interest. It is not the same machine as before - the previous machine is a Dell laptop and that problem has been solved. This machine is Dell desktop - Optiplex 380.

            <p>Thank you for your response. I have taken some time to get the answers to your questions because I could not get access to my computer.</p>
<p>1a. The machine was originally purchased in 2010 by a corporate customer. I acquired it in July 2011 and although the CoA sticker said that it had Win 7 Professional installed, it actually had Win Xp. I contacted Dell and got the Win
 7 SP1 Installation disk and did a clean install. I have had no difficulty with the machine until this incident.</p>
<p>1b As above, I did a clean install but I did not have to enter the product code.
</p>
<p>2. I use AVG free edition and it is on a rolling basis. I do not use any other spyware application or any third party firewall.</p>
<p>3. I have never installed a Norton of McAfee application – but I do not know if &nbsp;either was ever installed prior to my acquisition.</p>
<p>4. As per 3 above, I do not know.</p>
<p>5.All of these updates are installed</p>
<p>6a. I do not know – I cannot access any feature called update history or view update history. See also note A below.</p>
<p>6b. See 6a above.</p>
<p>7a. Using the URL I got a message saying that No working Java was detected – this surprised men as I am sure that Java has previously been installed.</p>
<p>7b. I have version 11.3.300.271 installed.</p>
<p>8 I have Chrome installed and that is the browser that I normally use.</p>
<p>9 From the list that you provided I only use CCleaner but I do not use the registry cleaner module.</p>
<p>A: After I posted the original problem, I continued to try and get my machine to work. Eventually using ctrl+alt+del I managed to get the machine to work on 14 September. During the process I would get a message saying ‘The logon scree
 was unable to display security and&nbsp; logon options when ctrl+alt+del was pressed. If the operating system does not respond , press esc or restart the computer by using the power switch. When I did get access back I then restored it to 9 September (the last
 good configuration) and although the machine didn’t shut down properly it seemed to be OK. No updates have been installed since that time. The machine then worked fine until 17 September when the original problem reappeared.</p>
<p>B.The current situation is that the machine starts but it does not connect automatically to the internet – although I can manually connect. Also, when I try to open an application, the machine hangs and does not open the application.
 Occasionally – see A above – everything will be all right except that machine will not shut down - I always need to hold the button .</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for all your help. </p>
<p>Please let me know if further information is needed.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Update is set to Automatic&nbsp; and when I tried to Shut Down my machine last night I encountered the original problem, i.e. A message appeared saying something like ‘Please do not switch off – Windows is installing update 1 of 6.’
 After 2 hours it was still displaying the same message and I switched off via the on/off button. When I restarted this morning, I got the Windows didn’t close down properly message but this time it did let me select the Start in&nbsp; Safe Mode which I did. I then
 restarted and I have come up and it seems OK.</p>

            <p>Sorry to take so long to respond – I had to go into hospital for a procedure and the after effects lasted longer than I had anticipated.</p>
<p>But let me tell you. I got ready to follow your instructions on Thursday but before starting I decided to check when I had last created a restore point. I keep these on an external USB connected HDD. To my surprise the drive was not visible;
 after a few checks, I discovered that a USB internal PCI card adapter that I had installed a few weeks ago had malfunctioned. I reinstalled the adapter in a different slot and everything was OK for about 15 minutes before it failed again. I removed the board
 and rejigged my connections so that all essential devices are connected to the motherboard USBs. I have shut down and restarted several times since then, and even automatically and successfully installed the updates which caused the original problem. So far
 without difficulty. I will therefore continue to hold out with that solution unless I have a recurrence, in which case I will try your detailed instructions.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the time and trouble that you have gone into trying to help me and hopefully others who might have similar problems will gain from the thread.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 problems after cloning C Drive to replace old C Drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 problems after cloning C Drive to replace old C Drive</h2>
                    <p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Windows 7 problems after cloning C drive.
</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>I decided that my system drive may be getting a little old (3 yrs old) so I decide to replace it with a new drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I bought a new Seagate drive and I cloned my drive using Seagate Disk Wizard.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then replaced the old drive with the new cloned drive.<span>&nbsp; </span>I rebooted and everything started normally.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then went to do my usual update of windows through Microsoft's update feature.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was surprised that the update said that I needed over 70 updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I chose to install all of the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>The updates started and a few appeared to install properly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then all of the remaining updates failed to install.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tried to install them two more time and they would not install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now I have the following problems with windows 7.<span>&nbsp; </span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>1. I cannot download updates for windows.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Windows update gave me the following error message: </font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>"Error Message: Windows update cannot currently check for updates, because the service is not running. You may need to restart your computer."</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Now when I go to the control panel and click on "Windows Update" the control panel freezes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Other programs running at the same time continue to work properly, only the control panel freezes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have to use task manage to close the control panel. All other functions in the control panel appear to be working properly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Restarting the computer did not help.<span>&nbsp; </span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p><b><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>When I replacing the new hard drive with the old hard drive everything works normally.</font></font></font></span></b></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Then I erased and reformatted the new replacement hard drive and again cloned the old C Drive to the new drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Exactly the same problems occurred.<span>&nbsp; </span>I cannot download updates or run Windows defender. I get the same error message that " Windows update cannot currently check for updates, because the service is not running. You may need to restart your
 computer."</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>2. My previously installed Microsoft security essentials is gone and since the Windows Update feature is not working, I cannot download it to reinstall it.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>3. Windows defender will not run.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>4. My indexing has stopped working and I cannot restart it.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>5. My startup desktop background has changed to a blue background with a small bird in the lower right corner. I do not remember seeing that before.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>6. The AVG program showed up on my computer and I do not remember installing it. I have since uninstalled it.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>7. All of my previously installed programs seem to work properly, only the above mentioned windows components do not run properly.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>I was able to download data to quicken and I was able to install the Google toolbar in Explorer 9.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Those downloads worked.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those downloads seem to get around the download problem.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>I ran Microsoft's malicious software removal tool and found no problems.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>I tried resetting Windows explorer to default values which did not seem to help.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>If I try to update the latest Windows update program by going to "Start/all programs/windows update"</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>a new blank explorer window opens and nothing happens and the window will not close or minimize.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>When trying to install security essentials using Google Chrome I got the following error message.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>"Cannot complete Security Essentials Installation</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>An error has prevented the Security Essentials Setup Wizard from Completing successfully. Please restart your computer an try again.<span>&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for your message.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The media-creation-tool-install program you suggested was slightly different from the previous one used and from it was able to create a non-specific upgrade DVD.&nbsp; "Non-specific" in terms that it did not offer a choice of either "Premium" or "Home" versions
 like my previous one.&nbsp; I also double checked the system requirements&nbsp;for the upgrade and am satisfied that it met them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade process took far longer than before, but once again, this time after two hours, I got the dreaded roll-back message and a final an error dialog box.&nbsp; The code 0xC1900101-0x20004 was the same as before, but with a slightly different message "The
 installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during INSTALL_RECOVERY_ENVIRONMENT operation".&nbsp; Most unhelpful and utterly hacked off!</p>

            I even reinstalled a fresh Windows 7 on a different drive, fully updated,&nbsp;with no other applications installed. But the upgrade still failed upon restart. It turned out to be my Logitech wireless K520 keyboard and M705 mouse. Once they were replaced the
 upgrade went fine.

            <p>I gave up with this in the end.</p>
<p>My solution was to do a fresh install of Windows 7 Pro on a new HDD, which was a breeze and then upgrade to Windows 10, which took under 50 minutes.&nbsp; Not very convenient if you want to retain installed Apps, like Office.&nbsp; Ultimately a good opportunity to
 rid your system of accumulated rubbish and re-install valued applications - reactivating MS stuff by phone when necessary.&nbsp; After all, you have always got your original drive to fall back on should you miss something vital or just cheezed off with the new
 Windows 10 shortcomings.</p>

<h2>            Atheros AR8161 Gigabit controller Severe Problem. Need help ASAP</h2>
                    <p>My computer is an HP Pavilion 500-054. ive formatted and reinstalled windows 8 a few times due to other issues. The problem i am facing now is with the network controller in the title. The problem is that it wont detect an Ethernet cable whatsoever......well
 the real kicker is that if i try to install any updated driver to it, Windows crashes. this is a 100% guarantee. If i go into Device Manager to change any setting, windows crashes. windows doesnt detect any problems with it. says the driver is up to date when
 i know it for sure is not. Downloading the driver from HP's support page will install but when i proceed to update it through the install manager, it crashes. I dont know if the controller itself is fried from a previous power outtage or even if that is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The built in wireless card works 100% but i get random lag spikes when playing games so that is why i want to go hardwired but cant even do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive searched and searched all through the web for answers but nobody has experienced a problem such as this. only problems not connecting to the internet but that is fixed by installing the recent driver which i cannot do. trying to disable the device causes
 a crash even.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has some sort of insight or cure for this problem i am plagued with, i would be very grateful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Andrew</p>

            Sorry I haven't been able to reply earlier but like I said, I can't even uninstall it. Whenever I attempt to do so, wondows crashes and reboots with no errors messages besides the error in event viewer. Am I just screwed? It looks like I'm going to have
 to just purchase an ethernet card

    <title>Laptop keeps disconnecting from wifi&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harleyraine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop keeps disconnecting from wifi&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have a Dell Inspiron 7347 with Windows 10 installed and I've just about gone bonkers trying to figure out why since Friday, it has been randomly disconnecting from my AT&amp;T wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happened out of nowhere last Friday, and when I tried to reconnect to my home wifi it showed "checking network requirements" on loop for forever, and then the dreaded "cannot connect to this network" message. I tried several times, restarted the wifi
 on the laptop, changed the settings, and deleted the home wifi from the remembered list. After I deleted it and entered my password, it did the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got frustrated and gave up. I knew it wasn't the router though because I restarted it and all of my other devices, including mobile phones and another Windows 10 laptop, were connected just fine. They could even disconnect and connect again. I went to
 a friends for the weekend and the wifi there connected automatically and never dropped once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I got home yesterday and had a strange idea to "rescan" my wifi modem channel. It's on auto and goes to channel 6, and it stayed on 6, but somehow, rescanning let my laptop connect again. But then an hour or so later it dropped back. And so I rescanned
 again. It connected, but with a "limited" connection. Then it would randomly connect. This went on all night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got back from work today and it was disconnected. So I changed the router channel to 11 hoping it would help and so far nothing bad to report, but I just know it will happened again. I called AT&amp;T but they simply said, "restart the modem and laptop" and
 I have. A billion times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wlan report shows rows upon rows of connect &amp; disconnects with the disconnect message reasons all either "unknown error occurred" or "security failed." The modem log reports "inbound session stopped" at the same times, so I doubt it's the modem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do and why is it doing this!? It's driving me nuts because I can't get anything done on this laptop!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Harley</p>

<h2>            Asus My Cinema U3000 Mini DVB tuner is not recognised by Windows 7 - help&#33;</h2>
                    I am running Win 7 Ultimate (64-bit) and cannot get the Asus DVB tuner recognised. Windows tried to install it as STK 7700, and failed dismally, while the disc that came with it (and which worked under Vista Home Premium 32-bit) will install but does not
 want to play ball with the system either. The Asus website support is about as much use as a chocolate fireguard, so I was wondering if anybody here knew of a workaround or driver that would be acceptable to this version of windows. I have attempted to run
 it in compatibility mode with both XP 64 and Vista Home Premium-32, but without success. The ecological part of me hates the thought of simply binning a piece of kit through seeming incompatibility with Win 7 media Centre, so any help and advice &nbsp;would be
 appreciated.

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />I've found an answer on a forum which seems to resolve your problem:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+R and navigate to:
<br />C:\users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\
<br />
<br />- Rename the FileHistory folder to _FileHistory
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and click Computer Management
<br />- Services and Applications&gt; Services
<br />- Scroll down to Windows Search
<br />- Double click on the name
<br />- Set Startup type to Automatic (Delayed Start)
<br />- Then in Control Panel&gt;File History
<br />- It should now say "File History on"
<br />- Select you desired drive
<br />- Click on Start​
<br />
