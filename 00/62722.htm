<h2>            Windows 10 VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to upgrade to Win10 without success.&nbsp; As of last night, I attempted to upgrade 3 times.&nbsp; I had not updated my NVIDIA drivers for the first 2 tries.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then upgraded to the latest and greatest drivers for my card and it still failed with
 the VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR.&nbsp; I have plenty of disk space on my laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my hardware set up from CyberpowerPC:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue could occur if you have two graphic cards where one supports Runtime Power Management (RTPM) and the other doesn't. In few cases user with&nbsp;AMD/Intel and Nvidia has faced the same issue where AMD didn't support RTPM where&nbsp;Intel did. In these cases,
 disabling RTPM in the Intel drivers fixed the issue. In your case I would suggest you to check if your&nbsp;Nvidia graphic card supports RTPM and if yes disable it and then check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results for further assistance.</p>

            RTPM is Run Time Power Management?&nbsp; Exactly how do I do that?&nbsp; Is it something that I have to leave disabled under Windows 10?&nbsp; Or do I run the install and re-enable it after it's installed.

<p>I have this problem as well, but I am unaware of how exactly to disable runtime power management on my Windows 8.1 machine with a 2GB 765 GTX nvidia video card and intel 4600 HD graphics. &nbsp;My setup is similar to the original complainant's--any assistance
 Microsoft help personnel can provide is greatly appreciated.</p>

            Unfortunately, I haven't been able to resolve this issue.&nbsp; I contacted NVIDIA and they referred me to the laptop vendor.&nbsp; I then reached out to the vendor who told me they did not manufacture the laptop and couldn't answer my question.&nbsp; The vendor referred
 me to the laptop manufacturer.&nbsp; So, it looks like I will be staying at Windows 8.1.<br />

            I had the same problem and in the end I downloaded the win10 iso file. Then run it from the desktop and when you get the option, do a custom install and click to replace the drivers. It then installs no problem (although I'm now trying to find the drivers
 and get everything back up and running!)

<h2>            Blu ray app won&#39;t play dolby atmos on UHD blu ray discs</h2>
                    <p>I have my xbox one s set to bitstream out dolby digital. I have enabled&nbsp;the "Let my receiver decode audio" in the blu ray settings. Here's my problem with the app.&nbsp;When I open the blu ray app and try to play a UHD&nbsp;disc with dolby atmos, I&nbsp;get an error that says&nbsp;"Your audio receiver can't decode this"&nbsp;(Error code 0x91d7000e).&nbsp;However,&nbsp;when I&nbsp;put in a 1080p blu ray disc with dolby atmos, it plays dolby atmos.&nbsp;My xbox one is connected to the HDMI in port of a soundbar that supports dolby atmos. Is this a known issue with the blu ray app currently? Is there a way to fix this?&nbsp;I'd greatly appreciate some help with this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you recently updated your Skype app that may have caused the emoticons not to load up. You might want to try on resetting/clearing up the app cache for it to load again. Below are the steps on how you can clear up the cache:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Close the Skype app.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if the same would still persist after resetting the app. </p>

<h3> osebnoime  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 S mode</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my laptop with a new SSD and had to reinstall Windows10. Now I can't install some of my software because
<strong>"Windows 10 is in S mode"</strong> ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>On microsoft support I get the info:</p>

<em>Windows 10 in S mode on an Intel or AMD processor</em>
<p><em>You can switch out of S mode on your Windows 10 device easily at any time through the Microsoft Store within Windows. The switch is available for free.</em></p>
<p><em>To learn more or switch out of S mode, go to the&nbsp;<span>Microsoft Store</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;within Windows and search for “switch out of S mode”.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Store shows no results when I search for&nbsp;<em>“switch out of S mode”</em> or anything similar...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to contact telephone support in my country (Slovenia) but the operator only suggested I do a complete clean install of Windows 10 PRO (even though I have a licence key for W8 Home eddition - I upgraded for free a couple of years back).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont want to do another clean install only to get to another (or same) problem, this one took me almost a whole day...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

            Hi OsebnoIme,
<br />
<br />To get out of this mess, you will need to re-install Windows 10 Home.
<br />
<br />At the very start of the installation routine, do you get a drop down box to choose the Edition (Home, Pro . .  etc.) to install on your System.?

<p>I know I can create a USB drive with any edition I want, that is not a problem. The problem is how to activate a PRO edition with a Home edition licence key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And i don't need a PRO edition anyway, Home edition is just fine for me, just without this stupid "S mode"...</p>

            Hi OsebnoIme, that is why I originally said, you need to install just the Home Edition so that activation will be automatic - take no notice of what that Tech advised, you will not be able to activate the Pro version !

            Microsoft Media Creation Tool makes no distinction in editions - in step 5 you can only choose 32bit or 64bit, no editions... I will try it with Rufus...<br />

            Hi OsebnoIme, sorry your screenshot is not coming through, can you please try that again . .. .
<br />
<br />Did your Windows 10 Home Activate?
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type snip and hit Enter - this will open the Snipping Tool
<br />
<br />Set Mode to Full Screen, then click New to take a screenshot
<br />
<br />Save that file to your Desktop and close the Snipping Tool
<br />
<br />Then in your next Post, click the second last button on the toolbar above your post to select that image and upload it to your post . . ..

<h2>            WINDOWS XP UPDATE DOESN&#39;T WORK</h2>
                    


How nice should i be about Microsofts screw ups???? 



I've been all over this so called Microsofts community reading articals dated back to the year 2010, and Microsoft still has not fixed a damn thing with their so called Windows Update. You know the thing located on the start button menu screen. I am so damn mad at Microsoft right now that i can't type right. Microsofts Ask Desk is the biggest joke i have ever seen in my life. I piad them the freaken $99.00 for them to fix this problem not just once but twice over a two day period. Their so called level 2 techs left me hanging and just up and disconnected from my computer and left my computer more messed up then it originally was to begin with. Then after getting a refound from the ask desk. I tried one more time. Only for the so called level 2 tech to never call me back. Yet left with the same damn problem. It was a simple task that i was and still em trying to do. Since Microsoft is ditching windows Xp. I wanted to crash my comput

The a so called ask desk level 2 tech already did all this and more and got no where. The so called fixit does not do jack anymore then the two place you sent me does. Because there is no C:\WUTEMP folder what so ever on my computer. I wonder why that is. Since this is a freshly installed windows. Could it just be that it is the new so called update agent you people carelessly put together that doesn't work. Just like this file iuhist.xml can not be found on my computer either. Go figure. This is Microsofts issue and has been for the past 3 or more years and Microsoft has yet to fix it. Time is running out for those of us that want to get windows Xp up to date and if you asked me that is exactlly what Microsoft wants to happen so people will just dump windows Xp and move on. I think i should just move on to Apple. To **** with and IBM based computer. as well to Microsoft, which whom back in the day did care about their consumors. It doesn't seem so now. NOW DOES IT!! You all just keep us runnin

The problem you are experiencing is a result of timing the upgrades.&nbsp; Proceed as follows and you should be up and running.<br />
<br />
First Install XP Pro with service pack 2<br />
Do not install service Pack 3 before this next step<br />
Next install Internet Explorer 8&nbsp; <br />
Now install Service pack 3<br />
Next install Internet Explorer 8 updates in the following order, one at a time with reboots
<p>KB2618444, KB2888505, KB2898785</p>
<p>Now go to Start Run Services.msc</p>
<p>Make sure "Intelligent Transfer Service is started, if not click on start and click on automatic</p>
<p>Now go to Help and Support and you should be able to update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This all takes a rather long time while everything loads<br />

            Well the sequence I published earlier no longer works.&nbsp; It worked for maybe 3 reloads on the same computer (had other issues) and since publishing the sequence it no longer works.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp; It appears the hand writing is on the wall.&nbsp; When you go
 to updates you get the message "Windows update does not start in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 or windows 2000".&nbsp; I used another computer which has had XP loaded for some time and opened Explorer 8 and clicked on tools and windows update.&nbsp; It took be to
 the web site (http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us). When I did the same in the new upload it took me to web site (http://support microsoft.com/kb/2497281).&nbsp; When I input the other web site address, it immediately did an over
 ride back to the last email.&nbsp; In other words, someone has put in the Explorer upgrade a command to take you to the web site that says updates no longer work for&nbsp; XP.&nbsp; Seems a bit unethical if Microsoft did this since they say they will support XP until April
 2014.&nbsp; If anyone can figure out how to over ride their over ride, we would be back in business.<br />

            <blockquote><br />
The problem you are experiencing is a result of timing the upgrades.&nbsp; Proceed as follows and you should be up and running.<br />
<br />
First Install XP Pro with service pack 2<br />
Do not install service Pack 3 before this next step<br />
Next install Internet Explorer 8&nbsp; <br />
Now install Service pack 3<br />
Next install Internet Explorer 8 updates in the following order, one at a time with reboots
<p>KB2618444, KB2888505, KB2898785</p>
<p>Now go to Start Run Services.msc</p>
<p>Make sure "Intelligent Transfer Service is started, if not click on start and click on automatic</p>
<p>Now go to Help and Support and you should be able to update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This all takes a rather long time while everything loads<br />

<br />
First off the Service Pack 3 is the wrong one. It is set for IT and develepers, it states in the download page if you are installing the Windows Xp Sp3 on one computer goto windows update. Well is that something smart to say and just how cluless Microsoft is
 about their problem. Because i can't down anything from a website that doesn't work. Beside this BS. Now i find out that some Virus named FLAME got into Microsofts Update Website and can affect millions of ueser. All the steps you have explained above is the
 norm for me to install. This may have worked for you, telling me that Microsft needs to figure not every computer reacts the same way to their so call solutions to the problem. Cause this didn't work for me the first and it did work for me after followed everyone
 for your steps to a T'. But thank you for your help. If i ever pin point the right answer i will post it and what is sad, Microsft's tech will learn something new from a common person. Funny, Funny

            Kieth Jones_770 Thanks for pointing out what i had figured on. So when i get the time from work i am just going to reinstall my Windows Xp Pro Sp2 and forget all Microsofts updates all together and just stay off line as much as possible. Since i can switch from one master drive to another in my BIOS. I will use Win 7 as the prime and Windows Xp as the secondary. Fun, Fun, Joy, Joy.... Somewhere in here i read Microsoft has had enough about how crappy windows 8 and 8.1 is and they are now working on a real Windows OS. So MICROSOFT if your EYES are LOOKING at this. Make no mistake about this. Make sure that what ever NEW OS you are coming up with. IT WILL RUN EVERYTHING THAT WINDOWS XP HOME, PRO, 32/64 bit DID and CAN..... MAKE SURE THE NEW OS WILL RUN ON A 1993 piece of  **** computer as well as the here and now and soon to be computers. MAKE THE OS AT LEAST 90% USER FRIENDLY. DON'T OD IT With APP STUFF. MAKE SURE A FULL FUNCTIONING START MENU IS IN IT AND CUT OUT ALL THE BULL. IF THE USER DOESN'T

<h2>            After letting windows 10 attempt to load all night,   Nothing</h2>
                    I started the 10 download about 4PM and at midnight I left it the laptop on, &nbsp;this morning I shut it off and then restarted it, &nbsp;I got a sign in window and clicked on it. &nbsp;there was a little group of blue dots going in a circle and then the screen went
 blank although there was some sort of backlight on. &nbsp;That is all I could get. &nbsp;I then pushed the Alt, Control, Delete and chose to sign out and restarted the PC. &nbsp;after the sign in came on and it went to the desk top for a second or two and then went blank
 again. I have tried this several times and every once in a while I get the desks top screen and then it goes blank again. &nbsp;

            <p><span>I understand your Upgrade at least partly installed and now won't fully start. This is often because of corruption from the previous install, especially factory installs which are the worst possible

<span>&nbsp;</span>It may be necessary to even Clean Reinstall the previous OS, although there's now a workaround I'll give you to Clean Install Windows 10 and directly activate from the Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product Key.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>l'm sure your answer would probably work, BUT as of now I have no intentions of another attempt to install Windows 10. &nbsp;I don't need the frustration or head ache that goes along with it. &nbsp; As soon as I can afford it I will be switching to a Mac Laptop or
 tablet. &nbsp;They are so much less trouble.</p>

    <title>Problems with DLC - DOA5 Ultimate - Complete Costumes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with DLC - DOA5 Ultimate - Complete Costumes</h2>
                    
<p>Guys, yesterday I bought Complete DOA5 Costumes, that says: "<span>Get all 81 costumes from DOA5 in one convenient set! This set includes the following costumes: Player's Swimwear, Hotties Swimwear, Hot Getaway, Uniform, Gym Class, Cheerleader, Christmas
 Set Note: This costume was originally distributed for Dead or Alive 5. Please confirm you do not already own this costume before purchasing."</span></p>
<p>BUT, Momiji, Rachel and Marie Rose aren't with costumes! Well, I bought for all chars right? What can I do now? I'm from Brazil, and can't even send an email to Xbox, or receive a call. Momiji, Rachel and Marie Rose has Christmas and other costumes that
 are in this dlc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope to receive a answer.</p>

<p>Hi Rufus,<br />
<br />
Please follow the below mentioned steps to backup your files and folders,<br />
</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Windows Complete PC Backup and Restore</em> is not included in Windows Vista Home Basic or Windows Vista Home Premium.</p>
<p>In the search field of the Start Menu type the word "backup" and then click on the
<em>Backup and Restore Center</em> shortcut. Alternatively, you can go to <em>Control Panel -&gt; System and Maintenance -&gt; Backup and Restore Center</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup1.jpg" /></p>
<p>The <em>Backup and Restore Center</em> has two main sections: one for backing up files and one for restoring them.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup2.jpg" /></p>
<p>On top of this, the backup section offers another two options: <em>Back up files</em> and
<em>Back up computer</em>. The first option will create a backup of your personal files and folders and the second will create a complete backup of your entire computer. It is recommended to create a full back up of your computer just after you have set up
 your computer for the first time. Windows Vista will take a snapshot of all your programs, settings and files. You can use this snapshot if your computer ever stops working and restore it to the original state.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup3.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>How to backup your personal files and folders</strong></p>
<p>To start the procedure, click on the <em>Back up files</em> button and the wizard will start.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup4.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the <em>Back Up Files</em> window you will have to select where to save your backup. You can select a partition from your hard disk, a CD, a DVD or a shared folder from your network. Select the location you prefer and click on
<em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup5.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the next window, you will see a list with all your partitions except the one selected as the location for saving your backup. The partition on which Windows Vista is installed will be selected by default. Now you can choose to include or exclude other
 partitions from the backup procedure. After you have made your selections, click on "Next".</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup6.jpg" /></p>
<p>The wizard will now ask you to select the types of files you want to have backed up. You can choose any of the following: pictures, music, videos, e-mail, documents, tv shows, compressed files and additional files. Select the file types you want to include
 in the back up and click on <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup7.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the next window you will be asked about the frequency of the back up process. You can have daily, weekly of monthly backups. The scheduled backups will include only the new files or the modified files to the initial backup which you are about to complete.</p>
<p>Create the settings you want and then click on <em>Save settings and start backup</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup8.jpg" /></p>
<p>The backup process will start. First it will make a shadow copy, then it will scan the selected partitions for files and folders and then it will create the desired backup.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup9.jpg" /></p>
<p>Depending on your system and on how much data you want to backup, the procedure will take from a few minutes up to a few hours. You can stop the backup at any time by clicking on
<em>Stop backup</em>.</p>
<p>When the backup is completed you will see a balloon tip notification showing up on your screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup10.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>How to reschedule or turn off your automated back up</strong></p>
<p>If you want to change the settings of the automatic backup procedure, go to the
<em>Backup and Restore Center</em> and click on the <em>Change settings</em> link beneath the
<em>Backup files</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup11.jpg" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the start menu search box, type "backup" and click on the
<em>Backup Status and Configuration</em> shortcut.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup12.jpg" /></p>
<p>The <em>Backup Status and Configuration</em> window will open. Here you will see the latest information about your backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup13.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you want to make a new backup, click on the <em>Back up now</em> button. To change the current settings click on the
<em>Change back up settings</em> button. You will notice that if you want to change the settings, you will have to go through all the steps described in the screenshots above: selecting the drives, selecting the file types, selecting the schedule, and finally
 you will have to choose if you want to create a new backup or you just to save the settings and exit.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup14.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you want to disable the automatic backup, click on <em>Turn off</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup15.jpg" /></p>
<p>Once you have finalized making all the desired changes, close the window.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>How to create a complete PC backup</strong></p>
<p>To create a complete backup of your PC, go to the <em>Backup and Restore Center</em> and click on
<em>Back up computer</em> to start the procedure.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup16.jpg" /></p>
<p>The wizard will start and it will ask you where you want to save the backup. You can select a hard disk or one or more CDs/DVDs. Make sure you have enough CDs/DVDs or sufficient space on your hard disk and then, after you have made your choice, click on
<em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup17.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the next window you will need to select the partitions which you want to include in the backup. Make the appropriate selections and click on
<em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup18.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the last window, the wizard will show you a summary of your backup settings: the backup location and the disks which will be backed up. In the
<em>Backup location</em> field it will show you the number of DVDs required or the hard disk space required to save your backup.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup19.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fbackup_system%2fbackup20.jpg" /></p>
<p>Click on the <em>Start backup</em> button and the procedure will begin.<br />

<h2>            Exprorer.exe crashes on CTRL key press.</h2>
                    <p>I've got this issue after insider's build update from 14942 to 14951 (I think I skipped 14946 due to not using my laptop). So every time I hit CTRL on my desktop I have Explorer process crashed with this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faulting application name: explorer.exe, version: 10.0.14951.1000, time stamp: 0x5801a6fc</p>
<p>Faulting module name: unknown, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x00000000</p>
<p>Faulting process id: 0x2ebc</p>
<p>Faulting application start time: 0x01d22b719646cb74</p>
<p>Faulting application path: C:\WINDOWS\explorer.exe</p>
<p>Faulting module path: unknown</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to type it all because I cant ctrl+c it. Also Event Viewer doent allow you to copy with right mouse button context menu...</p>
<p>Ok, I also have the other apps crashed when I click CTRL on their active window.. I'm guessing the problem is that something is trying to capture the CTRL button pressed command and fails... I dont know though.. Do you guys see this issue? Any way to fix/figure
 out what is it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            All of a sudden mahjong won&#39;t load</h2>
                    I've been playing mahjong for months with no problems at all. Suddenly last week it started crashing when I tried to open it, not getting past the initial green screen. I've scanned my pc, bought extra security software to make sure it's clean and ran
 the troubleshooter all to no avail. This happened with solitaire too a few weeks ago but after a couple of days it started to work again. If I remove it and reinstall will I lose all my game history, is it saved on my pc or with microsoft?

    <title>Win 10 batch edit mp3 properties erases data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chichi432  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 batch edit mp3 properties erases data</h2>
                    <p>I own over 2000 mp3 songs. Trying to re-group by genre. Using file explorer/select group of mp3/right click/properties/enter new genre name. When I press either OK or Apply, it ERASES ALL DATA, even the song title and album art.&nbsp; Only thing remaining is
 the file name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not happen all the time, just whenever it feels like it. This is a HUGE problem!! Note: I upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix? Or an explaination? Or a program I can use for batch editing?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Backup&#58; Criterias used to perform a &#34;Full Backup&#34; as opposed to an &#34;Incremental Backup&#34;.</h2>
                    
<p><span><span><span>I just started to use Windows Backup on my new Windows 7 (Ultimate, 64 Bit, German language Version) PC.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Because I need to backup periodically a large amount of data (in addition to the System Image of my C Partition: 14 GB of data files on my H Partition
 and 120 GB of photo Files on my F Partition) and because I want to be able to keep my backups for long time, I bought my PC with an additional large internal disk of 2 TB. This 2TB disk is more or less reserved to store my Backups.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>It was my intent to use Windows Backup to perform weekly a
<span>&nbsp;</span>incremental backup and to keep these backups for a long time. </span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>incremental backup and to keep these backups for a long time. </span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I was quite happy In my first tests with Windows Backup.
<span>&nbsp;</span>But a little bit later, <span>&nbsp;</span>I was quite surprised to see that Windows Backup had already created two times (in addition to the original Full backup) a Full Backup in a new "Backup Set".</span></span></span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>But a little bit later, <span>&nbsp;</span>I was quite surprised to see that Windows Backup had already created two times (in addition to the original Full backup) a Full Backup in a new "Backup Set".</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In order to conserve Disk-Space, I would like to avoid, that Windows Backup creates too often new Full Backups. Because in my case a Full Backup
 requires approximately 123 GB. This is a lot. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Therefore, it is important for me to be able to understand, how I can influence/direct Windows Backup to perform
<span>&nbsp;</span>more frequently "Incremental Backups" and less frequently "Full Backups" for the backup of Files/Folders (as opposed to the backup of "System Images" …so far, on my PC, Windows Backup did not revert yet to the creation of a new "Full Backup" for

 the "System Images").</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Questions</span></span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Can you please describe me in which circumstances "Windows Backup" will perform a Full Backup as opposed to an "Incremental Backup" for the Backup
 of Files/folders?</span></strong><span> (my question is for the backups of files/folders; not for the backup of "System Images").</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>I have read that after a Disk Defragmentation, the next incremental Backup created by a Backup Software from another Software company is quite
 large (because (a) Disk defragmentation moves around a lot of data and (b) that all files that had their data moved are considered to have changed).
<br />
<strong>Is this also the case with Windows Backup?</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>Thank You very much in advance for your answers.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>---------</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Details</span> of what I have observed on my PC
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(I do not know, if these details are relevant or not</span>):
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>The First time (after the initial Full backup), that "Windows Backup" performed again a Full Backup, this was approximately after 5 Incremental Backups.
<br />
<br />
I do not know, if this is because 5 is for Windows Backup a limit for the number of incremental backups; or whether this is for another reason that it created again a Full Backup (Unfortunately, I do not remember precisely what I did y before starting this
 Backup that resulted in a Full Backup).<br />
<br />
If there is a limit for the number of incremental backups associated with a Full Backup: can I change/increase this limit?
<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>The last time, that "Windows Backup" performed a Full Backup was in the following scenario.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>I performed a Backup on my Internal "X" Backup Disk (this was the Full Backup mentioned in item 1 above)<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>I then performed a Backup on an external USB Disk (a disk that I store in the safe of my Bank). This was the first Backup on that disk, and therefore this
 was (as expected) a Full Backup.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Then I performed again a Backup on my Internal "X" disk. This was again a Full Backup. Why? Because I had to change my "set up backup" definitions (just
 to change the Backup destinations)? </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>More details: Even though I defined an automatic weekly backup execution (in the "How often do you want to back up?" dialogue), for my current
 tests, I nearly always started the Backup "manually" from the Main window of the "Backup and Restore Center".<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
Also, I use the "Let Windows choose (recommended)" option in the "What do you want to backup?" dialogue.

<p>Hi Eckerlin,<br />
<br />
<strong>Normal/full backups:</strong> All files that have been selected are backed up, regardless of the setting of the archive attribute. When a file is backed up, the archive attribute is cleared. If the file is later modified, this attribute is set, which
 indicates that the file needs to be backed up.<br />
<br />
<strong>Incremental backups:</strong> Designed to create backups of files that have changed since the most recent normal or incremental backup. The presence of the archive attribute indicates that the file has been modified and only files with this attribute
 are backed up. When a file is backed up, the archive attribute is cleared. If the file is later modified, this attribute is set, which indicates that the file needs to be backed up.<br />
<br />
For the second question:<br />
<br />
As mentioned above in Incremental Backup, the presence of the archive attribute indicates that the file has been modified and only files with this attribute are backed up. When a file is backed up, the archive attribute is cleared. If the file is later modified,
 this attribute is set, which indicates that the file needs to be backed up.<br />
<br />
So the next Incremental Backup will be applied to the file which has archive attribute.<br />
<br />
<strong>For:&nbsp; If there is a limit for the number of incremental backups associated with a Full Backup: can I change/increase this limit?
<br />
</strong><br />
After the original full backup is complete, updates to the backup include only files that have changed since the last backup.
<br />
<br />
The backup would also depend on the scheduled setting: Daily, Weekly or Monthly. <br />
<br />
For more control of exactly which files and folders are backed up, you can also set up a new backup and click Let Me Choose from the backup and restore dialog box.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Dyvia.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank You very much for your information, that helped me to better understand how the Backup Program works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I am not sure, whether I extrapolated your information correctly when performing the assumptions that follow. Could you therefore please check whether
 the following is correct or wrong:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><strong><span>If I do not change any backup settings</span></strong><span> (via "Change Settings" of the "Backup and Restore
 Center"), and if I already created a Full Backup:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>the next execution of the Backup will be an Incremental Backup (even If I already have performed 100 incremental backups after the last Full backup).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><strong><span>If
<span>&nbsp;</span>I change the destination of a the backup</span></strong><span> (via "Change Settings" of "the "Backup and Restore Center"):
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>the next execution of the Backup will be a Full Backup (even, if that destination already contains a Full backup, that I created much earlier).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Therefore, if I need to create Backups on two different disks (e.g. because I keep one of these disks at home and the other one in the safe of my
 bank) and want to avoid that after every change of destination, the Backup Program performs again a Full Backup, then I shall proceed as follows:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Run the Backup Program without changing the destination. This will result in an incremental backup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Then once the Backup is complete, copy (e.g. with Windows Explorer) the backup folders from the first disk to the other disk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>What I do not understand:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><strong>will any change of the "Backup Settings" result in</strong> the next execution of the Backup<span>&nbsp;
</span>Program being <strong>a Full Backup</strong>?<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>Or can I change some backup settings (which ones? The schedule periodicity? The schedule date/time? inclusion of a System Image? even changes in the folders that I include in the backup? …. ) without triggering a Full Backup for the next
 execution?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>I will appreciate very much, if you could point me to a reliable description of the Backup Program that describes this level of details (I already bought excellent
 Windows 7 Books (among other "Windows 7 Inside Out" from Microsoft Press) but could not find this type of information).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks again.</span></span></p>

            Dear Divya,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that your answer was (unintentionally) not fully responsive to Eckerlin's questions.&nbsp; I understand the differences between "image," "full" and "incremental" backups; please allow me to state some observations I have made, and please respond if
 they are correct or incorrect.&nbsp; I have been trying to make a (rather large) full backup on a less-than-weekly basis, accompanied by my daily incremental backups.&nbsp; I am using an external 2 TB USB drive.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>When the "Back Up Now" button is pushed, the program makes a full backup, as defined in the user settings.
</li><li>Incremental backups are then performed on a daily basis, or as otherwise scheduled by the user.
</li><li>Another full backup is performed <strong>one week</strong> after the initial full backup, at the exact time that initial backup was run.
</li></ol>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand how to set the schedule for the <em>incremental</em> backups in the program dialog, and this setting also appears to be available in the Windows Task Scheduler under the AutomaticBackup key; however, I'm unclear on how to modify or set the
 schedule for the (currently weekly)<strong><em> full </em></strong>backup. ?&nbsp; Is this setting hardcoded into the backup program, or is it accessible through the Windows Task Scheduler at a different place?&nbsp; I would like to set the full backup frequency to
 monthly, inasmuch as I do a "file backup" of my entire computer when I perform a full backup.&nbsp; I believe that the daily 3 AM incremental backups will suffice for most changes I might make during that interval, though I realize that periodic pruning may be
 necessary.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If possible, please respond to my bullet points individually with your comments, as well as directly answering my question as to full backup scheduling.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't intend to put you on the defensive by being so concrete, but I feel that some of the "party line" documentation for Windows Backup is in error, or otherwise inadequate.&nbsp; Of course, it's possible that there are bugs or other limitations in the program
 as currently written, to be addressed at a later date; if so, a third-party program might be more useful until such time.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help,<br />

            Hi Divya, Hi Microsoft experts<br />
<br />
Could I please get an answer for the questions contained in the 3rd post (dated January 17, 2010 9:03 AM)&nbsp;of this Thread?<br />
<br />
Perhaps, the reason why I did not get an answer is the following: You might think, that my questions are about small details and that users do not need to know this level of details.
<br />
<br />
But in my case, my questions are not about nearly irrelevant details. In a case like my case, when the Full Backups are&nbsp;around 120 GB, it makes really
<strong>a huge difference <br />
</strong>- whether a&nbsp;backup run will result in a Full Backup and require 120 GB of disk storage<br />
- or whether a backup run will only result in a small incremental Backup.<br />
<br />
Thank You in advance for your answer<br />
Robert

            Meanwhile, more thanks to luck than to my average search-skills, I came across another Thread in another Forum, that contains some useful information.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The information that I found was in the Post of SriramB [MSFT], dated November 03, 2009 6:57 AM in&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprogeneral/thread/50f3ff7a-2ae7-41c1-ac92-41edaed1e2f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprogeneral/thread/50f3ff7a-2ae7-41c1-ac92-41edaed1e2f9</a><br />
<br />
I will&nbsp;need to study the information that i found there and will need to complement this information with tests of my own. Then I will see whether/which additional information I need.<br />
<br />
I wish,<br />
a) that Microsoft and Windows 7 documentation (for example the otherwise excellent "Windows 7 Inside Out" book) had provided similar information<br />
b) to have gotten similar information as an answer to my original post in this thread<br />
c) that Microsoft had provided external controls for its Backup Program, without the need to edit Registry keys (this is something, that i never did since I bought&nbsp;my first PC more than 10 years ago - I am a regular PC user not a PC specialist).<br />
<br />
Even though I have a lot of respect and admiration for Microsoft (I am amazed how much functionality I get in Windows for the price I am paying, and how stable Windows has become for me, since I switched long years ago to Windows XP), the following "excuse"
 of SriramB is not reasonable at all: <em>"We deliberately did not allow forcibly starting new backup set or configuring these rules through our UI because we did not want to confuse users about full backups, incremental backups, automatic full backups."&nbsp;<br />
</em><br />
Windows has users like me, who are not PC experts but have a lot of data that they need to backup ....and who need the possibility to configure
<em>"these rules through the UI</em>". Its OK of not presenting the configuration options in the main UI window of the Backup Program. But their should be the possibility to set "advanced" options or "additional options" without messing around with Registry
 keys.<br />
<br />
Of course&nbsp;no company and no individual is perfect.<br />

            In this Post, I will describe the few Windows Backup tests that I have made on my PC, in order to determine in which circumstances, Windows Backup performs a Full Backup and in which other circumstances Windows Backup performs an Incremental Backup.
<br />
<br />
First, I should describe in which environment I have done my tests: <br />
1) I have not changed those Registry entries, that influence when&nbsp;Windows Backup&nbsp;create again a Full Backup after a serie of incremental backups (for explanations on this subject, see&nbsp;the Post of SriramB [MSFT], dated November 03, 2009 6:57 AM in&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

2) in all my tests I have used the "Let Windows choose (recommended)" option of Windows Backup<br />
<br />
----<br />
In my tests, I have noticed (that in addition to what SriramB wrote), Windows Backup performs a Full Backup&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; - After use of "System Restore" to rollback&nbsp;the system to a previous System state.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- After changing the drive used to store the Backup Files<br />
<br />
I guess (but I did not test it and my guess can therefore be wrong) that after restoring the C Partition (and perhaps also after the restore of other partitions/disks), Windows Backup performs a Full Backup.<br />
<br />
In my tests, I noticed, that Windows Backup will stick to creating Incremental Backups<br />
&nbsp; - after changing the scheduling options of the Backup Run (e.g. after changing from weekly to dayli schedules)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- when starting the Windows Backup explicitly, after a series of automatically scheduled incremental backups (and later on, after resuming the automatically scheduled backups)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; - after adding or removing folders to&nbsp;Libraries (Libraries are included in the Backup, when using as I did the "Let Windows choose (recommended option).<br />
<br />
I have not done more tests, because for my purposes, these tests were sufficient.
<br />
<br />
---<br />
It would be great if Microsoft would provide more complete and more reliable descriptions than my own incomplete and unreliable descriptions.&nbsp;<br />

            Just a thought (as I'm in the middle of what appears to be a 3-day Full Backup,
<strong>again</strong> - perhaps the issue is with media files in folders referred to in "Libraries" - e.g., If a file is in a folder called "My MP3 Files" it wouldn't be included in the incremental backup unless
<em>CHANGED</em> , or unless "My MP3 Files" was included in the "Music" Library??&nbsp; Just a thought.<br />

            Bill, Thank You for your Post<br />
<br />
The post of Bill demonstrates how incomplete my previous Post is. This reinforce the gentle request, that Microsoft provides more complete (and more accurate) descriptions than my very incomplete and inaccurate descriptions.
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I thought that i should provide the folloewing additional information about the tests and the observations that i made earlier and reported in my previous Post:<br />
<br />
a) My Backup were written-to/stored-on a large internal Disk. Neither on a shared network folder, nor on removable medias such as CDs/DVDs, nor..... I do not know, how different the behavior of Windows Backup is for Shared network folders, removable medias,
 ....<br />
<br />
b) n my previous Post, I was describing some of the circumstances in which Windows Backup performs a "Full Backup" as opposed to "Incremental Backups". Because my original questions were about "File/Folder Backups" and not about "System Image" backups, I forgot
 to mention explicitely that my descriptions were descriptions for "File/Folder Bavckups" and not for the "System Image Backups" that Windows Backup includes automatically in the Backup when the user selects the "Let Windows choose (recommended)" option.
<br />
<br />
In none my tests, did Windows Backup revert for "System Image Backups" to a Full Backup.<br />
<br />
c)&nbsp;The long Thread &nbsp; "&gt;
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprogeneral/thread/50f3ff7a-2ae7-41c1-ac92-41edaed1e2f9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
mentions that Windows Backup has (or had?) a particular behavior in environments involving the Media Player and Media Player Extensions. I am not familiar at all with such environments and my descriptions do not mention them. This too demonstrates how incomplete
 my descriptions are. <br />
<br />
I believe to have read. that Indexing too can be relevant for the behavior of Windows Backup.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<strong>Microsoft, please, please provide us with reasonable descriptions about Windows Backup. Users who have large amount of data to backup regularly</strong> (today, I need to backup regularly around 140 GB - soon it will be much more)<strong> of data really
 need to have better descriptions. <br />
<br />
If this kind of forum is not the right place to ask for such descriptions: please let me know what the right place is.
<br />
</strong><br />
Thanks a lot in advance.<br />

<p>I understand that some of the issues causing incremental backups to backup more files than expected are source of concern. We are trying the best we can to address some of these issues.</p>
<p>Windows Backup was designed for users backing up data to a single backup target (either disk or network share or DVD). In case backup targets are being switched from time to time, then Windows Backup starts with a new baseline full on the switched backup
 target.</p>
<p>We intentionally did not expose incremental/full backups to users keeping simplicity in mind. (Users would like to have their data backed up/protected. Whether the decision of doing full or incremental should not be forced upon the user. The software would
 have to do the right thing for the user.)</p>
<p>There are definitely scenarios where Windows Backup is not very optimal &amp; where customizations in software would help.&nbsp;We take your feedback and would try to see how we can address them in future releases.</p>
<p>We have a series of blogs that would help you understand Windows Backup &amp; its features:</p>

<p>Sriram</p>
<p>I have been trying for some time to understand the backup mechanism - and have just come across this thread.</p>
<p>The problem with letting Windows&nbsp; 'sort it out' is that I am seeing my backup disk fill up, and unless I can force a new full backup, cannot delete anything. The ability to force a full backup is important, in order to be able to control disk space. &nbsp;&nbsp; Just
 creating incremental backups' forever' just fills disks.</p>
<p>I would suggest better Help documentation using (and defining) the terms full and incremental backup; and the ability to schedule full backups (e.g. monthly) and incremental backups (e.g. daily).&nbsp; The only other thing then required would be the ability to
 clearly distinguish between backup sets.</p>
<p>[I am about to try to force a new full backup by 'hiding' the current backup set, but such subterfuge should not be necessary&nbsp; Wish me luck !!.]</p>

<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel

<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If you recently upgraded to a new version of Windows 10, there might be a compatibility issue.
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            HHMcGrew</h2>
                    <p>I have a Compaq mini 110c with XP and I am trying to format the C: drive. &nbsp;When at command prompt I type format c: and answer y to erase all data I get a message "Format cannot run because the volume is being used by another process. &nbsp;Format may run if this

 an XP disk at startup but I get a message saying it cant continue due to concerns about viruses and asks me to run chkdsk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me, I want to format the drive in favour of another OS. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can't boot on a hard drive and then format the hard drive while you are using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The volume is open and used by another process and locked by another user and that user is YOU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody once said attempting to format the volume on which you are currently booted is like trying to change a tire on your car while it is still moving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the message about "message saying it cant continue due to concerns about viruses and asks me to run chkdsk' if you wish to pursue that you need to tell us exactly what the error message says without paraphrasing and if the XP CD you are using is
 a genuine bootable XP installation CD or some kind of Recovery CD that may have come with your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you did not say what other OS you are in favour of, you can perform a Google search to get instructions telling you how to install (at least) Microsoft operating systems including formatting the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I Googled <em>how to install windows 7</em> and got this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/installing-reinstalling-windows#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/installing-reinstalling-windows#1TC=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click the link that says:</p>
<span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/installing-reinstalling-windows#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Using the Custom installation option and formatting the hard disk</a></span></span>
<p>For example I Googled <em>how to install windows 8</em> and got this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/clean-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/clean-install</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Google search returns lots of other links to sites with instructions, how tos, with pictures, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before starting you might also want to download and run the Upgrade Advisers to see if you hardware meets the minimum requirements and which applications you might have installed that are not going to be compatible (you will have to purchase upgrades for
 them if they are available) and also check with the HP/Compaq Support site to be sure they have hardware drivers for whatever operating system you choose to install.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for getting back to me, and for the information added!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I get re the virus etc reads like this.</p>
<p>1. I start up the netbook and press F9 to change the boot sequence to boot from CD drive (I have a USB CD/DVD drive attchaed via 2x USB ports). The Win XP disk is in this drive.</p>
<p>2. I choose the DVD-RAM option&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. A message "Press any key to boot from CD..."</p>
<p>4. the blue windows setup screen appears with various messages along the light strip at the bottom "Setup is loading files" It reaches the stage where the message on the light strip reads "Setup is starting Windows" then... the message in question is as
 follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong><em>A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. &nbsp; If this screen appears again, follow these steps:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Check for viruses on your computer. &nbsp;Remove any newly installed hard drives or hard drive controllers. &nbsp; Check your hard drive to make sure it is properly configured and terminated. &nbsp;Run CHKDSK /F to check for hard drive corruption, and then
 restart your computer.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Technical information:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>*** STOP: 0x0000007B (0xF7A22524, 0xC0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)</em></strong> ".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. &nbsp; The problem being that there appears to be no way out, this message does not give the option of closing or any other option to comply with what it asks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>"I want to format the drive in favour of another OS</em>"</p>

    <title>PC stuck in boot state after WU scheduled restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> racebo  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC stuck in boot state after WU scheduled restart</h2>
                    <p>I have an older HP d5000t custom desktop minitower that has been running reliably for the past several years. Now with Windows 10, I'm experiencing an issue that I had never encountered on any previous Windows OS version.
</p>
<p>As a background, I never shut my computer down anymore, I leave it on and then let it go into hybrid standby after some time. I generally only end up rebooting due to a software change or windows update. (A nod to how stable the OS is!)</p>
<p>Issue:</p>
<p>When an automatically applied windows update update is installed that schedules a reboot, I find that the reboot doesn't successfully complete without hard powering off then cold booting. I find my computer in an unresponsive state with a blank screen and
 the fans running at full. After the cold boot, Windows returns to normal.</p>
<p>Usually these updates are applied in the middle of the night and after I've allowed the computer to go to sleep. When I look at the computer in the morning, that's when I discover it being in this odd state.</p>
<p>The event logs are not reporting anything specific to this issue, there are no driver crashes or the like. I can shutdown and reboot my computer normally and using shutdown.exe works just like it should. It appears as though the reboot process is somehow
 puts the computer into an odd boot state. I've reported this via the Feedback app as well.</p>
<p>I'm not seeing anything standing out that I could troubleshoot further.</p>
<p>I would be happy to share more detailed specs of my computer for further investigation.</p>

            <p>1. I had uninstalled the Norton solution as it expired and made sure that I pulled all of its ugly junk off of my computer... in 2009. There is no trace of it on my computer now.</p>
<p>2. I believe that I did run the Norton Removal tool. It's a shame that the AV vendors require such a thing when their goal is to _protect_ your PC from infections not litter it with crapware.</p>
<p>3. I was never running in safe mode. My computer runs perfectly fine except for this edge case. Once I hard boot the computer any remaining updates apply and my computer operates correctly with all updates verifiably installed. (I wouldn't mind a notification
 in the action center&nbsp;though that a reboot has been scheduled, just so that I can be aware and/or reboot on my own... knowing that is currently the way that I can mitigate this issue.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is an issue that is really hard to trace - the computer is stuck in a boot state (monitor is on but blank)&nbsp;and the handoff from the baselevel code to the OS isn't occurring&nbsp;after a scheduled reboot occurs - there are no logs to examine. I have
 been investigating the possibility of Intel's Rapid Storage Technology driver being a culprit. I'm currently using version 14.5.0.1081 which was released in June. When using Windows 8.1, I was using version 12.9.0.1001, but had to upgrade with the release
 of Windows 10.&nbsp;The latest release, 14.6.0.1029 has a bug which causes the computer to fault with an inaccessible boot device error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to know is what is different about the reboot when it scheduled and triggered via WU versus either an interactive reboot, or scripted via shutdown.exe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the pointer, but I won't be able to know until Microsoft pushes another update that schedules a reboot automatically. That happens... like once a month. Even then, it's not clear that there's enough evidence that there's a reason to run the Norton
 Removal Tool. </p>
<p>Remember, manual reboots - reboots that I trigger directly - are not impacted by this issue.</p>

            <p>I guess that I'm not explaining myself correctly. The computer only gets stuck in a boot state when a patch is deployed and installed via Windows Update and an automatic restart is performed. That's the

<p>Hi Todd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two method you can try. Firstly, you can use Outlook to schedule Skype for Business meeting. For detailed steps, please follow the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-a-skype-for-business-meeting-in-outlook-b8305620-d16e-4667-989d-4a977aad6556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-a-skype-for-business-meeting-in-outlook-b8305620-d16e-4667-989d-4a977aad6556</a></p>

<h3> majestero  say:</h3>
<h2>            0x000000ED Bluescreen Error on Windows 7 and the Repair Tool doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft Community , <br />
<br />
<br />
I have a more or less typical problem. A Netbook of my GFriend <strong>Lenovo u160</strong> has the
<strong>0x000000ED Bluescreen Error </strong>after loading Windows 7. It starts after the Windows 7 Loading Screen.<br />
<br />
So I tried the intern <strong>Windows Repair Function</strong>, but after the loading screen....
<strong>nothing</strong>, not even a blue screen, just black for like ever.<br />
So I took another Windows 7 Pc and made a <strong>Windows Repair Disk</strong>, as recommended.<br />
The Lenovo u160 has no Disk Drive, so I took an extern one to boot the PC with the disk. Changed the Boot priority in the BIOS Menu<br />
and it worked, allmost.<br />
It started all well, the setup started, you could choose a language and the next step was Install, Repair Tool and Windows Informations.<br />
<br />
I choosed <strong>Repair Tool</strong> of course, but that was it. There was no next Step, just the Basic Windows Background. I thought, maybe it would take some time so I left it so for the night and next morning nothing happened. I restarted and choose Install,
 nothing happened. No way to start the pc and the disk seems not to work.<br />
<br />
I have no Idea what to do now, do you have any solutions? And yes I have tried the basics like repair tool and no I don't know which Win7 is operating....

            <p>Sry sir, but I'm not able to run Windows to get to the dump files, because there is this little problem with the blue screen error and the fact that Windows can't start properly. So it restarts (or crashs) itself before the log in screen every time and no
 the repair function doesn't work (see above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you know a different way to help me, please, I'm exhausted and on my limits. I need your help.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div><br />
Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You have mentioned that you are receiving the error message “Your PC is Offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this PC”. Don’t worry; we’ll help you with this. Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Are you trying to log into a Microsoft account or a Local account? Is it an Administrator account?<br />
2) Have you reset the password for your Microsoft account recently?<br />
3) Have you installed Webroot Antivirus?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We usually receive this error message if we have typed the password incorrectly. We can also get this error message if you login to the computer for the first time after resetting your password online.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to first check if the CAPs lock is on and try the correct password once again. If you have recently reset the password online, I would suggest you to login with the old password and check.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you haven’t reset the password and if you are unable to login with the correct password, then I would suggest you to check the steps mentioned by Cliff_N&nbsp;on december 7th here:</div>
