<h3> jp cox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yammer iOS login</h2>
                    <p>For some reason i cannot login to the Yammer ios app. &nbsp;Its says "login failed please check your username and/or password and try again"....however i have made 100% positive im entering the correct login info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've looked for help in this matter and something about a temp pasword is recommended. &nbsp;Yet, every time i go to yammer.com it pulls up my ios app. &nbsp;The whole thing is confusing since why doesn't my login/pass work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note i am the one at our company driving the use of Yammer - so this kind of thing doesn't help my cause...many others will want to use their ipad with Yammer i am sure, so will they all go through this?</p>

<h3> nick giannios  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook recipient disappears on forwarding</h2>
                    <p>In Outlook 2016 when forwarding a message directly from the inbox (Right-Click Forward) sometimes the message body does not contain the recipients of the forwarded message. If I first open the message and then forward the entire information is included.
 I have seen this in multiple users in my company. Is this somehow configurable?</p>

            Just the To field missing from the reply block or are the recipient names but not there addresses listed?  
<br />
<br />The names but not addresses is not uncommon - the latest builds of office 2016 fix this.

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2010 runs super slow</h2>
                    I upgraded my outlook 2007 to 2010 and now it runs super slow. Even if I highlight a message to move to an archive file it takes 15 to 30 seconds to respond. I can't find anything running in the background and it's getting quite irritating. I'm about ready
 to go back to 2007. Anybody else having this same issue?

<h2>            get mailboxrule size&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm looking for a Powershell command (other other way possible) to determine an user's current mailbox rule size.</p>

<p>Yesterday I found these:</p>
<p>The following example command sets the rules quota to the maximum value of 256 KB.</p>
<p>Set-Mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -RulesQuota:256kb</p>
<p>The following example command allows you to view the current rules quota for a mailbox.</p>
<p>Get-Mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** |FL displayname, rulesquota</p>

<p>But this shows the current Quota, not the Usage. What I'm looking for, for example user A. Says user A has hundreds of rules. I want to find out the current size of his inbox rules, to see if he's exceeding his inbox rule quota or not.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>

<p>Hi Sava,</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to check current utilization size of user’s Inbox rules. Yes, you are right we can only see current Rules Quota limit and increase ‘Rules Quota’ limit for a particular user or mailbox, by running the command in the Windows PowerShell module.</p>
<p>For your reference: https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/exchange/2490</p>

<p>Hi Shyamal,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reply.</p>
<p>I however am having a user whose Out of Office is not working. My research suggests that it might be due to the fact she has over 110 Inbox Rules, and either that's too many rules, or her Inbox rules size is over the limit, which is causing her Out of Office
 reply to not work.</p>
<p>I have tried to increase her Inbox Rule quota from default 64Kb to 256Kb, but that does not solve it.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless I have a way to find out if she's exceeding the number of rules maximum she could have (is 111 too many?), or if I can find the exact size of her current Inbox Rule, I'm at a lost right now.</p>
<p>Please advise or suggest me a way to solve this,</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Sava,</p>
<p>If the size of the rules reaches the limit, the user will receive an error and not be able to create new rules.
</p>
<p>Could you help to confirm the following points to narrow down the cause?</p>
<p>1. Can the user create new inbox rules?</p>
<p>2. Is there any error message when you set up Out of Office?</p>
<p>3. Do you mean that the senders are unable to receive the Out of Office replies regarding “not working”?</p>
<p>4. Does it work when you turn off all the inbox rules temporarily?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<h2>            Outlook sucks</h2>
                    Entourage was a really good Email program for the Mac. I've used it for years, but in the 2011 version of Office for Mac, we are stuck with Outlook, which doesn't do anything it's supposed to do. You spend all your time trying to fix the program and little
 time sending or receiving Email messages? I don't see that as a great reason to spend all that money for an upgrade.
<div>When you YOU (Microsoft) put out a fix for Outlook, that actually does what it is supposed to do?&nbsp;</div>
<div>I like the idea of some of the thing it's been advertised to do, but it just doesn't do my of any of them. How bout the fact it no longer has an outbox, so you can't delete anything in that box. And when you want to change the color of the font you are
 working with so you can differentiate between two people having a conversation it automatically changes the all the font in the whole of the Email message. And dozens of other problems to numerous to mention.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So when can your customers expect you to deliver an Email program that actually does what is advertised, which is work for one thing. Without US having to spend all our time on message boards hoping to find a fix. How about fixing it before you offer it
 to the public?</div>

                    Is there a limitation to the number of recipients that I can send mail to using Mail Merge? Also, will any of the mail be sent to the recipients spam folder if I use Mail Merge?

            <p>If there is a limitation, it'll probably on the side of your ISP (Internet Service Provider). Many ISPs throttle the number of email messages that can be sent within a short period of time, to prevent spam. It might be a good idea to send the emails in batches
 of 50 or so, and wait for a couple of minutes between batches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether the messages will be seen as spam&nbsp;does not depend on mail merge, but with the subject and content of the messages.</p>

    <title>Change Default Display Calendar in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shooter27  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Default Display Calendar in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Using Outlook 2013, I have three active calendars I am using.&nbsp; The first one is what I would consider the default calendar that existed when outlook was first created.&nbsp; It is under the folder "My Calendars" and there is a single calendar under that folder
 called "Calendar".&nbsp; This my calendar on my work PC so it is the one that is driven my the company's enterprise outlook licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other two calendars are created under a new folder created called "iCloud" that contains two calendars, called "iCloud - A" and "iCloud-B" that are driven off of when I installed iCloud on my PC so I could see my personal calendards on my work PC.</p>
<p><br />
I always keep all three calendars checked so all three calendards show up on&nbsp;the calendar&nbsp;view at all times.&nbsp; At the top of the view page, I then can select a tab to make a particular calendar 'active' when I need to modify one fo the three calendars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My preference is to always have my orignal "My Calendars - Calendar"&nbsp;the default so everytime I open outlook, this calendar is the active one as I do 95% of my appoints in this calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based upon reading other suggestions, I was told that whatever calendar&nbsp;tab is selected&nbsp;when outlook is closed, that is the calendar that will be active when I re-open Outlook.&nbsp; However now matter what calendar tab is selected prior to closing Outlook, the
 "iCloud - B" calendar is always the one that is active when I re-open Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any setting to I can change to modify this so I can select which calendar I want to be active when outlook starts?&nbsp; Again, I always have all three calendars checked at all times so all three over shown at all times, but now I am just trying to set
 which one is always active when outlook starts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>

            <p>If I do step one, then I actually only have one calendar showing so that would not be a true test.&nbsp; However, understanding you intent so&nbsp;I selected another shared calendar which I usually don' thave open after I unchecked my icloud calendar to test the idea.&nbsp;
 It is my understanding that whatever calendar is open at time of close, that is the calendar that will show up upon reopening outlook. With the icloud calendars unchecked, the behavior did not come out as expected.&nbsp; I closed outlook with "mycalendar" as the
 active one and when I opened up outlook, the other&nbsp;shared calendar&nbsp;was shown as active.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i disable the icloud add-in the behavior is the same in which the shared calendar now is always taking the default after opening outlook no matter what calendar is active when I close outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to further test, I created another calendar under My calendars.&nbsp; So here is what I have in my directory:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Calendars</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Calendar</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Calendar - 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shared Calendars</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Conference Room</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have these three calendars showing in my calendar view, the Conference Room Calendar will always be active when I open Outlook even if I close my outlook with Calendar or Calendar-2 active.&nbsp; This is still with iCloud add-in disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I uncheck the Conference Room calendar and only have Calendar and Calendar-2 shown, then Calendar will aways be active when I re-open outlook even if I close outlook with Calendar-2 active.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, there appears to be a set priority on the calendards that is driving what is active when outlook is reopened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I keep icloud add-in disabled, then have the following listed which is what am currently using</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Calendars</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Calendar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iCloud&nbsp;</p>
<p>- iCloud Calendar&nbsp;- 1</p>
<p>- iCloud Calendar&nbsp;- 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then Calendar will be active when I close and reopen Outlook no matter what calendar was active when I closed outlook.&nbsp; This is actually what I prefer, but I am not sure what I am loosing by disabling the iCloud Add-In.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I activate the iCloud Add-In with the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Calendars</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Calendar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iCloud&nbsp;</p>
<p>- iCloud Calendar&nbsp;- 1</p>
<p>- iCloud Calendar&nbsp;- 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then iCloud Calendar - 2 ends up being the active calendar when I reopen Outlook no matter what I have active when I close outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so in summary I don't think the iCloud addin is impacting the behaviour all by itself, but does affect the priority somewhow.&nbsp; even with the add-in disabled, it does no appear to be working the way it should eithe.</p>

            <p>Outlook Calendar 2013 does not remember the last&nbsp;active/selected calendar tab on exit. Calendar 2013 always activates/selects the first (leftmost) calendar tab. If you want to change the active calendar on start-up you have to change the order of the list,
 and put the calendar that you want to be active first in the list. You can&nbsp;change the order&nbsp;by dragging calendars in the calendar column, or by using the Move up/move down options in the context (right click) menu for a given calendar. You can't change the
 order by dragging Calendar tabs, however, as any normal user would expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook Calendar 2013 has one of the worst UI's I've ever seen, and is riddled with bugs--it should be an embarrassment to Microsoft and the second rate engineers who developed it. Earlier versions were more cleanly designed and easier to use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A typical user booby trap:</p>
<p>1) Start Calendar</p>
<p>2) Forget to select active Calendar (it is almost impossible quickly determine which one is active), so it defaults to the first, which is not the one you want</p>
<p>3) Create an appointment in the (wrong) Calendar</p>
<p>4) Spend a half-hour trying to figure out how to move appointment to a different Calendar</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the answer is to drag it to a calendar in the Calendar column)</p>
<p>5) Spend another half-hour trying to figure out why the attempted move generates an error saying&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;can't move the appointment (to iCloud based calendars).</p>
<p>6) Delete the appointment (but wait, even though I've deleted it, it doesn't go away!)</p>
<p>7) Select the correct Calendar, and recreate the appointment</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not just have a pull-down list of calendars when&nbsp;you edit the appointment&nbsp;, so that you can easily change the calendar with which the appointment is associated? All other Calendar apps that I've looked at allow this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the user should be able to choose the active calendar on start-up regardless of the order of the Calendars! This is ridiculous! Did this product undergo any usability testing, or does Microsoft just enjoy planting banana peels in their software.</p>

            I know this is old news, but thanks for your entertaining reply. &nbsp;It amazes me every time how Microsoft has no regard or understanding of its user base and how important it is that they leave the structure of their menus alone. &nbsp;I absolutely despise 2013.
 &nbsp;It almost seems intentionally frustrating in an effort to migrate the base to Outlook.com.&nbsp;

            <p>Same issue here, Abe. &nbsp;My own calendar is on the leftmost tab, then I have an overlaid shared calendar (my boss's) next to it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I navigate to Calendars, it puts my boss's calendar tab in focus. &nbsp;Doesn't matter if I change the order etc. &nbsp;It may work for a few hours (at best) if I repeatedly force it to change, but soon reverts back to the shared calendar in focus. &nbsp;Why
 is my own calendar not treated as the priority, especially if it's at the top of the list/leftmost tab?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had similar complaints from other staff whose Outlook 2013 Calendar view settings are not "sticking". &nbsp;Would be great to have a long term fix.</p>

 2013, it defaults to his and it's very frustrating.

            I agree, I used to love Outlook and I required all my employees to use it but I am having an issue that started with the 2016 update that if I set a specific calendar, the one I use 95% of the time and then change view to e mail then back to that calendar
 it then shows in column mode instead of month mode. I am so frustrated with it that I am about to dump Outlook.

    <title>Multiple orders from 1 form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exnomad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple orders from 1 form</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,<br />
I have a form which allows users to enter new orders. The form's Data Entry property is set to 'Yes'<br />
Rather than give users direct access to the fields, I have a number of unbound combo boxes and text boxes to receive the data.<br />
When the user clicks the 'Save' button, vba checks the validity of the unbound controls data, then updates the actual fields.<br />
eg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Validity checks go here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Customer] = ComboCustomer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Product ID] = ComboProducts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Qty] = TextQty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Order received] = TextReceived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Invoiced] = "No"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Job Status] = "Current"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Invoice Number] = TextInvNo<br />
where controls on the left are bound, and those on the right are the unbound ones that the user sees.<br />
This works.<br />
But the issue is that an order is often broken up. The customer orders 5000 items, but wants delivery over 5 months.<br />
Currently, users have to create 5 separate orders, which is tiresome, since much of the information is the same for each order.<br />
So I introduced a combobox containing the numbers 1 thru 10, representing the number of deliveries.<br />
I then added 9 more unbound controls for some fields, making them visible or not, as required by the number of deliveries.<br />
So, for example, ComboCustomer is unchanged, but TextQty is now TextQty1, TextQty2, TextQty3, etc.<br />
The user can now include the multiple delivery information without having to repeat the static info.<br />
I want to run through the code, inserting varified data into the bound controls, then loop back, running thru as many times as there are deliveries,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">creating as many orders as there are deliveries</span>.<br />
At the moment, this only enters 1 order (the last one) into the orders table, because the code just over-writes the same record.<br />
SO:<br />
I'm looking for a line of code that 'closes off' or 'enters' a record and opens a new one at the end of each loop iteration.<br />
Is this possible?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance - Dave.</p>

<p>Actually, I'm going to make a suggestion, what you want to do is normalize your database.&nbsp; Have a look at...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.access-diva.com/dm12.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.access-diva.com/dm12.html</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main part of the Order (which stays the same) should go in the main table, in the examples case tblPrurchaseOrder and the lines of the actual items should go in the *sub*-table, in this case tblPurchaseOrderDetail.&nbsp; This will not only streamline data
 entry but use far less to have to *update*.&nbsp; It also takes care of not storing the same information over and over again which is the exact opposite of what a normalized database does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you take this time now to adjust your tables now it will pay for itself in time saved down the road.</p>

<p>Hi Gina. I had a look at your link and did a little research on normalising a database.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I explained myself well or not.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, my database is normalised, with no data repeated in tables. The form I'm working on is based on a query which pulls fields from several tables.</p>
<p>What I was hoping to know is:</p>
<p>Each time I close the data-entry form, then re-open it, I can enter another new record.</p>
<p>Is there a vba way of being able to enter another new record without actually closing then opening of a form?</p>
<p>Regards - Dave.</p>

<p>From your explanation I don't believe your database is normalized properly. Based on what you are telling us you can only have one product per order. ls that the case? Normally customers can order multiple products per order. So that means you should have
 an orders table and an order details table,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if its only one product per order, If an order is shipped in multiple releases then you should have a separate releases table. Something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblReleases</p>
<p>ReleaseID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>OrderID (FK)</p>
<p>ReleaseDate</p>
<p>ReleaseQty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The normal way to enter this data is via a subform.</p>

<p>OK, I think I see what you are saying. Yes, a customer can (and does) order more than one product on a single order, but currently we break that down and handle it as multiple orders - one order per product, and enter it that way. We are a small company
 at present, but I can see the merits of your suggestion. Thanks for the interest.</p>

<p>You say:</p>
<p><span><strong>The form I'm working on is based on a query which pulls fields from several tables.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>That's almost certainly a mistake. Multitable queries can be hard or impossible to update. Normally one would use a Form with Subforms for this purpose; and with a Subform for the deliveries, you wouldn't need any code
 at all, nor would you need multiple TextQty controls - just additional new records on the subform.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note also that the "Data Entry" property of a Form can be confusing - if it is set to Yes, then the form will ONLY let you add new records, not view or edit existing ones. A simple bound form allows you to do both.</span></p>

<p>It can be done, and depends on the query; it's fairly often helpful. But it can have problems!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're willing, perhaps you could open the query you're using in SQL view and post the SQL text here. I'm curious how you have it set up. It may also help to post the relevant tables and their relationships.</p>

<p>Hi Nicole, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can sign into <a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office portal</a> with your work/school account to check if you can see OneDrive and Word Online. If yes, access OneDrive for Business&gt;upload that paper&gt;and then edit it with Word Online as a temporary
 workaround. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the issue, please access <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>. Check if there is “The latest desktop version of Office”. If yes, it means you have the related license of Office for Mac. If not, please contact your tenant IT or school IT to assign you related license.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have that license, but cannot use Word for Mac, I’d like to confirm the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture a screenshot for “it tells me the editing has been looked”.</li><li>As you mentioned Word worked well before, when does it run into this issue, after Mac OS updates?</li><li>Click <strong>Word</strong> on the top bar&gt;<strong>About Word</strong>&gt;capture a screenshot of the pop-up. Meanwhile, click
<strong>Apple</strong> icon on the top bar&gt;<strong>About This Mac</strong>&gt;capture a screenshot of your Mac OS version.</li></ol>

<h2>            I have access to my OneNote on-line, but now my desktop is not syncing and telling me I need permissions to edit my own notebooks</h2>
                    <p>Hi :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this flag across the top of my notebooks now that says "We're sorry, your account doesn't seem to have permissions to edit this notebook, Click here to try again".</p>
<p>* Clicking there does nothing. I seem to be able to edit it anyways.</p>
<p>* I have access to it on line just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I have several notebooks with a red X next to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I have several others with the yellow warning exclamation.</p>
<p>* If I open a notebook with the red X and click on it, I get a window that says Sync automatically or Sync manually with all my notebooks there. Sync all brings back the response "Not syncing".</p>
<p>* Under these notebooks is the same remark as above with the error code 0x0E190193. Clicking on the Get Help link tells me that I no longer have access to my own notebooks. If I open up Share in my OneNote on my computer and click Invite people, I get Only
 Document Owners can share their documents..... I am the document owner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I looked up how to possibly fix this and a microsoft site suggested I close a notebook and then re-open it in OneNote on line by clicking the Open in OneNote ribbon. A pop-up says something about an external protocol is required - one thing leads to another
 but the end result is I can no longer open that notebook in OneNote on my desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Another site suggested I open my user accounts / and 'manage my credentials' and under Generic Credentials remove anything there 'from the vault'. I did so and this has accomplished nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These are all my Notebooks. I created them all. A few of them have shared access but I control that access. Or used to. The two other people who do have access to two of the accounts haven't touched these notebooks in months. I am the administrator of my
 computer as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please. I am feeling the computer "reboot" (and boot again and again and again) feeling coming on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx!</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To solve this issue you may try the following step in OneNote 2013 on your desktop computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>In OneNote 2013, click on <strong>
File &gt; Account</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>In Connected Services check if you are logged in to OneDrive.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>If yes, you may try signing out and sign-in again.
</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you were not logged in to OneDrive, then login to OneDrive using your Microsoft Account credentials.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the above step helps to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the above information helps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>I have a similar problem. I can use OneDrive on line, but if I use PC settings and go to one drive account on PC and I try to verify account it tells me that my password is not valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I raised a call and Microsoft support told me it is not a password problem but a one drive problem and I raise another call.</p>

            <p>Does not help - I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restarted, logged out and in to both onedrive and the computer, and closed and opened the notebook. I've logged out on my phone and all other devices too. I've logged in from oneNote online and then closed the notebook and used the "open in onenote"
 link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a pin for windows login... I've changed to password and so on but no better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happened when I changed my MS password. It's as though the notebook on this PC hasn't realised my password has changed and is still requiring my old credentials even though they've changed. I have three other notebooks which are all working fine.<br />
<br />
Now I'm going to reinstall OneNote 2016 and see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to happen every time I change my password. OneDrive's sync and permissions code seems very weak compared to competing products, especially google equivalents which are super robust.</p>

<p><span><span>You might try doing an Online Repair of Office 2016.
</span><span>Follow these steps to perform an online repair of Office 2016:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>&gt; Control Panel</strong></span><span>. </span></li><li>
<span>From Control Panel navigate to <strong>Programs</strong> and /or
<strong>Programs and Features</strong> and right-click on your Office 2016 installation.</span></li><li>
<span>Click on <strong>Change</strong> and then select the
<strong>Online Repair</strong> option.</span></li><li>
</span></li><li>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I have run the online repair as suggested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't work, so I also did a clean reinstall. That also didn't work. In fact it's got worse, now even my "Personal (Web)" notebook is saying I don't have permission to use it.<br />
<br />
After that, I've re-changed my MS/windows password and signed out and in to everything again to see if that helps. It doesn't - OneNote still believes I don't have access to the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other versions of OneNote - the phone, online and windows tablet versions - allow me to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all started when I changed my Skype login due to having used a pin for so long I forgot my MS password...<br />
<br />
<strong>EDIT:</strong><br />
For some reason just now I was able to view the notebook without being able to edit. It's telling me to copy the section to another notebook because it can't sync, but then gives a contradictory error saying it can't copy until everything is synced.
<br />
<br />
I've noticed there are definite bugs when syncing between mobile and desktop versions of onenote. Sketching for example often layers wrong when it moves over, and highlights can be off centre or look a lot different. I added a photo to one of the notes via
 mobile, and that's the one that really wont sync now. I'm going to remove the photo and try again...<br />
<br />
... no change. Ok I give up. I'm copy pasting everything from the web version into a new replacement notebook and deleting this old one. This will take a while. Not cool, guys. Not cool.<br />
... ok so my personal one was working intermittently, but now it's doing the same thing. There are so many notes in there that there is no way I can copy it manually to a new notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried copying the notebook and renaming online - new notebook is still corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried exporting sections (some let me do this even after a warning about it being out of date) which is fine, but
<strong>IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T IMPORT A SECTION INTO ANOTHER NOTEBOOK. Just wow.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Oh and now a brand new notebook I just created is having the same errors.</em></p>

            <p>Done as requested, removed all the office, windows etc. credentials just to catch em all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reopened Onenote and was prompted to re enter my password for the notebooks. The ones that worked before worked fine, the ones that didn't, don't. The personal one and the "mine" I created recently are both saying that they either don't have permissions
 or can't access the file.<br />
<br />
As before, everything still works on all other platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap, so far I have:</p>
<br />
<p>Done an online repair</p>
<p>Done a clean reinstall</p>
<p>tried opening from the webpage using "open in onenote"</p>
<p>tried sharing an edit link with myself</p>
<p>tried exporting the notebook</p>
<p>tried moving sections to other notebooks</p>
<p>tried logging in and out of both onenote and windows</p>
<p>Tried copying the notebooks and opening the copies</p>
<p>Tried logging out of all other platforms to see if it makes a difference</p>
<p>Tried deleting my windows credentials and starting over after restart</p>
<p>Tried changing my MS password again in order to force the passwords to update.</p>
<p>Tried syncing on other device</p>
<p>Tried a different internet connection in case it's a firewall issue</p>
<p><br />
So far no luck.<br />
<br />
My theory is that the files themselves are corrupt somehow at the permissions level in a way that only the desktop version cares about. I've tried modifying and syncing the notebooks on other platforms to see if that'll overwrite it, but it seems there's no
 obvious way to fix the files. I can't find other platforms that will allow me to move sections - seems only the desktop version can do that so that workaround isn't available.<br />
The only other thing I can think of to do is to reinstall windows.</p>

            Turns out the problem was the result of the virus program not permitting access to AOL.COM rather than being a windows error. &nbsp;However the error code was coded as an error code which windows recommended clearing the cookies and web sites.

    <title>Microsoft Access&#58; template for a definition database - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Access&#58;  template for a definition database</h2>
                    <p>Hello MS Access community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been tasked with creating a database for terminology and definitions.&nbsp; Currently, the data is located in 15 different documents, which have some parallel items within them.&nbsp; I have taken the data from the documents and put it into an Excel spreadsheet,
 as it is easier to manipulate.&nbsp; Now, I'm looking to move it to an Access database.&nbsp; However, when looking for a template online that may already complete what I am doing, I cannot find something that fits this type of data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, before plunging into a&nbsp;creative mode, I was wondering if anyone knew of an existing Access database template for storing terminology and definitions that could be used?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ahead of time!</p>

            I had the same reaction as Tom. This is basically a single table as he described. You MIGHT want to add some level of categorization to group the terms. That would mean adding a catefory table and a foreign key in the main table.&nbsp;

            <p>I agree it looks simple enough, but I'm also correlating multiple definitions for the same term with reference to where they are found (publication number, edition, section, etc.).&nbsp; This is in hopes of bringing several different definitions to a concise,
 reusable definition for a single term.&nbsp; That is where it kind of gets 'sticky'.&nbsp; I know very&nbsp;simple databases, and am no where near a pro level, so I was looking for something I could adapt (and learn from).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the suggestions, and now it is time to get creative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<span>Unfortunately, Microsoft still has the block on the email clients that they own (Outlook, Windows Live Mail etc.) We are still coordinating with them to further fix the problem. For

<span>The problem is not fixed. Why is Iprimus bouncing back emails sent via Outlook to Hotmail addresses. I sent two test emails to Hotmail recipients since your last email. Both bounced
 back. I then went into my iprimus webmail and was able to send an email to the two Hotmail addresses. This would seem to imply that Outlook is the problem and not Iprimus. However when you look at the two Delivery Status Notification emails (attached), you
 will see that they both come from “Mail Delivery System 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***” . Well after a little research I found that this email address is actually Iprimus. So therefore it is Iprimus which is bouncing these emails. The information below is from IP Address.com: We found that the organization hosting
 M2core.com.au is Primus Telecommunications in Australia. A more detailed IP address report for M2core.com.au is below. At the time you pulled this report, the IP of M2core.com.au is 202.154.123.80 and is located in the time zone of Australia/Queensland. The

            Hi MattBolger
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Since Skype account is attached to your Microsoft account, then Microsoft account will also get closed if you close your Skype account which means all your Microsoft services will be impacted..
<br />
<br />If you can login to that Skype Id, then you can switch off its Discoverability so that people can't search for you (but already added people will be able to use)
<br />Login to Skype account @ <a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com</a>
<br />Edit profile &gt; Edit profile
<br />Scroll down and uncheck the options as given in the picture
<br />
<br />However process to close Skype account is below (if you need)

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/334216f7-7a75-4ba8-b657-75ddb2d6e14a?upload=true" />

<p>Thanks for the response, but how is it possible that I can create two skype names on one profile but not delete the unwanted one? Seems like a glitch to me.</p>
<p>

            The fault lies with people getting moved from Skype account to Microsoft account. In this process, many got two Skype IDs - One was old one and one was created automatically by Microsoft account. Both IDs now reside on the same account or same mail ID. 
<br />Yes, I do agree that it is not a smooth movement. 
<br />
<br />Did you make Discoverability Off - This would stop people from seeing you when they search you. But existing people who you have already talked to, they can message / call you.

<p>Hi Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of those steps prior to posting the question with no result. I kept getting the error screen, so I wasn't even able to login to run the update. I also did the support and recovery assistant multiple times with complete uninstall and reinstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I had my IT Consultant dig in and he found a fix. It seems like the issue is on the SSL end from my provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply and suggestions!</p>
