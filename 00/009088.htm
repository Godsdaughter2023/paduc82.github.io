<p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the error code, it seems that your OneDrive, Group, or Document Library contains more than 5,000 items. Consider deleting some files you may no longer need and then try again. You can refer to 10008 of the following article:</p>

            hmm.<br />
<br />
try flashing the os first and then vanilla.<br />
<br />
<br />
see my #6 post in the top 12.<br />
<br />
try that and then post back.<br />
<br />
if you are flashing the vanilla, it shojld really be second, after the os flash and then you should end your command with -R to have it self reboot on the vanilla flash.<br />

            the emmc may actually be damamged from the drop!<br />
<br />
it is entirely possible as i have heard of others, dropiing the device and having a problem with the emmc.<br />
<br />
i would send it in to nokia for repair...omit the drop part..<br />
<br />
nokia does such a good job at the manufacturing of thier devices and drop tests...etc. that even droping the device from your pocket should not affect it that way and IMO if that happened the chip proly wasnt soldered correctly.<br />

<p>I, too,&nbsp;have been unable to get Outlook to work since I've downloaded Office 365. I think it has something to do with a conflict between Hotmail/outlook and/or a previous version of outlook existing somewhere on my hard drive...not sure. But I do have a
 screen capture of the Code [30088-8]:</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Help!! As I try to fix the problem (not successful as of this point--6/24/14 at 1:51 p.m.), I'm finding the whole Office 365 Suite not working either...but I'm not finished troubleshooting yet...</p>

<p><span>Hey there everyone. I have been fixing several machines over the last few days and talking to other IT department heads at a few companies and this is what I can tell you for sure. It may or may not be true for you, but it seems to be the
 most successful method right now and since MS is doing nothing but putting us off until some future date for a fix I am sharing this. You can try it or not. I cannot guarantee it will work for you, but it has worked for almost every case I have worked on and
 for those my associates have worked on also.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have the symptoms of this June update problem, then you have got to get Office uninstalled. Try the usual route through Control Panel. If it gives you any problem, reboot and try again. If you still cannot make head way then try this
 Fix from Microsoft to clean Office from the computer. It will leave your personal files untouched. Here is a link to the Microsoft Fix I am using. I posted the one I downloaded from them and am giving you a link to it that way i know you are getting the same
 one that is working for us. Here it is: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xmu090n724ca1lb/O15CTRRemove.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.dropbox.com/s/xmu090n724ca1lb/O15CTRRemove.diagcab</a> . Running this should get Office off the computer. If you want to do the extra work, go through your drive and delete your office folders to get rid of any leftover files (but do not delete
 the folder where you store the files you work on). Hopefully this gets rid of Office and you can reboot now.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have rebooted, reinstall Office however you can. By this I mean going to where you purchased it online and clicking on the original download file, or using an emergency disc to start the install, or using a saved version of the setup
 file on your own drive. Or if you got tech-savvy and used the Office Deployment Tool to download the Click To Run's complete installation files to your local computer, then use the Deployment Kit to run a local install. My point is, get Office installed somehow.
 It should be just a matter of installing like you did originally. If at any point during the install it gets stuck at a certain percentage of the install for a long time (like after 20 minutes or so it still says 74% or 94% or 79%, etc), the use this tool
 to get it to finish: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1rllw25046glqa3/OfficeFix.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.dropbox.com/s/1rllw25046glqa3/OfficeFix.exe</a> . Button number 2 is the one that gets it to finish.</span></p>
<p><span>After you do the reinstall, go into one of the Office programs (it does not matter which one) and click on File&gt;Account and over on the right side click and hold the Update button. You will see that the top choice is to Disable Updates. Click
 on that and you will Disable only the Office updates. Windows updates will continue just fine, but the Office ones that are usually mixed in with them will cease. Do not turn it back on until they say that they are releasing the fix or the update that will
 fix this issue. As long as your Office does not update you should not have to worry about it crashing again.</span></p>
<p><span>As I said, this is what is working for almost everybody I know. It is what Microsoft Tech support told me you have to do. So if it does not work for you, I can only say that you are left with restoring a Backup of the drive from before Office
 crashed and once you are up again, still turn off the Office updates. Or the most extreme action is to reinstall Windows completely and reinstall Office then turn off Office updates. This is a last resort, but the only guaranteed way to know it will fix it.</span></p>
<p><span>But remember, the only way to keep it from happening again until they fix it is to turn off Office updates. Well there it is. Use it if you want to or not. I hope you are not one of the unlucky ones that keeps saying that nothing will work
 for them. I wish you guys the best of luck. </span></p>

<strong>Uninstall updates in Office 2013 'Click to Run'</strong>

</p>
<p>Last reviewed on December 8, 2013</p>
<p>A spate of recent updates caused problems in Outlook 2013, and the short-term fix is to uninstall the update; however, updates can’t be uninstalled from the Click-To-Run installations of Office 2013, and almost all users have the Click-To-Run installation.</p>
<p>Instead, you will need to revert to an earlier version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you need to disable Office 2013 updates. If you don’t disable updates, the problem update will reinstall itself. You can disable updates from the File menu in any Office 2013 application.</p>
<p>In Outlook 2013 (this is an Outlook help site after all), go to <strong><span>File</span></strong>,
<strong><span>Office Account</span></strong>, <strong><span>Update Options</span></strong> and click on<strong><span>Disable Updates</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Next, create an appointment in your calendar for 30 days from now to remind yourself to check for updates. In many cases, the “bad” file will be removed or replaced with a corrected update, and you can allow Office to install updates without reinstalling
 “trouble” after a few weeks have passed.</p>
<p>Now you’re ready to roll back the click-to-run installation.</p>
<p>Type <strong><span>cmd</span></strong> on the Start screen in Windows 8 or in the Start menu’s Search field if using Windows 7, then right click on it and choose Run as Administrator.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Change the directory to the path of <strong><span>integratedOffice.exe</span></strong>. To do this, in the command prompt window, type (or copy and right-click paste) the following if you are running
<strong><span>64-bit</span></strong> Office:<br />
<span><span>cd %programfiles%\Microsoft Office 15\ClientX64\</span></span></p>
<p>or this if using the <strong><span>32-bit</span></strong> version of Office:<br />
<span><span>cd %programfiles%\Microsoft Office 15\ClientX86\</span></span></p>
<p>You’ll use the Online Repair tool to revert to the previous version of Office. Do this by running
<strong><span>integratedoffice</span></strong> using a command line in this format, where 15.0.xxxx.xxxx is the previous version.<br />
<span><span>integratedoffice.exe REPAIRUI RERUNMODE version 15.0.xxxx.xxxx</span></span></p>
<p>The command line you'll use will look something like this:</p>
<p>integratedoffice.exe REPAIRUI RERUNMODE version 15.0.4517.1005</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get the version numbers from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/office-2013-click-to-run" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Microsoft Office 2013 Click-to-Run virtualization</span></a></p>
<p>Choose <strong><span>Online Repair</span></strong>. Once repair is complete you can check your version to verify it updated properly. Note: you'll probably be asked to log in again and verify your license.</p>

    <title>Newest Build Keeps Crashing At Start Up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Newest Build Keeps Crashing At Start Up</h2>
                    I am stuck. The newest Windows 10 Insider Preview build crashes when my computer starts. A few times it actually let me log in before it crashed, but never long enough to even make it to the recovery page. I have a Dell computer, and with Dells you can
 get to recovery mode by turning off the computer, unplugging it and holding down the power button for 15 seconds. I did that, tried to go back to a previous build, but it failed. Then I tried to reset the computer, thinking that perhaps it was some 3rd party
 app the might be causing a conflict with the new build, but that failed as well. As of right now, I can't even log back on long enough to tell you exactly what build I have. I'm looking at only two options at this point; buy a copy of Windows 10 and hope and
 pray it works, or scrap the computer. I've searched around the Insider webpages trying to find some place where I might be able to download an older build and burn it to a DVD so I can do a clean install of it, but can't seem to f

            <p>You don't have to go to the bios settings first , you just need to do a cold start (this is actually what you do when you exit bios setting).</p>
<p>Your problem relates to restart from sleep/standby and warm start, so you need to check your power configuration first.</p>
<p>Run <strong>powercfg /a </strong>command&nbsp;from the command prompt, if Fast Startup is enabled turn it off by issuing a
<strong>powercfg /h </strong>command and try a restart from Start menu/Power/Restart.</p>
<p>Next try to enter sleep/standby and wake from sleep.</p>
<p>If your system still crashes&nbsp;when returning from sleep, inspect your systems drivers states, make sure you are running the latest available from your systems maker, pay special attention to BIOS and ACPI and Display drivers.</p>

    <title>Need to purchase Outlook for full version&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need to purchase Outlook for full version&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought a new laptop, it has windows 8 on it.&nbsp; I used to use Outlook Express and wanted to keep same email address.&nbsp; I needed to change my address from a "pop" account to another type, which the tech guy walked me through.&nbsp; There is a mail app
 on the start screen, which takes me to Outlook, but it seem so very basic.&nbsp; I'm certain it's not correct.&nbsp; Often times it won't show any new messages, just says "syncing" in the UR corner.&nbsp; I'm not connected to any other devices.&nbsp; There is nowhere on there
 where I can add a contact or even have a contact list.&nbsp; It just doesn't seem right.&nbsp; I bought and downloaded Microsoft Office student edition, but do I also need to buy Outlook?&nbsp; This was not mentioned to me when buying the computer or when talking to the
 tech guy.&nbsp; I didn't have to buy outlook express before on my old one, so guess I figured it just came with Windows.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;

Windows 8 does not include any version of Outlook. It does have 3 applets that can be used together to recreate the functionality of Outlook, more or less.<br />
<br />
Home and student does not include Outlook.&nbsp; You should NOT buy a standalone copy of Outlook. Instead, if you need Outlook you should use the "Anytime Upgrade" process.
<br />
<br />
<b>I have Office Home and Student. I Need Outlook. Now What? – Anytime Upgrade</b>
<p>You will have to buy Office 2010 Home and Business to get Outlook.</p>
<p>If you start with Office Home and Student and realize that you need Outlook, you have 3 options:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Buy standalone Outlook to add to Home and student</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Buy Home and Business full bundle</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Use Office Anytime Upgrade offer</p>
<p>Pros and Cons:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The standalone Outlook does not integrate with Word in Home and Student, and it is the most expensive combination.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Buying Home and Business is better price wise, especially since you can resell the Home and Student to someone else.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Apparently MS provides a discounted price to using Anytime Upgrade to a full Home and Student bundle</p>
<p>Here is the new and improved solution (much better than our previous advice) to your problem, direct from MS Customer Service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Anytime Upgrade offers you a discounted upgrade between Office 2010 bundles.
</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I contacted Microsoft directly and was able to get an upgrade to Home and Business for $79.95.&nbsp; I was told that there is no way to buy it from the Microsoft store website but that you can get it through the Office website.&nbsp; (The rep said
 that the easiest way was to contact Microsoft.)&nbsp; Microsoft will e-mail you an authorization code so you can upgrade.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Dear Charlie,</p>
<p>Warm greetings from Microsoft Customer Service Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Based on our recent phone conversation, here's the step by step instruction of upgrading the Office Home and Business 2010 to Office Professional 2010.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the start button</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click all programs</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the Microsoft Office folder</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the Microsoft Office 2010 tools folder</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on office anytime upgrade</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You'd be routed to a new window so click the "buy Microsoft Professional 2010 link</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You'd be routed to another window, just click on the "upgrade now" link for $220.
</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Just follow the prompts and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>I hope I was able to address your inquiry to your satisfaction, should you have further questions, relating to this inquiry, please don't hesitate to contact us back.</p>

<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>Here is another similar story:</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I went to Office Anytime Upgrade under Start Menu </p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Made payment for Office Home &amp; Student &gt;&gt; Home &amp; Business upgrade ($120)</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>After payment, a box with an "Install" button came up. I wasn't given the opportunity to save the download. I was given a new Product key.</p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I clicked Install &amp; it installed (or upgraded?) to Office 2010 Home &amp; Business</p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I ran Excel &amp; Word, and the "non-commercial use" was no longer there</p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>However, under my Control Panel / Uninstall Programs, there is only 1 office installation - Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2010; there isn't any Home &amp; Business.</p>
<p><span>My main intention in upgrading was to get rid of the "non-commercial use", so it turned out ok. But is there anything wrong that I did? Why does Control Panel show Home &amp; Student? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>Here is the “old” advice as an alternative.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Consider it based on the upgrade price they present you.</p>
<p>You have to buy a product key that is valid for Outlook. </p>
<p>The simplest apparent solution is to buy Outlook standalone for roughly USD$140. However, I have been told that this may not be the best overall approach for a couple of reasons. The obvious reason is that you'll have to manage 2 separate
 Office installations: separate install files/CD's and separate product keys. The other reason I've been told about is that when you install a standalone Outlook it does NOT fully integrate with the existing H&amp;S. Apparently spell checking dictionaries are maintained
 separately and a few other things.</p>
<p>If you do the math, retail H&amp;S has list price USD$150. Standalone Outlook has list price USD$140. Home and Business is USD$280. So, if you have the option, buying H&amp;B makes best sense all around.</p>
<p>If you bought the Retail/"FPP" license for H&amp;S, you have the option of uninstalling it and reselling it to someone else. If you have an OEM or Product Key Card license transferring the license to someone else is NOT an option.</p>
<p>PS: prices assume Retail/"FPP" license (my only recommendation). The product key card name "equivalents" are slightly cheaper on the surface. But if you understand the implication of license terms, you instantly realize that for most
 people the PKC is effectively a s*c*a*m IMO (because most people are not aware of the downsides of the the PKC when they buy it)</p>

<h2>            Sleep Information Comparisons</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone point me to information that relates directly to the parameters Microsoft Band provides on sleep?&nbsp; If not, how do I ask Microsoft to disseminate statistical information from other uses in its database?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know enough about calories, distances&nbsp;and pulse rates to intelligently use the other&nbsp;information my Band gives me about those things.&nbsp; But the sleep information I'm getting looks&nbsp;interesting if I only&nbsp;knew what it meant.&nbsp; Obviously, I understand what the
 labels and parameters language.&nbsp; But this is not meaningful since I don't know how many times most people my age wake up at night, what efficiency percentage is normal, etc.</p>

            <p>Thanks Fatou8.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that link doesn't provide much beyond what I know.&nbsp; The Band is pretty clear on what the various parameters represent.&nbsp; But this is meaningless since I have no basis for comparison.&nbsp; This is not a problem for me in other tiles
 since I already have a good understanding of how pulse rates, calories burned, etc. distribute across the population.&nbsp; But I don't have any of that basis for evaluating the information provided on sleep by the Band.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a problem understanding the 'sleep restoration' info. I've attached a typical graph from Health below. The graph is reasonably typical yet show sleep restoration as 'low'. I have NEVER had a sleep session recorded as anything other than low. I
 have compared this chart with one from my daughter, in which my sleep time, restful sleep, wakeups and efficiency are all better than hers yet her restoration is assessed 'good' and, as I've said, mine always says 'low'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I do experience tiredness during the day, the chart indicates a possible are to investigate. The problem is, it doesn't really indicate to me which aspect of the algorithm is causing the concern. I'm 58 years old and, on that day, I ran my usual 3km and
 had a total step count over 10,000. My VO2 Max is 34 'very high' and the dashboard tells me that 'people like me' have a worse sleep efficiency, total sleep time and number of wakeups than me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be really helpful to me if anyone with a better understanding of the algorithm used could point me in the direction of the areas of concern here. Given my general tiredness, I believe the band/health app has pointed out a very useful area for investigation
 but, as I said, I can't really see what the issue is in detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation</p>

            I don't know the answer but I'm also interested to find out. One thing I'll share is that I never get more than an hour of "restful" sleep yet often get "good" sleep restoration. When I look at your pattern you seem to sleep like a teenager and without
 any wake up times. How is that not good restoration? Counterintuitive.

            <p>Two standouts from your graph, compared with mine, and I usually get Good or Moderate ratings.</p>
<p>Your resting heart rate is quite high. Mine's usually reported as 44-47, sometimes as high as 51-52.</p>
<p>My restful sleep varies from 1-3.5 hrs, but each period of restful sleep is limited to 30 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes me wonder whather you're on sleep medication, which can cause tiredness the following day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm no doctor, and it should probably be a doctor whose advising you on your concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Googling restful sleep and sleep cycles might also help with advice.</p>

            I think you're onto it.&nbsp; My chiropractor just put me on a hawthorne herb supplement, and my resting heart rate overnight dropped dramatically.&nbsp; My sleep restoration went from low to moderate for the first time - and I do feel as if I got better sleep.&nbsp;
 Hawthorne is used for various heart-related issues.

            <p>Thanks for the helpful reply. No medication here and great healthy (but 58 years old!). My resting r rate during sleep is usually 57-60, which i thought we about right for my age - guess i need to look at that a little closer

            <p>I'm also trying to understand the sleep restoration, as one of the reasons I purchased the Band was to try and see if there is a pattern to my poor sleeping.</p>
<p>I regularly wake up in the night and then struggle to get back to sleep - I've attached an image of a typically bad night. Microsoft claim my sleep restoration was "Good" despite waking up completely shattered in the morning!</p>

</p><p>If anyone can shed some light on how the sleep tracking is interpreted I'd be extremely grateful. As it stands, I'm inclined to disregard this bit of information as just plain wrong!</p>

    <title>Failure to Install Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruscik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failure to Install Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>No idea if someone had this issue as I do not know what is the issue so cannot search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So had to reinstall Windows 10 as my Metro GUI stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put the same install I already had on USB, it boots up, I can see windows logo and the little dots at bottom. After a bit of time when next screen is to show up my monitor goes black and that is it. It does not go in to sleep mode it just does not display
 anything. Recorded the ISO on DvD same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 installed no issues as on it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed any hardware that could conflict despite fact I changed nothing. I get no error message so no idea what is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently booting from Intel HD 4000 Graphics, Gen 3 i5 not overclocked, 8GB of ram not overclocked, 60GB OCZ-Vertex2 SSD and a BluRay drive. Motherboard is AsRock HP77Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start install under Windows 8 I get to the step where it is listing possible compatibility issues, there is nothing there. I click next it says please wait for 1h now and nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 8 &#34;Out of memory at line 1&#34; or &#34;Stack overflow at line 1&#34; problems following IE9 trial.</h2>
                    After installing IE9 Beta on my Windows 7 Ultimate 64 machine, I removed IE9 which brought back IE8. Now when clicking on links in various IE windows I'll get one of the two error messages indicated in the title. Any ideas?

    <title>Calendar overlays not showing up in Chrome - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stewbates  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar overlays not showing up in Chrome</h2>
                    
<p>I've created a calendar and overlays for that calendar. It looks fine when I open the app itself and it looks fine when editing it in the home page but as soon as I save my changes and go back to the home page, the calendar overlays
 disappear. Now, if I open the page in IE, it looks fine. So the question is, is there a setting in the Chrome browser that I can change to get the overlays to show up. I've already tried deleting cookies and browsing history.</p>
<p>Thank you for the help.</p>

<p>Hi StewBates,</p>
<p>To clarify the situation, I'd like to confirm the following:<br />
1. Are you editing the calendar or adding it to the home page as a web part?<br />
2. For "the calendar overlays disappear", could you share a screenshot of the symptom? To upload screenshots, you can click Use rich formatting in the forum and then click the icon of Insert/Edit Media.<br />
3. Check if the issue happens to the calendars on other site collections.</p>
<p>Please share updates when you have time.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Felix</p>

<p>1. i'm doing both. i added overlays to the calendar from other sp calendars and then tried to add the calendar as an app part to the home page.</p>
<p>2. here are the two screen shots. the first one shows how the overlays are displayed while editing the page. the second shows how they are no longer visible after changes are saved and the page is being viewed.</p>
<p>3. there are other sites in the collection that i deleted the calendar off the home page, saved, exited, then went back in and reapplied the calendar to the home page. the overlays show up just fine on those pages.</p>

<p>Hi Stew,</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing the updates.<br />
It seems that the added schedule in calendar cannot show up in Chrome but looks fine in IE. Could you check whether they can show normally in Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari? In this way, we can identify whether the issue is isolated to Chrome browser or not.
 If it works fine in all other browsers, I suggest you try the following method to see if there are any improvements.<br />
1. Check whether your Chrome is the latest version. If not, update it to the latest version to see the outcome.<br />
2. Since some functionality in SharePoint 2013 requires ActiveX controls, it will produce limitations on browsers which do not support ActiveX. You may check the ActiveX controls lists in
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc263526.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396#activex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Plan browser support in SharePoint 2013</a> to see if any got involved in it. And we recommend customers who want a more deeply validated browser interaction experience consider Internet Explorer first since we make every effort to validate that SharePoint
 functionality works correctly with released versions of Internet Explorer.<br />
3. Google has removed the NPAPI Plug-in support from Chrome and it caused many SharePoint integration features not working. You can check whether it is related to the problem from the details in
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/office_integration__sharepoint/archive/2015/04/24/unable-to-open-sharepoint-documents-in-rich-client-from-chrome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Unable to open SharePoint documents in local client (rich client) from Chrome due to NPAPI plug-in missing</a>.</p>
<p>If this is not the case or you have further concerns, post back when you have time and we are glad to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p><span>Hi again Mal,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As promised, here are the instructions to locate, backup and delete your&nbsp;Word Data registry key:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. &nbsp;Exit all Office programs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; Click on
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3. &nbsp;Type
<strong>regedit </strong><span>in the<strong> Search</strong> box</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp; Press</span><span>
<strong>Enter</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This will take you to the Registry Editor window and you will need to locate&nbsp;the Data folder for Word 2007</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; From&nbsp;the Registry Editor window click&nbsp;on each of these in turn to get to the correct Data file:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *** Please be sure to follow this path exactly as described ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may need to double click to open each folder in order to get at the next folder in the list:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HKEY_CURRENT_USER (this should be at the top of the list in the Registry Editor window)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.0</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Word</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you get as far as the
<strong>Data </strong><span>folder:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;
</span><span>C</span><span>lick on the
<strong>File</strong> menu</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp; Click on
<strong>Export</strong> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4. &nbsp;Name the file
<strong>Wddata.reg</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;
<strong>Save</strong> the file to your Desktop. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp; Click on the
<strong>Edit</strong> menu</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>7.&nbsp; Click on
<strong>Delete</strong> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>8.&nbsp; Click on
<strong>Yes</strong> at the prompt<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>9.&nbsp; Exit the
<strong>Registry Editor</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>10. Start Word (a new Data key will be built automatically).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem has gone away then it was due to a damaged Word Data registry key. Some of your settings may have been wiped out and
 you may need to reset them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let me know how you get on?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>All the best,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> dystopia14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 battery failure &#126; battery classed as an accessory &#126; unbelievable&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 950 which is still under warranty. Recently it started to switch off without warning and the battery would drain very quickly. For example I could charge it with the official Microsoft charger for three hours and then disconnect it when the
 battery indicator was showing it to be fully charged and then within an hour of light use it would warn me of the battery being critically low or just switch off without warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed all the latest updates and builds and even set the device in power saving mode, all to no avail. Next I swapped the battery with a colleague who uses the same phone and the problem was immediately solved and when he placed my battery in his phone,
 the same problems began to plague his phone so we can safely say the battery is faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft support and they arranged a courier to collect the phone and battery for repair, all good so far. The phone, along with a covering letter explaining about the battery is collected and then shipped from the UK where I reside, to Hungary
 in Central Europe. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ten days later the phone is returned with the service code NF, which means no fault found. On the battery is a little sticker which reads
<em><strong>"the acessory </strong></em>(their spelling) <strong><em>i</em></strong><em><strong>s defective, we recommend a new purchase"</strong></em></p>
<p>My Lumia 950 is less than twelve months old and under warranty<em>
</em>and the battery is part of the phone and not an accessory. Imagine buying a new car and then when you attempt to leave the garage and it doesn't start you are informed that the battery is an accessory. It's totally ludicrous and I am speechless at the
 inefficiency that allows a phone to be taken, shipped across a continent and then returned in the same condition as it was sent when the problem is identified and blatantly obvious.</p>
<p>I have been using Windows Phone for a number of years starting with the Lumia 800, then the 920 and 1020 and finally this 950. I have only ever had one warranty issue prior to this and that is when Nokia were producing the handsets.
 In that instance the phone was repaired within a week and without drama whereas this is turning into a complete fiasco.
</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a similar problem and if so what was the solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p>

            yeah im having this same issue after having the phone around one year.. I already purchased a new battery. of course the Microsoft store doesn't offer replacement batteries. so I had to resort going to ebay and buying one from china (so who nows how reliable
 that one will be). hopefully when my new battery comes in it will fix this problem because I have tried to do the windows device recovery tool and my phone wont stay powered on long enough to finish the whole process of resetting my phone. im extremely disappointed
 in this phone I also have been a long time windows mobile user. since the days of my tmobile dash so nearly ten years now. I have never been this disappointed in a windows mobile device.

            Thank you for the feedback. It's wrong to treat loyal customers with such blatant disregard and what's equally frustrating is the fact that it is impossible to speak to a representative in the UK who actually understands UK consumer law. Having non negotiable
 diktats from on high may seem fine and dandy to those laying down the law on such matters but it makes for an appalling customer service experience and it does nothing good for the long term reputation of the company involved.<br />

            I have been a fan of Nokia devices going back to their US introduction in 1998.&nbsp; They were consistently the best phones on the market.&nbsp; When Nokia began using Windows Mobile as their exclusive OS, I was ecstatic.&nbsp; The Lumia 920 was the best and toughest
 phone I ever owned.&nbsp; MICROSOFT HAS RUINED NOKIA.&nbsp; The 950 , and Windows 10 Mobile, is junk.&nbsp; This is the buggiest, least reliable, most crash-prone piece of tech I have ever owned.&nbsp; And now, my battery refuses to hold a charge.&nbsp; Spontaneously last week while
 downloading up dates, it began shutting off for no reason, getting stuck in a boot loop, etc.&nbsp; I was able to get it to finish updating while plugged in, but it shuts off as soon as I disconnect it from the charger.&nbsp; This is unacceptable.&nbsp; I was so excited
 for Windows mobile, but I cannot be expected to use hardware and software with such poor quality.&nbsp; And I am so indescribably angry with Microsoft for destroying a great brand like

            <p>The Lumia 920 was indeed a fantastic phone with an unbelieviably good camera, something that thankfully has made it to the 950.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are encountering the same problems I had and it is almost certain that it's your battery that has failed. If your device is more than six months old and the same rules apply in the U.S. as the U.K. you're in trouble as getting a replacement battery is
 a nightmare. I was lucky to find a nearly new one on Amazon in the U.K. and it solved the problem. However I still feel let down by Microsoft as there is no way I should have to buy a new battery for £30.00 on a device that is less than a year old.</p>

            <p>Yes, the replacement battery sorted my problem. I managed to find a nearly new genuine replacement (from a broken phone) on Amazon which was lucky otherwise it would have been a two week wait for the slow boat from China.</p>

            <p>I found a purportedly new OEM battery on Amazon, and it's coming from California, which is at least in the lower 48 - although on the other coast from where I live, still closer than China.&nbsp; I will let you folks know if it is any good and fixes the current
 problem when I receive it.&nbsp; Still, I am through with Microsoft after this phone.</p>

            Ladies and Gentlemen, having updated my 950 I started to find my phone would restart on its own. Thinking it was the updates I left it for 2days. I would then find my phone would get really hot and battery would be drained. My first reaction was to send
 it for repairs. Second reaction was to buy a portable battery pack as i found my phone would not work with out a mains cable attached. When speaking to the shop I was told off the record to replace the battery myself. So I have, I bought an original Microsoft
 battery for this phone from Amazon for £18 ( ordered in liverpool came from germany in 2days ) and the shop wanted to charge me £50. I think if Microsoft read these posts they would see that the batteries have been an issue. And should recall them.

            <p>This is crazy.&nbsp; Without a battery you have a brick.&nbsp; The warranty should cover the battery.&nbsp; I am having the same experience with my battery and it is not right for Microsoft not to replace the battery.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been my very worst consumer experience for anything I have ever purchased .&nbsp;You can't speak to anyone, you get pushed to B2X and then I am pushed to a 3rd party service provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we escalate this to someone senior at Microsoft? They clearly have a defective battery issue with the 950 and are refusing to address it and even worse will not replace the defective batteries under warranty and are really to sacrifice customer satisfaction
 in the process.</p>

                    I'm trying to use SUM to add up times in a column that have been formatted (I think) with the Time 37.30.55 number format. When I click the SUM button, I see this formula appear =SUBTOTAL(9,) and this screen tip SUBTOTAL (function_num, ref1, [ref2], .

            OK--for anyone brave enough to be following this, here is my bottom line and it is working successfully in my spreadsheet. Thank you again to Joe!

<div>
To SUM the Time Spent Column in Excel:
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With the exported Student Portfolio Excel file open, select the <b>Time Spent</b> column (click column letter at the top of the column to select the column in one click).</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the <b>Data</b> tab, <b>Data</b> <b>Tools</b> group, click <b>Text To Columns</b>.</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the <b>Convert Text to Columns Wizard</b> <b>– Step 1 of 3</b> dialog box, select
<b>Delimited</b>; click <b>Next</b>.</p>
<p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the <b>Step 2 of 3</b> dialog box, under <b>Delimiters</b>, check <b>Tab</b>; click
<b>Finish</b>.</p>
<p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With the column still selected, right-click; click <b>Format</b> <b>Cells</b>; from the
<b>Number</b> tab under <b>Category</b>, click <b>Custom</b>, under <b>Type</b>, scroll down almost to the end and click
<b>[h]:mm:ss</b>; click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click in the cell at the bottom of the last entry in the <b>Time Spent</b> column.</p>
<p>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the <b>Home</b> tab, <b>Editing</b> group, click the <b>AutoSum</b> button.</p>
<p>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Note that the column to be summed is surrounded by wavy lines and a formula displays; for example,
<i>=SUM(N259:N566). </i>If necessary, drag the borders to include the entire range of cells to be summed.</p>
<p>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press <b>Enter</b> to accept the formula, and note the display of the sum of that column; for example,
<i>17:35:34</i>, meaning <i>17 hours</i>, <i>35 minutes</i>, and <i>34 seconds</i>.
</p>
<p>10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Review the column; if you see any cells in which the time is left aligned, those times include "days" spent as well as hours, minutes and seconds and have been excluded from the SUM<span>
</span>; for example,&nbsp;<i>2.06:48:16</i>, which represents&nbsp;<i>2 days</i>,&nbsp;<i>6 hours</i>,&nbsp;<i>48 minutes</i>, and&nbsp;<i>16 seconds</i>.</p>
<span>To convert cells with "days" to include them in the SUM:</span>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Review the <b>Time Spent </b>column to identify any cells in which entries are left aligned, such as
<i>2.06:48:16</i>, which represents <i>2 days</i>, <i>6 hours</i>, <i>48 minutes</i>, and
<i>16 seconds</i>. Those cells that include "days" must be converted in order to have their values included in the SUM. Follow the next few steps to convert those cells.</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the formula below this step, change eight instances of “F” to the letter of the Time Spent column that contains the data to be converted, and then select and copy the edited formula:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IF(ISNUMBER(F2), F2, IF(ISNUMBER(FIND(".",F2)),LEFT(F2,FIND(".",F2)-1)+MID(F2,FIND(".",F2)+1,99), --F2))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click in any blank column on the worksheet in the first cell of Row 2 (for example, Cell H2 assuming Column H is blank and assuming Row 1 holds column headings and not data for calculation); click in the Formula box (the box next to
<b><i>fx</i></b><i> </i>at the top of the spreadsheeet), and press <b>Ctrl+V</b> to paste.</p>
<p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After you paste the formula in the second cell of the blank column, copy down for as many rows as appear in the column with the entries to be changed. (To copy down, point to the black square in the lower right-hand corner of the cell in which you pasted
 the formula until your pointer looks like a black plus sign, and drag down from that corner.)
</p>
<p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With the copied-down cells still selected, right-click, and click&nbsp;<b>Copy</b>.</p>
<p>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click in the first cell of Row 2 of the <b>Time Spent</b> column.</p>
<p>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right-click and from the sortcut menu under&nbsp;<b>Paste Options</b>, click the icon representing&nbsp;<b>Values (V)-</b>-the clipboard icon with&nbsp;<b>123</b>&nbsp;on it.
</p>
<p>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the <b>Time Spent</b> column, click in the cell holding the SUM formula.</p>
<p>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the <b>Home</b> tab, <b>Editing</b> group, click the <b>AutoSum</b> button; that cell should now SUM all entries in the Time Spent column.</p>

            Office 2007 was the last version to include Microsoft Document Imaging. This is not installed by default, but you can re-run Office setup from the Windows Control Panel Add or Remove programs applet and add it. This will give you rudimentary OCR capabilities
 (thought the text translation is pretty accurate). If you want anything more sophisticated you will need third party software such as Finereader.<br />

            The tool you are looking for is called MODI, Microsoft Office Document Imaging. It is part of Office 2007. If you don't see it as you were told you can run the installer again to selectively install it.<br />

            Thank you for the advice. I found the reply at&nbsp; http://www.gmayor.com/scan_into_word_2007.htm&nbsp; solved the primary problem. The scan programme is rather rudimentary so having made it work, I still purchased a more effective programme called ABBYY fineReader
 11. This programme offers 50 pages free trial on limited function. The full programme is very good.<br />

            FYI: just in case you have a problem in the near future.<br />
<br />
If Word or Excel "just stop working" one of the first things to try is disable the Abbyy Addon.&nbsp; Many (NOT ALL) people have reported stopping using Abbyy has allowed Word and Excel to run.

    <title>How to stop Outlook displaying a deleted calendar by default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenheise  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop Outlook displaying a deleted calendar by default</h2>
                    <p>Outlook has messed up my calendars. Has anyone got any ideas on how to fix it? I'm using Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus running on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Background</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a separate, personal calendar for my team to use and shared it with them. All was well and there was much rejoicing. Some time later, I moved off the team. Turns out no one was using the calender, so I deleted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">The Problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, whenever I switch to the calendar view in Outlook, it shows the deleted team calendar and not my personal calendar. Outlook is quite confused about which calendar it is displaying:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa7d5d2b-be8f-4355-ac4c-ae651ac62164?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa7d5d2b-be8f-4355-ac4c-ae651ac62164?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I untick my personal calendar (the first one displayed above), and tick it again, I get both my personal calendar and the deleted team calendar displayed side-by-side. Now I can close the deleted team calendar and everything looks like it should. Problem
 is, I have to do this <em>every single time</em> I switch from the email view to the calendar view - dozens of times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the&nbsp;deleted team calendar is displayed and I click Calendar Permissions on the ribbon thing, I get this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78c2e9a2-8e85-4520-afe2-9741bca87c3f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78c2e9a2-8e85-4520-afe2-9741bca87c3f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is definitely in my Deleted Items (not that I can figure out how to access that). If I look at the folder size:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f17200c7-7263-4965-b312-865c1593be32?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f17200c7-7263-4965-b312-865c1593be32?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8851252c-9dcb-4acf-bd42-0c867ce3f178?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8851252c-9dcb-4acf-bd42-0c867ce3f178?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It clearly doesn't exist in my local data, but does exist on the server. I tried sharing it I got this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8daac1cd-135c-4b88-a423-2cfd035c9a76?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8daac1cd-135c-4b88-a423-2cfd035c9a76?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So why are you still trying to show it me!?!?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at my calendar with the Office365 online version of Outlook, everything works fine. There is no trace of the deleted team calendar. This problem only occurs on the Windows 10 desktop version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Stuff I've Tried</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Multiple reboots.</li><li>Logging out of Outlook and logging back in.</li><li>Close Outlook, deleted my .nst &amp; .ost files.</li><li>Close Outlook, deleted <em>everything</em> in&nbsp;%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Outlook.</li><li>More reboots.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I can try and fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. The team calendar was created under my Office 365 account and shared with the rest of the team. After I deleted it, it no longer appeared under the 'My Calendars' section on the left side. There was no trace of the calendar on the
 Outlook Web App. As far as I know, my account isn't in hold - I can do everything else (create appointments, add contacts etc) as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying a few more things, I have managed to fix the problem. I deleted my profile and created a new one. After Outlook synced up everything, the team calendar was completely gone and now when I switch to the calendar view, I get my personal calendar
 - great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps for anyone else that comes across this problem:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From ribbon, File &gt; Info &gt; Account Settings &gt; Change Profile. Outlook will close.</li><li>Restart Outlook.</li><li>"Choose Profile" dialog. Create a new profile.</li><li>Outlook will ask for an email address to add to your account. In my case, it already had my email address and I just clicked 'Connect' and it figured everything out.</li><li>Back to the&nbsp;"Choose Profile" dialog. Make sure you select the new profile and set it as the default. Click OK.</li><li>Outlook will start up and resync everything. In my case I took about 5 - 10 mins.</li></ol>
<p>If you are happy with the new profile and want to delete the old one (probably frees up some disk space):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From ribbon, File &gt; Info &gt; Account Settings &gt; Manage Profiles.</li><li>"Mail Setup" dialog. Click Show Profiles...</li><li>"Mail" dialog. Select the old profile and remove it.</li><li>Make sure the "Always use this profile" is set with your new profile so you don't have to select it every time Outlook starts.</li></ol>

<p>Hi BarbaraGrace,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you getting any erorr message when attempting to change your profile photo from the application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, when you click your profile photo, you should be seeing your <strong>
Settings </strong>menu. From there, click your photo again and you'll get the option to update your status. To change your photo, on the same box, you have to click your photo
<strong>once again </strong>to have an option to upload/change it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if that works.</p>

<div>Hi SueOll,</div>
<div><br />
<div>We'd like to know if you already tried using other Wi-Fi connections to ensure that the problem is not isolated to a specific Wi-Fi?</div>
<div><br />
<div>In addition to that, you may also try using a different mobile device (if available) as the Wi-Fi capability of your current device might be faulty.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</div>

<p>Hi SueOll,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to follow up with this concern. Since you've already tried connecting to a different Wi-Fi connection and using another device and the issue persists, I would suggest that you uninstall your Outlook application in your Android phone and reinstall
 it afterwards. Once reinstalled, try to connect again via Wi-Fi connection and check if the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the result.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Jomel.</p>
<p>I actually uninstalled and re-installed the outlook app when the problem first started. It different make any difference.</p>
<p>Am getting desperate. It's so frustrating.</p>
<p>Any other thoughts would be appreciated.</p>

            <ul>
<li>Open Outlook's Preferences under Outlook in the Menu bar.</li><li>Select Sync Services </li><li>Check Contacts</li></ul>
Tip: I suggest you first export your contacts in Apple Address Book as a backup in case there are problems. Sync has been known to delete or duplicate items. I suggest weekly backup of any data like contacts and events that are synced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Under File &gt; Export select just the item (contact) to export as .olm file.<br />
Repeat for events.<br />
<br />
<br />
Choose File &gt; Export &gt; Address Book Archive.<br />
Choose a name for the file, and select where you want to export the file.<br />
<br />
To further safeguard your archives, copy the file to an external hard drive or CD.<br />

            See my blog post about syncing Outlook with iPhone. It uses Apple's
    Address Book and iCal to verify things are syncing correctly. You
    can just ignore the iPhone information.<br />

<h2>            Cannot add more than four Outlook.com &#47; Hotmail accounts to iOS Outlook app</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of Outlook.com / Hotmail accounts.&nbsp; These accounts are not aliases; each is unique and has its own log-in password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">iOS Outlook app</span> and have run into an issue.&nbsp; I currently have 4 Outlook.com / Hotmail accounts added to the app; when I try to set up any existing additional Outlook.com / Hotmail accounts, I receive
 a message indicating that the "Account Already Exists", but it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the latest version of the iOS Outlook app.&nbsp; The Support link embedded in the app has not been able to resolve or answer my issue / question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that the iOS Outlook app can manage up to 15 email accounts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Is there a limit to how many of these 15 accounts can be Outlook.com / Hotmail accounts?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>* If not, what can I do to resolve this error?</p>

            is the account a unique account or an alias on an account already added? 
<br />In the interest of science, i added 5 outlook.com consumer accounts to my 5 office 365 business accounts already in the outlook app and it worked... i got the error message you received when i forgot which accounts i already added.

<p>These are not alias accounts.&nbsp; They are each unique separate accounts and have their own log-ins on Outlook.com.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have triple checked the existing accounts in the app to make sure that the accounts I'm trying to add are not already there.&nbsp; Although it shouldn't matter, many of the accounts do have the same initial characters along with a unique ending (ex. XxxXxx111,

<br />No, it shouldn't matter, but i have some of that type too - will try adding more accounts. 
<br />do your accounts all had outlook.com domain or are they split between Hotmail and outlook domain names?

            I'm up to 9 outlook.com - 5 using outlook.com , 1 each msn, live, Hotmail and one custom domain. live, Hotmail and 1 outlook.com use the same alias,  while 4 use *alias@outlook.com format rather than alias*@ as your format is.

            No, I was never able to add any of these other accounts to the app.&nbsp; Initially I had three accounts and was able to add the fourth; after that, I started getting the "duplicate" errors when trying to add the additional accounts.

<p>So, an update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't test my iPad Outlook app for the same issue because I had already deleted Outlook there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I deleted Outlook on my iPhone and then did a hard restart; I reinstalled Outlook...and my four original email accounts automatically populated the newly downloaded app asking for nothing more than my passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to add another Outlook.com account...and ran into the same "duplicate account" problem.&nbsp; I tried again...and it worked.&nbsp; I was then able to add ALL of my additional Outlook.com accounts successfully.&nbsp; Some took more than one try to get past
 the "duplicate" issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought all was well but then noticed that one of the individual accounts contained only a "drafts" folder - no Inbox, Sent, etc.&nbsp; All of the other newly added accounts seemed to be intact.&nbsp; I tried an in-app "reset account" for this particular account
 but that didn't resolve the issue.&nbsp; I deleted that account but now cannot add it again without encountering the "duplicate" error even after multiple attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook iOS app definitely has some issues.&nbsp; I may have to just move to Spark or another email app that doesn't seem to have this ongoing bug.&nbsp; I tried working with the Outlook app Support team but they couldn't seem to understand the problem I was encountering.</p>

<p>And yet one more update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled Outlook on the iPad.&nbsp; Same issue there - kept getting "duplicate email [accounts]" when trying to add additional Outlook.com accounts (NOT aliases).&nbsp; On one of the accounts that I was able to add on the iPad, I saw the same issue with that account
 only displaying a "Drafts" folder and no Inbox, Sent, etc again; this was the same issue seen on the iPhone for that same account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting and reinstalling didn't appear to resolve the issue.&nbsp; Also did another delete and reinstall on the iPhone to no avail.</p>

 mode for about two hours(not unusual) and during that time it went south.

<h3> nnicolee  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote iOS not allowing PDFs to be inserted as a printout</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am downloading PDFs on my iPad Pro.&nbsp; I select to Copy to OneNote, and they automatically go in as a "File Attachment."&nbsp; I am not given the option to select "Printout" like I have been able to in the past.&nbsp; I am able to insert the same files as a PDF Printouts
 on OneNote for MacOS on my laptop without any problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how I can get these PDF files to come into OneNote as a PDF Printout when I am not promted with the option to do so?&nbsp; In the past, I could select "File Attachment" or "Printout," but I am no longer given that option.&nbsp; It is much more convenient
 for me to take my iPad to class to take notes on the PDF Printouts than my laptop, so I am hoping to resolve this issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Nnicolee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To insert PDF files as printout in OneNote for iPad, your device should be running iOS 8 or later and you must be signed into OneNote and have at least one notebook open. Also, you must have a cloud-based storage app installed on your device such as OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If those requirements are already met and the issue persists, you may try to sign out your account and sign back in. If it still occurs, kindly uninstall the application and reinstall it afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; All of the listed requirements are met and the issue persists.&nbsp; I have signed out and deleted the app.&nbsp; Since I had no luck on my iPad Pro (software and app up to date), I tried to place the printouts in OneNote from the iPhone
 app on an iPhone X (software and app up to date), and the same issue is occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always used my iPad Pro to insert printouts into OneNote, and this was never a problem in the past.&nbsp; I have tried multiple cloud-based storage apps including OneDrive and the Apple file system through iCloud.&nbsp; In the past, I inserted PDFs as printouts
 by downloading them directly from the internet and opening them with OneNote on the iPad, but that is not working either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files themselves seem fine as I can insert them into OneNote from my MacBook Pro (software up to date).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, if I download the PDF to my MacBook Pro and AirDrop it to the iPad, I AM given the option to open with OneNote and insert a printout normally, but this has been the only way I have been able to see the open with printout option.</p>

            I also have an ipad pro and have had a lot of complications importing pdf to my Onenote. I have found that you must use Safari. If I use my prefered broser of chrome I have a ton of problems. I hope this helps as Onenote is an epic tool even in its depleted
 state in IOS. It’s still the best option. Good luck.

            The only work-around I’ve found is to tap said File Attachment in OneNote, whence you will be prompted to open it in the respective app. Once opened in Adobe, Word, PowerPoint, etc., select “Send a Copy” (for Microsoft) or “Share a Copy” (for Acrobat),
 then change the Format to PDF, then “Send with Another App”, and finally “Copy to OneNote”. You will then be prompted to insert the file as a printout. Hope this helps!

            Same issue.&nbsp; on my Ipad mini it works great lets me insert pdf's as printouts. &nbsp; On my Ipad pro it does not give me the option, unless I insert it as a file then I go into the page and hold down the file and a menu pops up that gives me an option to select
 input.&nbsp; A couple extra steps I do not wish to have to do.

            What worked for me. When you click the box with the arrow coming out of it in safari to printout the file, if you scroll through the places to download it there should be 2 icons for OneNote one just called "OneNote" and one called "copy to OneNote" if
 you use the "copy to OneNote" icon it should work like it used to.&nbsp;
