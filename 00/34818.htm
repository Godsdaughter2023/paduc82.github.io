<h2>            Lost Icons after update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>After this last update to windows 10 a few weeks back&nbsp;I now notice&nbsp;am now missing some icons on my desktop screen. One of the programs; Google Chrome is still loaded on my computer. I can not find a way to get the icon back on the desktop or a way to open
 the program. I need some suggestion as to what I might try as I have some documents and GMails that I need to access in that program. I also need a way to open the other programs that have lost icons.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. If I click on the Control Panel and go to Programs, Google Chrome is listed as an installed program.</p>
<p>2. It does not show up in the All Apps Listings and when entered in the search bar window I get a Google Chrome Window with a "Search My Stuff". When I click on that I get a message "Still Searching" and a running string of dots that never stop running.</p>
<p>3. I have no idea where to find this. The update was automatic when I turned on my computer about 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>There seems to be other missing icons from my desk top but I have not checked my program listings yet to see which ones.</p>
<p>Larry</p>

<p>Hi Jim, <br />
<br />
The "<strong><em>component 'comdlg32.ocx or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid</em></strong>" error is one of the runtime errors and will appear while the program is running.
<br />
<br />
The error "<strong><em>The module comctl32.ocx failed to load</em></strong>" is usually cause by un-registered COMCTL32.OCX component.
<br />
<br />
First, you need to verify if <strong>comctl32.ocx</strong> is in <strong>C:\Windows\System32 folder</strong>. If found, run again the
<strong>r</strong><strong>egsvr32 comctl32.ocx</strong> command. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Run Command Prompt as Administrator. <br />
<br />
Feel free to post back with the result for further assistance. </p>

            <p>Hey there ROOKIE NLD!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the headset issue! For clarification, do you have the Ear Force X12, or the Ear Force DX12?</p>
<p>I would check out the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/connect-compatible-headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One Headset Compatibility guide</a> to make sure your headset has the right cables.</p>
<p>Post back with which headset you have, that will help us out a lot!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not true. They are perfectly compatible and is listed but with Xbox One headset adaptor. What you have to do is Press chat balance in the xbox one adaptor until you hear a tone. You must regulate between TV sound and chat.
</p>
<p>It's not difficult and it's perfectly compatible.</p>

<h2>            Ran the MGA Diagnostic to see what my Windows 8.1 was and the key it shows is not my key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought my copy of Windows 8 direct from Microsoft following beta testing for £24.99p, and then applied for the Media Centre upgrade which I also installed.</p>
<p>I just ran the MGA Diagnostic just to see what happened, (I have the Windows 10 pre ordered OK), and the partial key it shows is not mine, and it says the validation status is unsupported OS</p>
<p>I went to the control panel and selected system, and entered my valid key I received from MS, but it says it&nbsp;is not for this OS?</p>
<p>I cannot copy the results of the diagnostic, it gives an error &nbsp;0x80070002</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been validated several times since I installed it OK, and updated to 8.1 with no problems.</p>
<p>The invoice is dated 10/27/2012, the media centre key notification is dated 10/29/2012</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have the original iso I downloaded at the time, but due to this problem I do not want to mess with it until I understand what has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been testing out the Windows 10 preview since the beginning, and have had several problems with drive corruption on my multi boot system and wonder if somehow this OS has been corrupted, though it seems to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice gratefully received.</p>

            <p>Hi, a bit more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded a new Windows 8.1 iso, and reinstalled, selecting keep data and programs, and it asked for my activation key, which it accepted. Following the install, it downloaded a lot of updates, by the end of which it activated OK. When I now run the MGA
 diagnostic, it gives my correct key, but the following odd results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Validation status&nbsp;&nbsp; unsupported OS</p>
<p>Product type 0&nbsp; -&nbsp; unknown</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it says it is Windows 8.1 pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still gives the error&nbsp; 0x80070002 if I select copy so I could paste it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little concerned as to what will happen if I upgrade to Windows 10, though the flag I had which gave me the status I had reserved Windows 10 has now gone as I might have expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have Windows 7 installed on another drive, and MGA shows this as retail Windows 7 Pro, which it is, though I did not plan to upgrade this right away as it is my main system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for that. I panicked a bit when it showed the wrong serial number and I was not able to key in the correct one. Seems strange it was still activated, but it must have been some strange corruption, as I did get some of the drives corrupted when
 installing the various iterations of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Reinstalling Windows 8.1 has fixed that, and now I know the report is normal with regards to the rest, is good news. I was concerned that when I upgraded to Windows 10, it may have had problems.</p>
<p>Tanks again.</p>

<h2>            Unidentified wireless network, can&#39;t connect to internet  &#43; 169 ip address</h2>
                    <p>Hi!<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also have this annoying problem. I saw lots of similar posts and tried every suggested solutions, but nothing worked.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>zte zxv10 w300 device and 2 computers ( a laptop and a normal pc)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no internet access on the computer which is not connected to the router with cable. It can connect to this unidentified network, but not to the internet.</p>
<p>It is the case with both computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, the computer which is first connected to the router with cable, will have this 169 ip address.</p>
<p>I could resolve this by disabling the wireless adapter, then turning off the router, then turning on the router and enabling the adapter, but then it changed back again. On one of the computers or both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what could be wrong?</p>
<p>

            <p>I managed to solve the problem, somehow. However I don't know how long it will last...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was definitely with the encryption as you suggested.</p>
<p>I realized that the unidentified network disappeared, when I modified the authentication type from VPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK to WPA2-PSK only and the encryption from TKIP/AES from TKIP only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it was good on 1 of the computers, but the other was still bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything suggested on this page:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://pocketpccentral.net/blog/2009/11/11/windows-7-unidentified-network-limited-access-no-internet-connection-problem-resolved/</p>
<p>
</p><p>and many other things and combinations of things to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest I got to the soultion was when I changed the automatically obtained&nbsp; TCP/IP 4 values to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Enter the following for the IP address: 192.168.1.210<br />
- Enter the following for the Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0<br />
- Enter the following for the Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1<br />
- Choose “Use the following DNS servers”<br />
- Enter the following for the Primary DNS server: 192.168.1.1<br />
- Enter the following for the Secondary DNS server: 4.2.2.3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the laptop recognized the network but could not connect to it. Or just with limited access and no internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I disabled the security measures of the wireless connection once again and I got an other connection which I could set as a home network, and I could connect to that with the laptop too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>http://kepfeltoltes.hu/view/140331/v_gs__www.kepfeltoltes.hu_.png </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I dared not merge the two networks, or restore the security. I am just glad it's all working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. : An interesting thing is that I can't see this ( or any other networks, since I deleted them) under the Manage wireless settings link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you for your help, I am very grateful for it.</p>

            <p>Your wireless adapter isn't connected to anything.&nbsp; The lines in <strong>bold</strong> show that the wireless adapter has an IP address generated by "Automatic Private IP Addressing" (APIPA).&nbsp; This is what happens when the adapter is configured to obtain
 an IP address automatically from a DHCP server (such as your router) but isn't able to obtain one, either because the router's DHCP server isn't working (not your case) or because there isn't a valid connection between the adapter and the router.</p>

On wireless connections, this is almost always a result of an incorrectly configured encryption password, although it can also happen if the router has been configured with a MAC filter (or other security measure) to prevent connection, or if a firewall on
 the computer is improperly configured.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>From the Network and Sharing Center, click the link to "Manage wireless networks" to get this screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89d88eea-dfcf-44f4-a81f-c4bb70f1d74d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can proceed in several different ways.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Delete all of the configured wireless networks except any that you know relate to networks OTHER than your own that you need to keep (for example, a wireless network at work).&nbsp; Now connect to your wireless network in the usual manner and carefully enter
 the encryption password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Modify the wireless network shown in the list to have the correct encryption password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Delete all of the configured wireless networks except any that you know relate to networks OTHER than your own that you need to keep (for example, a wireless network at work).&nbsp; Connect to your router with an Ethernet cable and log in to the router's
 configuration utility.&nbsp; Disable ALL security measures configured for the router:&nbsp; encryption, MAC filter, time of day restrictions, etc.&nbsp; Now connect to the wireless network in the usual manner.&nbsp; If this works, you can re-configure the security measures using
 the router's configuration utility one by one (although you really don't need to use anything other than WPA2 encryption and a strong password).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to wirelessly connect to the router when you have disabled all security measures on the router, check any third-party security software installed on your computer to see if it is blocking the wireless connection.</p>

                    <p>This will not update on windows. Just states initializing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is part of a larger problem where i cannot run games from steam because i get an error stating "the program or feature \??\C:\windows\syswow64\waitfor.exe cannot start or run due to incompatibility with 64-bit versions of windows. Please contact software
 provider and ask if a 64-bit version is available."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, while trying to troubleshoot that error message that arose every time "easy anti-cheat" tried to boot up during game launch i stumbled upon&nbsp; deleting and reinstalling Microsoft C++ files. As i tried to do that i kept getting another error stating that
 the file was already gone. Then asked if i wanted to remove it from the list. After countless uninstall reboots and install attempts i am out of options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so to sum up my issues i cannot play 16 bit somethings and i cannot try to troubleshoot this problem, and windows wont update properly.</p>

            If you are experiencing problems installing a new cumulative update for Windows 10 1809, here some things you can try.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />
<br />Right click CMD
<br />
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />
<br />Right click CMD
<br />
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />
<br />Net Start bits
<br />
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />

<br />Troubleshoot Windows Update Problems in Windows 10 Using These Five Tips
<br />

<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/23-troubleshoot-windows-update-problems-in-windows-10-using-these-five-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/23-troublesh...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, please installing the cumulative update manually by downloading it from the Microsoft Update Catalog. See instructions in the following article how to do that:
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manually-install-standalone-cumulative-updates-virus-definitions-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manually-insta...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, just block the update for the time being until a successive cumulative update is released. Sometimes cumulative updates can prove problematic when a new version is released.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />or

<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

</p><p>This is part of a larger problem where i cannot run games from steam because i get an error stating "the program or feature \??\C:\windows\syswow64\waitfor.exe cannot start or run due to incompatibility with 64-bit versions of windows. Please contact software
 provider and ask if a 64-bit version is available."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, while trying to troubleshoot that error message that arose every time "easy anti-cheat" tried to boot up during game launch i stumbled upon&nbsp; deleting and reinstalling Microsoft C++ files. As i tried to do that i kept getting another error stating that
 the file was already gone. Then asked if i wanted to remove it from the list. After countless uninstall reboots and install attempts i am out of options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so to sum up my issues i cannot play 16 bit somethings and i cannot try to troubleshoot this problem, and windows wont update properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP</p>

            Thank you for the help, i tried to install manually and it still stated there was an issue with the file. I'm not real sure how to fix all these issues i'm having. Is it advisable to uninstall windows 10 all together and go back to a previous version?

<p>
</p><p>In my case I was pleasantly surprised to find that HDMI started working again after 1803 but since the last update it stopped again and I have had to revert to a VGA connection.&nbsp; I actually use an HDMI-VGA converter plugged into a Surface HDMI adapter.&nbsp;
 HDMI Audio (which has never been reliable) had its own new quirks and was mostly unusable.&nbsp; Now, of course, with VGA I have disabled HDMI Audio on that port.&nbsp; I can't remember if I tried disabling HDMI Audio before giving up on HDMI Video.&nbsp; I may try hooking
 it up again to try to clarify my symptom description.</p>

            1. After connecting, can you do Windows Key+P and choose either Duplicate or Extend?
<br />
<br />2. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />3. Take actions related to Display Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you tried just refreshing the desktop (pressing F5).&nbsp; Given you've experienced this with a few applications I'm guessing however that that isn't your problem.<br />
<br />
Basically, the desktop is made up of the merging of 2 folders, a private desktop folder and a public desktop folder.<br />
<br />
Your private desktop folder is here - C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Desktop and the public desktop folder is here - C:\Users\Public\Desktop.&nbsp; If i'm not mistaken, the public desktop is a hidden folder so you'll seen to turn on the ability to show hidden files and folders
 in your view preferences (control panel).<br />
<br />
Basically, both of those folders get sort of merged together to show you your desktop.&nbsp; What I mean by this is that if you create a shortcut (or any file) in either one of them it should show on your desktop.&nbsp; Try doing that in both or at least looking for
 your shortcuts in both locations.<br />
<br />
Failing that, try searching for them.&nbsp; In the search box on your start menu, type the name of the software.&nbsp; When it finds it and displays the shortcut, right-click on it and choose properties.&nbsp; That will show you where your shortcut is located.&nbsp; When you find
 than, ping me back here and we'll try to find out why they're going where they are.<br />
<br />
Good Luck &amp; Enjoy Windows 7<br />
Jon<br />

<h2>            Disable Windows 8 photo viewer or block it</h2>
                    <p>I would like to block or remove the photo viewer of windows 8 that has replaced my Windows live photo gallery. This is outrages to force a program that sends the photos to easy access file and every time try to move the photos but there is not enough functions
 in this program.</p>
<p>When trying to remove it, at the same time the page for Administrative permission appears and when trying to write in it it jumps to the beginning, meaning you cannot remove it...?1.</p>
<p>Please kindly help me to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Best wishes: Changiz.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to disable Windows photo viewer as this is by design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may set your default program as Windows live photo gallery and check if it helps.<br />

            <p>hello,</p>
<p>thank you for your efforts, I was not informed that the Photo Gallery Windows 7 does not exist anymore.</p>
<p>But yet some of the functions as Revert to Original, cut and crop could be better by adding some adds similar to Windows 7 photo gallery.</p>

    <title>Ctrl Keys don&#39;t work in Win XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d lessmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ctrl Keys don&#39;t work in Win XP</h2>
                    I recently reinstalled Win XP Home on my Dell Inspiron 4000 laptop computer.&nbsp; I reformated the hard drive and installed the OS from scratch.&nbsp; Once the OS was installed, I also loaded support for Asian languages and installed the Japanese keyboard.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I have discovered that neither Ctrl key works on my keyboard.&nbsp; All other keys are functional but without the Ctrl key I cannot use many useful shortcut keys such as Ctrl-Alt-Delete, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, etc.&nbsp; I can use copy and paste by using the right
 mouse key.<br />
<br />
I have tried uninstalling the keyboard and rebooting, but this had no effect.&nbsp; I also removed the Japanese keyboard and reinstalled the keyboard driver, again without any effect.<br />
<br />
Any solution or suggestions offered are very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

            The simplest way is to run Windows Update and install all the updates it offers.&nbsp; Repeat until there are no more updates, which will probably take several runs and restarts.<br />
<br />
If you know what service pack level the restored system has (look in <strong>Control Panel
</strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> ), you can download and install a later service pack (there are three).&nbsp; For example, if the computer has Service Pack 1a or Service Pack 2, you can install
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=5B33B5A8-5E76-401F-BE08-1E1555D4F3D4&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Service Pack 3</a> .&nbsp; After installing SP3, run Windows Update repeatedly as above.

<p>Thanks Carlos, for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I suspected was the outlook calendar, so I did double check it was clear and I even unticked "Update my presence based on my calendar information" but no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed and signed into another "blank" PC, and also installed Skype for Business on my Android mobile phone but still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have <span>followed the steps you suggested for <span>clearing the Skype for Business cache
</span>but no effect.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding "<span>It seems coincided with the appearance of Microsoft Teams", I recalled when I first came across this problem, I noticed the "Teams" button appeared when I start Skype for Business.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>Besides,&nbsp;<span>please check the SIP address are added in your email address. Go Exchange Admin Center -&gt; recipients, double click the mailbox -&gt; email address and check if the SIP address there. If not, please add the SIP address to integrate Skype

<h2>            Ease of Access Center Controlled through GPO</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>I work as on-site IT support and we have some users that are leaving their mouse on their space bar which stops the computer locking after 5 minutes of inactivity, these users that leave the computer unlocked and walk away. I have found that within ease
 of access you can setup 'Filter keys' which in there is an option to ignore reaping strokes, the setting has to be set up per user per computer. I am wanting to apply this setting to a handful of computer regardless of which user is logged on, or have another
 solution which will stop this from happening.</p>

<p>Hiya mickeyd180, </p>
<p>Have you tried a power cycle? Hold the power button down for 5-7 seconds until the console shuts off. Then wait until the light on the power brick turns solid orange. Once that happens, unplug the power cable from the console for 60-120 seconds.

    <title>Xbox One Kinect Sensor Broke &#58;&#40; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew iz 1337  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Kinect Sensor Broke &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought the Xbox One from Argos this morning.. got it all hooked up and within an hour my sensor stopped working. Tried all the troubleshooting tips and called up Microsoft and they told me I'd have to get it replaced, so I was fine with that.. until
 I got told that I would need to use a credit card/debit card to verify me then they would hold £91 of my money, until I returned the broken sensor to them. I think this is absoloutely ridiculous. I demanded to speak to a supervisor and was told I'd get a call
 back.. no call back yet! I went down to Argos hoping to get it exchanged and was politely told to ''f off'' really. It seems that I'm not the only one who is being refused exchanges/refunds for the sensor issue. I couldn't of got it exchanged anyways, as there
 claiming there out of stock till late next week now.</p>
<p>I've tried calling back again in regards too it, told the same crap from Microsoft and promised again that a supervisor will call me.</p>
<p>I basically decided to take it upon myself and contact the scottish sun newspaper in regards too it and there interested in my story as they've heard of the sensor issues and wish to print it if I'll give them my full story and permission to do so. I'm absoloutely
 raging at the fact I've bought this now and have been treated this way, it may not seem a big deal to you all, but the kinect sensor does now play a large role in the way this console works now, to make it more easier and efficient. What gets to me more, is
 I'm sure any agent who took my call, could look into my account history and see that I've had 2 xbox 360's replaced, now I'm having to do this with an Xbox One?</p>
<p>To be quite honest, I think its cheeky that they're going to even hold £91 of my money as if I'm not to be trusted, but I'll say this now.. I put my trust in Microsoft, got this crap now to deal with, and they're doing this to me?</p>
<p>I hope they get there finger out there backsides and get this sorted and the people who like me who have been effected by this ridiculous problem get some sort of good will gift for this issue.</p>
<p>Anyone else had this issue, who are on this forum?</p>

<p>Seriously, just box it all back up again &amp; take it back to Argos.</p>
<p>Your contract for the sale is with Argos NOT Microsoft</p>
<p>Even if you have to wait a week for stock it will cost you nothing and you will get a new sealed box..</p>

<p>How do you or they know its a Kinect problem it could be the circuitry inside the Xbox associated with the Kinect.</p>
<p>'</p>
<p>At the end of the day the kinect came in the box with the console.</p>
<p>Based upon the length of time you have had the console and UK consumer law I don't beieve any retailer could deny you an immediate refund or exchange.</p>

<p>Cause the woman was pretty honest with me and was told by her boss that they've not to expect any consoles with kinect issues, they were told by bosses higher up. As I've already seen on many forums and much more today, it seems that there is a fault with
 the kinect all together.</p>

<p>Argos sold you faulty goods, and if you only bought it not that long ago then you as the customer have a right for a refund or a replacement. Shops can't sell you a faulty product.<br />

Everything in the box has to work. If it doesn't, your retailer should exchange it for a new one. You're in the UK, you know your rights, go exercise them and don't leave the store until they give you a replacement.</p>

<p>Yes he contacted a newspaper rather than "fight" for his consumer rights in a high street shop.</p>
<p>Rather cowardly IMHO but perhaps the newspaper will remind Argos that he is entitled to a refund.</p>
<p>Not exactly front page news though is it?</p>

            Hello
<br />
<br />Have you tried right clicking on your Start Menu and clicking on System?
<br />
<br />If this says Windows 10 you can do a reset which is pretty much a reinstall since it resets core Windows files.
<br />
<br />
<br />Right Click on the Start Menu&lt; left click Settings&lt; Update &amp; Security&lt;Recovery and then click on Get Started under Reset This PC. From here you can choose to complete the reset and keep your files, or wipe everything clean. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any issue or questions.       
        </p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Mic
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already

                    I ordered Microsoft Flight Simulator, paid for the program, and downloaded it to my new desk top.&nbsp; Windows 8 popped up with a request to reset windows 8, and further said no downloads or files would be erased.&nbsp; The reset removed the Norton software I had

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to other computers in my network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noelcastle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to other computers in my network</h2>
                    I had been able to send and receive files to different computers in my home through my home network. I had to replace my DSL modem/router, now I can't connect to the other computers. After changing the router, I changed the name of the network.<br />
<br />
In file manager, when I click on the network icon, the other computers aren't listed.<br />
<br />
I've gone into settings, network &amp; Internet, and selected network reset on both computers, and rebooted.<br />
<br />
Under advanced sharing settings, Turn on Network Discovery and Turn on File and Printer Sharing are both turned on.<br />
<br />
In the file manager address bar, I've tried entering \\(computer name), it says "Problems Found; your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device detected or resource is not responding.<br />
<br />
Anything else I can try?

<p>did you just update to windows 10 V1803 ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so then go here:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/connecting-pcs-and-users-for-sharing/fb92e439-5dbc-4367-9857-1ef360e9ffdf">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/connecting-pcs-and-users-for-sharing/fb92e439-5dbc-4367-9857-1ef360e9ffdf</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not updated any PC's to v1803 and you have a new Modem, is your modem set to DHCP Dynamic IP DNS.
</p>
<p>I would go into Modem and in device table note the IP address's for each PC. Then go back to each PC and verify that the same&nbsp;IP matches the modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Modem/Routers will need to do a quick setup with a new modem, usually provided by your ISP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question, besides not connecting to each other, do you have internet access on them, possible if you are here posting, but you could be posting from somewhere else.</p>

<h2>            &#34;This offer has expired.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Prior to activating one month of Xbox Live Gold, I hadn't had it for 6 months. I had several friends send me invites, which apparently came with a promotion of one free month of Xbox Live Gold with any activation of at least one month (or more) of Xbox Live Gold. However, when I tried to claim one of those promotions (after activating Gold via one of the links), I was redirected to a page saying "This offer has expired," despite that the invite was only a few days old. That was almost a month ago.<br /><br /></p><p>Last Tuesday (April 3, 2018), I received a message from Xbox Live on my Xbox One stating, "You unlocked a free $10 Xbox Gift Card for going Gold! Click 'Launch site' and redeem by 6/30/18 and spend within 90 days of redemption." I clicked on the link, but once again, it directed me to a page saying, "This offer has expired."</p><br />What's going on here? That's two separate promotions that I should qualify for, yet claim to be expired. :/<br />
