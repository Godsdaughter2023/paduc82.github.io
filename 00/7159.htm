            It's not a back-up, it is an online sync. Delete from the phone, deletes from the sync.

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. We are experiencing high volume of inquiries. By the way, let's find out what are the possible options that we can do to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>By upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><font color="#000000">The possible solution that I can think of
 is you run the Auto Restore option feature in Outlook.com to recover your lost emails, but
<ul>

 not reaching my inbox</font></span></a></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If emails were not restored, but the messages that you were looking for are already beyond retrieval
 because it's possible that emails were already purged from our system.</span></p>

    <title>Because Windows 10 is a mobile, smartphone, tablet, tv, washer devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supercocoloco.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Because Windows 10 is a mobile, smartphone, tablet, tv, washer devices OS, I request a new Windows Desktop PC OS Version that will be the next Windows 7 version.</h2>
                    <p><span>For Microsoft, the PC is dead and has no interest on PC anymore.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the new “Devices and Services” and now “Cloud First, Mobile First” era from Microsoft, the desktop is deprecated. The real era from Microsoft is “Cloud First, Mobile First, Desktop PC never more”. Also, they are doing important and strong efforts
 trying to kill the Desktop PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft is centered in Cloud and Mobile first and only. Microsoft not talk about Mobile first, Desktop PC second, or third. No. They not ever talk about Desktop PC. If anyone look at the new Microsoft website, there are
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nothing relative to Desktop PC’s</span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft, in order to be like Apple and Google on mobile devices, a market that sells more units than Desktop PC’s, are centered only and exclusive on develop a Mobile OS that also runs on a Desktop PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows is now a devices OS that also runs the same both on a TV or on a washer machine than on a Desktop PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>I don’t want a tablet or washer OS on my PC. I don’t want to put an OS on my desktop PC that also runs on a tablet.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>I want a powerfull OS developed to take full power of my desktop PC. An OS design for my 300$ processor, my 300$ graphics card, my 16 or 32 GB. of RAM, my 6 six cores with Hyperthreading, etc.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">That is what I’m requesting in this post.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To acquire and accommodate Windows OS, Microsoft needs to constantly remove features, options and performance, in order to run fast and fluid on any mobile device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Because of this, Windows 8.x and 10 is a lighter version <em>(an important downgrade)</em> with less options, features, performance and customizations. Every new version of Windows (or Office) since Windows 8
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is a clearly downgrade</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to complete his Cloud premises, Windows needs and requires a Microsoft Account in to track all what you do in Windows in order to sell our services. Those services including personalized ads based in your preferences that Microsoft recollects
 tracking all what you do in Windows 10. Also Microsoft can sell your tracking records to advertising companies in order to earn more income.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 is now an ad-aware OS. Microsoft knows how bad is Windows and wants to make cash by selling ads and apps via the Store, because is clearly it will not be amortized with Windows 10 sales, like Windows 8.x, a bad OS that nobody will buy. This
 is the reason of why is free also for non genuine copies of Windows 7 or 8.x. because Microsoft expects to get revenue with the Store and ads implemented in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 is free for the first year. What happened behind that first year? No updates until pay? A blocked OS with less function until pay? A subscription mode? Why can the new ugly crappy app of Windows Update can’t allow to select what updates
 you install? Microsoft have the control to install or uninstall all they want.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes, also allows to create a Local Account if you discover how and where, but the OS is not develop to run with a Local Account.</span></p>
<p>

</p><p><span>In order to be touch friendly and consume low batteries resources <em>(remember that is a Mobile OS)</em>, the UI is a completely disaster. All are big, flat, with ugly heavy and strong solid colors. Apps are black and white. Icons are like 1 year
 old baby design. Are not clearly identifying the item. And are ugly, very ugly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">lack of contrast between areas</span></strong> makes it unuseful, inoperative, less discoverable of features and functions, and there are no intuitive. The overall OS is not less intuitive, is clearly
 NO INTUITIVE at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, the new elements in the UI are a completely chaos. You see icons that are impossible to see if that icon is decorative, is a button, or is a link. The same for text, is a label? Is a button? Is a link? Is a textbox? Is a bird? Is a plane? Is
 a completely disaster. Also is impossible to discover what Window or element has the focus.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft teases us telling that Windows 10 has now a start menu. Sorry but this is not a Start Menu. It’s a little Start Screen put on the same place of the Start Menu. Microsoft needs to see Windows 7 or Windows XP Start Menu in order to discover
 how a Star Menu is.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>The user interface are a complete disaster and are also ugly, very ugly.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>It’s a worst, crappy and cheap copy of a mixed Android and iOS OS’s.</span></p>
<p><span>This makes working in that OS a frustrating experience, less discoverable options, no intuitive, more clicks to do simple things, not fluid or discoverable like Windows 7 or older versions. And with that ugly UI is not comfortable, not amazing to work
 on it. </span><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">They</span></span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">

            <p>Windows 10 will not sell, there will be a greater public outcry than win 8 / 8.1... so nothing really to worry about. MS will be forced to revert to producing a desktop OS. They will have lost all ground in the mobile market so no sales there either.</p>
<p>The answer is to just carry on using win 7.</p>
<p>DX 12 will be surpassed when win 10 fails. Mantle / Vulkan is ready and waiting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>There is hence no reason to change from win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even corporate will just stay with win7. service or not, support or not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The only thing I want in win 7 is DX 12, nothing more. And as said, that can be accomplished by Mantle / Vulkan .. when Nvidia see the light - or more correctly failure of win 10, they will release their own API or work to Vulkan. Problem sorted.</p>
<p>Everybody wins - apart from MS....</p>
<p>We will probably see a Bill Gates return 'to shake the tree', like Jobs returning and pulling a fading and dwindling Apple out of the mire after their headless chicken phase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the MS version of the headless chicken phase. All will come to pass. ;-) WIN 10 WILL pass... and rest in pieces. Perhaps with a 'TILE' as an apt headstone.&nbsp; ?</p>

            <p>I hear you loud and clear, SuperCocoLoco, and I agree with you. &nbsp;It's as if after the failure of Windows RT, they want to slowly transition desktop Windows into Windows RT. &nbsp;The inexorable movement away from the desktop is based on a complete misunderstanding
 of the market shift towards mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows RT was supposed to be the casual computing version of Windows, but it was an utter failure because it was inferior to other casual computing platforms and not able to run "real programs".</p>
<p>
</p><p>People have flocked to mobile devices mainly as convenient ways of performing casual computing - but not as a replacement for a workstation. &nbsp;To dumb-down workstation OS into a casual computing platform will not gain market share. &nbsp;The inconvenient truth
 is that Metro, Windows RT, OneDrive, Bing, Cortana, are all products and services developed in order to catch up to innovations that others have pioneered. &nbsp;Playing catch-up is not a winning strategy if it means taking your eye off the ball in the one area
 where you have a near-monopoly, and that's the desktop pc as a productivity workstation. &nbsp;<strong>Stay strong where you are strong</strong> AND develop products where you are weak, instead of weakening your product where you are strong and developing "me too"
 products that aren't better than the competition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are casual home users that are turned off by the PC for various reasons, but chief among them are poor built-in security (Defender/Security Essentials), inability to have centralized control of maintenance updates to Flash, Java, or whatever else is
 installed that may be a security risk if not updated (should include that in windows update). &nbsp;A number of casual PC users stop using their PC's when they become infected, or otherwise malfunction. &nbsp;A more robust built-in self-diagnostics, even if by subscription,
 would make people less prey to unscrupulous businesses pretending to offer security software or malware cleaning scareware services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than dumbing down the desktop, what Microsoft needs to do, to preserve and perhaps grow market share, is to go the other direction, and make tablets and phones that are
<strong>more capable and powerful than the competitors</strong>, and at the same time, keep the Windows as the premier business class, professional, desktop operating system. &nbsp;If you want to dumb down the desktop you are falling into Chromebook territory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Metro were fluid, reliable, with exceptionally capable apps, I can see someone switching away from Android and iOS, but honestly, the competing ecosystems have better, more reliable, more capable apps. &nbsp;The Metro app store is mostly garbage - seriously,
 clean house, even if it means dumping 95% of the apps. &nbsp;<strong>Microsoft should have a higher standard, not a lower one</strong><strong>.</strong></p>

            <p>Windows OS's UI has been&nbsp; 3&nbsp; big changes </p>
<p>Windows 1.0 / Windows 95 / Windows 8 </p>
<p>It was&nbsp;3 big paradigm changes&nbsp; actually</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>like this ;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows 3.0 to&nbsp;Windows 95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>some complained ,</p>
<p>they say "&nbsp; where is program manager ? "</p>
<p>they say " where is file manager ? " </p>
<p>but ,&nbsp;MS didn't step back&nbsp; , moved forward .</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;Windows 7 to Windows 8 / 8.1</p>
<p>it was&nbsp;windows 7 desktop&nbsp;&nbsp;UI to&nbsp; Windows 8 's metro UI</p>
<p>they say " where is start button ? "</p>
<p>they say " where is start menu ? "</p>
<p>but now .&nbsp; MS did step back </p>
<p>and windows 10&nbsp;&nbsp;is mix of&nbsp;&nbsp; windows 7 and windows 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>this time , I think, ms&nbsp; made a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp; they shouldn't have steped back </p>
<p>

                    Hi. I have a Hotmail account and I've now connected the email from my own domain to Hotmail. On Hotmail's "connected accounts" options page, it shows the connected account as being up to date. However, I can't see any folders from the connected account
 on the Hotmail webpage. What am I missing here? Thanks for your help. Kevin

<p>
</p><p>Finally, I just decided to try and sign out and sign back in (hoping it was just an issue with hotmail) and turns out it was!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Digital Movies with Microsoft PlayForSure protection</h2>
                    I recently received a few Blue Ray DVDs as Christmas gifts. Included in the packages were disks containing digital versions of the movies, which are DRM protected WMV files. When I attempted to transfer these to my Zune 32 GB HD player, they did not show
 in my Collection in the Zune software. When I right clicked on the file in Windows Explorer and selected Play with Zune, I received a message that Zune cannot play a DRM protected file (or something like that). It seems that the file can only be played with
 a Microsoft PlayForSure compatible device. It seems strange that a Microsoft device cannot play a files that is created with Microsoft protection. Does anyone know of any way that this can be transferred to, and played on my device?

<br />I added a new email account in Outlook 2016 but it will not show up in the lists of email accounts on the left-side listings. 
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />The Outlook Navigation Pane (left hand panel) is not a listing of email accounts but rather a list of the Outlook data files configured for the Outlook profile. Ergo, If you have configured your email accounts as POP3 accounts using the same data file, only the data file is listed in the Nav Pane.
<br />
<br />To determine what data files you have configured, go to Outlook menu --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab. Similarly, the Email tab shows all the email accounts configured with the "type" listed in the right-hand column
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />How do I add it to show up and be able to access the account to read emails?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />If you have multiple email accounts set to be delivered to the same &lt;Inbox&gt; (only possible for POP3 accounts), all the emails for all those accounts are in the same &lt;Inbox&gt; folder. To  make it easier to separate out emails by account, change the &lt;View Settings&gt; for the &lt;Inbox&gt; folder to &lt;Group By&gt; Email Account.

    <title>First Line on Even Pages Has Extra Indentation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rhetoric101  say:</h3>
<h2>            First Line on Even Pages Has Extra Indentation</h2>
                    I'm creating a Word 2010 template that has right-left pagination. For some reason in the main section of my template, the first line on my even pages has about five spaces of extra indentation, but the following lines are indented normally (the odd pages
 all have equal indentation). In the following example there are about 5 extra spaces preceding "Jack" on the first line:<br />
<br />
[Example]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down and broke his crown, And Jill came tumbling after. Up Jack got, and home did trot, As fast as he could caper; To old Dame Dob, who patched his nob With vinegar and brown paper.<br />
[/Example]<br />
<br />
I thought perhaps this was because I had clicked "Different First Page" in my 2nd page header, but I've since cleared that.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest where I might look to solve this?<br />

            Thanks for the suggestion about unwanted frames in the header/footer.<br />
<br />
When I highlighted my even page header elements, I suddenly noticed that part of it dipped down below the lower border of the header frame into the body! This was caused by an image of a vertical bar that I had inserted following the page number.
<br />
<br />
The solution was to drag the lower border of the header down two notches to make room for the vertical bar image. My odd pages already had that extra space below the bar, which is why they looked fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

    <title>Header and Footer Joined Together, Doc Body NOT Visible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sunnysunflower  say:</h3>
<h2>            Header and Footer Joined Together, Doc Body NOT Visible</h2>
                    I have a two-page document with headers and footers. Everything looked fine. I saved and closed it. When I reopened it, the header and footer were mashed together and the body of the document was not visible in print layout view. The document was arrayed
 on 34 pages instead of two, each one blank like the next. The actual text in the header and footer were not visible. The document essentially looked like this, with the footer above the header and butted up to it on the page.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>|<span> </span>&nbsp; |</div>
<div>|<span> </span>&nbsp;<span> </span>
|</div>
<div>|___ &nbsp;Footer __<span> </span>
|</div>
<div>| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Header &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />
<div>|<span> </span>&nbsp;<span> </span>&nbsp; <span>
</span>|</div>
<div>|<span> </span>&nbsp; |</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do NOT have the boxes for different first page or odd/even pages checked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div>Settings for "header from top" and "footer from bottom" each are 0". Even if I change these to another value, say 0.5", the document text does not show. I can see the document text in outline mode. In draft mode, each character of the document is on a
 separate line.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A similar issue occurred when I was editing another Word document. In that case, I did a cut and paste and when I pasted the text on a new page, the footer and header "stuck" together, despite the settings on that page being no different from the others.
 I am not sure if this document had been one that was converted from the Mac version of Word. In the first case, the document had originally been a Mac 2008 Word document.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a very frustrating problem. The document was fine until I either saved it and reopened it or did a cut and paste. Since a similar issue has occurred twice, I question the integrity of Word. I am hoping someone has a solution for this so that I
 can fix my present document and can ensure that it does not recur.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.&nbsp;</div>

            When trying to adjust the margins to see if that would help, I got an error message (unfortunately, I can't recall what it was or I would post it here, something about the left margin being outside the ...whatever). I was able to resolve the problem by
 these steps:
<div><br />
<div>1. Ribbon Home tab &gt; Editing: Select all (in Select dropdown).</div>
<div><br />
<div>2.Page layout tab &gt; Columns: One.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your help. I do wish Microsoft would resolve whatever leads to this error. My document was fine when I saved and closed it. &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Leave a non-printable note in Word</h2>
                    <p>Hello people of the forum!</p>
<p>I am somewhat curious of the idea to leave a note to someone in a Word document.</p>
<p>This I would utilize in specific instructions on printing, as the file might be distributed between people.</p>
<p>Therefore, it also has to be quite visible when someone opens the document.</p>
<p>However, it should under no circumstances be printed out with the rest of the document, like comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to move a textbox outside of the paper like in PowerPoint, but it became completely transparent.</p>
<p>Any good ideas?</p>

    <title>new Outlook icons on android - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nsgma365  say:</h3>
<h2>            new Outlook icons on android</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>today on my android phone, the outlook and calendar icons are different and look partially pixelated. In the notification, I can see that both outlook and calendar seem now to have a different icon (which I interpret as been related to Exchange). But on
 the larger "shortcut" icons the "exchange" part is pixelated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone as the same? was this a overnight update? or has my phone gone rogue?</p>

It was a Microsoft Security Certificate.&nbsp; I decided to restart my computer and&nbsp; seems to have taken care of the&nbsp; problem. Thanks for your reply, though.

    <title>Word 2013 word count not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2013 word count not working properly</h2>
                    Until this week, if I chose a paragraph or two Word would display on the bottom of the screen 158 of 800 words. Now it only displays the total amount of words and I have to click on the total number and a box pops up showing the breakdown of the words.
 How do I get it to give me the summary again by only selecting the words I want counted?<br />
<br />
I'm using windows 8. if that makes a difference. <br />

<strong>bit</strong> more solid feel but we should still see the background. also, please add a little bit of "blur" effect for tiles, so we can read and see the tiles clearly! man, just bring back the<em> aero</em> feature for w10 desktop and add it for phones

            Hi Vinu...,
<br />
<br />I'm Tyler, an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />I think this can help you.
<br />
<br />The first step is to sign in to <a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.outlook.com/</a> with the email address and password from which you have lost or missing the emails
<br />
<br />Now, you have to go and click on the deleted folder/Trash that' located in the left pane of the screen from the folder list
<br />
<br />And then, click on restore deleted messages to get back your lost or missing emails
<br />
<br />This will hopefully restore all your lost and missing email once again
<br />
<br />I hope this helps you.
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />Tyler.

<p>Hi Tyler,</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my deleted folder that day itself. There was nothing other than messages which i have deleted (like junk emails &amp; unimportant mails)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess its something happened in Hotmail (Microsoft servers).</p>

    <title>MS Outlook 2010 Drag-and-Drop is slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> useful43  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Outlook 2010 Drag-and-Drop is slow</h2>
                    <p>Other people have asked this exact question, so it's not unique to me, but no resolution has appeared in the answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, I recently converted to Outlook 2010 which is running on a new very fast Windows 7 Xeon workstation. I imported all of my emails (thousands) from Outlook Express to Outlook (I always keep and&nbsp;file my emails, except SPAM, of course).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I drag-and-drop an email from either my Inbox or Sent Items to any other&nbsp;folder, Outlook takes several seconds for the email to move. I have not observed this issue on other similar setups, so it must be something on my PC, but of course I have
 no idea what it might be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already tried a number of things, but none of them worked. This is the list:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Running Outlook in safe mode</li><li>Clean boot of PC</li><li>No active&nbsp;application add-ins in Outlook</li><li>Disabled and even uninstalled anti-virus software</li><li>Archived and compacted&nbsp;.pst file down to 200MB (although I have not observed this behaviour in a&nbsp;.pst of 10GB on another PC)</li><li>New Outlook profile</li><li>New Outlook data file</li><li>Repair of Office 2010 (in Control Panel)</li><li>Running PST.exe several times</li><li>Enabled the Group Policy (and forced an update)&nbsp;to prevent indexing in Outlook</li><li>Office 2010 SP1 is installed with all latest patches (last being 14 Feb 2013)</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My observations are that Outlook appears to be indexing the&nbsp;destination folder in the background (hence the Group Policy above), which is the reason for the delay. I have come to this conclusion because:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I drag-and-drop an email:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>to a folder and then a second email to the same folder, the first email takes a few seconds to move, but the second is immediate;</li><li>to an empty&nbsp;folder, the move is immedate;</li><li>to a folder with only one or two emails in it, the move is almost immediate;</li></ul>
<p>If I drag-and-drop an email backwards and forwards between folders, all second and&nbsp;subsequent moves are immediate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Further troubleshooting and observation has revealed what is going on:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I drag-and-drop an email, Outlook appears to 'hang', while&nbsp;the target folder is being&nbsp;indexed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the number of emails in the target folder, this process can take 3-5 seconds. Once the indexing is completed, Outlook 'recovers' and allows further activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If two emails are dragged-and-dropped into the same folder one after the other, the first takes a while (as described above), but the second is instant, as the folder is already indexed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's this indexing, during which time Outlook appears to 'hang' that I cannot turn off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set up another PC with default settings&nbsp;and imported emails from Outlook Express resulting in a PST file that is more than twice as large as mine and it has no such problem. Clearly the size of the PST file is not the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be very grateful if someone could think of a way to stop this indexing!</p>

<h2>            SharePoint Online Delete and Recreation of Root Site Collection Taking Long Time</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>we have spo e1 plan. i've deleted my root site collection and recreating new site collection with publishing template, it's taking nearly 24 hour and still not yet completed. reason for deletion is page library is not working and several other issues, which
 there's no such issue in other site collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if worst case scenario happens, may i know what can i do? like can i request for reset or any option that i can go for? i can't seem to find any support point of contact.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Some fonts are missing after Win 10 upgrade</strong>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/some-fonts-are-missing-after-upgrade/95839dfa-0df2-4bc0-875a-fd6b57e61fe4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/some-fonts-are-missing-after-upgrade/95839dfa-0df2-4bc0-875a-fd6b57e61fe4</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Symptom</strong></p>
<p>Some users have found that certain fonts they use are missing after upgrading to Windows 10.
</p>
<p>For example, if the English (or German, Spanish...) version of Windows 10 was installed, then the Gautami,&nbsp;Meiryo, Narkism... font is missing.</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>Many fonts that shipped in prior versions of Windows have been moved into optional features in Windows 10. After upgrading to Windows 10, these optional features may not be installed on your system. The result is that the fonts in those optional features
 will not be present.</p>
<p>If you need to use a font in one of these optional features, any of them&nbsp;can be installed on any Windows 10 system, as explained below.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Since Windows Vista, every Windows system has included all Windows fonts. Windows supports many languages, and many of the fonts are intended primarily for use with particular languages.
</p>
<p>For example, the Meiryo or Raavi font can be used for English, but they were added to Windows to support other languges: Meiryo was created to support Japanese; Raavi was created to support Panjabi or other languages written in Gurmukhi script. Most English
 (or German, Arabic, Ukrainian...) speakers don’t use Gurmukhi or Japanese writing, but they still would all have these fonts on their system, and many others intended for particular languages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having fonts that aren’t needed or being used provides no benefit, but they take up system resources and clutter up font lists with options that have no relevance. In order to optimize system resources and user experience using fonts, many fonts that were
 included in Windows 8.1 were moved into optional features in Windows 10.&nbsp;A comprehensive list of the font families in each of the optional features is provided below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these fonts are organized into optional features that are associated with particular languages. For example, the DaunPenh, Khmer UI and MoolBoran fonts were all designed primarily to support Khmer, and are now in the Khmer Supplemental Fonts feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While all these international fonts have been moved into optional features, every Windows 10 system still includes fonts that provide comprehensive coverage of international languages and the Unicode character encoding standard. So, you don’t need any of
 these optional features installed if, for instance, you occasionally browse in Edge to sites that have Chinese, Hebrew or Tamil text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to these fonts from previous versions of Windows, there are also some new fonts added in Windows 10 intended for use with English and other European languages that are included in an optional feature, Pan-European Supplemental Fonts. (See below
 for details on the fonts provided with this feature.) This optional feature does not have any language associations. If you’d like to use these fonts, you’ll need to manually install this optional feature, as described below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Automatic installation of&nbsp;optional font features based on language associations</strong></p>
<p>As described above, most of the optional font features have particular language associations. These are automatically installed if you installed the associated language version of Windows. For example, if you do a clean install or upgrade using the Thai
 version of Windows 10, then the Thai Supplemental Fonts feature will be automatically included during the setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The language-associated font features are also installed automatically based on other language settings. In particular, if you add a language into your user profile (which is the same as enabling a keyboard for the language), then any association optional
 font feature will be installed automatically at that time. </p>
<p>When upgrading from Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, language settings that were configured prior to the upgrade will also be detected during the upgrade, and any associated optional font feature will be installed during the upgrade. Similarly, if you add a user
 with an existing&nbsp;Microsoft Account that has roamed settings that were originally configured on a Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 system, when the language roam into the Windows 10 system, any associated optional font features will be automatically installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If upgrading from Windows 7, keyboards for additional languages that were enabled on the Windows 7 system will be detected and used to configure language settings in Windows 10. At this time, associated optional font features will not be automatically installed
 during the upgrade process. However, some time after the upgrade is complete, a maintenance task will detect the language settings and install the associated optional font features. It may take a few days before this happens. Until then, you can always install
 any optional font feature manually using the steps described below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing optional language-associated features by adding a language to your settings</strong></p>
<p>If you want to use some of the fonts in an optional feature and you know that you will want to view Web pages, edit documents or use apps in the language associated with that feature, then you should add that language into your user profile. This is done
 in Settings; here are the steps, using Hebrew as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Start button.</li><li>Click Settings.</li><li>In Settings, click Time &amp; language.</li><li>Click Region &amp; language.</li><li>If Hebrew is not included in the list of languages, click the “+” icon next to Add a language.</li><li>Scroll to find Hebrew, then click on it to add it to your language list. </li></ul>
<p>Once you have added Hebrew to your language list, then the optional Hebrew font feature and other optional features for Hebrew language support will be installed. This should only take a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The optional features are installed by Windows Update. You need to be&nbsp;online for the Windows Update service to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also note: </strong>If you are on a work machine, some businesses manage updates separately, in which case the optional features might not install. If that’s your situation, please get help from your system administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing optional features independent of language settings</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
Any of the optional font features can be installed manually without needing to change language settings. Here’s how—I’ll use the Hebrew Supplemental Fonts feature as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Start button.</li><li>In Settings, click System.</li><li>Click Apps &amp; features.</li><li>Click on the link, Manage optional features.</li><li>If “Hebrew Supplemental Fonts” is not listed among the installed features, click on the “+” icon next to Add a feature.</li><li>Scroll to find “Hebrew Supplemental Fonts”. Click on that item, then click on Install.</li><li>Click on the back arrow in the upper corner of the window.</li></ul>
<p>You should see the Hebrew feature in the list as installed or in the process of being installed.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The optional features are installed by Windows Update. You need to be&nbsp;online for the Windows Update service to work.
</p>
<p><strong>Also note: </strong>If you are on a work machine, some businesses manage updates separately, in which case the optional features might not even be visible to you—when you go into Add a feature, you might not see the optional features listed. If that’s

<p><strong>Workaround in Word</strong></p>
<p>“Save As” to PDF format makes the file independent of fonts on other computers</p>
<p>Or, you can also save Word files with the fonts embedded. This allows the file to be viewed in Word on another device using the font you used, even if that wasn’t installed on the other device; and it also allows the other user to edit the document using
 that font. This option is also found in Word’s Save As dialog, though it’s a little harder to discover. First, click on “Tools” next to the Save button and select “Save Options...”:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt" />
<p>You can also&nbsp;go into Word options another way and then select the Save tab.&nbsp;At the bottom of the Save settings, you’ll find a section, “Preserve fidelity when sharing this document”:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt" />
<p>By default, this is disabled. If you check the “Embed fonts in the file” option, then the next to options become enabled. Clearing the second checkbox would be good if others need to be able to edit the document.
</p>
<p>Note in particular the third checkbox: it’s set by default. If you clear it, as shown here, then the David font will be present when opened in Word even if the other person has Windows 10 and doesn’t have the Hebrew Supplemental Fonts feature installed.
 Moreover, it would ensure that David or any other font such as Arial would be present in case the other person (using Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7 or whatever) has uninstalled those fonts from their system.</p>
<p>If you’re using third-party fonts, there is one small issue you might encounter when using either of the approaches I’ve mentioned: some font licenses do not permit embedding, and so can’t be saved within a Word, PDF or XPS file. This doesn’t apply to any
 of the Windows fonts, however. You can discover the embedding permissions of any of your fonts using the Details view of the Fonts control panel: it has a&nbsp;“Font embeddability” column.</p>

<h2>            List of figures etc. keeps on multiplying and messing up captions when updating field</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently trying to set up my contents in lists as this, but there seems to be some sort of bug (or that I'm doing something wrong), that causes the elements of the list of figures to double up each time I try to update the "entire list" and mess up
 the system. It's shown in the attached pictures, whereas the last picture is only one of surely thirty pages of the same nonesense shown here. I got some of the same issue yesterday, and it worked by erasing ALL captions and insert them again, but it would
 be really struggling to do this each time I'm opening the document.</p>
<p>How do I fix this?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Joakim</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />The Table of Figures is a variation of a Table of Contents field. It picks up things for your list based on both the Caption Style and the label attached to the Caption.
<br />
<br />Here is the portion of my page on Complex Documents dealing with it.
<br /><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/complex_documents.htm#TableFigures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/complex_do...</a>
<br />
<br />If your styles are confused, you can get a confused TOF.
<br />
<br />You can see what styles are applied, where, using Shift+F1. Then click the box at the bottom of the Reveal Formatting pane to show style formatting.
<br /><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/basic_formatting.htm#RevealCodes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/basic_form...</a>

<br />This link is to a page on my (non-Microsoft) website. It is safe. I am providing it because I think it contains information that will help you. However, as an Independent Advisor I am required to add the following when posting here with a link to any non-Microsoft site:
<br />----------------------------------
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />If you want, save a sample document with the problem on OneDrive or Dropbox and paste a link here. Remove any confidential or sensitive information first. I can take a look at it. I may be able to fix it for you and explain what I did. 
<br />
<br />If you do not want to post a link here, you can email such a sample to me. To do that, use the email address shown below but substitute "@" for "[at]" and "." for "[dot]" in the address. However, posting a link would let more people give help. (I realize every day how little I know. The knowledge in this community is very extensive.)
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

            The table of figures depends on the label "Figure" is the Caption's SEQ field.
<br />-<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/complex_documents.htm#TableFigures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/complex_do...</a>
<br />-<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/numbering.htm#Sequence_Fields" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/numbering....</a>
<br />
<br />The field code for the Table of Figures field is { TOC \h \z \c "Figure" }.
<br />That is, this is really a special Table of Contents field.
<br />
<br />The Caption field should look like this:
<br />
<br />{ SEQ Figure \* ARABIC }
<br />
<br />To see field codes you can toggle the view using Alt+F9 or by changing the Word Options.
<br />(Mac Opt+F9 or Word Preferences.)
<br />Remember to toggle the view back.
<br />
<br />Here is the documentation on TOC field switches:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/field-codes-toc-table-of-contents-field-1f538bc4-60e6-4854-9f64-67754d78d05c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/field-...</a>
<br />
<br />\c "SEQIdentifier"
<br />Lists figures, tables, charts, or other items that are numbered by a SEQ (Sequence) field. Word uses SEQ fields to number items captioned with the Caption command (References &gt; Insert Caption). SEQIdentifier, which corresponds to the caption label, must match the identifier in the SEQ field. For example, { TOC \c "Figure" } lists all numbered figures.
<br />
<br />\h means that it acts as a hyperlink in the Table of Figures.
<br />
<br />\z hides the tab leader ...... and page number in web view (since pages don't make sense in web view).
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />How to include only part of a Caption in the Table of Figures
<br />- Use a Style Separator
<br /> To do that:
<br />
<br />1. Insert a paragraph break after the text you want to keep (in the middle of your Caption). Press Enter to do this.
<br />
<br />2. Change the Style of the newly formed paragraph containing the text you do not want in your Table of Figures to something other than the Caption Style. If you want that text to look the same as the Caption text, create a new paragraph Style based on the Caption Style and use that.
<br />3. Return to the end of the paragraph containing the text you wart to keep and press Ctrl-Alt-Enter. That will convert the paragraph break after it into a Style Separator, allowing both 'paragraphs' to flow together on the same line and, if you refresh the Table of Figures, the text after 'paragraph break after the text you want to keep will disappear from it.
<br />
<br />More on the Style Separator: <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm#Style_Separator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm...</a>
<br />
<br />Mac versions may not yet have the Style Separator. If not, select the paragraph mark at the end of the part of the caption you want to keep and use Font formatting to mark it as hidden. That should give the same effect. (Thank you to Paul Edstein for much of the content on the Style Separator.)

            Hi QueenieSantos 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.
