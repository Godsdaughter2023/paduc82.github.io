<h2>            Security Properties of System32 folder&#63;</h2>
                    I am curious if this is a normal condition? Under the Properties,&nbsp;The General tab&nbsp;has the read only box filled with blue. At the top it shows "System32" in very pale gray. Then under securities it lists, Creator Owner with a check for Special Permissions,
 System with a check for&nbsp;Special Permissions, Administrators&nbsp;with a check for Special Permissions, Users has a check for Read and execute, List folder contents, and Read, Trusted installer with a dark check for List folder contents and a light gray for Special
 Permissions. All of the Special Permissions are a light gray check mark. I am just curious if this is normal condition.&nbsp;
<div>Also under OS-C: is $Recycle Bin it is marked hidden and read only. Under Secirity tab the System and Administrators have full permission and the Users has Special Permission. Inside this folder are 4 recycle bin folders. S-1-5-21-....... 1000,&nbsp;<span>S-1-5-21-.......
 500,&nbsp;</span><span>S-1-5-21-....... 501,&nbsp;</span><span>S-1-5-21-....... 1001.</span></div>
<div><span>Something is just not right with my system. Curious if these are normal for W7?</span></div>

            <p>What you are seeing sounds correct.&nbsp; I would caution you from touching those settings.&nbsp; As for the $Recycler folder, that should be hidden.&nbsp; My advice to you is to turn off the display of system files, as well as hidden files, and not try to see or touch
 them.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 version 1607 update - Stucked at 0&#37; during first reboot..</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell desktop computer and it has been running Windows 10 version 1511 since the beginning. &nbsp;This computer has received various updates regularly. &nbsp;This morning v1607 came down automatically and from Settings - Security and Updates, it just prompt
 to "Restart Now". &nbsp;So I click it. &nbsp;It started the normal installation steps and reboot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon restarted, it went on to complete installion</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Working on updates 0%</p>
<p>Don't turn off your PC. &nbsp;This will take a while.</p>
<p>Your PC will restart several times."</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am writing, almost 5 hours have passed, and it is still at 0%. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help to get out of this jam?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 devices directly attached this computer : 1) external speakers, 2) a KVM switch.&nbsp; I removed both and connect mouse and keyboard directly before 1st hard boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;It came up and saying something of "Restoring previous Windows..." but soon it swapped
 to a black screen with the monitor active (or it&nbsp;didn't go into energy saving mode) for over half an hour but no activity spotted.&nbsp; Waited another 15 minutes and power off and on again.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time the familiar Blue Windows with the spinning thingy come up
 and eventually it booted into Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Logon ok...nothing seems to be damaged from yesterday.&nbsp; It is still Windows 10 Pro 1511 10586.545.&nbsp; Quickly the&nbsp;Microsoft Defender&nbsp;received the latest updates (1.227.1577).&nbsp; Not long after that, Version 1607 download started.&nbsp;&nbsp; After 1607 installed it asked
 for a reboot in the Windows Update screen.&nbsp; It is scheduled for 3:30am.&nbsp; The strange thing is I got distracted for a moment and accidently started rebooting the computer from Windows Start.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when I realized the error because I need this computer for
 something else yet, it booted into Windows.&nbsp; It didn't go into the post update installation sequences.&nbsp; Logon ok and the Windows Update screen still saying the same thing : A restart has been scheduled - 3:30am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll leave the computer as is for now and let it reboot itself overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions :</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Can it reboot and finish installation without internet connection?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In case of total failure (strongly hope NOT), is there something&nbsp;that I can use to reload the computer?&nbsp; This Windows 10 Pro was an auto upgrade from Windows 7.&nbsp; Hate to destroy any licensing information on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last&nbsp;week, v1607 has not came down to my machine and I didn't have&nbsp;time to reach out for it either.&nbsp; Microsoft Defender updates have been coming down automatically everyday.&nbsp;&nbsp;The update aspect of this Windows 10 computer&nbsp;is working well.&nbsp; A couple
 of days ago, this Windows 10 computer received the September batches of&nbsp;security and cumulative OS&nbsp;updates.&nbsp; Took a long time to install but it completed successfully.&nbsp; It's version is updated to Windows 10 Pro 1511 10586.589.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I have to report on this issue at this time.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally get 1607 installed.&nbsp; I am at Windows 10 Pro 1607 14393.693.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;1511 peaceful existence since Sep 2016&nbsp;got interrupted the night before POTUS inauguration.&nbsp; It failed at 0%&nbsp;exactly the same as before.&nbsp; Although the Windows recovery to previous build after a failure is a little different, eventually
 it couldn't continue and trashed 1511 installation altogether.&nbsp; After discussing this issue with MS complimentary Chat support services and they provided enough info that I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;use an 1607&nbsp;usb key to rebuild the whole computer.&nbsp; They also said hanging
 at 0% means "it is unable to locate the file for further installation."&nbsp; This makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new install means all existing partitions have to be removed first.&nbsp; Once the installation started, it promptly failed at 0%.&nbsp; So I opened up the computer and kind of tightened everything and restart installation from scratch.&nbsp; This time, it proceeded
 to 26% and stopped. "Progress finally".&nbsp; Redo it and the same thing.&nbsp; After some more research I came across an article talking about extending the size of the&nbsp;Reserved partition before installation!!&nbsp; Couldn't imagine what it could do but give it a try anyway.&nbsp;
 I have nothing to lose at this point.&nbsp; I extended the system partition using the disk&nbsp;tools available from the Advanced section from 500MB to 3GB.&nbsp; The installation got further but stopped at 63%.&nbsp; "More progress".&nbsp; Eventually I created a 7GB partition (not
 system as I have to start from scratch) and the copying of files into the primary partition reached 100%&nbsp;and carry on with the rest of the installation.&nbsp; After 1607 installation is completed, the System partition created is&nbsp; 500MB but&nbsp;the 7 GB drive became
 a separate drive.&nbsp; There is the C:\ drive of course.&nbsp; I have Windows at last.&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Windows&nbsp;forces logon with a Microsoft account and it automatically recognized me and allowed the digital license.&nbsp; So I have a fully licensed and functional Windows 10
 Pro 1607.&nbsp; Than new freezing problems start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once logon with an MS account and connected to the internet, it automatically reach out to download and install required patches.&nbsp; The disk drive got so busy that after 10 minutes of intense download and installation, the computer would&nbsp;froze solid like
 ice.&nbsp; (Why can't the 1607 download process&nbsp;included all major patches?)&nbsp; I have to hard boot at least 6 times before all the big patches are downloaded and installed.&nbsp;The final patch installation was done after a reboot with NO internet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;NO&nbsp;internet
 connection is&nbsp;KEY.&nbsp; I have to baby the download process by hard boot multiple times so that the required patches got a chance to come down to the computer.&nbsp; The computer runs pretty good after it's all done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one more freezing problem after.&nbsp; I tried to run Defrag but it's intense disk action froze the computer at Pass2:50%.&nbsp; It may indicate there is a&nbsp;problem with how Windows 10&nbsp;access&nbsp;this disk drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'll settle with what I have now.&nbsp; I need my
 sanity back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to all of you still getting stuck.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Recovering a digital game purchased on xbox 360</h2>
                    So in 2015 I bought the Telltale Game of Thrones Season Pass on 360 and I'm trying to figure out why I can't access it. It's not in my library even though lots of my other 360 games are and if I go to the store it wants me to pay for it again.

<p>Yeah, that changes it. That games is not backwards compatible (https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games) so you would have to purchase the One version in order to play on the One.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your download history on the One would be the Ready to Install section of your Games and Apps. Anything you own for the One or any backwards compatible games you own would be listed there.</p>

                    I'm typing this from my Windows phone. My V5 Acer laptop has been rendered useless. It starts up and immediately gives me the system thread error, then restarts itself and repeats. How do I enter safe mode? How do I do anything? How would I even begin
 to get the dmp files that people talk about when I can't do anything? Please help. I currently have a very expensive paperweight.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>Please follow below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Enter Safe Mode and Uninstall Graphics Card Driver.</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Restart Windows 8 computer.</span></li><li><span>As the system restarts, press F8 key&nbsp;continuously to display the Advanced Boot Options screen.</span></li><li><span>On Advanced Boot Options screen, make sure&nbsp;that Safe Mode option is selected and press Enter key.</span></li><li><span>Log on to Windows 8 computer with the account&nbsp;that has the elevated privileges.</span></li><li><span>Click Desktop tile from the Start screen to go&nbsp;to the desktop screen.</span></li><li><span>Once on the desktop screen, hover mouse to the&nbsp;bottom right corner of the window.</span></li><li><span>From the displayed options, click Settings.</span></li><li><span>On the Settings pane, click Control Panel.</span></li><li><span>On the opened All Control Panel Items window, click Device Manager.</span></li><li><span>On <span>Device Manager</span> Window, expand
<span>Display&nbsp;adapter’s</span> category.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Step 3:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Once expanded, right-click the graphics driver that is to be uninstalled.</span></li></ol>

    <title>Audio, video, and Photos stop working properly. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alyssaze.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio, video, and Photos stop working properly.</h2>
                    <p>Every once in a while my video, audio files, sound, and photo viewing stops working correctly. When I try to play a video, audio, or view a photo through the default windows program for it (Movies &amp; TV, Groove Music, Photos), it stalls for about a minute
 and then I get this error. "The wait operation timed out". My audio just stops working completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So even when I do open a video through another media player like VLC or windows media player, there is no sound. Another odd thing is if I open photos in GIMP or Windows Photo Viewer, they are fine. &nbsp;However, when I try audio files through Windows Media
 Player or iTunes, they open, but have trouble playing the audio file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The annoying part is the fact that youtube videos stop working during this time and I have absolutely no sound. These issues usually while I am watching videos on youtube. I had a few instances when this happened while playing a game (League of Legends).
 I usually use Google Chrome.<br />
</p>
<p>What can be causing this? Is there any fixes besides restarting? Restarting my computer works but it is really annoying and inconvenient. I did not have this problem before upgrading to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is some info about my computer.</p>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<p>Lenovo Y50</p>
<p>Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Just had an occurrence where my desktop went black and taskbar is unresponsive, but I was still able to Alt + Tab to the programs I had opened already and after a refresh, youtube was working again. I can't confirm if my video or photos would of
 worked because of the black desktop.</p>

    <title>Task Scheduler Task shows as completed successfully but nothing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dkaufmanjs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler Task shows as completed successfully but nothing happened</h2>
                    <p>I have a few .bat files I created added to my Task Scheduler on our server to fire everyday starting at 5am. &nbsp;The tasks run a series of SQL commands and a find and replace third-party application to update a MySQL database we are using for a web application.
 &nbsp;SQL scheduled events are not an option for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I manually run the task it works fine (I am an administrator with full permissions), either by double-clicking the .bat file or by selecting the task in Task Scheduler and clicking 'Run'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tasks have supposedly been firing everyday for over a week and all of the history logs say the operation completed successfully but when I check the MySQL database nothing actually happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add to the confusion this is happening on 2 of the 3 .bat files I wrote. &nbsp;One works perfectly, two do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the task set to 'Run whether user is logged on or not' and 'Run with highest privileges' and configured for our server, Windows 2012 R2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies if I'm missing something obvious, I'm a JavaScript/PHP web developer that has been thrown into the server environment and, although most of this makes sense on a basic level to me, a lot of the nuances are lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<blockquote>
couldn't boot into windows and received the message 'boot manager is corrupted'<br />
<br />
Created a bootable windows 10 thumbdrive and booted from it, clicked on repair and it just stayed at the loading screen. Happened similarly if i tried to install windows 10. I confirmed it can work when booting from it on a laptop.<br />
<br />
Next i tried to boot from a windows 7 dvd and on clicking install, screen also stayed at setting up windows.<br />
<br />
Unplugging the ssd where windows 10 was installed then allows me to get into setup.<br />
<br />
This means i cant repair windows 10 or install any windows onto the ssd. Any ideas how to fix the boot manager of the ssd if i cant access it via bootable windows repair?<br />
<br />
If i need to install windows onto my hard disk with data, will the data on it remain or be wiped off? It has 200gb free out of 1TB.</blockquote>

            <p>The "I/O device error" could indicate that the SSD is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ALL part of the bootsect command might give some errors, but still work on the SSD.&nbsp; ALL tries to update bootcode on all partitions.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessarily update the boot code for each volume.&nbsp; Instead, this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option updates the boot code on volumes that could be used as Windows<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connected with an underlying disk partition.&nbsp; This restriction is<br />

<p>
</p><p>The bcdboot command will rebuild the Windows boot configuration database, which tells the computer where to find Windows on the disk.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It should work instead, if you just type:</p>

            <p>That's not looking good.&nbsp; Do you need to try to recover data from the SSD still?&nbsp; Possibly you could boot from the USB and still load Windows from the SSD.&nbsp; You would have to make a bcd on a USB to do this (assuming the SSD is still readable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the USB bootable to launch Windows on your SSD:</p>
<p>Boot with the install USB as before and get the Command Prompt.&nbsp; Replace the USB stick with another small one, formatted FAT32 (for a UEFI PC).&nbsp; Try running diskpart to see if the SSD is detected OK.</p>
<p>diskpart</p>
<p>list vol &lt;--- this will list the drive letters assigned to the SSD and USB and show any without drive letters as well.</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup the USB to boot Windows on your SSD. If the USB is drive F: the command to make it bootable for Windows on your SSD would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>bootsect /nt60 F: /force /mbr</p>
<p>bcdboot C:\Windows /s F: /f ALL</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes what you expect would be drive C: gets another letter. The diskpart list vol command would show this ig it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(If your PC is not UEFI, the USB has to be instead&nbsp;formatted NTFS and marked Active.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that could be tried is running chkdsk on the SSD C: drive:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /X</p>

</p><p>I see, thank you for confirming. Password reset codes are sent to your account's security info.&nbsp;If you do not have access to it anymore, you have to go through the account verification and recovery process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users first need to prove their ownership of the account by answering a series of question. process before the system grants them access to the account. This was established in the interest of account and data security, meaning that the system will only
 grant access to the user who will be able to pass the verification process. Click
<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/ACSR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> to access the recovery form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll receive an update from our Accounts&nbsp;Specialist within 24-48 hours about the status of your account recovery. They will provide the next steps you need to take to proceed with recovering your account.</p>

<p><span>Here are recovery methods for Windows 7 Home Premium in a rough order of most data preservation &amp; least total aggravation.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If one recovery method cannot be used because its requirements cannot be met then review the next recovery method &amp; so on down the list.<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>Whilst the total content of this thread is necessarily large as it presents every recovery method I have found to be useful,
<b>I have split each procedure up into individual tasks that I believe can be followed with trepidation by any user who is prepared to work carefully through each one sentence by sentence &amp; step by step.</b><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><em>I have repeated common procedures so each recovery method is self-contained except for a small number of explicitly identified procedures provided in external links [as I had no means of testing these particular procedures].

<p><span><em>I tested the draft version of these procedures by using it as my instruction manual when working through each of these recovery methods &amp; precautionary measures.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I used Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 x64; I believe that these procedures are also valid for Windows 7 Home Premium without SP1 and for 32 bit Home Premium.
<span>&nbsp;</span></em></span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></em></span></p>
<p><span>These recovery methods address the issue of Windows 7 logging-in only and assume that you do not have any passwords set up in your BIOS.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you do then you will need to use your BIOS password(s) as you normally would in addition to following the procedures given here.<span>&nbsp;
</span><em>Advice about recovering from problems with these BIOS passwords might be provided by the PC maker’s support sites &amp; forums.</em></span></p>
<p><span>These recovery methods address the issue of Windows logging-in on independent PCs only.
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Users with corporate PCs should consult their IT support section as recovery methods might have already been prepared using enterprise-wide network procedures &amp; tools.</p>
<p>I am not the brains behind these recovery methods or precautionary measures.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have learnt from Windows Help, from <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 Help &amp; How-to</a>, from PC manuals, from threads in this forum and from other internet sites such as
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Seven Forums</a>.<span>&nbsp; </span>
All I’ve done is collate the information into one thread - because personally, when faced with the stressful situation of not being able to login, I do not want to have to search everywhere and cross-check against multiple links in recovery procedures.</p>
<p><span>None of these recovery methods involve any <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Page/faq#faqCodeConduct4">
password cracking</a>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whilst such utilities can apparently be found online, any utility capable of doing this might also be doing something else behind your back such as planting malware to subvert the system or steal information.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Protecting your system against such utilities, and others, is discussed briefly in

<h2>            Issue with Disc-based backwards compatibility </h2>
                    
<p>I don't know if others are having issues with Just Cause 2 trying to use the disc in the Xbox 1 console, but I've recycled the power a few times and still end up with an error message stating "This game isnt playable here, check Xbox.com for a list of backwards
 compatible games." Even though that just cause 2 is on that list of supposed avAilable games for backwards compatibility. I'm curious to find out what the issue is and I would love if someone could help me resolve it, because Xbox support seems to have no
 clue of what the issue is or how to fix it.</p>

            <p>Hey there MINIGEDDY98!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issue with the Just Cause 2 disc! If the issue is continuing to occur, I recommend trying a few troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>First, press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 10 seconds.</span></li>
<li><span>Once your console has powered off, wait a few minutes and then power on &nbsp;your console.</span></li>
<li><span>Insert the Just Cause 2 disc into your Xbox One console and check to see if you are able to install it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If the issue continues after trying the steps above, check out our&nbsp;Backward Compatibility Troubleshooting&nbsp;page for some helpful steps. If the issue persists, go ahead and fill out the survey at the end. Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi Johnny, 
<br />
<br />What’s the exact model of your Inspiron? You are correct, others have had this issue as well. I’ll do whatever I can to help. 
<br />
<br />Grab me the model and we’ll go from there.

            Hello,
<br />Please see the below options:
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

    <title>Unable to check for updates in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arkoprabho chakraborti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to check for updates in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded from Windows 10 10586 to Windows 10 14393 (aka Anniversary update). I am not running the insider&nbsp;builds.&nbsp;Currently I am on Version 1607(OS Build 14393.0). On checking for updates I keep on getting the error that "We couldn't connect to
 the update service. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet". I tried to fix the above problem with the common solutions found around the community.</p>
<p>1. Checked the internet: I checked if it was my internet connection, tried playing videos on YouTube and did a bit of browsing. They all seemed to work fine. Tried to check for updates after closing all the tabs as well. Got the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Used the windows update diagnostic: I tried the windows update fixit. It showed the following to fixes every time without actually fixing anything. I restarted my laptop after this and checked for update again. Didn't help.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5279e11f-eb94-4865-a5df-632ba7eabfc7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5279e11f-eb94-4865-a5df-632ba7eabfc7" /></a></p>
<p>3. Restarted the windows update service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had faced the same problem some time back with Windows 10 10240. Back then the windows diagnostic software seemed to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arkoprabho</p>

            <p>Windows defender updates wont appear in the update list.&nbsp; your winidows should .82 now and windows defender 1.227.620.0. you can keep your old antivirus and just use defender as a scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other Option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The history is not related to the current system status. To check whether Windows is up-to-date, we can have a check with
 Windows Update.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, please understand the information of Windows Update history is in a file and if you would like to delete it, all
 the update history, not just the installation failures will be removed.</span></p>
<p><span>To clear the Windows Update history, please follow the steps below: Does Not remove installed updates only history.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open command prompt:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1) Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2) In the search results list, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3) When you are prompted by User Account Control, click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. At the command prompt, type “net stop WuAuServ” (without quotations) and press Enter.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click Start, type “%windir%” (without quotations) in the Start Search box and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>4. In the opened folder, look for the folder named “SoftwareDistribution” and open it.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Double click the DataStore folder and locate the DataStore.edb file. Right-click on the file, select “Rename” and type
 “DataStoreold” (without quotations) to rename this file.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Open command prompt, type in the command “net start WuAuServ” (without quotations) and press Enter to restart the Automatic
 Updates service. </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Then check if the updates failure history is cleared. This does not remove installed updates.</span></p>
<p><span>It will also reset windows update by restarting it.</span></p>
<p><span>Run the windows update tool and apply the fixes</span></p>

    <title>Windows XP will not get past BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopherkendalls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP will not get past BSOD</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows XP machine that will not go past the BSOD.&nbsp; I tried Safe Mode, Safe Mode with Networking, Safe Mode with Command Prompt, etc, and cannot get into DOS.&nbsp; I did notice when I tried AVG at boot it was able to scan 68% of the drive.&nbsp; It also
 said to remove antivirus and run CHKSCN; the owner removed the antivirus, but did not know how to do CHKSCN.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time I started up the computer it took about 10 minutes to boot up.&nbsp; I open up Google Chrome and it consistently provides write file errors, forces a close, restarts, etc.&nbsp; I could never get a web page to come up on Google Chrome.&nbsp; I was able to
 open up Internet Explorer, but it hung when I went to install Microsoft Security Essentials.&nbsp; I looked up the write file errors, and told Windows to choose what was best for my computer; the user had the cache and page file set to 2 GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long story short, I reboot the computer and I cannot get past the BSOD.&nbsp; So my question is, can I use a CD with MS DOS to boot into DOS, scan the disk and have it fix any errors it finds automatically and then successfully get into Windows or, can I use
 someone's recovery disc to fix the computer.&nbsp; The only problem about using a recovery disc, is that I do not have a registration key I can use.&nbsp; I was even going to go as far as purchase a recovery disc online for $12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this laptop has deeper issues that successfully booting into Windows cannot fix I do not want to waste my time; I really do not want to waste my money either.&nbsp; I know I can use a Live CD and retrieve the files using Linux but the user is more interested
 in getting into their computer than they are retrieving the data.</p>

Hi Christopher, <br />
<br />
There are hundreds an different Stop errors (blue screens) each of which contain data which points to the cause of the problem.
<br />
<br />
To identify the cause, we need that data. <br />
<br />
Here is a typical picture of one: <a href="http://stlpcfix.com/articles/images/bluescreenofdeath.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://stlpcfix.com/articles/images/bluescreenofdeath.jpg<br />
</a><br />
The important info as far as we're concerned is listed under <b>Technical Information</b> about 2/3rds of the way down and will comprise of the Stop error code and the name of the file causing it.
<br />
<br />
In the screenshot, the error code is <b>0x000000D1 </b>and the file causing it is
<b>gv3.sys</b><br />
<br />
You need to post the data which shows on your own BSOD from that location. <br />
<br />
If it doesn't stay on the screen long enough for you to note down the details and you own a digital camera, take a picture of it and then you can read the data from that.
<br />

    <title>Pinpointing Faulty Driver Causing Memory BSODs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mksaga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pinpointing Faulty Driver Causing Memory BSODs</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wanted to get some advice on pinpointing which driver is faulty on my machine. I recently built a desktop, installed Windows 10 on it (specs are in the OneDrive folder linked below).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep running into BSODs while using the machine after powering it on- it typically happens while I'm playing Overwatch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, they varied widely- I got errors like:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>kmode exception not handled</li><li>driver_irql not less or equal</li><li>driver overran stack buffer</li><li>attempted execute of noexecute memory</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After doing some reading, I realized it was a memory issue, and using the Windows Debugging Tool I found that they were probably caused by wdf01000.sys, but wasn't able to go farther than that. I messaged the MS support, they recommended reinstalling Windows-
 I did, and it was fine for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it's starting to come back... but I would get an error saying "memory management" as soon as the lock screen appeared. I ran the Windows memory diagnostic, but that came out clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enabled the Driver Verifier for all non-Windows driver and went through the "clean boot" procedure (went into system configuration, disabled all non-Windows services from startup and disabled everything under startup in task manager). Now everything is
 fine- but when I power down my computer, it shows me a BSOD with an error code, "driver verifier found faulty driver" -&nbsp;<em>but it won't tell me which one.</em> As of now, I have a working desktop with a faulty driver currently disabled lurking somewhere...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After going through this clean boot process, I noticed that as soon as I started my keyboard software (Logitech Gaming Software 8.91), I'd get a BSOD with the error "system exception thread not handled"- so I uninstalled that, but the Driver Verifier is
 still showing the BSOD when I power down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So: I am relatively sure that one of my drivers is faulty, cause the RAM test came out clean. I want to pinpoint which driver is causing these crashes, but I don't know how other than enabling them upon startup one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Followed the procedures mentioned in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">

            HI,<br />
<br />
One of the minidumps was 0 bytes however it is not needed.<br />
<br />
Yes one of the minidumps indicated <strong>Lgbusenum.sys</strong>&nbsp;Logitech WingMan was involved.<br />
<br />
The other one from Driver Verifier showed no driver issue. So you should disable Driver Verifier which can cause instability when there would otherwise be none which I suspect is the case here.<br />
<br />
Be sure you check with ADATA for any firmware updates for your SSD drive. And keep checking every month or so.<br />
<br />
Ensure you are running the latest<strong> BIOS</strong>, <strong>chipset drivers</strong>, and the
<strong>major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>. That means check at ASUS and the individual device makers' sites such as NVidia and Realtek.<br />
(See how to update major driver below.) I can't emphasize enough to you the importance of this because new components usually come with early stage or even beta drivers and firmware.<br />

<br />
If you have not done so after building the unit remove all power then reseat all cards, memory, and cables. That alone solves a lot of issue with home builds.<br />
<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : <br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -<strong>&nbsp;set
</strong><br />
<strong>VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and<br />
<strong>BIOS and chipset drivers</strong>).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Xbox Live is extremely laggy and slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> interzonal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live is extremely laggy and slow</h2>
                    
<p>I've been having some trouble over the past few days. My Xbox Live connection has always been fine, and I've played games with minimal lag (provided I choose specific servers, as I'm in South Africa) However in the last 3 days or so, my connection to Xbox
 Live has become extremely slow. On startup, the Xbox takes about 2 minutes just to sign into Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Usually when I test the connection, the connection between internet and Xbox Live was very quick, it connected in about a second. Now while testing, that connection takes a good minute or so. Every server on every game has terrible lag, to the point where
 I can't even move my character in Battlefield.</p>
<p>The connection is ok, as everything works at normal speed on my pc, but the xbox is increasingly slow with the connection to Live. Is there any way I can speed up the xbox? (I'm on capped internet, so not having to clear cache would be a big bonus, as it
 would be a lot of updates to re-download)</p>
<p>I have a 1mb line, in case that matters to anyone. But I've never had problems like this before, and suddenly this has started.</p>
<p>Reply asap please, this is really ruining my gaming :c</p>

    <title>Why Black Ops suck - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fs2097  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Black Ops suck</h2>
                    
<p>Hit marker problem: how many times do you actually have to shoot you enemy before he dies? Like 15/20 bullets? While if you knife him he dies instantly. Almost 5 out of the 10 times when I shoot some one from close range, I get hit markers but when he knives
 me I die. Thats not realistic, that simply just SUCK. The weapons are under powered while the knive does the most damage, they should fix that *** up. Why cant they do it like Infinity Ward did in MW2? You kill an enemy with 1 or 3 bullets is it really that
 hard for Treyarch?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Quickscope/Noobtube: this is just crap and unrealistic, they should limit the sniper and grenade launchers up per team. Like 3 snipers per team only. I have no idea which douchebag came up with this idea, only people who lack skills usually do this.
<br />
<br />
Connection problems/lag switches: Yes we still live in 2011 but can you f&amp;^* believe it there are still people with a **** connection from the 90ties? Why I complain about this? Well it seems like you need to put more bullets in a lagger before he dies, and
 in my opinion thats not fair. Stop leeching you neighbours connection and get a decent connection.<br />
<br />
Players teleport over the whole map because they use a lag switch, they lag the whole game except theirs so they take advantage over other players. Still, why don't they have an auto kick feature for people with slow connection? Like a limit, if you connection
 speed goes over a couple m/s then you will be auto kicked. So all the people who use a lag switch will be kicked out of the server and the players with a good connection will still able to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
Emblems: the emblem feature is nearly the crappiest *** I ever could imagine. It's just stupid and it just doesn't make sense at all. It just took them so many time to make that useless function instead they could put more time in their retarted game engine.
 Why didn't they just use the same engine like the one from the MW series? <br />
<br />
Treyarch are being a bunch of hypocrites! If you have played Call of Duty World at War MP then you know how many modders/hackers there are. Treyarch doesn't want to patch the game and let the MS moderators do all the banning stuff. If Treyarch would release
 a patch for this game then it all would be okay (for a while maybe), but people would think twice before they going to cheat again. Why do I mention this? Well, you know that in Black Ops you can report gamers, you also can report them for cheating. What happens
 if you report them? MS Moderators will get a message so they will investigate it. Basically Treyarch knows that people will mod their game in the future, but if they have released a new CoD title they wont give a dime about BO anymore. So all the complaints
 will go to MS while Treysuck will laugh about the gamers.</p>

<p>Your so wrong on so many levels. Where to start? OK, here goes nothing. 1st paragraph-- Yeah, IW had a great knifing system in MW2, LOL, have you been Commando knifed? MW2s knifing was worse, just saying. 2nd paragraph--QSing nor tubing is a problem in BOs
 and again, have you played MW2? Everyone was QSing (and it was way easier in MW2) AND the tubes with OMA and Danger Close made tubes a HUGE problem in MW2................/facepalm. 3rd paragraph---Intrawebs and connections are problems, but whos? Lag causes
 some WTF moments for sure. 4th paragraph--- I have seen a lag switch in BOs, but only one maybe two in over 29 days played in the MP, so Id say its not a big problem. Report the player, switch lobbies and game on. 5th paragraph--- The emblems were taken to
 new lows with this community for sure, but I have seen some great ones also. 6th paragraph--- TA has done a great job with post release support. Report anything suspicious and game on. BTW, M$ will not ban anyone for anything happening within the game, that
 falls on the developer (TA) to handle.</p>

<p>I'm not going to argue about quickscoping because people are going to do it whether you like it or not. They shouldn't limit the number of grenade launchers and sniper rifles per team because you'd be guaranteed people who intended to mess with it would
 take the available slots and then make sure to not use the items. Snipers might need to quickscope in Call of Duty because of the nature of the game. It's fast-paced and you don't always get a chance to pull your pistol out, so you may as well go down with
 a roll of the dice. Grenade launchers in Modern Warfare 2 were bad, but I have no problem with them in Black Ops because they're fairly ineffective outside a very short range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You always do need to shoot someone who is lagging more, because hitting them is going to be different to hitting someone on a perfect connection as the game tries to keep it as best as possible. I rarely need to hit someone more than five times with an
 automatic rifle - and that's where the difference is. It's an automatic so five shots are nothing. I rarely meet someone who actually wins due to lag. As often as not they are at a disadvantage themselves, because where enemies are shown on their screen can
 be misleading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't like the emblems system, fair enough. It's a cool system apart from the community ruining it with offensive imagery. Beyond that it's a cool system and it lets people do a lot more with their game than previous titles offered. The game does
 use the same engine as Call of Duty 4, so if you're assuming the engine is 'retarted' then congratulations, you've managed to complain about the engine that also powered World at War and helped create Modern Warfare 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are hackers on World at War because the game is easy to exploit. Sad, but true. Treyarch likely do want to patch the game. In fact, Treyarch
<em>did </em>patch the game a while back, and it killed off hacking for a few days. Due to the nature of the community though, it was circumvented and now the hacks are as rampant as ever. The report system in Black Ops is also managed by Treyarch themselves,
 as opposed to Microsoft. Microsoft do not ban players from individual games. Treyarch can ban people from their game, and the reason the feature was included was to counter the hacks that appeared from JTAG consoles in Modern Warfare 2. If they can be flagged
 up they can be killed off sooner, and as a result any hacks (if there even were any) are short-lived. I'll give you your dues, though. In the entire rant you made, you didn't start going on about Activision. Most people tend to do that, so props for bucking
 the trend. I'll disagree with you but I can still attempt to see your side.</p>

<p>the one and only problem i have with this game is the fact it lets people play it split screen. 9 times out of 10 it seems they want to play split screen on a 13 inch tv and both players almost always go 2-33 in tdm or get 0 captures and defends in domination.
 not to mention if theirs more than one split screener in a lobby it should split them up, not put them on the same teams cause all that ends up being is a easy win or easy loss depending which side has them. if it must allow split screeners at least make them
 reach a certain rank or even hit the prestiege once, that or they should only be able to play in a select lobby with other split screeners. all in all this is by far one of the better cods other than 4. if you have a list of complaints for a game like you
 do, your just not good and should quit playing the game. don't come post crap about a game thats the most recent game your playing and talk crap and continue to play it.</p>

<p>If two little explosive projectiles really mess up your game that bad maybe you should use flak jacket. Quick scoping is almost the only way to get a high kill count with a sniper rifle. I know because quick scopers have annoyed me too, because they were
 killing me every time i turned around. </p>
<p>The knife problem is terrible, they should put a delay on your ability to knife after being hit. The maps have to many close quarters to not make the gun the better weapon in every situation except stealth.
</p>
<p>Lag does throw me off alot. I have a schitzo connection four bars one match two bars the next, don't know why. when i have two bars i do very poorly. When my connection is slow i can pretty much only get kills from behind. Hit markers suck when its like
 that. But it's not Treyarchs fault and i don't think i should be punished any more then i already am for having a spotty connection.
</p>
<p>Treyarch has patched pretty much everything they have ever had a complaint about. I've been playing long enough to have noticed the nerfing of every gun, and the erradication of exploitable glitches. I have only seen one lag switcher and i reported him,
 that's with plenty of play time logged. Never seen aim bot. People who do poorly will always find a scape goat.</p>
<p>Heres an example of why MW2 is ten billion times worse then black ops. A true story.</p>
<p>Started a domination match, ran to C flag, got there and it exploded, watched the kill cam looked to me like a cannon ball with a white towl rapped around it. I've only been playing online for a few months so I played black ops before Mw2 so I was like "that
 had to have been luck" went after C again same thing happened. Me being naive I was "Like well he's out of ammo now" went after C again same thing. That entire match some guy was shooting an endless wave of grenades at the C flag killing anyone who tried to
 capture it. I have only ever once been able to blindly launch a grenade at a flag and get a kill in Black ops. I have seen the home flag in MW2 bombarded constantly in many matches that's why i only play black ops. But still have hope for MW3.</p>

            <p>Can you check that the headset is working "locally" by opening up Messages on the console, and trying to compose a message to a friend (you don't send the message, so it doesn't matter who you try to message).&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of typing the message, press the microphone button, and try to speak into your headset microphone.&nbsp;</p><p>Does the microphone pick up your voice? Can you listen to your voice when you listen to your own message?</p><p><br /></p><p>When you say the console isn't recognizing any of them: Does the console at least play sound via the headphones? Or are they not detected at all?</p><p>Can you check in the Xbox Accessories app, that your controller has the most up-to-date firmware?</p><p><br /></p><p>Also, check if the headsets work on a smartphone. Be aware, that on Apple smartphones, the ground pin and microphone pin are reversed. So if you can hear sound from your headset, but the microphone isn't working, go to any phone shop (or online) and look for an OMTP to CTIA
