<h2>            Error c1900101 - 2000c When Trying to Install&#47;Upgrade from 7 pro to 10 pro</h2>
                    <p>I have a full version of Windows 7 and have been eligible for my upgrade which I decided to do yesterday. &nbsp;I first went the route of upgrading through Windows update and after the computer restarted and went into the safe OS phase of the update, I received
 the new Windows 10 BSOD which stated IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL. &nbsp;Windows 7 was restored and I was given the error code c1900101 - 2000c.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a little research and saw a few posts stating that anti virus software should be disabled (preferably uninstalled) and all USB devices should be removed before upgrading to avoid any conflict. &nbsp;I followed these steps and tried again to upgrade from
 7 to 10. &nbsp;I got the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this, I used the media creation tool and put the setup on a USB. &nbsp;I used the USB setup to see if this worked instead of the Windows update. &nbsp;Same problem and error code. &nbsp;Just this time the, 'Get Windows 10' icon in the taskbar disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;What does the error code mean for me and is there a work around for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;I am going to be getting a new desktop within the next couple of months. &nbsp;If and when I am able to get my free upgrade for 7 to 10 on this current desktop and I get a new desktop, will I still be able to install 10 on the new one (will I be given a product
 key after upgrading from 7 - 10 on my current desktop)? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Desktop Specs:</p>
<p>CPU: &nbsp;Intel Core i5 760 @ 2.8 GHz</p>
<p>GPU: &nbsp;GeForce GTX 980 Ti</p>
<p>Memory: &nbsp;6 GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Most of what I want to see is original Xbox games. Outrun 2 CtC and Jet Set Radio Future are more I’d like to see. Outrun is probably never coming because of licensing but I have to think SEGA’s catalog will come eventually.

<p>Microsoft will want to bring as many games as possible to backwards compatibility, but it isn't up to them to allow it, it is the game developers / publishers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should contact them to request that they allow it. There can also be restrictions on licensed content within the games that prevent this from happening no matter how much they want it.</p>

            Hi Dorothy
<br />
<br />If you want to remove those from your hard drive, you need to clear out the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download  folder . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />Leave Command prompt open
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer, on the View ribbon, temporarily turn on 'Hidden Items'
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download 
<br />
<br />Delete the entire contents of the Download folder
<br />
<br />Close File Explorer
<br />
<br />In Command Prompt, run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />When that completes, close Command Prompt and restart your PC

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Ruined My Computer and Now After Reinstall I Can&#39;t Even Reactivate It.</h2>
                    During a routine automatic update done by Microsoft on my Windows 10 version, it failed to install properly.&nbsp; This was the free upgrade from my Windows 7 version that came with my computer.&nbsp; After failing I was blocked from my personal windows user account
 saying it couldn't sign in to my Microsoft account and thus I was given a "temporary" user account.&nbsp; It no longer had my personal account.&nbsp; Trying all possible ways to fix it, including trying to re-download the updates that failed, as well as using other
 solutions posted online (like making another personal account, which worked for my sister cause this same problem happened to her not 2 weeks later, though hers' didn't corrupt, which I guess makes the difference), nothing worked.&nbsp; I was then forced to try
 and use a restore point.&nbsp; This COMPLETELY destroyed my computer!&nbsp; Apparently the combo of failed update and restore point had basically corrupted/de-installed Windows from my computer and now it w

            Hi VSor. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />
The problem is that you inserted your Windows 7 key to reinstall which messed up reactivation.&nbsp; When you originally Upgraded from Windows 7 -even if you used your Windows 7 key to first activate -&nbsp; your PC was issued a permanent Digital License stored in MS
 Activation servers to compare with whenever you reinstall. <br />
<br />
If there is any other key than the generic Version key entered it will never activate until that key is restored. Copy and paste it from this link into Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key:
<a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>. Give it a day or two to phone home and activate, as long as you're sure you reinstalled the licensed version.&nbsp; If not contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:&nbsp; https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/<br />
<br />
If accounts were corrupted on two of your home computers then it might be something you're installing or doing. What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run
 Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>. It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />
There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:

<p>I checked the Windows 10 digital code I have right now and it matches the generic one provided for Windows 10 Pro, which is currently installed on my computer as it was the only available one at the time.&nbsp; However, I am not sure if Windows 10 Pro was the
 one I had installed originally.&nbsp; It was the free upgrade version.&nbsp; Was that Windows 10 Home, and if so how do I get it without paying for it?&nbsp; In addition, whenever I interact with Windows, including troubleshooting the digital code error message,&nbsp; which is
</p>
Error code: 0xC004F012
<p>it says to check if I am connected to the internet.&nbsp; Plus the internet icon on the bottom right of the start bar as well as the network&amp;sharing center think I am not connected to the internet.&nbsp; Yet I am typing this right now on my computer via the Firefox
 browser which does think I am connected.&nbsp; Is this problem contributing to my issues or only linked to the activation process?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the clean install it looks really tempting but I'm worried I won't be able to retrieve my drivers.&nbsp; Will they be okay?&nbsp; And I'm assuming I can't use the clean install until I resolve this problem anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not 100% sure whats going on at my end in my home but I have 2 big suspects, other than bad luck.&nbsp; One is that we do play MMORPG's and mine happened to crash at that very moment I was playing one.&nbsp; And no I had told Windows to NOT upgrade at that time,
 but later.&nbsp; It did it anyway, freezing my computer and forcing me to reboot it.&nbsp; However my sister was NOT playing the game and it did the same and locked her out.&nbsp; She just didn't get a total wipe out. The other most likely suspect is that we have really
 spotty internet connection that goes from consistent to unusable for days at a time.&nbsp; On that day it had been working well but its always a gamble.&nbsp; The bad connection is mostly the providers fault but might also be our landlord who has noise interference
 in the electrical wiring.&nbsp; Not sure if that had anything to do with it, with my luck it did.&nbsp; The other outside contender is the fact that my sister's computer may have gone into sleep mode or both computer's hardware is almost 5 years old.&nbsp; The thing with
 the age theory though is that 1) I cant keep buying computer's every 5 years, is there a way to block some of these compromising updates 2) not sure this even holds water as my Toshiba is ALSO 5 years old and works just fine</p>

            Yes, you need to install the licensed version.   Home is by far the most common and those who have Pro usually know it because it costs extra even if it comes preinstalled from factory.  So chances are your Digital License is for home and you need to reinstall Home to activate with the DL.  
<br />
<br />You can always reinstall Windows as often as you want.  Just make sure you reinstall the licensed version and follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>Hm I'll first try to confirm if I did or didn't have Pro.&nbsp; Honestly I am one of those who wouldn't remember.&nbsp; My brain was rather frizzled back when I was busy buying things to replace what was lost.&nbsp; However I do know from experience that I have always
 preferred Pro over Home so if I could have got it, I would have.&nbsp; However it is possible I wasn't able to, so if I don't get results I will just reinstall Home instead.&nbsp; Hopefully that will work.&nbsp; However as for the root cause of this, meaning auto updates,
 does the clean version not have this issue? Or do I have to continue to watch out for repeat incidents?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know if I am successful.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the help till now.</p>

            In Windows 10 what matters most is the quality of the install, so once a great install is in place almost no one suffers further from Update disasters.  They can still be annoying however, but are more within your ability to control.  Every way possible to manage Windows Updates is compiled here:

    <title>Why Doesn&#39;t Cortana Sing Songs Anymore&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m brumback  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Doesn&#39;t Cortana Sing Songs Anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I ask Cortana to sing me a song, she just pulls up a Bing search.&nbsp; This has only been recent, seeing as she would sing a song before today.&nbsp; However, now when I ask her to sing, she doesn't.&nbsp; I'm using Windows 10 and whenever I search to try to
 find answers, my question isn't listed.&nbsp; I've tried using the system file checker, but it told me nothing was wrong.&nbsp; If the singing was removed from Cortana for an update, please bring it back.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; She still tells me jokes, weather, and does searches,
 but she doesn't sing anymore.&nbsp; Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Fun while it lasted, yes ... but I doubt it's coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft announced that Cortana is being 'demoted,' if I can use that term. Clearly, Cortana is no match for Google Now or Alexa, and even Microsoft has recognized this. Rather than making Cortana an all-purpose digital assistant, her future role will be
 limited to helping users navigate and use their software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana will be a separate app available to any developer who wants to use 'her' for that purpose. You can count on seeing Cortana in that role with Microsoft Office in the near future. If you remember Clippy ... ah, yes ... Cortana is Clippy with a voice
 and AI.</p>

            Well, this is strange...it seems that Cortana wasn't singing songs for just that one day.&nbsp; She sings now, so I suppose it could've been a temporary problem, I hope.

<p>i would &nbsp;try &nbsp;while the &nbsp;console &nbsp;is on and at the dashboard to &nbsp;unplug the hdmi &nbsp;cable from the &nbsp;back of the xbox &nbsp;and wait a few &nbsp;seconds &nbsp;and then &nbsp;replug it in if your dashboard reapears and &nbsp;it pops up &nbsp;hdcp &nbsp;connected &nbsp;then you should be connected
 properly if not &nbsp;then you probably have a faulty hdmi &nbsp;cable this can happen on any type of cable &nbsp;where as things look ok on some stuff &nbsp;but if the cable is bad will get &nbsp;shotty &nbsp;quality or no quality &nbsp;because the cable &nbsp;cant handle it &nbsp;if you got a cheap
 hdmi &nbsp;cable this may be the case since twisting and moving them around &nbsp;can cause a failure rate &nbsp;heck even plugging and unplugging them in a bit &nbsp;can do it. &nbsp; but as posted before try to see if you can use a different cable and if you can and everything pans
 out then your hdmi cable is crap </p>

<p>Borrowed a friends HDMI cable and no difference. Unplugged the cable as suggested by Krazy2768 it did not give any message about the HDCP. Went in to Netflix and started it anyway and after the screen went black I unplugged the HDMI cable and then when I
 plugged it in got a message about secure HDCP connection established and worked fine. But after reboot of xbox black screen again. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox HDMI faulty</h2>
                    I was playing xbox through my HDMI cable and I accidentally kicked my xbox on the floor. The HDMI viewing did not work from then on, any ideas? I'm pretty certain the HDMI port is broken

<p>Try using other cables such as Component or Composite to be sure the whole thing isn't broken. Sorry to hear about the accident! I hope it survived. :-/ If it is just the HDMI port you could always send it in for repair, or buy a new one.</p>

<h2>            Issues with updates KB 2518864 KB 2572073 KB 2633880</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft People,</p>
<p>I am having difficulty with Windows XP Updates, specifically:</p>
<p>KB 2518864<br />
KB 2572073 and<br />
KB 2633880</p>
<p>In spite of their appearing to be satisfactorily installed, they return for reinstalling
</p>
<p>time after time.&nbsp; I have tried various solutions documented on the net.</p>
<p>The two machines producing this problems both have SP3.&nbsp; One is XP Pro, one is XP Home.</p>
<p>These files have been installed via Automatic Updates, Windows Update, and by manually
</p>
<p>downloading and installing.&nbsp; (The last was suggested on the net to be done in safe mode, but
</p>
<p>none of them will instal in safe mode.)</p>
<p>Windows Explorer, running Windows Update, shows them as successfully installed.<br />
No log file (%windir%\KBnnnnnnn.log) is generated by any of them.<br />
They do not show as installed in Control Panel / Add &amp; Remove Programmes.</p>
<p>Along with other suggestions, I have tried<br />
- running Microsoft Safety Scanner (no errors found)<br />
- running CHKDSK on the main drives (ibid)<br />
- running MicrosoftFixit.wu.FISC.80261113661526509.6.1.Run.exe<br />
- running MicrosoftFixit50202.msi</p>
<p>The last of these did nothing in normal mode, and crashed with error code 2755 on attempting
</p>
<p>to run in aggressive mode.</p>
<p>I am unable to set these updates as hidden, as they are high security updates.</p>
<p>My customer with these problems is not enjoying them much, and I would appreciate your
</p>
<p>advice please.</p>
<p>Chester Wilson,<br />
&lt;removed&gt;<br />

            No changes other than usual Microsoft upgrades.<br />
<br />
However . . . I have fixed it!&nbsp; Yay!<br />
<br />
No idea whether this will be useful to others with this problem, but here goes:<br />
<br />
The 3 problem updates were all Net 2.0 SP2 related.<br />
I went in to Add/Remove programmes (with Show Updates checked), and removed all upgrades<br />
from now back to the end of 2010 (a total of 3).<br />
<br />
I then clicked on the Automatic Update icon, and for the umpteenth time reinstalled the three problem updates.<br />
<br />
Then back to Windows Update where the updates I had deleted were found and reinstalled.<br />
<br />
Hey Presto!&nbsp; The previously problematical updates showed as installed, the ones deleted earlier in this exercise showed as installed, and the updater is happy.<br />
<br />
I hope this is some use to some other poor bunny with similar problems!<br />
<br />
[I was going to ask about a Net 2.0 &amp; 3.5 upgrade which when installed with any other upgrades made the paging file go up to 5.82Gb and 4.7Gb on 2 machines respectively, and ground the system to a thrashing halt, but installing it one upgrade at a time, with
 a reboot in between each upgrade, got around that one!]<br />

    <title>MSVCR80.DLL not found - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MSVCR80.DLL not found</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently did an update to Windows 8.1 and now I am unable to view any pictures (pictureviewer) as it gives me an error message: "The program can't start because &nbsp;MSVCR80.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem".
 I have tried other suggestions provided in other threads:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;(Follow these methods:</div>
<p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong>Let’s try to register the MSVCR80.dll file and check. Follow the steps to register the .dll file.</p>
<p>a. Click on Start menu button and type in ‘cmd’ in the start search box.</p>
<p>b. Right click on ‘cmd’ and click on ‘Run as Administrator’.</p>
<p>c. Type ‘regsvr32 MSVCR80.DLL’ in the ‘cmd’ prompt and press enter.</p>
<p>d. Now, the DLL file will register on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:&nbsp;</strong>If that does not help, I would suggest you to perform SFC scan and check if it the issue persists..</p>
<p><br />
The SFC /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>For more information how to do SFC/ scan, please follow this link:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong>&nbsp;I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
</p>
<strong>Note:</strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>None of these suggestions is fixing the problem. I am getting increasingly frustrated. Please help!</div>

    <title>Xbox One takes way too long to boot up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One takes way too long to boot up</h2>
                    
<p>It's been a couple of weeks I haven't touched my Xbox One and <span>&nbsp;I was in the mood of playing some Forza 6, so I turned on the power and my TV screen only started to show the sign-in screen until after almost an hour of waiting, the sign-in seems to
 take almost forever so I turned off the power and turn on the console again. Now I have to repeat an hour long of waiting for the console to boot up. What could've possibly gone wrong with my Xbox One and what can I do?</span></p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Obviously your console is downloading and updating. Since you haven't turned on the console in a long period of time, you can choose to download and install updates when your Xbox turn off can save you a lot of time when booting up by choosing a direct power
 mode visit this link to see how you can change that. <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/learn-about-power-modes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi SMPINFIDELIS93,</p>
<p>Sorry you're console is taking so long to boot. If you have instant on, it could just be "stuck". With the console on hold the power button down for about 8 seconds until it turns off. After it's off turn it back on and see if it books.</p>
<p>Did you see an update screen or something of that nature? If so try following <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>hi i have a problem and need help. iv had my xbox 1 for about &nbsp;just over a year or so. i dont play online and the last time i was online was when i first set up my console. i was playing fallout 4 and when i fast travelled to another settlement this one
 time it took forever to load and then this error came up saying my game save files arnt synced. i switched it off and then on again and i had lost all my game save files for all my games. i had to start forza 6 again and after some playing it happened again.

<p>Sorry you're having issues with your console. It sounds like your issue is a bit different than the OP's. So the community can best help with your exact issue, I would suggest creating a thread of your own.

<p>Hi SMPINFIDELIS93,</p>
<p>Just to make sure I have the whole idea of what's going on, when you says sign in are you referring to boot time, or the actual sign in for your account? If it's your account, then try removing it and then adding it back by
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/security/remove-profile-from-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this process</a>. If that doesn't work I'd recommend a full factory reset. If the Xbox is slow booting and you've tried the steps I first posted, I would also recommend a factory reset. &nbsp;Follow
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
these steps</a> to perform the reset. Provided you keep your Xbox connected to the internet, your saves should be backed up. You will need to reinstall your games after this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>

<p>yes same game&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;no consoles are not in the same place xbox is much closer to router and has 1 wall between them. ps4 is on other side of house between ps4 &amp; router is 3 walls, a/c, xbox1s, &amp; smart tv and a regular flat screen tv</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;yes via wifi. tried using hardline didn't make a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;been dealing with this &amp; other similar issues for over a year now. have spent hours on phone with xbox EA and my ISP they just blame it on each other and of course it's never the one ur talking to that is at fault&nbsp; done all basic troubleshooting countless
 times have removed and re-added account have even reset my console a few times reset router had my xbox dmz got a list of ports from EA that needed needed me to contact my ISP and make sure that specific ones were open I could understand it being my ISP fault,
 however if was my ISP wouldn't it take just as long for the/an/any other install? any other info I left out or that u may need let me know&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Have you tried a different router? Or you can go in and set priority to different devices. You can look up your specific router online and get steps how to set priority. I in past had a router that couldn't handle more than one console either. I had to get

</p><p>I have not tried a different router. I thought about it, but then I thought about it. And i don't think that it is the problem. If it was the problem my ps4 would have the same issues when it comes to downloading or installing which it doesn't and i can't
 afford to waste money on a new if i need to buy something else. And i had my isp&nbsp; dmz my xbox so it has priority</p>

            The problem is with MS guys.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Im in the same boat<br />
<br />
I didnt pay 700$ (cad+tax) for a console that takes 6+ hours to download a game. Its pathetic really, please get this fixed and stop telling customers its their problem. this is widespread as can be. more forum threads than I care to count regarding this. Accept
 MS has an issue and maybe it will actually be addressed.

Yes I have. EA emailed me a list of ports that they wanted me to contact my isp (att) and have them verify that certain ports were open. I call and asked and they didn't even know what I was talking about they transferred my call to their support specialist
 (which cost me idk how much) only to tell me that said ports were already open, he then dmz my Xbox after telling him not to since i had already done that which is why all ports were open in the first place</p>

</p><p>Hey buddy! Your Xbox profile only applies if your signed into an Xbox app or an Xbox. Your Microsoft account also has a option for you to program it to a phone for phone number and contact pictures and videos, but doesn't apply unless your signed into a
 Microsoft phone. Same as the Xbox profile. Only way to disassociate is to delete the account entirely.</p>

            Hi Abhay
<br />
<br />Did you follow these steps to calibrate the screen?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/calibrate-monitor-color-display-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/calibrate-moni...</a>
<br />
<br />Information in the above link is sourced from a trusted Microsoft MVP blog.
<br />
<br />If you did, I recommend the next option is to uninstall and reinstall your display driver:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart

            it has two options intel UHD graphics and NVIDIA GE force 940mx idont think uninstalling one of these is a good idea after all I paid for one of these also , I think the color ratio numbers in high contrast settings would do it right If I setit right bcz
 I messed it up by setting my own numbers ....&nbsp;

            Uninstalling either would reinstall the driver automatically. Another option is to try performing a system restore. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point before the problem started.

<h2>            Is it possible to keep google off my P.C completely&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Google has been infletrated by hackers and there is so many fakes and problems with them. I am a victom of the problems there having my email was hacked&nbsp; anbak and the pass word was changed . I have no way to recover my account other than make a new one
 with them . I refuse to do anything with google bcause of this .They have no tech support no number to call. The site recomends to use another e-mail to recover the old one. That makes me very un confortable for the obviouse reasons of then they will have
 not only one email account with lots of info but two. Google needs to fix this problem while there is still a chance to save there buissness it seems. How backwerds is it to have a no way to communicate with them if there is a problem other log on to the acount
 .If was able to log on I would not have those problems now would I. Another note behind these fake sites also know as Trojans , if you asked if you want a new spy wear or virus protection that then proceeds to want you to pay for it. Major red flag its a fake,
 were some person or should i say persons are about to steal your credit card numbers even worse bank acount numbers that were givin to them and then they proceed to going on major shopping sprees online , sending the products to closed buisnesses forclosed
 homes via UPS mail or other private delivery services. Not cool if you ask me so be very cautiouse what you do these days better yet if you do not know if the site is a real or fake do not use it......</p>

            <p>Yes. Don't use anything Google. I don't like Google particularly and I keep my Google&nbsp;use restricted to Blogger&nbsp;and Youtube only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is NOT the fault of Google that your password was blitzed. Passwords are the Google users responsibility, not Google the company. You need to devise a method for constructing passwords which user upper and lower case alphabet and which also includes
 numeric characters.&nbsp;The important part is that you remember them. They should be at least eight&nbsp;characters long..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infected websites are found in ALL search engines, not just Google. Regardless of what others may tell you, IE 9 is fast and it protects you as much as it can from rogue websites. Add a good quality anti-virus solution,&nbsp;a bit of extra help from the likes
 of Malwarebytes, and common sense and you will be protected well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a>&nbsp;.. when you install this, don't install the TSR which gives you 24/7 cover. Your Anti-virus solution shoud be doing that..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good quality anti-virus solution should not stop normal operation of a computer's functions. It should not be invasive, but it should tell you what's going down when it is important that you know. In my opinion, there are two solutions which fit the bill.</p>
<ul>
<li>ESET NOD32 v. 5 if you prefer paid solutions.. <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/</a></li><li>Microsoft Security Essentials if you prefer a free solution.. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/mse.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/mse.aspx</a></li></ul>
<p>Both work well, are not invasive, and they alert you when you need to know. BUT, they will not protect you if you keep opening the door and inviting 'too good to be true' stuff in. This is where common sense works best..

    <title>Windows 10 Update Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garywmck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Failure</h2>
                    <p>I experienced a failure of the most recent Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>Now, each time I attempt to reboot, I first get the message "Your PC experienced a problem and needs to restart".&nbsp;The restart puts me in an auto repair mode, which also fails, taking me to "Reset PC" and "Advanced Options".&nbsp; Neither option has been able
 to recover my system; specifically attempting to go back to a recovery point fails, attempts to reset fail, and attempts to "repair" Windows from a USB key (the system fails to find a working version of Windows to "repair") have all failed.</p>
<p>However, using the command screen I have been able to view file directories.&nbsp; That has lead me to a list of ".rtb" extension files.&nbsp; After some hunting, I found information that suggests that these files are to permit the system to be rolled back to its
 original state, if the update fails.&nbsp; Clearly this didn't happen, but the files still exist.</p>
<p>Is there any way to use these files to recover all or part of my earlier setup?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, a clarification: the PC in question is non functional right now, I am reading and replying using a different machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the link provided to a "Download Windows 10" web page.&nbsp; I have been here before as part of my earlier efforts to resolve the issue.&nbsp; I have used the "Download Tool Now" button to create update media, following the directions "Using the tool to
 create installation media to install Windows 10 on a different PC".&nbsp; From there I followed two slightly different paths, with the same results to both.</p>
<p>1) Initially I came to this page following instructions that involved using another piece of software to create an "ISO" file on a USB drive (tried that).<br />
2) However, while downloading the tool, I also noted an option to create&nbsp;USB media files directly. I have done this as well, so I have two USB drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure that there is any difference in the files created by either method as I have tried both and they seem to function in the same manner.&nbsp; Using&nbsp;each of the&nbsp;USB drives, I have attempted the following:</p>
<p>1) Boot as normal, going through the error message and automatic repair to the "Command Prompt" option in "Advanced Options", then running "Setup" from the USB.&nbsp; This goes through a&nbsp;setup screen to&nbsp;an "Install" option.&nbsp; I have so far avoided this option
 out of concern that it will "uninstall" other software and data files.&nbsp; Although I have File History backups of data, much of the software was downloaded so I am without physical media.</p>
<p>2) Change boot options to boot directly from the USB drive.&nbsp; This also goes through&nbsp;the same&nbsp;setup screen but the "Install" screen now includes a "Repair" option.&nbsp; Selecting that resulted in options to "Continue to Windows 10 Pro" (seems to take me back
 to square 1), "Troubleshoot", or "Turn Off".&nbsp; "Troubleshoot" -&gt; "Startup Repair" -&gt; "Choose a Target" -&gt; Windows 10 Pro goes into a "diagnosing" mode which returns "Startup Repair couldn't repair ..."&nbsp; Dead end it seems ...</p>

            In that case, this issue might be due to software conflicts. You can try running a system file check scan and DISM&nbsp; to troubleshoot this concern. The steps can be found on this

<p>Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that you have tried several options within the Advanced Options menu.&nbsp; You didn't mention having tried
<p>
</p><p>Within the ASO menu choose Advanced Options &gt;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Startup Settings</span>&gt; Safe Mode w/ networking F4 or F5.&nbsp; Then ESC to exit and return to Windows.&nbsp; Doing so might return you to a functional desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the above with your USB installation media plugged into a port.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestions.<br />
I followed the instructions to run SFC as provided in your link.&nbsp; That runs fine and indicates no issues.</p>
<p>I then ran DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth with some interesting results: "DISM does not support servicing Windows PE with the /online option."</p>
<p>That lead me to try without the /online option, before researching the "Windows PE" part (my first assumption, that it referred in some way to "Windows Professional" which I am running, was way off base).<br />
Apparently this refers to a Preinstalation Environment?&nbsp; Is that true, and if so, is it consistent with a failure of the update process?&nbsp;There is a lot of reference to Widows Vista, which leaves me&nbsp;uncertain (I was running Windows 7 Professional, upgraded to
 Windows 10 Professional, so Windows Vista has never been oh this system).&nbsp;Is there a path forward (or back) from there?</p>

<p>Hi Gary, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To further troubleshoot the issue, it's best to clean install Windows 10 on your computer. Here's how:

<p>I'm keeping that option in mind, but want to be sure I haven't missed something before I head in that direction. My understanding at this point is that doing this will erase other software and data.&nbsp; I have backups of data and some software install media,
 but my Office software came with the machine from Dell.&nbsp; I also appear to still have the Dell factory reset option.&nbsp; I found a directory of .RBF files that, from the date on them, I suspect are the Dell restore files.<br />
<br />
Can you provide any insight or recommendations on doing a Clean Windows 10 install vs the Dell factory reset- (leaving aside the whole Windows 7 vs Windows 10 thing?&nbsp; I'm more concerned with being able to recover/retain my Office software than I am with which
 operating system I end up with,<br />

<p>I'm no expert at this, even after considerable research and some helpful comments from folks like yourself there are a lot of pieces I have no explanation for.&nbsp; I'm going to summarize a bit here:<br />
Windows 10 went into one of its updates while we were out for dinner one evening (so I only saw where it ended, nothing that might have happened during the process).&nbsp; I have seen a lot of other users with problems blame "power failure" - this desktop is connected
 to a UPS with about 15 minutes of backup.&nbsp; There is no indication of a power failure at all (flashing clocks) much less one of 15 minutes duration ...</p>
<p>The machine showed several strange symptoms on return: hung for a while on a "loading personal settings" command screen, excel files in recovery mode and Dell (factory install) apps not starting.&nbsp; I forced a reboot and the real fun began.</p>
<p>The reboot failed with a Bad Config Settings message and reboots into Diagnostic mode.&nbsp; Automatic repair fails and offers Restart and Advanced Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over several days (and while checking online resources from a different computer) I tested pretty much all available Advanced Options: restarts from restore points all failed, in some cases with specific messages like "unable to extract Edge ...".&nbsp; System
 Reset fails. Attempts to start in Safe Mode fail.&nbsp; One of the few things that "works" is the Command screen.<br />
Through a bit of trial and error I discover that with the command screen I can find three partitions: C: (volume label "Recovery") with a few hidden files in it, D: (Volume label "O/S" but appears to be mostly software and data files) and X: (volume label "Boot"
 which appears to contain "Windows" files).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>One helpful person suggested running DISM.&nbsp; While this did not run as expected, I suspect that the error message indicating that the /Online option was not supported&nbsp;by Windows PE offers some insight.&nbsp; Certainly some online information about Windows PE seems
 consistent with where I ended up, however, it didn't result in anything useful from the perspective of recovering my system.<br />
My final options seemed to be to do a clean reinstall of Windows 10, or go back to my Windows 7 System Recovery disks.&nbsp; I did try doing the Windows 10 install from a USB drive created using the Windows Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; It boots, goes through a few screens,
 and then asks me "where" and shows three partitions, a small one designated "OEM" a slightly larger one (10 MB, more or less), and a third that contains most of my 1.5 TB of hard disk (I apologise, but I don't remember the labels on these partitions).&nbsp; Short
 story, Install will not run to the larger partition at all (tried the Format command on the Install screen and going back to a command screen format - no luck at all).&nbsp; After formatting the 10 MB partition, Install does run to there (after complaining that
 it would really like at least 35 MB).&nbsp; In fairness, the system did boot successfully from there, but the end result looked nothing like my old system from a directory structure perspective, and then the "low on disk space" comment came in...</p>
<p><br />
Somewhat reluctantly, I loaded the Windows 7 System Recovery disks.&nbsp; Those booted and seemed to run, but when I restarted the system seemed to boot from the Windows 10 (10MB partition again).&nbsp; The Boot menu (if I interrupt during startup) does not show individual
 partitions just "RAID", so I didn't see an obvious way to force a restart of Windows 7, even though it did appear to load.<br />
That lead me back to the Windows 10 USB drive.&nbsp; I used that to erase the 10 MB partition and reformat the larger one again.&nbsp; Then I returned to my Windows 7 System Recovery disks and *voila* after running again, appear to have restored my Windows 10 operating
 system with the original directory structure (I assume the OEM partition is hidden by Dell, still not sure exactly what is there but perhaps it is where Dell DATA Safe does it's thing).&nbsp; It's a bit of a slog reloading all of the old upgrades, but I am now
 close to where I was when Windows 10 first came knocking with it's free upgrade offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, when I do get restored, I'm running a new System Recover Disk using the Dell Data Safe software and will be using Windows 7 to create a System Image as well.&nbsp; Simple data backups (I have all of the file history backups so data isn't my problem) and
 system restore points don't do it for me any more.&nbsp; I had five restore points showing and none of them were useable from the state I was left in.<br />
I have found instructions for creating a Windows 10 System Image, and have followed that for my laptop, placing it on physical media that I can use later without any functioning operating system on the machine itself (given that I couldn't boot in any of the
 safe modes, cloud storage of this sort of backup seems to me to be less than useless).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few final thoughts of the Windows Update and Security" section of System Settings ...<br />
The "Backup" option has a nice section on using "File History" and how to access old Windows 7 backups, but no obvious links to any assistance in backing up the system itself.&nbsp; In light of my experiences over the past month, and the many comments I see of other
 people having problems during the update process, this seems a bit of an oversight.&nbsp; There should be at least a link here to how to create a bootable recovery disk or USB or system image&nbsp;...</p>
<p>The "Recovery" option has sections to "Reset this PC", and "Go back to the previous version of Windows 10".&nbsp; I believe both of these were included in "Advanced Options" after the "Automatic Repair" failure.&nbsp; Both of them also failed for me.&nbsp; I was left with
 the impression that the update process is *supposed* to automatically roll back to the previous state if the update fails; it is no real surprise to me that if the update process fails, and also fails to roll back successfully, that those advanced options
 also fail (and there is no way to access the Systems settings when the system refuses to boot).</p>
<p>Finally, we get to "Advanced Startup" which offers advice to "start up from a device or disk" or "restore Windows from a system image", but offers no insight or links to how to create the "device or disk" or the "System image".&nbsp; Again, given my experience
 over the last month, this seems a glaring oversight.&nbsp; There is a link to "Learn how to start fresh with a clean installation of Windows", so why are there not links to creating a "device or disk" or "system image"?<br />
My two cents worth would be that these other options need to be much more clearly and prominently identified for people such as myself to find ***BEFORE*** we find ourselves squarely behind the "Update 8 Ball".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My final comment is to thank those individuals who tried to help out with this problem.&nbsp; I have the feeling that one or two of you might have resolved this if I could have placed you at my keyboard.&nbsp; I thank you for your time and efforts, and would be curious
 about whether anything I put here suggests avenues that I didn't go down (just in case I see this happen again).</p>

<h2>            XBOX ONE&#47; TWC &#47; NAT PROBLEM</h2>
                    
<p>Hello to all.</p>

<p>Before, I began I would like to post some info on my Modem which is a Motorola SBG6580.</p>

<p>As you can see all Xbox one ports are forwarded correctly, with the additional port with the value of 3075, which I have read that that port is needed for COD Ghost.</p>
<p>My NAT on the Xbox one is open, but I am having trouble getting a open NAT on COD Ghost. This has been an ongoing problem since I have purchased the Xbox One.</p>
<p>However, UPnP is disabled, along with the firewall in the modem. I can get a Open NAT&nbsp;in COD Ghost by placing the Xbox&nbsp;One in the DMZ. (I don't want to)</p>
<p>So, I am thinking this is a Microsoft problem rather than a ISP problem, has anyone with this modem been successful?

<p>The SBG6580 is actually a gateway, which is a combined router+modem. As a result, you can run into problems (double NAT) placing another router behind it. It doesn't sound like you are doing that but, to confirm, are you?</p>

<p>XBOX ONE is having issues with Gateways. I'm having the same issues. I found a work around for the time being until I get a router and bridge my gateway.</p>

<p>@GZA, Nope, I am not behind a double NAT. I am using only the Motorola SBG6580. I have talked to TWC, which they updated the modem's software to SBG6580-6.5.2.0-GA-06-077-NOSH, which unleashed IPv6.
</p>
<p>@TTheInfamous1, I believe you're assumption to be correct, that the Xbox One has issues with Gateways.</p>
<p>I do not wish to dump another $100+ on a router to run in bridge mode. I appreciate the tip. I am going to wait this out, hopefully Microsoft will swiftly roll out an update to fix an array of problems.
</p>
<p>Best solution for me for the time being is place the Xbox One in the DMZ, which I hate the idea!

<p>I don't know about Time Warner Cable, but usually ISPs that "unleash" IPv6 either have trouble running out of their IPv4 address range or really are on the cutting edge of technology (a very rare occurence). A solution to that "running out of IPv4 space"
 problem, is to create a huge Router/Gateway in their data centers and using DS-Lite and Carrier Grade NAT to do the same as your home router does: Connect a lot of devices to the public Internet with only one IP address.
<br />
<br />
See if you can find out what public WAN IP address your Motorola Gateway gets from your Internet Provider. Let's assume for example your WAN IP is 123.45.67.89<br />
<br />
Now go to this website <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://checkip.dyndns.com</a></p>
<p>Let's say the page now displays 98.76.54.32</p>
<p>When the two IP addresses are different your Provider uses CG-NAT and DS-Lite to get you online. Which won't work that well with multiplayer games. In that case you need to contact Time Warner and demand a full Dual Stack capable connection with a real public
 IPv4 (and for the One) a proper IPv6 address, and not a NATed DS-Lite abomination.

<p>@ ArminatorX, The IPv4 address is matching, however it is clear to me that I am running a dual stack IPv6 network.</p>
<p>The NAT problem occurred on the previous gateway software which I was IPv4 at that time.</p>
<p>The Xbox One NAT is open, however port value 3075 which is needed for Call of Duty Ghost will not open. I asked TWC if there was a reason they would be blocking port 3075, the answer was simply, "No".</p>
<p>My conclusion it isn't the Xbox One with the NAT problem using my gateway to connect, it is Infinity Ward problem.</p>
<p>the reason is because the Xbox one does not have an issue connecting to its own servers, the NAT is open. I think that Infinity Ward servers are having trouble maintaining connection with the Xbox One for what ever given reason.
</p>
<p>I returned my gateway, and received a new one to rule out my end! The problem still remains. I have tried every network technique I know to establish a open NAT on COD Ghost, the only thing that does work is DMZ, which I am not going to apply, I just don't
 trust the security.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse is working intermittently.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10).</p>
<p>The mouse was working on fine before, but I haven't used it in a while.</p>
<p>Now when dragging the mouse it would stutter (stop/roll/stop/roll...), I looked at the LED tracking light under the mouse and the blue LED is blinking. I think that this is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>1. Replacing the batteries.</p>
<p>2. Uninstall/reinstall&nbsp; the bluetooth driver and with the most recent driver.</p>
<p>3. Uninstall/reinstall&nbsp;Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse driver (Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center V.3).</p>
<p>4. I have scoured the net but and tried everything suggested but didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Naris</p>

<p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your answer.</p>
<p>I have tried the what you have suggested but still could not get it to work on my Surface Pro4, but I could get to work on my HP Pavillion at work so, I exchanged the mouses, everything is working well now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi Venessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update on the situation, it only worked on the HP for a few minutes before, it failed again.</p>
<p>I worked intermittently, I looked underneath to see the tracking blue LED, it is flashing a about 0.8 sec interval.</p>
<p>I am not sure what is exactly going on now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will contact the hardware support link as you have suggested.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us, Naris. Since the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse worked intermittently on both your Surface Pro4 and your HP Pavillion, then it's more likely a hardware issue. It's a good option to get in touch with the hardware support.</p>
