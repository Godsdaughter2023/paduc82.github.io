    <title>Poor RAM Usage by Desktop Background Slide Show - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> titusgrail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Poor RAM Usage by Desktop Background Slide Show</h2>
                    First, I am going start by saying that the 90 Day Tech Support including with Windows 8 Pro is unfortunately a joke after 12AM EST. I had both techs, a female, then a male, who both decided to hang up on me. I'll explain in further detail if anyone asks.<br />
<br />
Well, onto the actual issue. I have personalized the Windows 8 Desktop to change Wallpapers every 3 minutes, shuffling the pictures from different Windows Themes going all they way back to Vista. Now, we all know that actual RAM in Use tends to increase the
 longer the system is UP. Tonight, though was the night that I was fed up with the amount of RAM that was being used.<br />
<br />
My system has a Intel Core i7-940 and 6GB of RAM with approximately 43% Usage at Start-up, sitting at an Idle State. After 6 1/2 Days of Up Time,&nbsp; my system was now sitting idle using 63% - 64%. So where did my RAM go?<br />
<br />
My thoughts turned to <i>Mark Russinovich</i> and the <i>Sysinternals</i> tools he and his colleagues created.
<i><br />
<br />
RAMMap</i> was my weapon of choice. <br />
<br />
I start looking through the File Summary and immediately noticed the sheer amount of files, from my Backgrounds Folder, that I use for my Wallpapers.
<br />
<br />
Quite of number of the Wallpaper files that were opened were being stored in RAM. I get why, buy why? I had more than 250 Files, ranging anywhere from approximately 400K to 1.2M in RAM.
<br />
<br />
Well, there was, for the most part, my missing 1GB. So, I just restarted system as I would have done in the past.<br />
<br />
So, this isn't memory leak. It's just apparently an issue that Background Slide Show doesn't have any advanced memory management to clean up it's own mess.<br />
<br />
My question is what next? How in the world do open a support ticket to get this behavior changed (and Techs who hang up on people Reprimanded)? I know that this issue my only effect a small minority, but I believe my issue is certainly fixable and I hope that
 an UPDATE will be released to all versions of Windows effected.<br />
<br />
Please someone get this to proper Team Engineer. I gladly provide my RAMmap Save Files, just ask.<br />
<br />
I'll get off my soapbox, now.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like memory usage is more when you use blackground slideshow. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you disabled blackground slideshow to see if the&nbsp;memory is working normally?
</p>
<p>2. Have you checked the event viewer for more error logs? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's check with the event viewer to get more error logs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also&nbsp;may Run <strong>System&nbsp;Maintenance </strong>troubleshooter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a.<strong> </strong>Press<strong> “Windows key + C”</strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Choose the <b>‘Settings tab’</b>, now type <b>Troubleshooting </b>in the search box and click on it which will be displayed on the left side of the window.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Now under the ‘System and Security’, you have&nbsp;run<strong><span> Maintenance tasks</span></strong>. Click on it.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click NEXT, in the system <strong>Maintenance interface.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>e. Once the troubleshooting is done, you can look for the updates and close it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Check Event Viewer:</font></span></b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>I would also suggest you to provide us any error logs related to issue from Event Viewer. Follow these steps to access the Event Viewer.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>a. Move the mouse to the bottom left corner and right-click on the start.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>b. Select ‘Event Viewer’ and click an event log in the left pane.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>c. Expand ‘Windows logs’ and click on ‘System’ to check for the logs.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this information helps. Provide more information so that we could help you further.

            Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
System Maintenance did not find any issues. <br />
<br />
Here's a link to my event log.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=BE3A072C724506D!9175&amp;authkey=!AI5gK1mhNUZUkF4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Log</a><br />
<br />
I will forgo use of the Desktop Background Slideshow for the next few days and report the results.<br />
<br />
I honestly expect there will be an improvement, though that won't resolve the actual issue.<br />

            <p>Your computer is using and allocating memory for what it is doing, will have to do, is expecting that it will have to do. You have 6gb and it is still NOT using all of it after 6.5 days of running stuff, caching stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you not consider that to be a better option than leaving RAM free doing nothing? What is the point of having 6gb RAM if you don't want your computer to try to maximize its use?</p>

            <p>There is absolutely an issue with the desktop background slideshow.&nbsp; I have been running it for months, and have had to restart windows explorer at least twice a day.&nbsp; but I never put the two together.&nbsp; however, a few days ago I noticed a very slight lag
 at the same time the background was changed. I then decided to turn odd the background slideshow.&nbsp; guess what?&nbsp; not a single problem since!</p>

            <p>This error arises because you tried to send a message&nbsp;including a photo album. This feature no longer works as a result of changes at OneDrive, where the photo album would have been stored had the changes not taken place. This means that the message is now
 stuck in your outbox and&nbsp;may be&nbsp;preventing subsequent messages from being sent. The outbox is below the account folders in the folder pane:</p>

            Microsoft community emailed me asking if the problem has been resolved. No, I tried to send one photo to myself 4 different ways last night. This morning they were all sitting&nbsp;in my outbox, until I dragged them out. Now I can't open and send any type of&nbsp;new
 email, if I select email message to create an email, it gives me an error. Error: A problem occurred trying to open this message, try again. I can no longer create and send any kind of email! Microsoft has been no help at all!!! Microsoft could help, but there's
 no money in it to motivate them. I see a lot of posts on the web that give excuses for the problem, but no fixes.&nbsp;I don't know how they stay in business. Thank you for your suggestion, I have tried them all.

 speed, so it's not sounding like a jet engine. I set them to about 50% (which is still a bit high, but better safe than sorry).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At 50% speed, my temps are running around 27C, so it's not over heating, my CPU load is around 6% to 8%, memory is around 20% (too many Chrome tabs open), I don't have any services that are out of control and eating a ton of resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research and I found a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off notifications - no luck</li><li>Sometimes upgrading to Windows 10 can duplicate your display drivers - this didn't happen to me</li><li>There was a handful of services that people posted that had issues, none of them I had. Again, I don't have any service or application eating up my resources.&nbsp;</li><li>I've tried messing with the cooling settings in the power settings - no dice.</li><li>I've upgraded my mobo drivers - no luck</li><li>Even upgraded my BIOS - no luck</li><li>Checked all my hardware had up to date drivers - no luck.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I'm running an i7-3820, with 16GB of RAM, an Nvidia GTX 660 and GTX 970 - I have a 256GB SSD Crucial CT256MX and a 3 TB HD (Windows is installed on the SSD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first few days of using Windows 10, there wasn't any fan issues, and it just started today - so what changed? The only change was that I install Samsung SideSync and uTorrent - I uninstalled them both and no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what to do next.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Vista slow to respond overall. Long pauses when starting applications, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Vista slow to respond overall. Long pauses when starting applications, etc.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Since about 2 weeks ago, vista has been curiously slow to respond, and system pauses for up to a minute when starting up applications that it previously had no problems handling. A wide range of programs and actions seem to induce this effect, including
 but not limited to loading a CD, streaming a video online, opening a non-resource-heavy program, and even just now as I type.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span><strong>During the pauses, usually the cursor is completely operational, and windows already opened do not show the white tint in case of "not responding" when clicked on. Also, buttons do not show the regular mouseover
 response when tried.</strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Moreover, system startup is also slowed in a similar fashion. A black screen would show only the cursor for over a minute without anything else.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have Vista SP2, with Duo core 2.13GHz Intel CPU and 4 GB ram. Graphic card is GeForce 9500 GT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please let me know if I should provide more information. Thanks!</strong></p>

Limit how many programs load at startup
<div>
<p>Many programs are designed to load automatically when <span>Windows</span> starts. Software manufacturers often set their programs to open in the background, where you can’t see them running, so they’ll open right away when you click their icons. That's
 helpful for programs you use a lot, but for programs you rarely or never use, this wastes precious memory and slows down the time it takes
<span>Windows</span> to finish loading.</p>
<p>Decide for yourself if you want a program to load at startup.<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1264bc24-72a8-48aa-84e3-a355327139d91033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1264bc24-72a8-48aa-84e3-a355327139d91033.mspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>“<strong><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. This tab includes two additional ways to free even more disk space:</span></p>
<p><span>Programs and Features: Uninstall unwanted Programs.</span></p>
<p><span>System restore and Shadow Copies: Delete all but the most recent Restore Point</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 install</h2>
                    Ok, so this laptop that I am using is a gateway that I originally had a couple years ago when it had windows 8 on it. Well, something with windows corrupted on the laptop and sent it into an inoperable state. I was young enough to cut my losses and let
 it go but now I need a laptop for school so I have been trying to install windows 10 on it. I have a boot disk made, when I tried to install it I would get a message that my partitions were not in the correct order and that some files are corrupt. So, doing
 some digging online it seemed the best solution was to go into the command prompt and clean disk 0, which previously had windows on it, to clear corrupt files. When I tried to reinstall it was SO SLOW that it would not get off of 0%. I tried rebooting and
 each time I booted from disk it would go to a black screen with no operable mouse, so I figured I may have cleaned that disk as well because I believe it also fit into disk 0 in my partition list. So I made a USB stick for install but

<h2>            How do i go back to windows 10 home that came preinstalled with my HP Laptop..&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP au 624tx that came with Windows 10 Home pre installed, HP charges more than 5k for the preinstalled variant over the DOS variant.</p>
<p>I was logged in with a microsoft id.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, a few days ago i used a random Windows 10 pro product key in the 'Upgrade Windows' section and since then my laptop has gone haywire, I cant access the start menu, cant go to settings either, cant even change brightness!</p>
<p>Since HP didnt give me any product key or a Windows 10 Home cd and i didnt create a hp recovery media (although i did create a windows recovery a few months ago) i have no way to re activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft help me find my original activation key that my laptop was on, out of the box?</p>

<p>Hi Rohan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret to inform you that downgrading from Windows 10 Pro to Home is only possible through clean installation. However, you can try Andre Da Costa's workaround on how to get back to Windows 10 Home from Pro on this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/downgrade-from-windows-10-pro-to-home/345f5464-cb7a-44b3-8856-237cbec072c8">thread</a></strong>. Please make sure that you are currently
 running Windows 10 Pro by checking the<strong> System Information </strong>through
<strong>Cortana</strong> before proceeding and have a Windows 10 installation media ready. You can create one from this

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's only a number of monitors that are known to not work with Surface devices. The refresh rate and screen resolution can be configured to get the best connection for your devices. Mini DisplayPort 1.2 is the one that works with newer Surface models.
 You may ask the staff in the store to assist you in testing your Surface's connection with your chosen monitor to see how it will work. You can also consider getting Surface accessories like the Surface Dock or Surface docking station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>On turning on my PC all I see is a blue screen with white dots going around endlessly in a small circle at the centre of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated from W7 to W10 three months back and have not encountered this problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to attempt any of the proposed fixes as I cannot get past a blue blank screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>surely the update proposed from 2015 is already on my system since we are now March 8 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is now day four and I still cannot not get in!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>help please</p>

<p>
</p><p>We need to do further investigation so that we can identify the cause of the issue. The error may be caused by the

<p>&nbsp;This seems to have solved itself. I was later able to Turn Off the File History, and change to a different drive.&nbsp; However, I am repeatedly receiving error message that there is an error in the file history drive and it needs to be scanned and repaired.&nbsp;
 But after scanning the drive, no errors are found to be repaired.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don't know what is causing this error message.&nbsp; This error message is the reason I wanted to change the File History drive, and changing it has not seemed to resolve the problem.&nbsp; Will take
 a screen shot the next time this error message pops up.</p>

<p>Yes, I am using a SD card.&nbsp; Receive several messages a day that the drive needs to be "scanned and repaired".&nbsp; Sometimes the drive has been repaired; at other times, no errors were found&nbsp; Received the same message when I used an USB thumb drive to backup

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the current OS build and version of your computer? Have you tried stopping the use of your current backup drive before adding a new one? If you haven't done it, we suggest doing so. This won't delete any files from your current backup. Here are the
 steps on how to do it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li>Open<strong> Update and Security</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Backup</strong> category</li><li>Click <strong>More options</strong> under Backup using File History<strong>.</strong></li><li>Scroll down to <strong>Back up to a different drive</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Stop using drive.</strong></li><li>Go back to the main Backup window</li><li>Click <strong>Add a drive.</strong></li><li>Select the new drive.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already done the above and the issue still persists, try to do a<strong> System File Check
</strong>on your computer. It's a <span><span>utility available in Windows 10 that checks for system file corruption. To do it, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Open the<strong> Command Prompt</strong> from the start menu as the
<strong>Administrator</strong>.<br />
2. Type in <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (please note the space after sfc)<br />
3. Windows will scan your system files and repair corrupted ones, if any.<br />
4. Reboot your PC.</p>

<p>We would like to clarify if you were able to do the steps that we've mentioned above prior to changing the current back-up drive. Also, a common reason for getting the scan and repair error is that the removable disk in question was not properly removed
 from the computer the last time you used it. It usually happens when you eject a USB drive directly from USB port without clicking “<strong>Safely remove the hardware”</strong>. So to properly isolate the issue, we suggest doing the unmounting steps methodically,&nbsp;
 and also do the steps of stopping and restarting the back up drive to check if it would make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth headphones either has mic refusing to work or incredibly poor audio quality. Windows 8.1</h2>
                    &nbsp; Hey, so I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones, and getting them to work with my bloody computer has kind of put me in an infinite loop of problems. It started with my microphone just refusing to work, and then I fixed that, and then the audio quality
 of everything was lowered to the point of it being garbage. I went back and forth for a good while, and I've spent at least a good 2-3 hours looking for&nbsp;a solution of some form, but everything was either driver related(all of mine are up to date) or things
 I've already tried. A bit of help would be nice.

            Hey Swanky Pants (Great Name! and I've seen em all!) -
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Updates cause problems with sound,  microphones and bluetooth, so I'll give you everything I've got that works to fix these victims of buggy Updates:
<br />
<br />Please run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />Now Microphone: 
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try this fix next:  <a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br /> Now Bluetooth:
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br />For all : 
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>It a crying shame that they have posted their question to the 8.1 forums, isn't it&nbsp;Greg?</p>
<p>And you going on about the 1803 update in 10 and repair upgrade install of 10, too..</p>

<p>&nbsp; Hello! Sorry for not posting in a bit, Ive been caught up with some other things lately, and its been difficult to respond. Apologies for not posting in the right forum, didnt even know there were others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Ive tried the solutions already posted, well, ive already installed the drivers and all that(and reinstalled, and reinstalled again, and again, and again), and it does appear to be on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;And aside from these posts, ive tried a good couple others, restarting all the bluetooth and audio services, unactivating and reactivating all the settings in Bluetooth services for my headphones. None have worked, and im still stuck with this problem.</p>

<p>If you have checked that and everything appears to be correct, the next step becomes difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could check for system file corruption, but I don't think that&nbsp;is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for you to check those headphones with a different device, as that would then rule out if it was your computer or the headphones causing the problem?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Home Single Language Clean Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaronj1984  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home Single Language Clean Install</h2>
                    <p>Good Day. Last year I bought a retail copy of Windows 8.1 Single Language and upgraded it to Windows 10 Home Single Language last July 2015 currently installed in my PC under my MS account. I am creating a new PC and plan to install my copy of Windows 10
 Home SL in the new computer but later on I will install that same copy of windows back to my old computer for my parents to use and once I buy a copy of Windows 10 Pro, I'll be installing it to the new computer I am building. I have 3 questions regarding that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is the free upgrade tied to the license key or the MS account used to activate and upgrade to Windows 10?</p>
<p>2. Can I do a clean install of Windows 10 on my current computer under my parent's MS account using my Windows 8.1 SL license key?</p>
<p>3. Can I do a clean install of Windows 10 in the new computer I'm building using my Windows 8.1 SL license key and own MS account?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes free upgrade is tied to the license key. But it will carried forward to the same system for free upgrade to Windows 10, since the license key is injected to the motherboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes, you can perform clean installation but you need to buy product key for Windows 10 to activate the Windows.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Balaram,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused. We will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Has the change reflected only on apps?</span></li><li><span>Is the language of the OS and keyboard in English?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Set the display language to English by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>icon<strong> key</strong> on the keyboard, type
<strong>Settings</strong> and select the top most search result.</li><li>Select <strong>Time &amp; Language</strong> and click on <strong>Region &amp; Language</strong> from the left side panel of the window.</li><li>Click on <strong>Add a Language</strong> under <strong>Language</strong> settings and select
<strong>English</strong>.</li><li>Click on the added language and click on <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Download</strong> to download the language pack.</li><li>After the download is complete, select the language and click <strong>Set as default</strong>.</li><li>Check if the changes are effective.</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the issue persist, <span>I suggest you to run the </span>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows apps troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span>and check if the issue is resolved</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write back to us for further assistance, we will be happy to assist.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,My systems default language is already set to english only. The region is set to India,as thats where the computer was bought. When i saw the different language in app,i checked those first and there has been no change in it. My system language is in
 english, my region is India and my keyboard language is also english. So how come after update my apps are in chinese? I tried your app troubleshooter,but it dint find any issue with my apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Let me make this clear- i dont have app issues,.only that the app display language has been changed from english to Chinese after the update since i updated my computer from china.</strong></p>
<p>It looks like windows update service has automatically decided that since update was performed from china,the apps are updated to the chinese version even though my system of is english version single os pack.

<h3> lorraineblough  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana Problems</h2>
                    <p>I have done the following things to set up Cortana on my Acer Aspire laptop</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up my microphone for speech recognition - it does work</li><li>The drivers for my microphone are up to date</li><li>Set Cortana to recognize my voice only- it was successful</li><li>Set Cortana to respond to "Hey Cortana"</li><li>The region and language all match</li></ul>
<p>My problems are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cortana only responds to "Hey Cortana" occasionally and not very often</li><li>Cortana doesn't give me many spoken responses - usually opens a Bing search instea</li><li>Cortana has many problems recognizing my speech so it gives me the wrong information a majority of the time</li></ol>
<p>I haven't found any good solutions in the community so far. &nbsp;I would like to know how common these problems are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing - in the notebook under weather I placed a location into the trash and added a new location. &nbsp;For 2 days now I still am getting the weather for the trashed location. &nbsp;Is Cortana a really, really slow learner? &nbsp;Please don't tell me to restart
 my computer - I have restarted it many times and I shut it down for the night regularly.</p>

            Thanks for the info MarkoeWRS.&nbsp; I just thought Cortana would be as easy to use as Google Voice Search in the Chrome Browser.&nbsp; Google always hears me and I never had my mike set up for voice recognition until Cortana became available to me.&nbsp; I find it funny
 that my son (who has speech problems) gets a better response from Cortana than I do and he doesn't use a headset or have Cortana set to recognize his voice.

            <p>Just an update - Cortana does hear me better and more often if I use a lower voice.&nbsp; I am not going to change the way I speak just to use Cortana!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The problem with the wrong weather location is persistent.&nbsp; I had gone to the notebook and placed a weather location into the trash.&nbsp; Then when I used Cortana again it still gave me the weather from the trashed location.&nbsp; I have a completely different
 location added in my notebook and it is the only location. I get updates for this new&nbsp;location&nbsp;and the trashed location.&nbsp; This happens even after I have turned off Cortana for&nbsp;a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I have sent feedback about this problem already.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not use Cortana.</p>

            <p>It constantly does this. Some days it gives the right location, some days not. Some days it gives it to me in Fahrenheit, other days in Celsius. It does not matter what I have put in the settings. These last couple of days, it has been stuck on the afternoon
 temperature and will not update for the evening. No idea what is going on. I have never seen such an inconsistent program that ignores user settings, and I have used computers since the early 1980s. Every day the behaviour is completely different and I am
 at a loss why. There’s now no point asking Cortana anything as it spends minutes ‘Thinking’. (Nothing happens beyond this.)</p>

<p>Hey there VibratoryMean66!<br />
<br />
In order to do this, you would have to format your harddrive. To do this, please follow these simple instructions. (Note: Doing this will remove ALL content from the Xbox. Make sure to save any content you wish to keep to the cloud or an external device.)<br />
<br />
Another easier way is suggested by Daft Badger above. :)<br />
<br />
Press the&nbsp;<b>Guide</b>&nbsp;button on your controller, go to&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>, and select&nbsp;<b>System Settings</b>.<br />
<br />
Select&nbsp;<b>Storage</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>Memory</b>.<br />
<br />
Select the storage device that you want to rename, and then press&nbsp;<b>Y</b>&nbsp;on your controller.<br />
<br />
Select&nbsp;<b>Format</b>. You will see the following message:<br />
<br />
This will delete all content on this device. Do you wish to continue?<br />
<br />
Select&nbsp;<b>Yes</b>&nbsp;to format the storage device.<br />
<br />
If you are asked to enter your console serial number, do so, and then select&nbsp;<b>Done</b>. This step helps to guard against accidental formatting.<br />
<br />
<br />
The console serial number is located on the back of the console and behind the oval door on the front of the console.<br />
