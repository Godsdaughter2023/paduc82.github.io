    <title>Word edit view of documents different to print preview&#47;print view - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word edit view of documents different to print preview&#47;print view</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been trying to word out what's wrong with my document exports as the word view does not align with the print preview, so my documents are printing different to how I have edited them in word. I export delegate biographies for event booklets from
 an online programme, these are exported into a table. Before my laptop update the export tables would run continuously as 1 long table, however now a blank line/space is added between each table, so each are individual - this is not an issue however when we
 come to print the blank space appears to print slightly smaller than it views on the word edit view, so therefore all the document formatting is out when printing, or viewing in print preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have recently had a work update with a new laptop and windows 10, using word 2016</p>
<p>- I use word exports from an online programme - the issue is not with the online programme as this has been tested&nbsp;</p>
<p>- It is not caused by my company programming on the new laptop as this has been tested</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<span>Problems are not with the margins as this has been tested&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>- When I open the word export the screen appears to 'glitch' and a white space is added between each separate biography/table&nbsp;<br />
-&nbsp;<span>When editing documents in word – these spaces between the tables are the equivalent of a size 12 font size gap – however when printing the spaces are not the same size. Therefore the printing
 and formatting of the whole document jumps and does not match with the word view.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- T</span><span>he space appears to be a different size in word view as compared to print view. So it’s not that we need less/no/more space
 – it’s that the space created is not the same size. So we would have to manually remove these spaces as they are messing up the printing.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>As you can see here the last 'biography table' will print at the letter Q - however the word view cuts the page at the letter P&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(** it is usually out by more lines however for the example I have cut it down and had to remove content)</p>

            Can you change your default printer to pdf or xps or Onenote and see whether the  same problem occurs in these printers also?
<br />
<br />To change default printer &gt; Type printer in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click on Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Click on Pdf or xps or Onenote printer &gt; Manage &gt; Set as Default
<br />
<br />(Later on you can change the default back to your original printer)
<br />
<br />If printer is the problem, then you should update your printer driver to latest from internet.

            Hi, no meant to add, it's nothing to do with the printer drivers either as this has been checked. I've just tried again and the same problem is there.&nbsp;

            I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to Technet forum also as this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. Experts on both forums will assist you giving you wider reach.

    <title>PowerPoint Bar Chart Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoffsabourin  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint Bar Chart Issues</h2>
                    <p>I have a bar chart inserted into a PowerPoint slide, but for some reason three of the bars are not showing their full value. If I click/select any of those three to outline the bar you can see the rest of the column but it is not filled in? This is not a
 stacked bar chart, screenshots below of the bar chart and the data that's behind it. Thanks.</p>

<p>That looks like a video display problem. If this only occurs in edit or normal mode, please choose
<strong>File&gt;Options&gt;Advanced</strong>, scroll down to the <em>Display</em> section and check
<strong>Disable hardware graphics acceleration</strong>. If it also happens in Slideshow mode, then also check
<strong>Disable Slide Show hardware graphics acceleration</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also be able to fix this by visiting the web site of your computer manufacturer and searching for a recent Windows 10 video driver, if they have one for your model.</p>

    <title>extract microsoft photo editor from Office 97 and use it with 2003 or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slickrcbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            extract microsoft photo editor from Office 97 and use it with 2003 or 2007</h2>
                    I kinda like the old Microsoft Photo Editor tool included with Office 97, but I absolutely hate Clippy from Office 97. I greatly prefer Office 2003 over 97 or 2007 (the only versions of office I own).<br />
<br />
Is there an easy way to install Microsoft Photo Editor on my Windows 7 system without installing Office 97 as well? I already have it set up with both 2003 and 2007, I don't need another copy of office on my system.

<h2>            Outlook views Ethernet Connection as metered, can&#39;t send e-mail out</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 recently updated on my home machine.&nbsp; It is a tower with no wireless connections, yet my Outlook is displaying this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef49fb04-d6c3-45cf-bb68-e0ad47f50c08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef49fb04-d6c3-45cf-bb68-e0ad47f50c08" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The connection is not metered, nor have I ever set it up as being so...&nbsp; I do understand that this is a Windows setting, not an Outlook setting, but that's not really helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't turn off the metered connection status because it is not even shown as an option in my internet settings.&nbsp; I can receive e-mails, but nothing will go out.&nbsp; In searching for posts on this I cannot find anything that's really applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas anyone???</p>

<h2>            product key for power point</h2>
                    I am disappointed. Purchased office 365 . installed - call tech support, they uninstalled and installed a second time and still can't get power point to work. It asked for activation key which I don't have because it was suppose to be installed with purchase.
 No Activation Product Key was not sent and can't get one. And no it was not a trial

            <p>A number of people have reported having this problem on the forum. They activate Office 365 but one application thinks it is not activated. The only "fix" I've heard of is to uninstall and re-install. But as you've see, that doesn't always work.
<br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the "click to run" environment makes it almost impossible to do manual trouble shooting. All that is left to do is uninstall and re-install. But even that does not always work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try using the "fix it" on this page to uninstall.&nbsp; Then log in to the Myaccount page and "deactivate" the current installation.&nbsp; Then install again on your computer.

    <title>Excel 2010 changes relative paths to absolute in files synced with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danceswithwindows  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 changes relative paths to absolute in files synced with Offline Files in Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this (easily reproducable) problem:<br />
<br />
I have a number of Excel 2010 files in a folder on my file server. This folder is also synced to my computer using Offline Files in Windows 7.<br />
I use a lot of crossreferencing in these Excel files, that is to say, references between cells in different Excel files.<br />
This all works nicely when I create these files at work - all file paths referenced in the cells are created as relative paths and the documents open correctly.<br />
When I edit these files at home, nothing seems odd until I get back to work and sync these files back to the file server.<br />
At this point, I discover that Excel 2010 has, when I saved the files while away from the corporate network, changed all the cell references in the edited Excel files to point at absolute paths, and that these absolute paths point to my C:\ drive. So whenever
 come to work and I try to open an Excel file that I have recently worked with at home, I get a bunch of error messages about referenced files that are missing, although clearly they exist in the same folder as the file I've opened, and I must edit all the
 file references again, whereupon they are again created correctly as relative paths, which are promptly mangled into absolute C:\....\Offline Files\.....\..... paths when I save them at home (and since that works too, I don't notice it again until I come back
 to work and the offline files are synced back to the real network location).<br />
<br />
This seems to be a case of Windows 7's Offline Files not being able to fool Excel 2010 into believing it is working on a file server - apparently Excel 2010 can see through the fakery and decides on it's own to "fix" the problem (which obviously isn't a problem
 since the paths are relative to begin with) by saving the paths as absolute paths instead. Yes, really clever, Excel.<br />
<br />
Is there a fix for this, or a known workaround? Because frankly, this bug makes it impossible to work in any advanced manner with crosslinked Excel files in Offline mode. The sad thing is that this worked perfectly fine with Office 2003 and Windows XP, and
 since all Windows does is copy the files without modifying them, it must be Excel that has introduced a bug in version 2010, causing this unwanted and completely unnecessary behavior.<br />
<br />
A patch for this problem is needed urgently, and while we're waiting, a straightforward workaround would be nice.<br />

<h2>            Can shape locker lock from slide master in power point&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I create many placeholder images in the power point template for the users. To prevent users move the placeholder image, I install an app called office one shape locker. Well, it works and really can lock the placeholder image. However, I realized
 that when the users want to change the image and insert again in the placeholder image then the shape locker has lost its function. That means that I have to lock these placeholder images again and again. And the users still have the chance to move this placeholder
 image. Can anyone please help me?? Although I lock it under slide master but still the same.

            This is one of the draw back of locking things in the XML. Locking placeholders doesn't really work. Everytime content is changed the lock will be lost. This is one of the reasons we never made our version commercially available. This is not to say Shapelocker
 is not very useful.

<p>So this shape lock add-in is considered as a part of XML also?? Do you have any solution for my problem? Is it only cannot work for placeholder when there is a change on it?</p>

            <p>You may find it helpful to read my tutorial on locking shapes by editing XML:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brandwares.com/bestpractices/2016/09/xml-hacking-locking-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XML Hacking: Locking Graphics</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Shape locking is not inherited. This means that if you apply locking to the Slide Master, it will not affect Slide Layouts based on it. Likewise, locking applied to a Layout will not transfer to Slides based on it. Much of the time, locking must be applied
 to the final slides to be of any use and as John Wilson has mentioned, updating the content can lose the lock.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 on Mac - CPU hogging by mdworker32 plus any need to keep Office 2008 &#38; 2011 if using 365</h2>
                    <p>I recently did the updates to Office365 on my MacBook Pro (mid-210 model with 8Gb RAM &amp; 1TB SSD added later). The system was recently checked by Apple as I had been having some slowness issues and the OS was reinstalled and I restored from Time Machine.
 The MacBook was running ok until after the Office365 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My MacBook has been crashing and also the fans have be running wild. When checking the CPU usage I found mdworker32 the culprit and checked it back to see it was being run by Office2011 and in particular Outlook2011. I am using Office365 and wondered if
 this was something connected with the recent updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>mdworker is used by the Mac for indexing Spotlight. There is mdworker and mdworker32. Since resetting and clearing out the cache my machine has now quietened down and only mdworker is now running but not mdworker32. I wanted to see if others experienced
 this problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also wondering if I should remove Office2008 and Office2011 that are still on my computer from earlier installations of the Office suite. I wasn't sure if they needed to remain for any compatibility issues. I have Parallels on my system inside which
 I keep an old copy of my original Windows XP machine that I owned before migrating to Macs/Apple in 2008. It has an old copy of Outlook I used to use with my old messages on and on my HD I have some old Wordperfect and Word files that I've kept but haven't
 accessed in years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any constructive comments.</p>

            <p>The issues you’re seeing are with Spotlight indexing. If you have Outlook 2016 and it’s up to date, it should be in version 15.25. This version is 64 bit and using mdworker instead of mdworker32.<br />So everything points to an old version of the Outlook mdimporter acting up.<br />You could indeed remove the old versions of Office if you don’t need them (or at least the old versions of Outlook).<br />You might also consider deleting the old Outlook 2011 and 2008 identities (again, if you’re sure you no longer need them). In all likelihood, Spotlight indexing through mdworker32 is choking up indexing the identities so archiving/removing them should eliminate the issue.<br />&nbsp;Corentin</p>

            <p>Thanks for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, since posting and after another reboot, only mdworker is now in the activity monitor. It seems mdworker32 has finished doing whatever it wanted to dohaving left the machine for several hours to see if it would settle down. My machine has gone quiet and
 the fans are off and the CPU is idle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found one occurrence of mdworker32 running and it says it is in connection with Office but there isn't a year associated with it so I assume it is the current version. There are loads of copies of mdworker running but all are at idle/low use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running v15.25 of Outlook. I think that was the last upgrade after which the problem began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By old Outlook identities I presume you mean profiles (aka Users on a Mac). I checked and there is only one for the current version of Office: namely mine. Do I assume if I delete the programs it will remove all old users? I have CleanMyMac as there is only
 an uninstall program included in Office 2008 but not 2011 but it is meant to be a thorough uninstaller. I noticed inside 2011 there was an app called Office365Service.app but assume this is redundant with Office360 now installed.</p>

            <p>Users on a Mac are a different things.</p>
<p>By identity, I meant the setups that live in&nbsp;~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities in your account.</p>
<p>Outlook 2016 keeps all the data in a different location:&nbsp;~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean my Mac can be of some use but mostly everything you really care about for an old version of 2011 you'd want to remove lives in /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011. The rest are fairly small support files, etc. that shouldn't interfere with anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just so you understand. mdworker is a process provided by the system that scans files to index them for Spotlight.</p>
<p>It uses "descriptors" called mdimporter that basically tells it how to read and interpret the files. The one provided with Office 2011 is 32 bit and therefore requires mdworker32. The one provided through Office 2016 15.25 is now 64 bit and runs through
 mdworker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many other apps provide mdimporter and could be using mdwoker32. The fact that you see it in the Activity Moitor doesn't necessarily mean it's used by Outlook 2011 (or 2008).</p>

            <p>Again, thanks for coming back quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had understood that mdworker is a Mac OS system file which is why I didn't remove it. But I checked that when mdworker32 was running that it was in fact Office2011/Outlook2011 that was calling on it. Hence posting my original Q. It is running again now
 but with another app and it's not hogging the CPU. So that's ok. I've no idea why 2011 invoked it in the first place as I am not running the 2011 app but perhaps it was just something rogue sitting there that woke up after my system clean up/re-boot and reinstalled
 itself upon the fresh start up after I had been deleting the caches and preference lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, seems like I should delete the old Office programs as they just take up space. Cheers!</p>

            <p>I just ran the uninstall app supplied with 2008 and it found both the 2008 and 2011 suites to unsitnall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when selecting both to run it told me that Outlook was running. The only Outlook running is the 365 version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that it is nothing to worry about and after the uninstallation I can re-launch it safely. But I thought I better check with you in case removing the old 2008 and 2011 versions also somehow takes out, on a Mac at least, anything from the new software
 suite. The big difference I can see is that 2008 and 2011 have their own folders whereas 365 apps just sit in the top folder of the Applications folder where most other apps live.</p>

            <p>The uninstaller is convenient, but not that smart.</p>
<p>When it searches for processes that might be running, it only searches for Outlook and doesn't verify the version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just quitting Outlook while you uninstall makes it happy and there is no reason why it would do anything that would affect the new version in any way, especially since the new and old version do not share any type of resources anyway.</p>
<p>Office used to be a set of apps with some shared resources. The new versions are standalone: all the resources that used to be shared are now embedded within the app itself (larger installs obviously, but it has some advantages)</p>

</p><p>I cannot remove the extraneous Text "Table 1:".&nbsp; I've tried using the Style Gallery to Modify, but it does not show this anomally.&nbsp; When I Insert, the Table 1:&nbsp; &nbsp;Figure # appear.&nbsp; I deleted the Table, then try to use the Figure label, but when I continue
 numbering, the Caption removes the Figure and Displays the Table.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Almost certainly, Neo Wu has sent you on a wild goose chase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an illustration of the suggestion by Stefan Blom that a Table #: system of numbering has been linked to the Caption style</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3357b9b-a838-4667-90b7-26b6ef1f7e91?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3357b9b-a838-4667-90b7-26b6ef1f7e91?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>With such an arrangement, as you are experiencing, the caption dialog will display</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24507b60-590c-4820-91ed-5b15ae7d5951?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24507b60-590c-4820-91ed-5b15ae7d5951?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To correct the problem, select a caption with the errant numbering and press CTRL+SHIFT+S to display the Apply Styles dialog, which should show Caption as the style that is in use, and click on the Modify button</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e59dbc58-66ed-4dbb-b390-d0892dc8965f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e59dbc58-66ed-4dbb-b390-d0892dc8965f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, in the Modify Style dialog, expand the Format dropdown and click on the Numbering item</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f309efe2-6955-4f4c-b71f-f15a83c4aef7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f309efe2-6955-4f4c-b71f-f15a83c4aef7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and on the Numbering tab of&nbsp; the Numbering and Bullets dialog, select "None" and click on OK as required to dismiss all of the dialogs</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55316c58-b2a9-462f-a39f-843655bcd512?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55316c58-b2a9-462f-a39f-843655bcd512?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, and perhaps better, access the Define new Multilevel list dialog, and replace Caption with No Style, or if you want style of numbering for some reason, link it to the appropriate Style</p>
<p>

<h2>            Invalid redirect from Yammer login page to Office 365 login page preventing access</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I encountered&nbsp;this problem for the first time yesterday. I have a work email address which&nbsp;I use to&nbsp;access my&nbsp;company's private&nbsp;Yammer group. For some reason, as soon as I type my email address into the log in form (via the URL below), a line now appears
 saying "we are redirecting you to your organization's log in page" and I am redirected to the Office 365 login page before I even have a chance to input my password. I do not possess Office 365 with my work email (hence the use of my personal Hotmail account
 on this forum) which means I cannot progress any further.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yammer.com/dialog/authenticate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yammer.com/dialog/authenticate</a></p>
<p>I had my Yammer account deleted and reactivated by our internal IT department which did reinstate normal access but, as soon as I then&nbsp;attempted to log in via the mobile app (on iPhone), the same problem recurred. I have never had a problem logging in via
 the app before which is why I did not hesitate to use it.</p>
<p>Aside from asking our IT team to delete my account again and then avoiding use of the app, I thought I would request help from you on here. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now, anyone who wants to access Yammer will have to sign-in to Office 365 and access Yammer as it is now integrated with Office 365.</p>

</p><p>As you are being navigated to Office 365 for signing-in to Yammer, please check with the Administrator,&nbsp;if the domain&nbsp;has been&nbsp;added to any Office 365 tenant. The behaviour which you are experiencing is because&nbsp;Office 365 identity has been enforced&nbsp;for all

</p><p>Thank you, this is helpful. &nbsp;We are in the process of moving to Office 365 but it will be a considerable period of time before this is available for all users. &nbsp;I have asked our technology department to advise regarding your reply however is there provision
 for users who have not migrated to Office 365 (but for whom there is a licence) to obtain access? &nbsp;We have a large amount of information on Yammer and had no indication that we were at risk of losing access to the data.</p>

<h3> kselleck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Limit field input based on record in another table&#47;move data from on table to another.</h2>
                    <p>Project background:</p>
<p>I am working on creating a database for tracking the status of mail boxes in my mail room and package delivery. The first table is&nbsp;"box info" and is&nbsp;set up to list all mail boxes numbers that exist on location&nbsp;(primary key), mail box status (active/inactive),
 and the Box owner's name and email.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mail&nbsp;box is listed as active the owner's name and email are required.&nbsp;The second table is "packages" and lists the "destination&nbsp;box" for each package&nbsp;(foriegn key), package status (on hand/picked up), auto number
 field (primary key), and some other info such as where it is stored ect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Goal:</p>
<p>&nbsp;I want to stop the mail box status from being changed to "inactive" if there are packages listed as "on hand" for that box.&nbsp;Also, I need to keep the record of picked up packages.&nbsp;Therefore, I can't just&nbsp;delete the record once it's picked up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My proposed solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;I was considering having one table for "on hand" packages; a second table for "picked up packages" and once the package status is changed the record would move to the "picked up" table and be deleted from the "on hand" table. When an attemt is made to&nbsp;change
 the mail box status&nbsp;to "inactive" it will query the "on hand" table for any records with a "destination box" that matches the mail box&nbsp;being&nbsp;set to inactive. If a record in the "on hand" table matches the&nbsp;mail box being&nbsp;set to "inactive"&nbsp;the change to inactive
 will not be allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<p>Would my proposed solution above be acceptable? What solution would you recommend? How would I best implement my proposed solution, if it is viable, or how would I implement your solution?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; I found out that&nbsp;some boxes have a "secondary user" that is unofficial because, currently, &nbsp;there is no way to record a second user. Therefore, he wants to be able to add and track the secondary users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Also, he wants to add the ability to keep personel on file after they leave and&nbsp;be able to record&nbsp;a fowarding address for them. Because of these changes I have had to&nbsp;restructure the model.</p>
<p>
3.&nbsp; Currently the status field in box_tbl is a combo box, row source type&nbsp;is value list, row source is active;inactive, and limit to list is yes. Does this method make it impossible to enforce referential integrity?
</p><p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Bill numbers start over at 1 on January first every year, so over the course of time you will have many packages that have the same bill number and article number.</p>
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; (i) If each user can have only one mail box or a share in only one mail box then you will need to decompose the table into MailBoxes and Users table with a BoxNumber foreign key in the latter.&nbsp; (ii) If a user can have a share in more than one mail box
 then you will need to model the many-to-many relationship type with a table like this:<br />
<br />
MailBoxUsers<br />
....BoxNumber&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....UserIID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
The primary key of the table would be a composite one of both columns. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To map a package to a user the packageinfo_tbl would now need to contain a UserID column, i.e. in scenario (i) this would replace destinationbox and it would reference the users table;&nbsp; in scenario (ii) it would be an additional column, and destinationbox
 and UserIID would be a composite foreign key referencing the composite primary key of MailBoxUsers.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The simplest way is just to include a Boolean (Yes) no column in Users to indicate whether a user is current or non-current.&nbsp; Alternatively you can include AppointmentDate and TerminationDate columns in the Users table.&nbsp; A non-Null TerminationDate would
 indicate that a user is not current.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; If you do use a value list you must set the ValidationRule property of the column so that it allows only values 'Active' or 'Inactive'.&nbsp; As these values are data, however, personally I would have a Statuses table with two rows containing the values and
 create an enforced relationship.&nbsp; I would only use a value list for values which are immutably fixed in the external reality, such as days of the week or months of the year, but the choice is yours.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; The constraint on each bill number/article number and year of receipt being distinct can't be enforced by indexing.&nbsp; It would have to be done by applying a CHECK CONSTRAINT to the table, which can only be done in Access by executing the DDL statement in
 code:<br />
<br />
CurrentProject.Connection.Execute "ALTER TABLE packageinfo_tbl ADD CONSTRAINT Bill_Article_Year CHECK((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM packageinfo GROUP BY YEAR(datereceived),billnumber,articlenumber)=1)"<br />
<br />
If for any reason the constraint needs to be removed the code would be:<br />
<br />
CurrentProject.Connection.Execute "ALTER TABLE packageinfo_tbl DROP CONSTRAINT Bill_Article_Year"<br />

<p>Hi Morris,</p>
<p>To better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm some information:<br />
1.&nbsp;What do you mean by saying “contract Office 365 Business and Exchange Online can’t create the account”? Do you mean that you got the error message when you tried signing to the Portal of your Office 365 account?<br />
2.&nbsp;By saying “Years ago open an account in Outlook.com with the same email address I use for work and is the same login info I use in my computers to operate Windows 10”, do you mean that the email address of your Office 365 Business account is the same as
 the email address of the Outlook.com you are using to sign in to Windows 10?<br />
3.&nbsp;How many users in your organization encounter the same issue?<br />
4.&nbsp;I’ve translated the error message you provided in the screenshot, it says “Currently you have logged in as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, sign out and then start it in Outlook with the account used to read the mail from your organization”, am I right? If yes, did this
 issue happen when you are trying to sign in to Office 365 Outlook Web App (OWA) (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</a>) with your Office 365 Business account? If so, since Office 365 Business plan doesn’t contain
 an Exchange online license, you are not able to use it to sign in to Office 365 OWA.</p>
<p>Please let me know if anything is misunderstood.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Mouran</p>

<p>Hi Morris,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>I understand that this error message occurs when you are trying to sign in to the Office 365 Portal.</p>
<p>Please switch to a different browser or clear the browser history, then sign in to Office 365 Portal again to see if the issue can be fixed. Also, you can sign in to Office 365 portal in the private mode of these browsers.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after performing the suggestions, I’d like to confirm more information to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p>1. To see if we can reproduce the issue from our side, would you mind also sharing the detailed steps of how you signed to the Office 365 portal with us?
</p>
<p>2. Which browser you are using to sign in to Office 365 portal?</p>
<p>3. What do you mean by saying “I look for sync my mail, contacts and calendar in Android Samsung 5S.”? Do you mean that you are trying to sync your mail, contacts and calendar in Android phone? If so, which Office 365 plan you are using, Business plan or
 Enterprise plan?</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued efforts.</p>

<p>1. I sign the portal from <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Morris,</p>
<p>I have read all the posts above and give my summary below.<br />
The scenario on our side is that you have an Office 365 Business plan and an Outlook.com email account. Now you want to acquire Exchange Online service like email, calendar and contacts with your Office 365 Business plan account.
<br />
<br />
If my understanding is right, it is an expected behavior that you cannot access Exchange Online service like email, calendar and contacts with your Office 365 for Business plan account. This is because that Office 365 for Business plan only contains Office
 applications licenses without online services like Exchange Online licenses. If you want to use the Exchange Online service, you may need to apply for other Office 365 for Business plans which contain Exchange Online service. You can refer to the article below
 for more details about Office 365 for Business plans.<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office-365-plan-options.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Plan Options</a>.<br />
<br />
If my understanding is not correct, please provide us with the username without password that you used to login to Office 365 portal and we will help check the account on our side.
<br />
To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the username information. You can go to this link to access the Private Message:

<p>all is clear.</p>
<p>however, if office 365 business don't includ exchange online, why ask me to point my domain dns to miscrosoft and configure mail users?</p>
<p>i have to redirect the dns to the original server because i don't have mail service in office 365 business?</p>

<p>Hi Morris,</p>
<p>I understand that you, as an Office 365 for Business user, are asked to point your domain to Office 365. It’s because after clicking Add domain, a complete wizard promts which is designed for all Office 365 plans including adding domain and users, setting
 up email and Skype for Business. Considering your scenario, if you only work with the Office applications, you don’t need to point your domain to Office 365. Just verify your domain, add it to Office 365 and skip other steps so that you can use your custom
 domain to sign in to Office 365.</p>
<p>I recommend keeping your DNS pointed to the original provider to avoid any impact on your existing online services related to the domain.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chris</p>

<h3> rcesq01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender&#58; Your PC couldn&#39;t be scanned. Error Code&#58; 0x800106ba</h2>
                    <p>I believe the problem I have began recently within the past week.&nbsp; I have two Windows 8.1 machines (a laptop and tablet). Both are experiencing the same problem. After running a full scan on Windows Defender, a yellow triangle warning sign appears indicating
 that "Preliminary scan results show malicious or potentially unwanted software might exist on your system. You can review detected items when the scan has completed." Right before the progress bar is complete, the scan stops and the following message appears:
 "Your PC couldn't be scanned. The program's service has stopped. You can start the service manually or restart your computer, which will restart the service." The error code is 0x800106ba. Oddly enough, Windows Defender will restart on its own within a minute
 but if I run another full scan, the same results repeat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched this issue and found that in 2013, Microsoft released a defective update definition which caused this problem.&nbsp; I have updated the definition several times in the past two days and the problem persists. I have run Malwarebytes, HitmanPro, and
 Kaspersky's TDSSKiller and show no infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run sfc /scannow and the DISM cleanup-image/restoreheatlh programs and I still have the same problem. At this point I am at my wits' end and don't know what to do. I cannot trust these machines anymore because I believe they are infected with a virus
 or malware that disables Windows Defender.&nbsp; Is it possible that there was a bad update?&nbsp; Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>The original issue you experienced with&nbsp;Defender was most likely due to the release of a "bad" antimalware engine (v 1.1.10903.0) which was released on August 18,2014. Subsequently another antimalware engine&nbsp; (v.1.1.1090<strong>4</strong>.0) was released

<h2>            Reconnecting &#40;and reconnecting...&#41; the data source each time the Main Mail Merge letter is opened.</h2>
                    
<p>I am using an&nbsp;Excel spread sheet as the data source to a Word Mail Merge Letter document type.&nbsp; Each time I open the Word document I am prompted to drive to the data source.&nbsp;&nbsp;I drive to the folder and select the data&nbsp;source then things work fine but it's
 getting tedious.&nbsp; Is there a way to&nbsp;save&nbsp;the path&nbsp;to the data source once and for alll?&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. One or two things can cause Word to get the data source location wrong. These problems vary from one Word version to another. For example, if you have specified fliter options, Word may "lose" the data source when it next tries to open the Mail Merge
 Main Document (although I thought that problem had gone in Word 2003).</p>
<p>2. Also, you may have problems if at any time you have done this with the Mail Merge Main Document:</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. Connect to a data source</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. Save and close the Mail Merge Main Document document</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. Move the data source</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. Re-open the Mail Merge Main Document</p>
<p>&nbsp;e. when prompted to find the data source, you provide the new location/name/sheet name</p>
<p>&nbsp;f. you save and close the Mail Merge Main Document.</p>
<p>After (f), you would probably imagine that Word has remembered the new location and will use it next time. However, that does not always appear to be the case. In that scenario, you can sometimes fix the problem by removing the data source altogether, then
 re-connecting. You can do this as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;g. re-open the Mail Merge Main Document</p>
<p>&nbsp;h. go through the process of re-attaching the mail merge data source (this is probably the most straightforward thing way to go at this point)</p>
<p>&nbsp;i. Enable the MailMerge toolbar (if necessary), e.g. using View-&gt;Toolbars</p>
<p>&nbsp;j. Click the first icon and select Normal Word Document as the document type. This disconnects the data source</p>
<p>&nbsp;k. Save and close</p>
<p>&nbsp;l. Re-open, attach to the data source you really want, then save and close.</p>

<h2>            Mosti have a lumia 950 that is malfunctioning.</h2>
                    i have a lumia 950 that is malfunctioning.&nbsp; i have no phone app, so can't make calls. i have no way to access settings - the normal app is gone. the start screen is also half missing, and i have nothing on the left side. most 3rd party apps are also missing.&nbsp;
 i am unable to tell if there was an update that caused this.&nbsp; i have tried a soft reset 3-4 times.&nbsp; i was able to regain access to email.&nbsp; Everything was fine this morning.&nbsp; any suggestions besides a hard reset?

</p><p>Hi Victoria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, have you made any changes on your phone prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that certain apps, most especially the phone app, is missing on your phone, we strongly suggest that you perform a hard reset on your device. Performing a hard reset would allow us to accomplish two things:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Refresh the settings of your phone, which may lead to the return of the apps that were missing;</li><li>Allow us to narrow down the possible causes of your phone's issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In order to ensure that the files on your phone will be kept, we suggest that you back up your files before proceeding with a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the same issue happens after doing a hard reset.</p>

            Hi boba123,
<br />We are members of a community, were moderators who help others. We are not Employee's of Microsoft. 
<br />If wanting to report Phishing then I would suggest for you to contact Microsoft. Phishing and emails scams seem to be getting worse these days we all get them. I agree if more informaiton was shared with Microsoft they may be able to do more about it. 
<br />In saying all of that the email address I use for reporting phishing on my account is 
<br />*** Email address is removed for privacy *** report phishing by forwarding the email as an attachment.
<br />Also In outlook under Junk mail, Spam how ever it shows up in your email folders you can click on the Junk Mail 
<br />Click on the email you want to report and on the Ribbon and there is a Heading Junk mail. 
<br />Click on this and then click on phishing the email will disappear as it will be sent to Microsoft. 
<br />I hope in some way I have helped and I do understand your frustration it gets to me too. The spam, try to scam, try to get your information. We can help stop it by being proactive and actually reporting it. 
<br />
<br />Kindest Regards,
<br />Sam

<h2>            Reply All Messages not Synchronizing with Address Book</h2>
                    <p>Thank you For the Help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am upgrading my Father's Windows 10 PC Office from the old Outlook 2010 to Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of his contacts have made the transition and under the contact properties the box "show this folder as an e-mail Address Book" is checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that when he hits Reply All to a message, the contacts in that Reply all are shown as new contacts ready to be added to his address book and not as existing contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is even odder is on that same email message I can add that same person to the TO or CC line and that instance of the email address will reference the existing address book.&nbsp; The reply all instance of the email address still comes up as a new contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He likes to hit reply all on messages, click on the name on the message and call the person prior to sending his response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Searched your questions and did not see anyone else having similar problems.</p>

            Think I have your scenario replicated in terms of what you're asking about
<br />
<br />If you add an email address by selecting the contact from the AddressBook and then click on that email address in the To (or CC/Bcc) line, you have the option to "Edit contact card" when clicking on the 3 dots to open the contact detail when clicking on the 3 dots screen whereas otherwise, the only option is to "Add to Outlook Contacts" which is true whether you select an address as part of the reply all or just typing in the email address manually.
<br />
<br />Are we on the same page regarding the problem?
<br />
<br />Don't have an answer but will send an inquiry about it to the MS Outlook team. Just do me a favor and confirm that this is the same issue you're referring to.

<p>Close,&nbsp; If i type it in and have it auto fill in the contact then i can edit that contact as well and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only when I hit Reply or Reply All do i have the problem with the contacts no pulling the information from my address book.</p>

            To resolve the issue, a registry entry needs to be added and set - specifically one called "TurnOnLegacyGALDialog" 
<br />
<br />You can refer to this page and use the "Do It For Me" tool on the page - otherwise you'll have to add/set things manually

<p>I ran Both .reg files to edit the registry and then restarted the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have the problem when I click "Reply All" and Then Click On the Known Contact it doesn't show any of the information that is located in the address book concerning that contact.&nbsp; Then I add the same person manually and then it pulls up all that information.&nbsp;
 The first photo is what i get when i click on the contact after hitting "Reply All"&nbsp; The Second Photo is What I want after i add myself into the email again manually and double click on the name.</p>

            Just for the sake of clarification in terms of terminology, what you're looking for is the contact detail screen not info located in the AddressBook. The  AB is merely a specialized view of the contact folders that have been designated to be members of the AB.
<br />
<br />The above aside, the first screenshot indicates 
<br />#1 - You are using an Exchange server
<br />#2 - You are a member of the Global AddressList (GAL) which is the info that is being displayed
<br />#3 - You have added a member of the GAL to a contact folder
<br />
<br />Is the above correct?
<br />
<br />Haven't tested the above scenario but would be interested in finding out the search/display order of your AB. Open the AB from the ribbon, click on &lt;Tools&gt; in the AB menu bar --&gt; Options
<br />
<br />Just to be clear, this is no longer the same problem/question as originally described since the contact is getting resolved. Now whether "which" contact card can be controlled is another question but certainly there is a difference which I'll be passing along regardless.

<h2>            Calls to UK using Skype will not connect</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have been unable to connect to land line phone to UK Using Skype. &nbsp;I have Skype credit. &nbsp;I can make calls to Canada without a problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using this number in my contact list for several years without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying the call, I get a male voice which says "Sorry but your call cannot be completed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has just started within the past month</p>

<p>It has been a puzzling problem, given the fact that I could use Skype to make a local call but not an international call even though I had Skype credit.</p>
<p>Last night I made some changes and one of them was to change the password.</p>
<p>Because of the time difference between UK and Canada I couldn't try to call last night, but this morning I tried again and low and behold the call went through without problems.</p>
<p>Obviously whatever I did helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
