<h2>            Nokia E71 - some serious issues, and Nokia doesn&#39;t seem to care</h2>
                    Well, I have owned the Nokia E71 for some weeks now, and while I must say that hardware, design, keyboard and display of this phone are well engineered, when it comes to software, there are many serious show-stopper bugs in many very basic applications
 which have been known for months and have so far not been taken care of by Nokia. New buyers, beware: 1) The Email-client has great difficulties coping with more than about 950 messages. After that, out of memory errors and lockups while deleting messages
 appear. Sometimes, repeatedly, all messages are lost. 2) The internet browser crashes at random intervals. 3) The calendar seems to sometimes produce buggy internal files, which in turn make the error intolerant sync-function crash when trying to transfer
 data to a PC. 4) The camera picture is very noisy in low light conditions and has a purple haze. The haze was finally corrected in firmware 210. 5) However, since firmware 200 the clock in not updated in standby. 6) Since firmware 200 t

I think the only thing that will 'dent' NOKIA is a migration towards the competitors.<br />
It usually works this way.... its human nature.<br />

<p>I'm not sure these are all universal issues. My personal exerience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Can't comment (I archive emails so have very few alive at one time).</p>
<p>2. I've never had this problem in extensive use</p>
<p>3. Again never had this problem</p>
<p>4. Agreed -the camera isn't great. However, your argument says that Nokia do not take care of these issues yet you acknowledge the purple tint has been cured. I can't see that mobile phone camera quality is a serious show stopper for "professional" use.</p>
<p>5. True but there is a no big deal workaround</p>
<p>6. Can't comment (I don't use alarms).</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Agreed.</p>
<p>8. Only for apps stored on MC (And why leave it connected in mass storage mode anyway?)</p>
<p>9. Agreed. By report, this does seem to be frail though I have never had an unsolvable problem.</p>
<p>10. Agreed. But hardly a "show stopper".</p>
<p>11. Touch wood - never had a problem</p>
<p>12. Agreed. There are free 3rd party solutions though.</p>
<p>13. Haven't found it a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each to their own of course. Very few issues I would find to be show stoppers and my use is almost wholly business. I haven't looked at the Blackberrys; are they without any problems? Impressive development if that is the case.</p>

<p>@paulw - I totally agree with you. I have N95, E71, and E90. I haven't had&nbsp;any issues with email, or the web browser. It is a common understanding that there&nbsp;are limitations on the phones memory so I say if someone knows that they are&nbsp;going to download so
 many emails, try different phones to see if it fits&nbsp;their life style. E71 is a business phone, but it is not for everyone and&nbsp;not for every user. As for as a camera, for goodness sake this is a<br />
business phone,&nbsp;if someone is looking to get great picture quality, then go and buy a cellphone with a real</p>
<p>camera like N95, which has 5MP. I must say this is not a perfect phone&nbsp;but it is also not a show stopper. I think the problem is people are so use to their old phones and pc that when they try different phones they</p>
<p>automatically expect it to work like their other devices. If there&nbsp;was a&nbsp;perfect phone then people wouldn't be switching phones.</p>

<p>You are right this is first a business phone and my only beef is the MFE could be better if it allowed other folders to be syn'ed as it would be good to be able to move e-mails out of the inbox but not to the phone memory but back on to the exchange server.
 camera is good enough for business use as I travel a lot and use this to take a few shots of different places and show stands. I would like Maps to work more like TomTom as the only tomtom is old with old maps and will not use internal GPS Nokia Maps has new
 maps but not a great interface but I am using this worldwide and it does a good job. shame it cost so much to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My biggest issue is the bluetooth and the way it drops out or the voice from maps doesn't come through on some car kits and the volume even with the wired head set is to low to use on some flights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I would say to Nokia well done as a Business phone this ticks most of the boxes.</p>

<p>Add to your list</p>
<p>- Cannot input non-numeric characters when editing phone numbers, e.g., parens around area code or '-' as separator</p>
<p>- Contacts app offers 'Copy' and 'Cut' in Editing Options (not documented in User Manual, a comment I could make about much of the rest of this device), but no paste!</p>
<p>- PC Suite USB driver has a bug that kills Windows XP every time you try to use Standby mode. No problem before installing PC Suite, big problem afterwards. The driver also doesn't work in the presence of other USB drivers. To upload maps to the phone with
 USB, I had to use a computer with no other USB drivers installed (no iPod, HP scanner, Palm, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could go on (downloading maps and uploading to the device is an exercise in total frustration). I am completely dissatisfied with the E71; I feel like I'm beta-testing this thing -- I run across a new bug almost daily. If Apple or RIM put out stuff like
 this, we'd never have heard of the iPhone or Blackberries. I completely agree with your assessment -- not suitable for business use, unless you like fighting with your tools instead of doing your job.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, I can fix it, but after spending multi-hundred-dollars on a phone, why should I have to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paste is available but only after you have copied or cut an item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Contacts app, if you 'copy' a phone number that came from Outlook (and therefore is in the form (123) 456-7890) and then attempt to paste it into another phone number field, you can't; no paste option is offered. I think this is related to the numeric-only
 problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I was told yesterday via email by a Nokia support person that the phone number fields HAD to be numeric for caller ID to work, because the number it gets from the network is numeric. While I'm sure the last part is right, the rest is nonsense. I called
 my phone from my home phone, my home phone number is stored in my own contact entry in (123) 456-7890 format in the phone since it came from Outlook, and the caller-id lookup in the contacts database worked fine, i.e., my name appeared. The lookup is clearly
 doing what you'd expect -- removing any non-numeric characters from a candidate number to match against.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using the latest version of PC Suite?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. And the latest firmware in the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have loads of USB drivers on my Windows XP machines and never had a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and I both know that Windows problems can be highly configuration-dependent. The issues with the USB driver are two: on my Thinkpad G41 running XP/SP3 with lots of other USB drivers installed (Palm, iPod, HP scanner, Nikon scanner, etc.), uploading maps
 to the phone was impossible. "Unexpected error ..." occurred every time. In addition, after installing PC Suite and Nokia Maps, I can put the machine into standby mode, but when I tap the function key to awaken the machine, Windows crashes, every time. Uninstall
 PC Suite and Nokia Maps and the problem goes away. I'm quite certain it's a bug in the Nokia USB driver, which is the only part of the software that runs in kernel mode and thus can kill the system. I did solve the map uploading problem by moving it to my
 Thinkpad X61 on which I have a pretty vanilla XP/SP3 installation (I run Linux on that machine 99.99% of the time) -- no other USB devices installed -- and the map-uploading problem went away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, US map-data downloading with Nokia Maps was an exercise in total frustration. It was impossible for me during the day; it would just hang. Not get slow; hang (I'm suspicious, though I can't prove it,&nbsp; that Nokia is using a home-brew protocol rather
 than one of the time-tested file transfer protocols, like ftp or http, that keep slogging along even under bad network conditions). I've got a broadband connection via Comcast cable. The only time I was able to download was early in the morning or late at
 night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What problems have you had with maps? Someone on here might be able to help. My user experience has been totally different!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've described it all above. By the way, I'm an experienced (45 years!) software developer and have done a *lot* of OS kernel development (IBM, DEC, and Unix systems). I still write code (R, C, Python, Scheme, web development) every day as part my work and
 investing activities. My point is not to give you my resume, but rather to emphasize that I'm not a person who knows nothing about such matters as we are discussing.</p>

<p>What an excellent article. I too am so disappointed with the E71. To your list I can add 1)&nbsp;it resets all calendar entries back in time if you move to a time zone back in time 2) it looses all applications when you do a firmware update and you have to reinstall
 them. I have just updated to firmware 200.21.006 and don't do it! Now I have these other problems 3) some applications don't work after a firmware update 3) it won't pick up a WLAN using the 'always ask' option unless its SSID is visible 4) it has inserted
 8 bookmarks that can't be deleted 5) it has lost all my settings - home page, email etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this is only 2 hours after the update, I'm sure there is more to come. I think very fondly of my Palm Treo. OK it didn't look so good but all I had to do was put it in its slot and all syncronisations, updates, installs would be done seemlessly at the
 press of a button. Nokia is going backwards.</p>

</p><p>1. Make sure you sign up on Xbox website and create a Gamertag (if you don't have one)</p>
<p>2. Delete the App from SD card and try to re-install it to phones memory</p>
<p>

    <title>How can I stop messenger from switching my status from invisible to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I stop messenger from switching my status from invisible to online automatically&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I am having an issue with the outlook.com messenger feature.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have noticed that if I use the external messenger application, that i can sign out completely from messenger on outlook.com. &nbsp;I recommend implementing in Outlook.com the option to sign out of chat, but stay in hotmail/outlook.com mail, as this is very
 useful, and can be useful if using Outlook.com for business e-mail and not chat.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have noticed that it seems if I am "invisible" or "offline" in outlook.com's messenger, but switch to skydrive, or calendar, etc, and back to mail, that I am getting logged back in, or if invisible, I am getting set back to "online" status. This morning,
 I was offline, but then changed to being logged in as invisible automatically. However, when I checked the calendar, then went back to e-mail, I was automatically in online status. Is there a way to prevent this? I don't want to be switched to online status
 when I am offline or invisible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>Same issue here. With either browser I use, IE10 or chrome, or any computer or tablet, as soon as I close&nbsp; Outlook.com &nbsp;and reopen it, it logs me back on as "Available".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not feel comfortable being logged in as "Available" and it is getting to be very annoying.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thank you for bringing up this issue to our attention. If&nbsp;I understand your issue correctly, your web messenger automatically log you in as available even though you have set to invisible in your last log, am I correct. Let me help you on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For initial troubleshooting, try to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
optimize your browser</a>&nbsp;to make sure that&nbsp;it is free from any cluttered temporary internet files that may have caused the error to appear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Also, could you check if the same thing will happen when you access the account on a different computer? Furthermore, if you have downloaded an add-on that is not compatible with Outlook.com
 page, it might have caused the issue. In this case, it would be advisable to disable the add-ons and try reloading the page. To do this, you may need to contact the respective support group of the browser you're using for assistance.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>There are computer related cases where the firewall, pop-up blocker, and anti-virus software are the cause of the issue. To verify if they are not preventing the page from loading correctly
 or responding to commands, add bing.com, hotmail.com, outlook.com, live.com, and msn.com to the list of safe domains for your firewall, pop-up blocker, and antivirus software. To learn how to do this, refer to the documentation of those security tools for
 instructions.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>If all the instructions we gave did not work, please answer the questions we asked you so we can isolate the issue. Your cooperation and prompt reply will be highly appreciated.</font></font></font></span></p>

            Here's a hint that may be useful.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have 2 Hotmail accounts and I definitely have the above problem on the "Free" hotmail account but I do NOT have this problem on the account that I pay for.&nbsp; The paid account works fine and remembers "Available" or "Invisible" whichever one I select, all on
 the same computer (dual core Processor, 3+gig), same OS(Win7), same everything.<br />
<br />
I've also tried another computer (laptop).&nbsp; Same result.&nbsp; The Paid "Hotmail" account selects and remembers just fine.&nbsp; The "Free" "Hotmail" account will not remember and continually switches me back to ""Available" even though I have repeatedly selected "Invisible".<br />
<br />
I think this eliminates the issues of Computers, filled up caches, cookies, OS's, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
This is really a "Outlook" problem........<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me try to help you with your issue in web messenger. You have mentioned that you're having the same issue with the first user on this thread. His concern&nbsp;is, he keeps getting back to
<em>"available"</em> even he selected <em>"invisible"</em> when switching to Calendar, Skydrive, People and go back to Mail. I have replicated your issue and did not encounter the same thing on my free Outlook account.</p>

            <p>Hello:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is with Windows 8&nbsp; pro with Media center on multiple computers and a tablet with &nbsp;Windows 8 (Not RT) . It occurs with IE10 or with chrome. Antivirus and firewalls are all stock and came with the OS. Defender and Windows firewall respectively.
 I have not added any ad-ons to ie10 on any computer. </p>
<p>I open ie10, it loads the outlook.com page; it goes directly to mail. The messaging icon on the upper right,&nbsp; next to settings gear, is grayed out, or dark. After approximately five seconds, the icon turns on and then the green line next to account picture
 appears. I click on account pic and click on invisible. The line disappears. Once I close the browser and reopen it occurs again.
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need any more information.<br />

            <p>ok guys, pardon my frankness, but this is exactly how I see it - THIS&nbsp;SUCKS! - it should be as simple as clicking it once -&nbsp;"Invisible" and it should stay this way - PERIOD! - this MICROSOFT for crying out-loud - DO SOMETHING ABOUT - or we will look elsewhere
 where such simple matter is just what it is SIMPLE!... I have "amateur" created accounts where staying "invisible" is ONE click of a mouse away and it stays that way...</p>

<br />
We're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you. I simulated the issue on my end. I clicked "Invisible" and I signed out. I signed back in and I was in the same status "Invisible". I suggest that you try it on a different browser to see if the same issue
 is being encountered. Let us know the result.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just did the same thing. I logged in from an old laptop running xp and using ie8. Same thing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine.........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just created another account using the laptop. signed in. a few seconds after logging in, the messaging icon turned on and the green line appeared to the&nbsp;&nbsp; left of the account picture. I switched it to invisible and signed out. I logged in from another
 W8 computer with the account I just created. A few seconds later, &nbsp;about 8 seconds, snap!, it logged&nbsp;me in as available. Same as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know If you want&nbsp;the new account.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you with your concern. As per your description you are loosing emails from the inbox folder in Outlook. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we start with the troubleshooting steps, I need more information on the issue:</p>
<p>Did you make any changes on the computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot and fix the issue related to Outlook emails, you may try the steps below and check if it helps:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 1:</span></p>
<p>Check if you have created rules to delete emails or move them to other folders.</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/delete-a-rule-HP010096701.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/delete-a-rule-HP010096701.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 2:</span></p>
<p>If you have configured a POP account and configured identical emails on the device or on any other computer, verify if '<span style="font-weight: bold">Leave a copy of message on the server</span>' is enabled.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the tools<span>&nbsp; </span>&gt; Account Settings</span> </li><li><span>Highlight existing email account</span> </li><li><span>Click change &gt; More settings &gt;Click Advanced tab</span> </li><li><span>In Delivery section check the box </span><span style="font-weight: bold">'Leave a copy of message on the server</span><span>'.</span>
</li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span> &gt; Next and </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 3:</span></p>
<p>If the above option is already checked then remove any filters applied for emails and then verify the results.
</p>
<p>To do so, once you are in the Inbox, click on <span style="font-weight: bold">View</span> Tab -&gt;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try to use the following command to reset views and check the result.</p>
<p>Close the Outlook program and follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click on </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span> </span>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">All Programs</span><span> </span></li><li><span>Accessories </span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Run</span><span> </span></li><li><span>In the open box type in </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Outlook /cleanviews</span><span> and click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">ok</span><span>. </span></li></ul>
<p>(<span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: There is a space between Outlook and /).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 4:</span></p>
<p>If the above steps fails, create a new profile for Outlook and configure the account, check if the issue occurs:</p>
<p><span>Refer the link to know how to create new profile:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Gallery indexing everything - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sevilla08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gallery indexing everything</h2>
                    Does anyone know of a way to stop the gallery application indexing all the iamges you have on the phone and the memory card? I have a N73 with a 2GB card installed where all of the applications are stored. I have only 14 photos and 1 video on the card
 but gallery has indexed 149 images, most of which are graphics from applications on the card. How can you force this application to only index what is in the images directory?<br />
<br />
Start up at the moment is really painful- up to 1min to show an image and the most recent photos do not show for a further 1min or so, until the small images have been created from the 3Mpixel images.<br />
<br />
Is there anotehr application out there which can be used to view images?

    <title>Dealing with multiple accounts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dealing with multiple accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have various email accounts, and I like keeping them separate especially as some receive a lot more email than I want. However I also like to collate and store emails from the various accounts into one place. On one of my PC's I can do this as it is still
 running Outlook 2010, and I use an @live account ost to store the emails in. I run rules to sort the different accounts when the emails arrive. All is good (or reasonably so).&nbsp; But I can't do that on my phone or tablet, and Outlook 2016 won't let me specify
 an ost as the destination for a pop account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my organised life is becoming out of sync/disorganised until I fire up the PC and sort things.&nbsp; How can I re-jig this to give me the ability to only check the accounts I want, reply using the email address the email was sent to, yet store these all in
 one place??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before we proceed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-How did you configure your Live.com account? &nbsp;IMAP or&nbsp;Exchange Active Synch email account?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you have configured Live.com as Exchange Active Synch, it will not allow you to
</span><span>move/drag and drop nor import/export the emails. Since you are running rules to sort the different accounts when the emails arrive, this rule would not work as its same as moving emails to EAS account. As a workaround configure your account as
 IMAP and verify the result.</span></p>

<p>Nothing prevents you to configure the same account using different protocols (i.e. IMAP &amp; EAS) in the same Outlook profile which provides you with your main calendar.</p>

<p>Maybe am not entirely understanding the landscape so will describe it and then you can tell me where it's not correct.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - You have multiple devices from which you want to access your calendar (from your EAS Outlook.com account)</p>
<p>#2 - On your old system - you sorted and moved emails from different accounts into your Outlook.com MAPI account - calendar included in every sync&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the revised scenario is</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - On your '2016 system you need to move emails to an Outlook.com configured as IMAP&nbsp;</p>
<p>#4 - Take the Outlook.com account configured as EAS out of the auto send/recieve</p>
<p>#5 - When you start up OL'2016 - do a manual S/R on the EAS account to sync your calendar with all updates from the other devices</p>
<p>#6 - When you shut down OL'2016 (or just before you leave the system) - do a manual S/R on the EAS account to sync up calendar updates you made since starting the OL'2016 session so all other devices have everything</p>
<p>
</p><p>the important thing in this scenario is remembering to do a manual S/R at the start and end of your session working with OL'2016 - two steps that you don't/didn't need to do with OL'2010</p>

            <p>I tried a few things over the last couple of days, and decided to move away from Outlook 2016.&nbsp; Ironically I will still use Outlook 2016 to copy messages from one imap account to another (thanks Vardhaman), but that's all it will be used for. I've found
 windows 10 mail and calendar give me a much better experience, especially when using touch/surface pro 3 in tablet mode, and works with all my accounts including calendars even with google accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sad really to see Outlook get so out of step with real day to day needs... even sadder to see other teams at Microsoft 'get it' and have implemented the technology correctly as far as calendars goes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Any way thanks everyone for the help. And to the Office team: please fix this, especially calendar support for imap accounts. When I install Outlook I expect it to be an upgrade from the free mail, not something that doesn't do what the free mail and calendar

</p><p>Just for the same of accuracy - not sure what you're referring to with the sentence above - Outlook<strong> supports copying/moving
</strong><strong>between &lt;imap&gt; accounts without any issues</strong>. The <strong>
problem</strong> arises when the Outlook.com is <strong>configured as an Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) account</strong> - two entirely different things and the limitation with the latter will be gone your Outlook.com account gets migrated to the new Office 365
 Exchange server backend - an ongoing process which hopefully will be completed by year's end or shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>
</p><p>"Microsoft mail" is what I wrote and indeed what I was referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap:&nbsp; I installed Outlook 2016, was immediately having trouble moving messages&nbsp;between accounts, then switched to imap as Vardhaman suggested. Once I did this I could move the emails, but noticed I lost my calendar. It was then I realized I wasn't getting
 any of my google apps calendars etc.&nbsp; This was quite a surprise given the experience on Windows phone is good, and on windows 10 with
<strong>"Microsoft</strong> <strong>mail"</strong> is good. So even if I did add the eas account as a
<strong>duplicate like you suggested, I still wouldn't get calendars or contacts from my other accounts.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence "<strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>mail</strong>" is a better fit for my needs.. it integrates nicely with other accounts across contacts and calendars, and has a much better touch experience. As I said, I hope one day it supports copying between
 accounts.</p>

<h2>            A lot of hotmail errors from multiple accounts, browsers and devices&#58; can&#39;t send mails or search in history</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a couple of months, Outlook has gotten completely unusable. I have multiple hotmail accounts and all of them have the same problem:</p>
<p>- A couple of times per day it is not possible to send mails, I get a error messages stating the message can't be send, no further explanation;</p>
<p>- When I need to view an older mail, the search option is malfunctioning. A lot of the times all mails just won't load;</p>
<p>- When deleting spam mails, the folders empties. When I go back to my inbox, the mails are back in the spam folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening from multiple devices (laptop, desktop, tablet and smartphone), via multiple browsers (Firefox, Chrome and Edge) or apps (the outlook app). It is also very slow with everything we want to do, from open a new mail to open a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible solutions I already tried: </p>
<p>- Delete cookies etc., didn't work;</p>
<p>- Use other browser, didn't work;</p>
<p>- Use another device on another local network, problem still occurs;</p>
<p>- Create a new mail-address, problem still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife has the same problems. We are thinking about not using hotmail/Outlook anymore at all, since it is completely malfunctioning and not user friendly.</p>
                </div>

<span>Hi JacobDubbel,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>It’s interesting that your Hotmail account encounter issues, even if after performing those possible solutions that you have provided. As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you check the
</span><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Service health</span></a><span> status of your account to identify if there’s an issue with the server.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, we recommend checking this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. It discusses most of the common issues and known workaround in resolving Hotmail and Outlook.com account concerns.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</span></p>

<p>Hi Genevieve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply and the suggested actions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the Service health immediately today when I encountered the errors again. All systems were up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article you mentioned shows a work around for not being able to send mails, where I have to check whether my account is up-to-date. It shows it is. Other workarounds for my problems are not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at this moment I still encounter the same problems. I seems service-specific, although the Service health status show everything should be working smoothly.</p>

            Ctrl+Alt+Enter, when pressed at the end of a paragraph,&nbsp;inserts a so-called style separator. You can apply different paragraph styles to the left and right of the style separator. This can be handy for references as you have found; you can also use it
 to limit the text that is included in the Table of Contents.

            <p>What you're seeing is the "style separator." This allows you to apply different styles to two different parts of a paragraph. Only one of the styles is then picked up by a TOC or a StyleRef field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common use of the style separator is for run-in headings. The first part of the paragraph (before the style separator) is formatted with one of Word's built-in heading styles (or some other style that will appear in the TOC) and the rest of the
 paragraph in a body text style that will not appear in the TOC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recently used the style separator in captions that would&nbsp;appear in a Table of Figures. The caption itself was formatted in the Caption style, which would be picked up by the TOF. But the source notes (which appeared in the same paragraph as the caption)
 were in a different style that would not appear in the TOF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not exactly sure how you're accomplishing what you're doing, but if it works, keep doing it. In general, a cross-reference to a caption doesn't include a StyleRef field. The caption itself may include one, however, if you have used the "Include chapter
 number" feature; the caption uses a StyleRef field to pick up the paragraph number of the most recent paragraph in the nominated heading style.</p>

<p>Try it this way</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((B2:B99&gt;=2)*(B2:B99&lt;3))</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Try COUNTIFS()&nbsp; like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=COUNTIFS(B2:B99,"&gt;=2",B2:B99,"&lt;3")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you had cells with the 2 and 3 limits in it (say A1 = 2, A2 = 3) then it could be written like this:</p>
<p>=COUNTIFS(B2:B99,"&gt;=" &amp; A1,B2:B99,"&lt;" &amp; A2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps you just a tad.</p>

            I hadn't looked at his formula to see that, but the way he apparently intends to use it, he would need to change that part to "&gt;=3" as he doesn't seem to want to include 3 in the result.

<h2>            Exporting Custom Fields from Outlook 2016 to Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to export a list of emails from an Outlook folder into a CSV file. I would like to be able to create columns for the "First Name" and "IM Address" fields, but I don't see any way of mapping those fields when I use Outlook's Export Wizard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way of adding these fields to the Export Wizard so that I can map them into the CSV file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Mspping the &lt;FirstName&gt; field is done by expanding the &lt;Name&gt; field (click on the + sign) to see the component fields that make up the &lt;Name&gt; field</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IM Address is not an option via the Outlook wizard</p>

</p><p>You might want to use the free export tool from the CodeTwo folks to get to all the fields</p>

<p>Looked at this: </p>
Why is my calendar not updated instantly on first login?
<div><span>The calendar can take a few extra minutes to sync on the first use, especially if you have a lot&nbsp;of events and meetings. If it's been at least an hour then please submit a support request (Settings --&gt; Help &amp; Feedback --&gt; Contact
 Support) and we can take a look.</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Our app will sync your calendar once per hour to pick up changes made by other clients. Changes made in our app or changes that arrive by&nbsp;email will update in real-time.</span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>it has been over 24 hours.. and since I deleted and re added the account.. it has been over 5 hours. I do not have many events.. maybe 5 for the rest of this year</p>

            <p>My employer upgraded my phone to a Note 5 from Note 4. The outlook App calendar and email worked great on the Note 4. The outlook App on the Note 5 running Android Version 6.0.1 will not show created events on the App calendar when created in the App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I have found.</p>
<p>If I create an event on the Outlook online calendar. The event will show on my outlook calendar online, in Outlook 2016 on my desktop, and NOT on my Outlook App on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create an event from my phone using the Outlook App. The event will show in my outlook 2016 calendar on my desktop but not on the App calendar or the online outlook calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create an event from outlook 2016 on my desktop. The event will show in outlook 2016 calendar, online outlook calendar, but not the Outlook App on the Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried 3rd party calendar apps and got the same results. I have deleted my account. I have reset my account. There are no upgrades for the Outlook App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if this is an issue with the Note 5 and the App or it started when Microsoft started to merge my stuff with office 365, Because I just got email about my new office 365 Account.</p>

    <title>SaveAs PDF in Excel 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron de bruin  say:</h3>
<h2>            SaveAs PDF in Excel 2011</h2>
                    <p>Hi al<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I was looking at the way Excel 2011 save as PDF with VBA.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have this page for Excel 2007-2010:<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee834871(office.11).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee834871(office.11).aspx</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
But when I save with code in Excel 2011 it always add the active sheet name after the file name.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The macro below will add a workbook with one sheet and add the word “Hi” in a few cells and save it as pdf<br />
in your documents folder, you see that I use the date and time as file name.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But if you look at the pdf name you will see that it add the active sheet name after the date and time.<br />
27-sep-11 19-27-02 Sheet1.pdf<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Is this a known problem ?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sub TestPDF()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim wb As Workbook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim FileExtStr As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim FileFormatNum As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim TempFilePath As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim TempFileName As String<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FileExtStr = ".pdf": FileFormatNum = 46<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set wb = Workbooks.Add(1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wb.Sheets(1).Range("A1:D5").Value = "Hi"<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TempFilePath = MacScript("return (path to documents folder) as string")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TempFileName = Format(Now, "dd-mmm-yy h-mm-ss")<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With wb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .SaveAs TempFilePath &amp; TempFileName &amp; FileExtStr, FileFormat:=FileFormatNum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Close SaveChanges:=False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also I notice that it will not use everything that you set in TempFileName as a file name<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In a mail macro I want to use this but it will remove the date and time if I use that<br />
&nbsp;<br />
TempFileName = "Part of " &amp; Sourcewb.Name &amp; "" _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; Format(Now, "dd-mmm-yy h-mm-ss")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we need AppleScript for this to get it working correct ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to present Rich Text Field Content without user sign-in in Mobile App using WebView&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>We are developing Mobile Application in native iOS &amp; Android languages. Mobile Application fetch record from SharePoint Online custom list, this custom list have "Rich Text Box" which
 have HTML data including links, images and videos. We have registered app on Azure and through MSAL Library we are authenticating user and getting data using Microsoft Graph API.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once we get data we display it in WebView UI. We can render HTML content but we cannot fetch images, videos and pdf files because we have to make trip to SharePoint Online and this
 needs sign-in again to SharePoint Online. This is not good user experience, because this requires multiple sign-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we have another issue that we cannot fetch custom list attachment through Microsoft Graph API.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>How can we resolve both the issues?</p>

<p>Hi Bahadur Khan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have consulted senior engineer. I would like to let you know that since your query "user sign-in in Mobile App using WebView" involves&nbsp;Microsoft Graph API, it is best to post a new thread in
<strong><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/microsoft-graph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Graph API forum</a>&nbsp;</strong>for dedicated support. It is a specific channel handling this kind of queries and questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

                    <p>Can someone please advise me re uninstalling my "old Windows 7" which shows up as being 31 Gbs. That's an awful lot of stuff to delete and I'm wondering what exactly gets removed! Will it mean I lose Media Player, my DVD player, etc immediately? Will my
 music in the Media Player library be safe??? Will Microsoft Office 2007 be safe? What about Picasa and all my photos?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just can't get an answer anywhere and would be most grateful for help. I'd love to remove 31G from my laptop to make more space of course, but at what cost? Should I do some sort of backup first?</p>
<p>

            <p>Making copies,backups,images etc is just an insurance policy in case of a future worst case scenario. &nbsp;Windows10,unlike all previous windows OS, will continue to change/evolve every couple weeks or months however MSFT see's fit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What works now,may not work next month. &nbsp;Example: Will WinMediaPlayer exist in future versions of 10 ? Will it be replaced by a cloud based app ? &nbsp;Will you lose access to your music and video ? &nbsp;Will support for certain file formats(avi,blueray) &nbsp;disappear
 ? Will Digital Rights Management be strictly enforced ? Will HDmp4 video 720-1080p or higher no longer play in Win10 ? No way any of us could possibly know the answers. &nbsp;Therefore copy/backup all your stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CD's, DVD's, flashdrives, or an external HDD like your passport. &nbsp;Your choice.</p>

            So, at least on my Dell Venue 8 Pro, the problem seems to stem from setting the storage settings to install new apps to the SD card. If I change it back to internal storage, everything seems to work fine. Are there requirements for formatting a storage
 card in order for Windows 10 to install apps to an SD card?

<p>Hi Systeembeheerderadmin,</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, could you let us know the following information?<br />
1. The file location/URL of the problematic library/site. I have sent you a Private Message to collect it:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations
<br />
Is it a shared library/site? Or, did you directly click Office Online icons in portal?</p>
<p>2. Are you the admin? Have you checked your permission for this site? <br />
If not, maybe the admin has done some changes. You may consult the admin to check it.<br />
If so, or it shows the proper permission, please provide the tenant information with us via PM.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. To protect your privacy,&nbsp;we won't use your credentials. Could you confirm the following information for&nbsp;further investigation?<br />
1. I tested with my test accounts. The first time I open Office Online, the error message appears. but it works fine the second time I click it or pressing F5 to refresh that page, then the issue is gone. Could you check it and let us know the results?</p>
<p>2. By saying "now its not possible to open the page, i dont have permision to the site....", could you let us know more detailed information about it and share some related screenshots&nbsp;and the URL with us?<br />
To upload screenshots, you can click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> in the forum and then click the icon of<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Regarding "Only the admin can open create documents" and your PM, I'd like to explain that after clicking the Office Online icon in portal, the document will be saved to the user's own OneDrive for Business library. And the list shows all the previous
 created documents, which is&nbsp;expected. You can let us know more details if you have further concerns about it.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Jim</p>

<p>Glad to hear that the issue has been resolved and thanks for sharing. For "They logged in...from the user logged out", this behavior is expected.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if the logged in user doesn't have the permission to the logged out user's
