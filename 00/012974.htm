<h2>            Cannot copy and paste</h2>
                    
<p>So i couldnt copy and paste in Outlook in the Office 365 suite.</p>
<p>Advice here is that could be an issue with using Chrome.</p>
<p>However, could nt copy and paste in an installed copy of word either, ie not online.</p>
<p>Just done a windows 10 update, and hey it works.</p>
<p>So just questioning whether this is a Chrome issue or Windows.</p>
<p>IMHO Office 365 and Outlook, so poor functionality.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>According to the description, you were encountering an issue that you were not able to copy and paste in Outlook Web App on Chrome or in desktop Word in Windows 10.<br />
However, the issue is resolved after a Windows 10 update is installed.</p>
<p>From my experiencing, as the issue is resolved after a Windows 10 update is installed, the issue might be related to Windows 10.<br />
To confirm this, you need to check if the issue occurs in IE or Edge before the update is installed.<br />
If yes, it’s an issue related to Windows.<br />
If not, it’s an issue related to Chrome.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Franky</p>

            <p>Alternatively, after doing a "regular" drag/move to the first folder, dragging it from that folder to another folder brings up a plus sign, and the drag becomes drag/copy.</p>

<h2>            Autosum function &#40;and generally adding columns of figures&#41; Excel 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I have used several previous versions of Excel, so am familiar with the program. Not an expert, but could certainly do spreadsheets. Just today downloaded Office 2016 as need to do important financial spreadsheet.</p>
<p>If I go to cell where I want the sum to appear, press autism - it shows the range of cells to add OK, but when I press return, nothing happens - all I see is the formula in the cell where I need the result. &nbsp;Completely wasted my time - If I go to the function
 list, and click SUM, it does show me the range included and indeed the result, but not in the cell where it should be automatically..... am I supposed to cut and paste or write the number down and then type in the cell. This is crazy..... &nbsp;Any help really
 appreciated!!!</p>

            <p>Auto Sum should Work as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill in your Column or row of numbers.</li><li>Now move to first empty cell just below last number in Column. Or just to right of row of Numbers.</li><li>Click autosum.</li><li>At first you will see the formula.</li><li>As soon as you hit tab, or return the answer should appear.</li></ol>
<p>If this doesn't happen, then you&nbsp;either have to go to Excel preferences view and turn off&nbsp;view formula.&nbsp;Or 0n 2016 one of the ribbon tabs there is a checkbox show Formulas (un check that). Or This short cut that worked in 2011 might still work in Excel&nbsp;⌘

<p>What you have is an Office Trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many new computers come with a trial of Office, but after X days or X uses it goes to reduced functionality mode unless you buy it. To continue using it beyond the trial period, you'll need to purchase a Microsoft Office license. Or if you're trying to activate
 a trial version of Office you'll need the correct trial key. <br />

I assume that you mean "from Walmart," not "for walmart."<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; and i didnt get a product key. How can i get one? <br />
<br />
<br />
Neither Windows 7, nor any other version of Windows, has ever included<br />
Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Access, or any other significant application<br />
software. Such programs have to be bought, either by themselves or as<br />
part of Microsoft Office.<br />
<br />
If your previous computer, running an older version of Windows, came<br />
with Office, it was because the vendor who sold it bundled it as part<br />
of the package he sold you, not because that version of Windows came<br />
with it. Some, but not all, vendors do the same with Windows <br />
7 computers.<br />
<br />
In the present case, undoubtedly what you got from Walmart is not an<br />
actual copy of Office, but just a trial version of it; that's why you<br />
got no product key. If you want to continue using Office past the<br />
trial period, you need to buy it.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Lumia 920 camera suddenly not working after app updates</h2>
                    
<p>I have had yellow Lumia 920 now for about 3 weeks and everything worked just fine. Yesterday evening (european time) I saw update reminders on the "shop" tile and there were 3 or 4 of them (Nokia drive+ and some others that I don't remember). I was doing
 something and didn't give a thought but just let the updates to be downloaded and installed and they went fine as far as I know. Today when I tried to take photos the camera suddenly dosen't work anymore. No matter if I click the hardware button or the camera
 app tile, it just flip back to live tiles. Camera doesn't work on Bing search either and not on any apps that utilized the camera.<br />
<br />
I wonder if anyone else have this problem or what I should do next... I have restart the phone a few times but it didn't help... I haven't hard reset it because I have so many stuff in the phone, if there is a easy way to do it I rather not hard reset it...<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are greatly welcome!</p>

<p>Can only suggest that you backup any data, go to Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone as a precursor to returning device as you need to exclude any software issues before implicating hardware.</p>

<p>I had the same problem. &nbsp;Yesterday Extras and Info updated and an hour or so later the phone just went to the Nokia logo. &nbsp;It would not respond, no even when I tried a hard reset by holding down the power button. &nbsp;Now my phone went black and will not turn

<p>&nbsp;Try holding the Volume down + Power + Camera buttons together until the phone vibrates. Then release the power button but keep holding the other two buttons for a further five seconds then release. The phone should reboot. The only adverse effect this will
 have is your date &amp; time may need resetting but you won't lose any personal data or apps.</p>

<p>I also got my camera to work - well, sort of.<br />
<br />
I was actually preparing a hard reset because nothing seemed to work. I connected the phone to my computer trying to copy a few self-made ringtones manually, and suddenly the phone restarted by itself. Just for curiosity I tried the camera and
<span>whoa! It started to work.<br />
<br />
I said sort-of because I tried some apps that use the camera and sometimes it works, sometimes not. Also the original camera app stops working if the above-mentioned apps stop working. Although a restart usually fix it. Now I know that it's probably some software
 glitches and nothing to be too worried about, just hope that Microsoft / Nokia fix it ASAP because it's really annoying that I don't know if it works when next time I click the camera button...</span></p>

<p>I didn't install any new apps right before this problem occurring but there were some updates as you can read from my last post. I can uninstall every single of them and see if they cause the problem, but I wouldn't call the problem fixed even if I find
 the app that cause the problem, because then I don't have that app to use, e.g. I need Nokia Drive+ almost as much as I need camera app, I can't just ditch one of them and call the problem fixed...</p>

            No that surely cant be called as fixing the problem as these two are the basic apps. Are there any camera apss installed. Try unistalling them only one by one &amp; see if it solves the issue. But do remember that uninstalling the apps also deletes the data
 in them.

<p>I haven't installed new apps, I have not made changes......until yesterday the camera was working........today not!</p>
<p>I made hard reset, but the camera is still not working.............I flashed again the firmware..........but I still have the problem...... so I think is not a software problem, because flashing again the firmware bring the phone completely new.........</p>
<p>At this point I will send to technical assistance but when they send me back I will sold it and buy again the iPhone......bye bye Nokia</p>

<h2>            Outlook and Skype shows wrong pictures and wrong user info</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have recently joined a new company and this task got assigned to me.<br />
<br />
We have an old Exchange on-prem solution but has started to move a few users to 365.<br />
<br />
On those users we have encountered some quite strange issues.<br />
<br />
If you go into contacts in Outlook 2016 and search for "Eric Winterberg" you can see a picture of someone else in the company and the user info can also show someone else´s email.&nbsp;<br />
Also in Skype for business we encountered that the pictures and information is faulty.</p>
<p>This morning one user was typing a message to another user on skype and it sais that the message is from a whole different person.<br />
<br />
Anyone have an idea of what could possibly be wrong here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p>Hi Robert, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please perform following troubleshooting steps one by one to narrow down the possible cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.First, may I ask if the issue happens to the online users, on-prem users or both of them? Additionally, where is the wrong contacts from? On-prem or online?
</p>
<p>2.What is your current deployment? What is the version of on-prem Exchange server and do you have Skype for Business on-prem server?
</p>
<p>3.Try to check the wrong contacts' email addresses and run following cmdlet via Exchange online PowerShell or Exchange on-prem Management Shell. To protect your privacy, I will send you a
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">PM (Private Message)</a> to collect the result.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Get-mailbox -identity &lt;email address&gt; | fl</span></p>
<p>4.Please collect some screenshots of the wrong contacts showed in Skype for Business and Outlook if convenient.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<p>Hi Robert,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late response, I was out of office in the last 3 days. May I ask if you were able to get the PowerShell results from your on-prem Exchange? It's important for us to narrow down the possible cause of the issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Change in how to select a row or column in a PPTX 2016 table&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> betsy herrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change in how to select a row or column in a PPTX 2016 table&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It used to be in previous versions of PPTX, one could hover the cursor to the side of a row (or top of a column) and the cursor would change to a black arrow with which one could then click to select the entire row. In 2016, the black arrow still appears,
 but does not respond to clicking. I cannot select the entire row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I know how to select the row from the ribbon, but why would this easy solution be removed? Is there a trick to it in 2016 that I am not seeing?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p><span>Hi Vaneessa_365,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the screenshots you provided, you are using Office 365 account, as all items disappeared in Outlook Web App, please login Outlook Web App-&gt;select and right-click the
<strong>Sent Items Folder </strong>-&gt; then choose " Assign Policy", is there any retention policy applied on this folder? You may check whether there are any retention policy assigned to your account:

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please also check your <strong>
Delete items folder</strong> and <strong>Recoverable Items folder </strong>in Outlook Web App to see if you can find these disappeared items:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, please check whether you have set any inbox rule applied for Sent items folder:

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. I've checked my "Assign Policy", and it's 7 years. I have had this email for 4 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes! My emails are in the web app. Thank you. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to recover all of them as they are mixed in with regular email. But this definitely helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted all of my rules- just to be safe. There weren't any rule set up for sent items. All of my rules applied to "received from" items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im happy i can recover my emails, but I want to make sure there isn't a bigger issue. These issues began with the outlook 365 updates in May. I'm wondering if the issues are server related, and if that's the case, where do you recommend my IT team should
 look?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>When my sent folder items disappeared- so did my signature. When i checked, my signature is still saved in preferences, but just the settings were not selected.
</li><li>I have had issues with emails going out with blank body of texts. For example, I send an email with: attachments and a body with a couple paragraphs. The email sends successfully but can't be found in my sent items or my drafts folder. I find it in my deleted
 folders. The recipients of the email only receive an email with attachments and no body of text. In my deleted folders, the email appears the same way. But, if i attempt to forward this "sent" email then the body of text reappears and sends with both the body
 and attachments.&nbsp;</li><li>Sent emails are viewable in the "sent folder" on my iphone device but not outlook 365 for Mac. I'm using ioS Microsoft "company portal" app, so I don't think this should be an iphone issue. It always worked before June.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the help!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Vanessa_365,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you mean after updating Outlook for Mac client, the previously sent emails in Sent folder are all mixed up with Inbox regular emails?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To scope whether it is server issue, please temporarily close Outlook desktop client, then take a test on
<strong>Outlook Web App</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Create a new email with body text and attachment-&gt;send it to a specific recipient.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. After sent, please check whether the email is still going into deleted items folder in Outlook Web App, and whether the body text is missing.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Please let recipient check if he can view the body of the email.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Forward it to other recipient to check the emails.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About signatures, you may select it to see if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>You may need the specific Nokia drivers that are installed when installing PC Suite or Ovi Suite, as the Microsoft generic Bluetooth drivers do not work properly / contain the full functionality that the Nokia drivers provide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that under Windows 7, I do not require to install Nokia software to gain the proper drivers for the device I am using (though I have not used Bluetooth to be honest). Instead, I would receive the same message at times, same as you guys. I would
 select the drivers to be found online through Microsoft (there is an option to that wording). Try that and see how it goes.</p>

<p>I have just installed Windows 7 and niether my N95 8GB or my N900 will install correctly, they both worked until I installed the Windows 7 Ultimate althought the N900 had limited functions on the PC suite. I can still send files from my pc to my n95 but
 not the n900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Probably isn't a Windows problem, as the underlying communications stack provided by Microsoft isn't that specific. Usually for all persons using Bluetooth devices, you will have to use the drivers provided on CD/DVD or downloaded from the website, to gain
 full functionality for your device. If Windows Update can't find the drivers for your N900, then contact Nokia using the form at the top of the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the drivers you have are only for Vista, and not stated as compatible with Windows 7, try running the installation package under Compatibility Mode for Vista.</p>

<p>HI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the nokia n95 which has been firmware ug to latest, also have acer 5536 with bluetooth with windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>windows finds loads of blutooth drivers but 6 peripherals are not loaded, then i install nokio ovi suite latest one that gets rid of&nbsp;3 then my device in the bluetooth devices works fine i.e windows can play the music etc and connect to the internet through
 my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so from a point of view everything seems to work sync music internet and making calls, bu i am still left with the 3 peripheral drivers if i choose to select driver manually it brings a long list of item but if i select one it comes up with a warning obviously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i installed the above item it removed my existing broadcom drivers and loaded som of its own but i was left with 4 peripheral drivers not found? rebooted a couple of times no joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>phone still worked ok, but would not allow connect using laptop as handsfree device or calls only internt worked and music. but what i didnt like was it always kept a connection wit h my phone as before it only connected when you asked it to connect to web,
 music, or make a call, ,you know when phone is linked to the laptop as you get brackets around the bluetooth symbol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so removed this and reloaded the hp broadcom driver pack for my internal bluetooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i think the drivers are there but maybe windows cannot match them??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also when my ohone is connected via BT if i browse the phone that fine no probs but when i want to play a track it says ftp connection and starts to copy the file onto laptop in the temp directory i thought it would have streamed or something??</p>

<h2>            Same view for everyone under one drive.</h2>
                    
<p>We have a small business with three offices in different states. &nbsp;I originally got one drive for business to set up a file system that everyone (with permission) could see and sync to the cloud and we would all have the same "view." &nbsp;In other words, if I
 upload a folder under my files, I want it to be under everyone's else's my files and not under files shared with me. &nbsp;I want everyone to see the same thing as if they were looking at our physical server.</p>
<p>I've tried sharepoint, but we have too many files for that to work. &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions to help in setting this up in one drive? Is it possible to set up? Is there a Microsoft product that would do this in the cloud?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Amanda,</p>
<p>Everyone’s OneDrive for Business library is respective and other users can’t see the files a user uploaded in his OneDrive for Business library without sharing.<br />
Given the situation, there are two options for you.<br />
1. Share the documents you uploaded with other people in your organization to let everyone see the files in the
<b>Shared with me</b> folder.<br />
Note: The storage of OneDrive for Business is 1TB.<br />
2. Upload the files to the team site to let everyone in the same view. The storage of the team site may be smaller than OneDrive for Business, so if you want more storage, it is suggested buying more storage. When the storage of the team site reaches 1 TB,
 you can’t add any more storage because the maximum storage is 1TB per site collection. For more detailed information, please refer to

                    <p>Hotmail was hacked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the process of changing phone numbers so I cant use that for verification (I could, but you wont let me because derp security).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support Live Chat is just Google Live.</p>
<p>Escalations team is Google 24 hour response with the only search result being "DERP VERIFICATION FORM" + 'Helpful Hints'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive missed job interviews because of this. I cant use my Windows Phone properly because of this. Its looking like I'm going to have to migrate half a decade of my digital life to another email provider because of this, and literally EVERYTHING I have done
 online for years has been though this email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this. What (short of sacrificing my first born, though I'd still consider it at this point) do I have to do to get my email back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will a copy of my drivers license and passport do?</p>
<p>Will a personal conversation about my account activity do?</p>
<p>Would a DNA test suffice?</p>
<p>Would you like me to tattoo the email address to my arm, cut it off, and send it in, as a tribute to the security gods?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I swear, I SWEAR, that if you say "derp account verification form" or "derp its YOUR responsibility", I will put a gypsie curse on you.</p>

            <p>Ok, so obviously I've filled in that form, in fact I've done it three times. And obviously it's hasn't worked, thus the anger surrounding references to the accursed verification form. And obviously 'helpful hints' in regards to this issue aren't going to
 cut it. In addition to this, you have obviously copy pasted a response without actually paying any attention to what I have written.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why the entirety of the worlds largest software conglomerate has so much difficulty providing genuine support, instead of simply referring people to simple 'self-help' pages. I've been through them all. I don't want a self help page, or
 any more 'helpful hints', or handy verifications forms. I want a human being to make a human judgement call on whether or not the account is mine. It's not impossible, it's just the worlds most savage bureaucracy being sold to me as 'procedure'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What at is the point of escalating a request if all they go is look at the verification form and say "well you'll have to &nbsp;do it again". Why do you think I escalated it in the first place? What do they ACTUALLY do? Why is a critical mass of identity documents
 and a genuine conversation about my account somehow less secure than filling out a form that any hacker could fill out if they took even a cursory glance at my account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be simple. Very, very simple. Hell it's easier to access my bank account if I'd &nbsp;forgotten my details than this rubbish.</p>

<p>Ok, so obviously I've filled in that form, in fact I've done it three times. And obviously it's hasn't worked, thus the anger surrounding references to the accursed verification form. And obviously 'helpful hints' in regards to this issue aren't going to
 cut it. In addition to this, you have obviously copy pasted a response without actually paying any attention to what I have written.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why the entirety of the worlds largest software conglomerate has so much difficulty providing genuine support, instead of simply referring people to simple 'self-help' pages. I've been through them all. I don't want a self help page, or
 any more 'helpful hints', or handy verifications forms. I want a human being to make a human judgement call on whether or not the account is mine. It's not impossible, it's just the worlds most savage bureaucracy being sold to me as 'procedure'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What at is the point of escalating a request if all they go is look at the verification form and say "well you'll have to &nbsp;do it again". Why do you think I escalated it in the first place? What do they ACTUALLY do? Why is a critical mass of identity documents
 and a genuine conversation about my account somehow less secure than filling out a form that any hacker could fill out if they took even a cursory glance at my account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be simple. Very, very simple. Hell it's easier to access my bank account if I'd &nbsp;forgotten my details than this rubbish.</p>

<p>You realise that's just support chat don't you... The very same support chat that can't access any account details. The very same support chat that referred me to escalations. I'm sorry mate, but you really don't have a clue about this do you. You are just
 pasting links to other places that don't involve you actually doing any research or making any serious recommendations. I know nobody on this public forum can help me. What I want is INFORMATION. Has anybody recovered an account without filling in the belligerent
 Verification Form? If so how? And why does Microsoft think this its acceptable to treat it's customers like this.</p>

<p>I'm getting a redirect loop on that link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw. i have a problem with getting the account back as well. My verification backup email is my ISP's old domain on .yu which was deleted as it stood for Yugoslavia which no longer exists. Quite a big problem since i cant access that email in any way, checked
 with my ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cant fill out the form enough as i've used the account many years ago and i mostly used it for game accounts, havent really done much correspondence. Account in question is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

            <p>Just to clarify this for everyone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We DON'T want to be referred to 'Helpful hints', they can't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. we DON'T want to be directed to self help pages. (Ive read them all, as I'm sure everyone else in this situation has).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. We DON'T want to go to Microsoft Support Live Chat, they do exactly the same thing as the mods on this forum do, just direct people to pages until they finally send someone to escalations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. We DON'T just want to be directed to escalations. I've been there and they direct me to the maddening Verification Form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. We DO, I repeat DO, want to know WHAT TO SAY to escalations in order to get them to do SOMETHING OTHER THAN DIRECT ME TO THE VERIFICATION FORM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how many times I've said this. I understand social engineering, I understand the whole hacking and security thing, I understand that Microsoft has their enormous throbbing reputation to maintain. But it is ENTIRELY UNREASONABLE to think that
 your entire security system and support operation revolves around a half-**** verification form. I AM the rightful owner, and I can prove it. Its that simple.All you have to do is get someone in escalations to actually have a conversation, instead of just
 being condescending and saying rubbish like "I understand your frustration" and "It must be very annoying for you".</p>

    <title>Why is Excel 2016 different from Excel 2016 - Powerpivot Add-in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael_confused  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Excel 2016 different from Excel 2016 - Powerpivot Add-in</h2>
                    <p>I have recently sought support regarding an Add-In that I require that does not seem to be working (Power pivot in Excel 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Start-the-Power-Pivot-in-Microsoft-Excel-add-in-a891a66d-36e3-43fc-81e8-fc4798f39ea8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Start-the-Power-Pivot-in-Microsoft-Excel-add-in-a891a66d-36e3-43fc-81e8-fc4798f39ea8</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the instructions on the website I tried to enable the add-in but there is no Add-In to enable. I contacted the support chat and bounced between several departments. Eventually I have now been told that the add-in is not provided in the version
 of Excel 2016 that is part of Home 365 (via some forum where other users have made complaints, NOT from the sales site) and is only available in Excel 2016 (?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_winother/office-365-home-premium-excel-powerpivot-add-in/8969378b-7537-4413-9410-57799c11e8b5">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_winother/office-365-home-premium-excel-powerpivot-add-in/8969378b-7537-4413-9410-57799c11e8b5</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact the only place that I, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">or Microsoft support staff</span>, can find where such an issue is detailed is in this forum where other customers are trying to get the feature enabled; Presumably because they also
 needed to use the feature right now, not waste hours talking to support. I was directed to this link by your own staff as irrefutable ‘proof’ that my request is wholly unreasonable! Really?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowhere on the 365 website does it clearly explain that the Excel version is not fully featured. In fact the 365 “lease” model is actually promoted as somewhat superior to the Office 2016 suite in that
<em>“Office as a one-time purchase does not include any of the services included in Office 365”.
</em>Please note<em> </em>It doesn’t mention anywhere that Office 365 does not include any of the service offered in the Office 2016 suite</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-365-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/office-365-home</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft then goes further to actively discourage purchase of the Office Suite as per below. Still there is no mention of loss of functionality which is exactly why I was drawn into the purchase 3 years ago</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-GB/article/What-s-the-difference-between-Office-365-and-Office-2016-ed447ebf-6060-46f9-9e90-a239bd27eb96" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-GB/article/What-s-the-difference-between-Office-365-and-Office-2016-ed447ebf-6060-46f9-9e90-a239bd27eb96</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing mentioned in the comparison page either, which I assume would be the logical place for Microsoft to come clean:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly advise exactly what I am supposed to do in this situation. I feel that I have been conned and I am very angry. This is something that I expect when dealing with a disreputable company, not one like Microsoft</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not seem to have any option other than pay for an Office Suite version of Excel 2016. There, yet again, is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nothing on the “Standalone” Excel 2016 website to indicate that this will indeed solve my issue</span>. In fact the power pivot feature is criticised heavily which is the only reason I would consider this purchase</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Kindly advise what the solution to this issue is. I do not want to spend hours on the phone to the “Professional” support desk to get to the same conclusion and dead end

<p>
</p><p>It is cynical, but in the end it is to the point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of separate threads of thought that come together in the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, some genius in marketing decided that in 2016 PowerPivot would be part of the "Business Intelligence", "BI", set of features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, from your question you probably have a "consumer" license like 365 Home / Personal / University.&nbsp; That is consumer NOT business, so you don't "need" "business intelligence" features ... (not my idea ...).&nbsp; But, unfortunately the same big brain decided
 only "big business" needed business intelligence (not at all an intelligent business decision on MS's part, but there you go!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, for some mysterious reason they decided to include the BI in the standalone version of Excel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, the MS documentation about this limitation of BI is EXTREMELY vague and hard to find!&nbsp; This link is the only place I've seen it explicitly stated, but it is buried in the diagrams and very hard to find:
</p>
<p><span><a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/09/18/new-ways-to-get-the-excel-business-analytics-features-you-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://blogs.office.com/2015/09/18/new-ways-to-get-the-excel-business-analytics-features-you-need/</span></a></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally, yes, if you have one of the bundles that does not include BI you have to buy and install the Standalone Excel over your 365 subscription to get the feature. Like I said, it doesn't make business sense to me, but lately MS seems to be going out of
 it's way to shoot itself in the foot every chance it gets.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Steinle88,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for participating in forum!</span></p>
<p><span>If you state that the installation does not respond during the "<span><span><span>Checking</span></span></span><b>
</b><span><span><span>for</span></span></span><b>
</b><span><span><span>updates</span></span></span>" and you get this message
<span><span><span>for</span></span></span> a long time, I would ask you to click Cancel. This action cancels the scan but not the installation. This behaviour can occur if the computer cannot
 communicate with the service that provides the <span>
<span><span>updates</span></span></span><b>
</b><span><span><span>for</span></span></span> the Zune software.
</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not help, I would suggest that you try to get your Zune software from the link below rather than from zune.net:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=ab1a80ed-e337-4346-9d5a-f00cfb467514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=ab1a80ed-e337-4346-9d5a-f00cfb467514</a></span></p>

                    <p>Begging assistance, this is driving me nuts!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When adding our company's logo to any excel form, it seems our entire form gets squashed and is distorted when printed, is converted to a PDF (which is integral to our business), or when in Page Layout view.&nbsp; I have tried using PNG and JPEG, neither affects
 the outcome.&nbsp; Needing suggestions to solve this problem, pretty please! I hate just narrowing the picture so that it displays properly when converted.&nbsp; Running Windows 10 Pro. See examples below...</p>

<p>Hey Jawwadkhalid, Welcome to the Nokia Forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be sure that you are allowing your phone enough time to buffer the video before you start to play by giving it a minute or two before viewing the video.</p>
<p><br />
If your device is still lagging during playback even whilst you have let your phone buffer well in advance and try free up some phone memory if it is nearing full capacity and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could also try a soft reset using *#7780# security code 12345 by default if prompted.</p>
<p>Please be sure to create a back up using <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-ovi-suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite </a>beforehand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this has helped.</p>

            Hi, I got same problem while streaming youtube. It really has a poor quality and does'nt run smoothly. I also noticed that you cant scroll the video slider while playing video in horizontal position and while playing mp3. I really wish i could jump to
 the portion of the music which i want to hear.

            @ nyehpoi,<br />
<br />
It could be that the speed of your connection is not sufficient for streaming high quality videos. Please make sure you use fast wifi to do this. If you are using operator broadband, please make sure you have 3G connection and that the signal is strong.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Signed E-Mails with Attachments Bug</h2>
                    
<p>this bug has been there since the preview, i thought that would be fixed with the final version.</p>
<p>for signed mails with attachments, the size is always 0kb (obviously, they are larger than that).</p>
<p>any fixes for this in sight?</p>
