    <title>Will new Windows phones that fit in your pocket be available in 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will new Windows phones that fit in your pocket be available in 10 years if you&#39;re not part of a big company&#39;s network&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I ask because I'm a diehard fan of using a Windows phone to keep my life in sync in a device that can fit in my pant's pocket or hang on my belt.
</p>
<p>I've also always used Outlook (2003, 2013 &amp; now 2016) that ActiveSyncs my Contacts, Appointments, Calendar and even Tasks, at least until Microsoft stopped having Tasks show up in Outlook 2010 Mobile &amp; I had to discover the free OneTask APP.</p>
<p>So since about 2000, I've had 5 Motorola MPx-220 Windows flip-phones, 2 Nokia Lumia 635 phones &amp; now a&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 950-XL.</p>
<p>Heck, maybe some younger people out there don't know but in the beginning of ActiveSync, you actually bought a disc with the ActiveSync program on it &amp; you would install it on the computer that had the Outlook on that you wanted to stay in sync with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those were way back in the days before somebody renamed&nbsp;programs as APPs that you now either buy or rent on monthly terms after downloading it. Or sometimes they just give you access to their APP that is still on their server. (I hate all of that :-(&nbsp; )</p>
<p>Then to sync your phone &amp; your Outlook (2003 for me), you connected the phone to the PC with the cable or maybe even using Bluetooth if you were a gutsy young techie. ;-)</p>
<p>Those days are gone, luckily. ;-)</p>
<p>I tried the Outlook APP on a stupid Android (Samsung Galaxy J-7) on my T-mobile account when my Lumia 635 kept having problems &amp; I was trying to decide if just using an APP on a phone that has a good % market share would be OK.</p>
<p>I hated it and they got it back well before the Returns time limit expired.</p>
<p>As an example of its foolishness, you could see the Notes section on Contacts but you couldn't create one or edit one.</p>
<p>I'm sure that there were other serious shortcomings but that was enough for me to return it while I still could.</p>

            Nobody knows what devices will be available in 10 years. The Outlook app on my current Android works perfectly, incl. creating and editing notes in Contacts - all other MS apps also work much better than on any Windows phone and receive very regular updates.

<p>I realize that nobody knows the future of almost anything in life that far down the road but I keep reading and hearing from people even in the industry that Windows phones are on their death bed and are being read their last rights. I sure hope they're

<p>I'm glad to hear that the Android Outlook APP works good for you and that they fixed that design "oops" that I'd encountered. I'd always wondered how it had ever even gotten out of their product research and development process with it doing what I'd experience.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Reality check, based on hard facts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no more development by Microsoft of new features or hardware for Windows Mobile - this is official. There will be support in the form of bug fixes and security updates according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Support for Windows 10 Mobile is almost the same as other editions of Windows 10, but the support duration is slightly longer. Each version of Windows 10 Mobile is supported for around&nbsp;<strong>26 months</strong>&nbsp;(2 years and 2 months) from the date of release.
 End of support dates for each version of Windows 10 Mobile:<br />
<br />
Windows 10 Mobile version&nbsp;<strong>1511</strong>&nbsp;build&nbsp;<strong>10586</strong>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Initial Release</strong>: January 9, 2018<br />
Windows 10 Mobile version&nbsp;<strong>1607</strong>&nbsp;build&nbsp;<strong>14393</strong>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Anniversary Update</strong>: October 9, 2018<br />
Windows 10 Mobile version&nbsp;<strong>1703</strong>&nbsp;build&nbsp;<strong>15063</strong>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Creators Update</strong>: June 11, 2019<br />
Windows 10 Mobile version&nbsp;<strong>1709</strong>&nbsp;build&nbsp;<strong>15254</strong>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Fall Creators Update</strong>: December 10, 2019 *<br />
<br />
<strong>*</strong>&nbsp;Tentative dates, support may be extended. The exact date will be announced within 1 year of these dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Lumia Support Lifecycle</strong><br />
<br />
Lumia phones are supported for&nbsp;<strong>2 years</strong>&nbsp;from the date they are launched. This means they get&nbsp;<strong>Feature Updates</strong>&nbsp;during those 2 years. Each Feature Update is supported for around&nbsp;<strong>26 months</strong>. The last Feature Update
 that a Lumia phone gets at the end of the 2 years will be supported for around 2 years, so the total support period for a Lumia phone is around&nbsp;<strong>4 years</strong>&nbsp;from the date it is launched.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In short, a Lumia phone will get Feature Updates for 2 years and it will get Cumulative Updates for the last Feature Update for 2 more years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your 950XL was released in November 2015, so 2 years have already gone - please note that it is irrelevant when you actually purchased your particular device, the clock is ticking from the point of release to market.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP X3 Elite was released in August 2016 so is already over 1 year old, same as the Alcatel Idol 4S, which is the only other worthwhile W10M handset that can still be bought. I don't believe we will see anything else worth mentioning released on a platform
 which has been effectively abandoned and is on life support.</p>

<p>Thanks for all of this. I've hoped to hear some real insider info and this sounds like it. My phone says that it has Windows 10 Mobile version&nbsp;<strong>1703</strong>&nbsp;OS build 10.0.15063.674</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa22af16-a65e-4270-9cd2-a5d544fb5df8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa22af16-a65e-4270-9cd2-a5d544fb5df8" height="367" width="223" /></a></p>
<p><strong>How do&nbsp;I update it myself to Windows 10 Mobile version&nbsp;1709&nbsp;build&nbsp;15254&nbsp;/&nbsp;Fall Creators Update: December 10, 2019, or will it be automatically updated when it is released?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do realize that their support has nothing to do with when I bought my phone. But I guess some people wouldn't understand that and that is different than what most people consider to be a "warranty".</p>
<p>As far as the HP X3 Elite and the Alcatel IDOL 4S, I'd been reading up on both of those already as you saw with that article that I posted to start this Discussion.
</p>
<p>It bums me out to see even you say that the Windows 10 Mobile is a "platform which has been effectively abandoned and is on life support."</p>
<p>I guess that means that my next phone will probably end up being some Android and I'll just run the Outlook APP?</p>
<p>I'm a T-Mobile customer and when I needed to replace my Lumia 635, they'd already stopped selling any Windows phones so I bought my Lumia 950-XL unlocked and slid in my card and went thru some steps and it worked. I'd made sure that could be done and I guess
 that since AT&amp;T Wireless and T-Mobile are on the same type of system, the phones can be interchanged.</p>
<p>I did find about 6 silly useless AT&amp;T APPs on it, which I deleted back then since I would never use them. But they all reappeared last week when I did a Hard Reset.
</p>
<p>I guess I understand why since that's how the phone had shipped originally.</p>

<p>Thanks for the info. I guess I can understand from a business standpoint, that since Microsoft has only been able to build such a tiny % of the market for Windows Mobile OS, it makes sense to stop fighting the Androids &amp; iPhones that own the smartphone market
 worldwide and even here in the USA.</p>
<p>It's got to be a nightmare dealing with APP approval, privacy &amp; security in APPs customer&nbsp;service and the rest like accessories sales &amp; development if those costs aren't underwritten by a big sales base.</p>
<p>I don't know if this might be playing into Bill Gates or upper management deciding to pull back and just provide Office Mobile APPs for Androids, but maybe pride &amp; ego played into the decision.</p>
<p>After all, Microsoft has always been top dog at anything they bit into.</p>
<p>Makes you wonder.</p>

<p>Hi NM_PHD,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
To protect users from setting passwords to their own OneNote sections, it is not feasible to do this setting in OneNote directly.<br />
You need to configure this setting for all the end users using Group Policy.<br />
<br />
Right click the “Disable password protected sections” and click “edit”.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38eec4f2-9e47-4946-b2f7-f49b2ac42a3a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38eec4f2-9e47-4946-b2f7-f49b2ac42a3a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Click “Enabled” and then “OK”.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6e2c779-0fe0-42c1-8e86-27a468c3771c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6e2c779-0fe0-42c1-8e86-27a468c3771c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>

<br />
A Windows shortcut (what you are trying to open) is only a pointer to a file. If the file is moved or deleted, it will not work. That is what you are working with now: a shortcut. The file itself may still be around but not linked to the shortcut.<br />
<br />
To find the file you need to use the Windows search capability. Since you did not tell us which version of Windows you are using, we can't give any hints on how to do this. However, that search facility does not automatically locate all files. You have to go
 into Advanced search and tell it to look in system and hidden folders to locate all files. This is a slower search.<br />

            Well,I am using Windows 7 and I have to say that I am not a computer expert,but I really have no idea what could have happened to the file itself.So,could you please explain me,if you know,how could I locate even the hidden files?Thank you.

            I don't have Windows 7 on this computer. The basic idea, though, is that you type the name of the file in the windows search window. Then press Enter. It looks for the file. It will probably find your shortcut again but not the file. (See screenshot below.)<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ded4ec6-2692-4c08-8b21-a74153e0c36a" /><br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the same search run as an Advanced Search - finding second file in a System Folder.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4c2a83a-3c0d-44ba-860f-4836c5fcb4a3" /><br />
<br />
Note, I don't know how your file could have been put in a hidden folder but it is worth a look. I would run the search on your c: drive rather than in any folder. It may take a while.<br />

<h2>            Disable Mail&#47;Calendar within Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>A recent update to Windows 10 has expanded Mail functions which I don't want.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook 2016 for my office.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening is we don't use Mail.&nbsp; We use Outlook for reasons of our management system that integrates with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, clicking a link within an Outlook email, will open the link in Mail.&nbsp; We don't have Mail set up and so it is impossible to get to the link without doing a cut/paste of the link in a NEW email.&nbsp; This breaks the chain.</p>
<p>

    <title>Why do I have to sign in all the time. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why do I have to sign in all the time.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: </strong>Why do I have to sign in all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does this peice of **** called "Outlook" keep signing me out. I shouldnt have to sign in every time I use it on my own home computer. Why does Outlook have to bundle all the chorospondence together. There is a sent file! Why have both? Its confusing.
 Especially when you can mark an email as unread which I occaionally do it is may have some importance in the next few days. There is only one improvement in Outlook. And that is the blue bar across the top that acts as a menu, is always stays as the content
 moves up and down. This saves time because I dont have to go back to the top to deleat. Hooray for you. But that is it. Hotmail was superior in every other way in which I use or care to use email. I may be leave you soon! Daniel

            <p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me further assist you with your concern about being able to sign in automatically on Outlook.com to view your emails. Please be informed that it depends on the browser setting that you have or if you have shared laptops or computers. If one optimizes
 browser and cleared cached files, once you go to your Inbox again, it will prompt you to sign in with your credentials.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest that you check the browser settings that you have or ask the person that you are sharing computer with not to delete cached information on the browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that this was helpful. If you have other concerns, do not hesitate to respond to this post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            steps and distance during a horseback riding</h2>
                    My Wife has a band 1 and is using it when she goes horseback riding. She set the band on a run with the gps off. Is the millage recorded the actual distance traveled or&nbsp; are horse steps counted?

Thank you for bringing this question to us. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
There is a dependence of the swinging action on the arm for accurate step count.&nbsp; Additionally, Band is intended to track the human gait.&nbsp; It is unlikely the distance traveled while on horseback as recorded by your Band is accurate - horse steps vs. people
 steps and, I assume, less arm swinging than if walking.&nbsp; </span></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 restore from back-up or disk image</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Pro and Microsoft outlook 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently my C drive crashed and I attempted to restore the disk image to a new drive to no avail using the Microsoft image restore software.&nbsp; Essentially I gave up and reinstalled 7 onto a different
 drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am trying to do is restore my Outlook 2010 address book files and not having any luck.&nbsp; I found out how to view the&nbsp;image of my crashed drive as a virtual drive and&nbsp;retrieved the .pst file.&nbsp; I restored the email files but no address information was
 recovered.&nbsp; I click on address book contacts and it is empty.&nbsp; I thought in Outlook 2010 the contacts were in the PST file as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Contacts are in the PST file but the AddressBook and contact folders are 2 different things so a lot depends on what actions you have taken as part of the restore process.</p>
<p>If the restored PST file has been set as the "default" PST file for the profile, then generally the contact folder in the same tree as the INBOX is automatically set to be shown as part of the AB. The AddressBook is nothing more than a "view" of one or more
 contact folders which are set to "Show this folder as an email addressbook" by right clicking on the folder --&gt; properties --&gt; AddressBook tab --&gt; make sure the check box is checked.</p>
<p>If the above checkbox is greyed out and unchecked - then the best solution would be to create a new profile via the Control Panel mail applet.</p>

                    <p>Over the last 2 weeks or so I have started to receive a high volume of spam emails - previously I had none, or at least very few, and assumed the Junk filter was working but it seems to have given up !</p>

            <p>Your advice is ****!&nbsp; It is well known now that the filter has been broken since at least 31 MAY!&nbsp; Please, for the sake of argument (and potentially assisting MS Hotmail/oulook in resolving this problem) why in the world it would matter HOW I access my account?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SERVER holds the emails.&nbsp; please tell me how I would see LESS spam in my INBOX by logging in from a different domain or app.&nbsp; To me this advice is asinine. PLEASE let me know how that is relevant to YOUR filters being broken and what I see in my inbox.&nbsp;
 PLEASE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW, I am aware of the "gear icon" and extensive options able to be selected.&nbsp; I have spent many an hour checking and rechecking them and the filters and lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to pre-empt another asinine response, in MY case, it does not matter in which way I access my account, in EVERY way the spam mails have taken over my mailbox!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd, yes, mail still goes to my spam folder, just not very much.&nbsp; AND NOW REAL VALID MAIL IS FREQUENTLY BEING ROUTED THERE!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now not only do I spend hours cleaning my inbox.&nbsp; I must spend more time going thru my junk folder to ensure I have not missed any important emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last, Some mail just does not even come thru anymore at all.&nbsp; Nearly ALL password reset emails doent even come thru anymore... TO INCLUDE from SKYPE.... A MICROSOFT PRODUCT!!!&nbsp; Even customer service centers are stymied by this.</p>

its absurd to change to a new server with more spam. </p>
<p>
</p><p>an example would be the ability to block based on what is contained in the address and in this case '.0x'. That is the only constant in these address. It would work similar to the Ctrl Find ability. The current filters cant do this if i'm not wrong</p>

<li>What is the exact issue are you facing?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, this is the OPS original post... SPAM FILTERS HAVE FAILED!!!!&nbsp; If I had had a different issue, it would not be in this thread.&nbsp; This is basic reading skills and common sense logic.&nbsp; If you cannot even
 successfully put these two things together before composing a response... then you need remedial training from a supervisor and/or should look into another career choice... Either by your own recognizance or your employers prompting!</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW, even this post is 3.5 months old... the problems still exist!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Are you facing any issue in receiving junk email into inbox?&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this has already been covered!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st, the logical inference from the OP is that it is his inbox being inundated with the spam emails.&nbsp; Even Mr. Kumari seemed to have understood
 this!&nbsp; 2nd, I SPECIFICALLY mentioned the problem was SPAM IN MY INBOX!&nbsp;&nbsp; Quote from the 2nd para of my response: "The SERVER holds the emails.&nbsp; please tell me how I would see LESS spam in my INBOX by logging in from a different domain or app."&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we see CLEARLY again how you have failed in your response to me.&nbsp; It almost seems you are required to respond to a quota of people during your shift so to meet this quota you only half **** skim a problem and post a really **** response!&nbsp; If this
 is a reflection of your commitment to Microsoft and their customer/user base, then there is NO QUESTION you should NOT be working there.&nbsp; You are only drawing a paycheck from a company you are actually hurting more than helping.&nbsp; Wow, I literally cannot see
 how you are still employed there.&nbsp; This would thus infer a clear apathy of the supervisors and management of your specific workplace.&nbsp; I truly feel sorry for Microsoft in the damage you and your coworkers are causing the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.How do you access your account? Is it through browser, email client or mail app?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though clearly inferred... AND not answered in MY original posting.&nbsp; I ACCESS MY ACCOUNT THRU ALL AVAILABLE CLIENTS!!!! BROWSER!!!&nbsp; OUTLOOK APP ON MY COMPUTER!!! and
 my PHONE!!!&nbsp; AND EXCHANGE SERVERS AND ANY OTHER FORM I MAY HAVE FORGOTTON.&nbsp; THE SPAM IS STILL THERE.&nbsp; Please, PLease, PLease, answer how it would be possible to access my account in multiple different ways and to have ONE of those ways NOT show the spam?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I don't see this as a possibility.&nbsp; But lets pretend it is... for you.&nbsp; Then it is abundantly clear in MY original post that even if this is possible, in MY situation I AM RECIEVING AN INUNDATION OF SPAM IN MY INBOX VIA ALL WAYS TO ACCESS MY ACCOUNT!!!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the OP, Myself and all others replying and plus 1'ing this post are having the same problem.&nbsp; At least Mr. Kumari attempted to give possible solutions.&nbsp; (which I will get into further below)&nbsp;&nbsp; YOU on the otherhand, did not read/comprehend anything from
 the original poster, nor my write up.&nbsp; You offered no other possible explanation OR solutions.&nbsp; Instead referencing back to Mr. Kumari's solutiontions..... WHICH I SPECIFICALLY SAID did NOT work!!!&nbsp; ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT MAY BE RELATED!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"If you are receiving junk email into your inbox I suggest you to follow the steps provided by Vijaya Kumari1 that is mentioned above and check if it helps."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have thoroughly reviewed, read the links,&nbsp;and followed the steps offered by Mr. Kumari.&nbsp; and they are not slowing the onslaught of SPAM/Junk Mail in my inbox.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To counter Mr. Kumari's suggestion of blocking EACH AND EVERY&nbsp;individual Spam/Junk mail... though this may yes work, there are two issues with this that make it not useful.&nbsp; 1st, most spam mail is coming from hundreds of different addresses.... which
 are not reused as often as new spam is created.&nbsp; thus blocking that address in the short term, is useless.&nbsp; Continuing to follow this advice with in no time add hundreds of wasted hours on each of us as individuals in taking the time to do this.... while at
 the same time adding HUNDREDS upon HUNDREDS of blocked users in OUR (yes OUR, HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of users you are suggesting this solution to) blocked address folder.&nbsp; This creates its own subset of issues.&nbsp; 1 it makes it extremely difficult to find an
 accidental blocking.&nbsp; as well as overloading your capacity to successfully manage these addresses IF they were to be reused.&nbsp; I speak from having this problem AND spend much time both on the phone and via email with customer help... to which it was determined
 I had too many filters that the system is getting overloaded and confused.&nbsp; (and another issue... in your update you removed the option to mass delete filters.&nbsp; Thus my OVER 500 filters I have to manually deltel each and every one.... to clean them up.&nbsp;this
 takes hours with my slow connection at home.&nbsp; OR I could be a deadbeat employee at work and spend my WORK DAYS reconfiguring my Hotmail filters and controls)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd.... you have a JUNK button!&nbsp; this, as explained to me, is specifically meant to HELP and ASSIST outlook/Hotmail/etc in updating its algorithms and blocking the address for ALL members/users.... funny.... kind of like a giant "block" filter for the server
 to help others and not just ourselves.... thus relieving the issues I have just explained happen above by following Mr. kumari's advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Please post back with the updated status to assist you further."</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is now my 2nd post back with my UPDATED status... following ALL of your steps and answering ALL of your questions....</p>
<p>Please, whomever replies to this offer an educated explanation of what happened that may be causing this chaos, what MS is doing to aid in combating this for us, and if possible a logical offering of a solution on our end.... in addition to (meaning DIFFFERENT
 than) mr. kumari's instructions.</p>

            <p>Starting about 2 weeks ago, I have started receiving about 20-30 junk e-mails per day where I was getting few to none previously. I've repeatedly checked the e-mails and reported them as junk or phishing but within hours or days would get the same sender
 back in my inbox as if my designating a sender as junk achieves nothing. Very frustrating. I do not want to put the setting to "EXCLUSIVE" as this would make my e-mail not usable for my needs. I never had to do it before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI. Marking e-mails as junk through outlook app on iphone NEVER achieved the intended effect of not getting the same e-mail in the future. That is not a recent change, it has never worked.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Unbelievable that after so many months Microsoft keeps moving people from the old servers where Spam filtering worked and now on their new servers email unbearable with the amount of Spam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft,</p>
<p>Please get people that know what is up and are informed to give us an update as to when you think you might begin to address this problem on your servers. &nbsp;This is not a user error problem. &nbsp;This is all on you MS to fix on your servers. &nbsp;Setting email filter
 to exclusive is a non-usable solution.</p>

<p>Hi Doug</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion, however, I can open the files, what I can't do is view them in the preview pane form the file explorer</p>
<p>Since I first posted the problem I have discovered that the word and excel files that are in version 97 will open in the preview pane, the others that are in the recent version don't open in the preview pane.</p>
<p>Maybe this will give help orient a solution.</p>

            The problem seems to be with the 365 version of office.&nbsp; The older files which were in word and excel version 2003 do open in the preview panel.&nbsp; The ones I have stored with the 365 version don't open and the explorer does not respond and I have to close
 and start again.

            The easiest workaround is to simply hide the Preview pane in File Explorer. (You can still preview images in a folder view where you are showing icons.)

    <title>Word Online Does Not Preserve Tab Stops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Online Does Not Preserve Tab Stops</h2>
                    <p>I find it curious that Word Online does not support so basic a feature as tabs. Nevertheless,
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Can-I-set-tabs-in-Word-Online-8c3b5d9d-0d32-44ab-8c92-6870129c298d?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this post from Microsoft</a> states that "Word Online preserves tab stops that are added to your document using the Word desktop application."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this does not work for me. I uploaded a Word 2016 document (.docx) that I created in the Word 2016 desktop application and not a single tab stop was preserved. Interestingly, the preview icon of the same document
<em>does</em> preserve tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't Word Online preserve tab stops that I added in the Word 2016 desktop application?</p>

support article</a> that you’ve provided regarding the tab stops that are added to your file using the

<p>
</p><p><span>We’d like to confirm if you’ve tried using a different browser to open the document in Word Online. Also, does it happen on all of the documents?</span></p>

<p>Honestly, the contributions of "Microsoft," who previously called themselves "Microsoft Forum Administrators" and before that "Microsoft Technical Engineers" discredit these community forums to the point where I am no longer interested in posting here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also discouraging is when "Microsoft" splits someone's post inappropriately and I have to figure out the context in order to make sense of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst of all, however, is when "Microsoft" decides <em>on their own</em> that their inept reply has answered my question and marks the question as "Answered." I have had to un-mark my questions as "Answered" on several occasions.</p>

<p>What you are describing can be easily reproduced: Word Online does not preserve any tab characters and it doesn't respect custom or default tab stops in an uploaded document. I can't tell for certain, but my guess is that this is a bug in Word Online.</p>

<p>When you double-click a .xls file in File Explorer,&nbsp;Excel opens that .xls file. If you then select File &gt; Save or press Ctrl+S,&nbsp;Excel saves the changes to the existing&nbsp;.xls file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you double-click a .xlt file in File Explorer, Excel creates a new, unsaved workbook in memory that is a copy of the .xlt file. If you then select File &gt; Save or press Ctrl+S, Excel displays the 'Save As' dialog, letting you save the workbook as a .xls
 file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a template if you frequently need to create a new workbook with the same design and/or formatting. Let's say, for example, that you need to produce a monthly report. The data will change from month to month, but the layout must be the same
 each time. You could save a workbook with the required layout as a template. Each month, you can double-click the template to create&nbsp;a new report.</p>

<p>I already disabled the external users sharing, but I need that also internal users cannot share nothing between them.</p>
<p>It's possible?</p>
<p>Or I must use the access rights for every single site? (I hope not...)</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Alessandro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, you have switched off external sharing and there are many sites in your tenant. If you prefer not to use UI to uncheck options in Access Requests Settings, I'd like to suggest using PowerShell to disable sharing for non owners.</p>
<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p><span>1. Install&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SharePoint Online Management Shell</a><span>&nbsp;and open it.</span></p>
<p>2. Input</p>
<p><span><em>Connect-SPOService -Url&nbsp;</em></span><em>https://<strong>domain</strong>-admin.sharepoint.com</em><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em>Set-SPOSite -Identity https://<strong>domain</strong>.sharepoint.com -DisableSharingForNonOwners</em><br />
<strong>Note that you need to change contoso to your tenant.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>For more information, please check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set-SPOSite</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>

            <p>If you open the Normal template as a document and make the change and save it, that should work. The easiest way to open the Normal template (obviating the need to actually locate it) is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Word, press <strong>Alt+F11</strong>; the Visual Basic Editor opens. Press
<strong>Ctrl+G</strong> to activate the Immediate window. In that window, type (or paste)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument<br />
<br />
and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Normal opens, but note that it may not be on top of all windows. You can close the Visual Basic Editor. Make the desired changes to the Normal file, and then save and close it. If the changes you have made have not been recognized
 as changes (the Undo button is not activated), press <strong>Spacebar</strong>, then
<strong>Backspace </strong>to "dirty" the file, thus ensuring that the template will actually be saved.</span></p>

            Thanks for the reply! The Normal document was able to open, and I was able to change the color to black and save the changes. When I reopened up the Normal.dotm to ensure the change was made, the document is still black. But, when I open up a new document,
 the color of that page is still white.

            <p>Bummer! Developers, heads up!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately it's really easy to change, at least in Word 2013: Design Tab, Page Color (found on far right of ribbon). Sad that we have to take time to do this, but it could be a lot worse. I set a shortcut key to access the "more colors" window for page
 color. That works, but it's no easier than doing the two clicks to set one from your template colors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, yes, a macro might be nice to uniformly access a specific color every time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Onenote file location</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my onenote files set up on onedrive and it works well, syncing with all my devices. &nbsp;But I noticed that my hard drive on my PC seems to be filling up and I think it might be with the local files I have added using onenote (I am assuming that a local
 file is stored on the C Drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am i correct to assume i have a file on onedrive and a copy stored somewhere on my PC? &nbsp;If so, is it possible to move them to a USB Drive? &nbsp;I looked in the location that onenote shows in the options - Save &amp; Backup, but I don't see anything in the folder
 when i view it using windows explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Adding a phone number to outbound calls</h2>
                    <p>I live in Taiwan, and I want to make calls to my grandmother's phone in the UK. Due to scam phone calls, she has blocked undisclosed phone numbers. As a result, I am blocked from calling her phone using Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to add a phone number ID to my outgoing Skype calls to this number, so that I'm no longer blocked?</p>

<p>
</p><p>As additional information with the answers of Vijay and Dave, you may also purchase a Skype Number which you can also set up as your Caller ID. If you are using a mobile number in setting up a Caller ID, I would like to inform you that it may take 24 hours
 to activate it. You will be receiving a notification via SMS to the mobile number you have used once it is activated.

</p><p>I must express my regret to inform&nbsp;that it&nbsp;can only show either your Skype Number or the mobile number you set as your Caller ID when making skype calls to landlines/mobiles. You cannot set your&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;Name (Display Name) when you are calling together with
 your Skype Number.&nbsp;On the other hand, it will show your Skype Name when calling if you are making Skype to Skype calls.

<p>&nbsp;A timely warning of what can indeed happen.<br />
The www can be a jungle...with opportunists lurking...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have allowed access to your Computer by persons unknown please ensure your PC has not been infected with a virus or malware by running the below scans<br />
<br />
1. I suggest the<strong> free </strong>version {<strong>not</strong> the Trial version} of&nbsp;
<strong><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Malwarebytes.</a></strong><br />
Update it immediately.<br />
<strong>Do a full system scan</strong><br />
<br />
2. I further recommend you use&nbsp; <a href="http://www.eset.com/me/home/products/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>ESET’s Free Online Scanner</strong></a><br />
<br />
3. How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>
