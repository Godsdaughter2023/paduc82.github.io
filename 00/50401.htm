                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 Home, then I upgraded to Pro, but I don't have a key for Pro, so I want to know if I can go back to Home.</p>
<p>

            I deleted the partition Windows 10 creates (3.87 GB). I am also unable to boot to the recovery partition HP put on my PC (D: 21.6 GB).I tried running the Windows 8.1 reinstall ISO that I downloaded from Microsoft, but I don't have my Windows 8.1 product

</p><p><strong>You can do this because once the Upgrade is activated - and it will only activate the version you are qualified for - then you can reinstall it as often as you like.</strong>&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Because you didn't' answer this question from my first post I'm still not sure you are aware of this.&nbsp; If you know for sure you activated Windows Ten Home then you&nbsp; should make and&nbsp; boot the media for it, delete all partitions (you can leave Recovery if

            <p>Wow. I'm dumb. I just realized the partition I deleted was a RAM backup. <em>That's
</em>why it said swap. It was not a recovery partition or a rollback partition. I must have had a process running that messed with the legit recovery partition, because Windows tells me the files are missing whenever I try to roll back. Thanks for your help,
 but my question was completely wrong. </p>

            <div>That was just the backstory of the question. It was the whole reason I thought I ran into trouble. Yes, Windows 10 Home was activated. I ran the upgrade to Pro with an invalid Pro&nbsp;key, thinking it worked, but in the end, it didn't, so I was wondering if
 I could go back to Home. I would like to ask you to save the effort and not worry about it.</div>

    <title>Xbox One X wireless&#47;headphone problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> connortheanimer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One X wireless&#47;headphone problems</h2>
                    <p>So I recently moved into a dorm at college and brought my xbox one x with me. Before I bought it, I owned a headphone/mic for my original xbox one which worked for years. Right before I moved to college, i experienced very minimal audio popping that seldom
 occurred. But once I began using my headphones at college, the popping became so bad that i couldnt take it and trashed my headphones. Now, I had it hooked up to my wireless controller which I had since my original xbox one. I figured it was just my headphones
 being old but I JUST bought a new pair and experienced popping on the same controller. I was so confused, so I dug out my old headphones I threw away and tried them on my black controller that came with my xbox one x, still popped. I have a see-through wired
 afterglow xbox one controller that, when plugged into the headset, didnt pop as much, but still popped. So I threw them away again. As for my new headphones, i did the same experiments, but with my wired controller - which I've had for a few years now and
 bought for my original xbox one - there (SO FAR) has not been ANY audio issues whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that my wireless controllers are experiencing wireless connectivity issues becuase my dorm is filled with wireless frequencies (there are at least 10 wifi broadcasts at a time in the dorms, plus my smart TV also broadcasts wifi right next to
 my xbox and is almost touching it, although my controller is only an inch away from the xbox so I thought wireless problems would be impossible)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it only happened once but my wireless controller randomly disconnected and began blinking and I had to take the batteries out and reconnect it for the controller to properly respond to controls (the batteries were brand new). On a side note I also cleaned
 the audio jacks of all my controllers and that didnt help. So should I purchase a non off-brand wired controller and use that for headphone use instead of wireless controllers? Do you think once I move out of college, I could use my headphones with a wireless
 controller as long as there isnt too much wifi frequency colliding? Or could my xbox one x's NIC be faulty?</p>

<p>Ok so I did the troubleshooter to no avail. Also, that little adapter did come with my headset that I trashed. I tried it with and without the adapter on all of my controllers (old, new and wired) and there was still popping. My new headset does not have
 this adapter and instead plugs directly into the jack to the left of the controller. This creates popping with the old and new wireless controller. I currently have the headset on, hooked up to my 2-year-old wired afterglow controller and am sitting at the
 title screen of Star Wars Battlefront. There isnt any popping at all (figured I'd use the loud and dramatic music as a stress test). Obviously I'm glad it works but I'd still like to know why it only happens on my wireless controllers.. also they are updated
 to the current firmware version.</p>

i don't think consoles support headphones since they are plugged into a TV for both audio and video

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this problem concerning your headset problem.
</p>
<p>I would say that if the previously posted troubleshooting step didn't resolve the issue then I would suggest trying what we call a soft reset of your console.
<span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I'm looking forward to selling my Xbox 360 so I can buy the Xbox ONE and I'm wondering if I would be able to save my online profile. I would be getting the Xbox One after I sell my 360 but I don't what whoever I'm selling my console to have access to my
 profile. How can I keep my profile but make sure no one else can access it?</p>

<p>You just need to log into your profile from your new machine, which means you need to know your user name and password. To make sure who ever buys your 360 doesn't have access, you need to reformat the 360 hard drive before you sell it.

<p>I agree you should keep your 360, especially if you have friends that have not made the upgrade, because you will not be able to go into party chat with them if they are on 360 and you are on ONE. And from personal point I enjoy going back to 360 to play
 some older games. </p>
<p>And I am sure you won't get a lot of money for it. So yeah keep it.</p>

<p>Also, if you're going for the X1 you're more than likely going to stay Gold meaning you can just log on every 15 days onto your 360 and get a free game to keep for life..
</p>
<p>Can't really complain with that, especially seeing as selling your 360 will net you £30 or so selling it, whereas Games with Gold you're looking at about £20 of free games per month just on 360</p>

<h2>            abcavi tag editor not working</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I just recently upgraded from Vista to W7 Ultimate x64. I like the OS and the improved speed and functionality. However, much like my older version of Trend Micro, abcavi tag editor isnt working properly in W7.<br />
When installed the program will show avi tags while hovering the mouse pointer on an avi file. This doesnt seem to work anymore. Numerous google searches for an answer has left me only frustrated. The program will install just fine but doesnt work. The default
 program compatability setting is in XP. I've tried running it in compatability mode for Vista and even troubleshot through the control panel why it isnt working properly. Is there&nbsp;and issue&nbsp;going on in Windows 7 whereas it doesnt allow metadata or media tags
 to be viewed?

            Hi <span><span>ShawnL7</span>
</span>,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows forum.<br />
<br />
Check if <strong>abcavi tag editor</strong> is compatible with Windows 7 using this link.
<strong>Windows 7 compatibility center</strong> : <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx<br />
</a><br />
It does not seem to be compatible with Windows 7 as of now. Get in touch with the manufacturer as they are best people to offer help.<br />
There might be an issue with compatibility of the program.&nbsp;We have no information on the compatibility of the program.
<br />
&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            Windows Taskbar Not Working</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10, I have been having a few problems here and there, but one of my biggest problems is that my taskbar is just not working! Nothing happens if I press the Windows key, Cortana search, battery icon, sound, network, notification
 center, or calendar (however, the Task View icon works). I have tried rebooting, stopping the explorer.exe task and restarting it, and even some PowerShell methods and nothing is working! It's getting to be very annoying. Please help!

<p>So I tried your first method, however it didn't help. I can't do your second method because I have no way of going to the settings since I can't use anything within my taskbar. Since your original post, I have also completely restored my computer to factory
 settings (I have more reasons to why I did this rather than this problem alone) and I've found that it works when I initially use my computer after it is done upgrading, however after the first restart the taskbar continues to do what it's doing now.</p>

            <p>After searching the Microsoft support forums for HOURS and finding that lots of people are having this same problem and zero solutions that worked, and trying to get through to tech support waiting for HOURS on 3 separate occasions over the past 2 days,
 I had no other choice but to abandon 10 and revert back to 7. &nbsp;I will say that the roll-back process back to 7 was quick (10 minutes), effective and painless. &nbsp;I'll be waiting till 10 gets straightened out a bit before trying again.</p>

            I have found that if I avoid pressing the windows logo/start button on the bottom RH side... the thing that pops up this 'Life at a Glance' and 'Games and Explore' tile package thing, it generally wont lock up, but if you push it, and it has a bad tile
 (an internet ad or adware), it can lock the taskbar up. It is almost like we need an adware blocker for the tiles on the windows start button... or better yet how do you remove it, what is that thing called? how can you make it act like a old style windows
 start button?

            <p>My windows 10 were working fine till the new update from Microsoft came. I updated my pc and plethora of problems engulf. The aforementioned comments specifies the problem I faced. Tried everything and nothing works. Reset my PC 3 times and every time a
 problem occurs and it prevents from resetting as well. </p>
<p>This is extremely annoying and frustrating. I don't know whether to roll back to 8.1 or not.
</p>
<p>My only concern is that if I do roll back I'm afraid that I wouldn't be able to upgrade to 10 again.
</p>
<p>Can someone please clarify my doubt with that. </p>

<h2>            No audio output device installed and computer freezing all the time</h2>
                    I've started having audio problems a while back and since then my laptop also freezes randomly (but more often when there's audio or video playing). I opened my laptop this morning and there's a little X by the audio icon in the taskbar. Tried the troubleshooter
 and it says ''Restart your PC to finish installing drivers and updates''. I restarted my laptop maybe 20 times now and still the same thing. Tried uninstalling audio drivers and restart, still no luck. Can't rollback drivers and it says there no updates for
 the audio drivers. When I right-click on the audio icon there's something there that I don't know what it means : Speaker Setup (UNKNOWN). Also, there's no audio when I plug earphones in. I have Windows 10 and it's all updated. Please help, this is my gaming
 laptop :(

<p>1B says I don't have a driver for : Intel High Definition Audio &amp; Intel High Definition DSP. I troubleshoot both and restart but then I checked and it still says the same when I trouble shoot. 2 it says 'download and install pending update' I chose Apply
 this fix then restart my laptop. Tried again the troubleshoot but it says the same thing. I then followed the link you put, download that update tool and it says 'repair windows update database corruption'. I applied this fix. Then it said&nbsp; 'download and install
 pending update' which I applied this fix. Then it says everything is fixed. I ran the tool again and it tells me the same 2 problems (so it wasn't fixed?).&nbsp; When I said 'No' to the 'Did this resolve your problem' on the update tool page, it said to download
 the latest SSU that matches my version of windows so I tried but the 4 options of download I had all said it's not applicable for this computer (http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4090914). I then said this didn't resolved my problem and
 they said to download the most recent KB and they lost me there, I don't understand the steps. Laptop froze in the middle of writing this :/<br />
</p>
<br />
I will continue along the other steps.&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for replying fast!&nbsp;

<p>3. For the SFC thing, I put in the command sfc /scannow and at the end of the scan it said 'Windows Ressource Protection did not find any integrity violation'. Then to the Dism thing, I put in Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth and it said 'No component
 store corruption detected'. I went on to next step with Restore health and it said it was completed successfully.
</p>
<p>4. I only have Intel(R) Display audio. Can't rollback (it is enabled), so i uninstalled and restart my laptop. I then checked the device manager and Sound, Video &amp; game controllers is not there. I restarted another time for good measure and still the same.
 Though I see there's twice Intel High Definition Audio now under Other devices ( there was just 1 before I uninstalled &amp; restart).<br />

<h2>            What is causing the USB Audio Codec&#47;USB Microphone input to mute&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a Dell Inspiron N7010 laptop, running the most current version of Windows 10 Ver 1709, OS Build 16299.64, patches are up to date. I am having trouble with recording records from my Numark TTi turntable
 through a USB port. It worked fine before replacing the hard drive and installing the software. I have set the recording input volume settings for USB Audio Codec/USB Microphone and turned it on. Set the recording level to 75%. I have set it to default.
<span>&nbsp;</span>When I play a record, after 10 seconds to 2 minutes it mutes and sets the recording level to 0.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>When I play a record, after 10 seconds to 2 minutes it mutes and sets the recording level to 0.</span></p>
<p><span>Restart EZ Vinyl /Tape Converter (Ion Audio). Start turntable. Records for 30 seconds or less. Input mutes, volume goes to 0.</span></p>
<p><span>Right click on speaker icon. Double click on Microphone – USB Audio CODEC.</span></p>
<p><span>Select Properties. Levels tab.<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is causing the USB Audio Codec/USB Microphone input to mute?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have the default format set to 1 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz.</span></p>
<p><span>I have a Lenovo laptop with the same Windows version, works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 Version 1709, USB Audio Codec/USB Microphone mutes by itself when receiving a signal.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Wiped the drive. Reinstalled Windows 10. Loaded the patch. Loaded software. Loaded data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That did resolve the problem. Apparently it was a corrupted audio driver.&nbsp; Should be an easier way to update drivers without reloading windows from scratch.</p>

<h2>            New Skype Update Help 2017&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone! With the new skype update that rolled out recently, I have seen many complaints addressing it. For anyone displeased with the new skype update, continue sending in your complaints. Skype has a twitter, Instagram, a feedback center, and this
 wonderful website to make complaints on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone curious, iOS has no way to return to a previous version of skype that is also functional. (If anyone finds a way, however, please tell me.) In the meantime, keep complaining. If they don't change it soon we can boycott it as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone looking for a good alternative Skype app, Line is extremely useful and does no have the ugly interface that Skye has given us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, keep complaining! Lets get out old Skype back! #newskypesucks</p>

            I am also very disappointed with the new update. Unfortunately I have found no way to get the old version work, simply meaning I lost the chance to use it anymore.

<p>Let me just say this, I got the update within this last week (first week of August 2017) and I have video ads on mine. I don't even show any of my contacts on line anymore and the only way I know if they are there is if I type a message and ask them if they
 are there. What's with all this mess? "Discord" is looking better and better. "Discord" being a type of Skype that launched in mid 2016. Honestly I cannot believe the mess my Skype is right now.</p>
<p>FIX IT!!!&nbsp; I am going searching for the prior version now and I will find it somehow.</p>

            Somehow my Skype updated to the new version. Great, another new interface to learn this week. &nbsp;If I spent 6 months designing it and used it everyday to boost my ego it would be great. but since I am just trying to make phone calls it sucks. Please fire
 all the designers who made this and the people who approved it. I have been a Skype customer since its inception, as soon as I can find a new program that believes in simplicity I am gone. Sorry this update is &nbsp;a waste of my time.

            I am incredibly frustrated with the new version - it’s now useless to me. I can no longer video chat from my iphone with my family far away &nbsp;(the video option isnt even offered); it only presents the options of calling or messaging and requires me to pay
 for those. My contacts have all disappeared too. Very unhappy

            I found the old, prior version, before this nightmare of a Skype just updated and downloaded on me back in 2017 and I refuse to let it appear again (the new version). If it tries to download the update again I am done with Skype.&nbsp; My Skype still does not
 show my contacts that are on line and this happened when it downloaded that new version (without my permission) as an update. When I went back to the prior version my contacts were still messed up and I never did anything to mess them up. I have to still ask
 a contact if they are there because it shows them all off line and most are really on line. All this has been going on since Aug. 2017. I posted something up top here about it. So Microsoft why do you mess with something that isn't broken?&nbsp; I have family in
 the military over in the Middle East that have always used Skype and even they have the same problems as I do. There contacts show off line also and they can't get there video calls to work now. Don't shove the blame off at peo

<p>First in Internet Explore I can click on the arrow on the address bar and go to a couple web site without any real effort. I use this at least 20 times a day. No option in Edge, just far too much work to get to where I want to get to.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community. I will certainly assist you with the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to inform you that you can manage the folders in favorite bar. To do so,&nbsp;Follow the steps below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.Click and drag up or down to reposition a bookmark within the list.<br />
2.Right-click inside the <strong>Favorites panel </strong>to create a new folder, rename or remove a bookmark.<br />
3.Click and drag items from the panel into another folder.<br />
4.Favorites are stored in a folder under your user profile.&nbsp; You can manage them directly thru the Windows file system.</div>
<div><br />
Path: </div>
<div><strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AC\MicrosoftEdge\User\Default\Favorites\</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;?</strong></div>
&nbsp;
<div>You can still search for related websites in edge address bar when you type a general word. Edge will show you recently visited sites and also search suggestions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>It is also recommended that you&nbsp;install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

            Did you read his complaint stated above? Yes your&nbsp;solution in Edge will work as he stated. But he isn't going to do this and neither am I. To reply to his reasons for not using Edge by restating exactly why he said he wouldn't use it. I.e. going through
 these ridiculous steps is 'inane', without any reasoning. You probably did this because there is no answer other than to disable Edge and use something else. So you read off your script. I too, for his stated reasons already went back to Internet Explorer
 11. Yet it has compatibility issues with Windows 10. At least in Internet Explorer 11 all you have to do is right click when in the URL (website) and copy it to your desk top. Can you do this in Edge? NO! In short, he doesn't want to scroll through Favorites,
 and neither do I. Another option is to dump Internet Explorer and use either Google Chrome or Firefox, which I am considering doing.

I also do not appreciate Edge.&nbsp; Microsoft, I believe, is playing games with IE.&nbsp;When Edge was installed Microsoft made it the default browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; They did this in the middle of the night without my knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not liking the program at all I continued using
 IE.&nbsp;&nbsp; To my surprise one day I went to use IE&nbsp; and it was gone from my machine.&nbsp; I immediately went to an alternative browser and settled with Flash Peak Slim Brower.&nbsp; Then again to my surprise IE was back but is very unstable and unusable.&nbsp;&nbsp; To stop Microsoft
 from playing games with my machine I installed a private virtual network.&nbsp; Hopefully they will leave me alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's interesting, it's my machine and they treat is as if&nbsp;its&nbsp;their own.

            <p>Those are the only two things that you don't like about Microsoft Edge? Many people have a lot more to complain about ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't like Microsoft Edge, don't use it. Nobody's forcing you. But if you're going to use another browser, don't use Internet Explorer. It's old technology that is rapidly falling behind the times. The only updates it's getting are security updates
 - no new features. IE 11 was included in Windows 10 for the benefit of businesses who've got specialized software applications that will only run on Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of us should use a modern, standards-compliant browser like Firefox, Chrome (my choice,) Opera, etc.</p>

            <p>Edge is a far better browser the Firefox, Chrome or Opera as far as I am concerned. There were just two small thing I didn't care for.</p>
<p>That being said,&nbsp; I have since started to really use it and I find it pretty good now. It just took a while.</p>
<p>I really have no use for any browser that have Goggle as the default search engine. I can never figure out why they are not forced to offer you the choice up front like Microsoft was forced to do.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 errors</h2>
                    Hello I have here hp laptop with windows 7 pro 64bit&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I received my windows 10 upgrade but when I downloaded at the first time I get error with code "WindowsUpdate_80240020" "WindowsUpdate_dt000" and I searched for help &nbsp; I found this :<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windowsupdate80240020-windowsupdatedt000/cb02803d-a357-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5?auth=1<br />
<br />
then I did what typed in the page :<br />
<br />
<p>1) Access this file location&nbsp;<strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download&nbsp;</strong>and delete everything there. (Note delete only content found there and not the Download folder itself)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2) Open CMD (command prompt) with run as administrator (admin privileges) and run this command:&nbsp;<strong>wuauclt.exe /updatenow</strong></p>
<p>The Update Window should pop-up with downloading Windows 10 again, and if your lucky it will be the complete kit this time.</p>

<br />
I tried this twice and then I get another error with code 80240FFF <br />
and tried agine and get another error with code C1900208<br />
<br />
can you please help me upgrade this windows or &nbsp;my laptop can't run it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            error code&#58; 0xA00F4244&#40;0x80070005&#41; on using Camera app Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Webcam</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have a X-Gerr webcam that has a mic incorporated, I have had this webcam for a few years and has worked well with windows 7, Ever since I updated to windows 10 it will not work, when I run camera from the start menu it comes
 up saying “We can’t find your camera and ends with if you need it, here’s the error code: 0xA00F4244(0x80070005)” or the program that came with the camera it say no camera found!</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have tried everything to get this working all to no avail, one other thing I found was in Device manager/Imaging devices/properties/Events in the information section it says “Device USB\VID_0C45&amp;PID_613C\5&amp;15c311e1&amp;0&amp;3 requires
 further installation.” </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now here is where it gets stupid, when I run Skype it sees my camera and mic and works perfectly. So why can it not work in windows 10, Can you please help
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes </p>
<p>Bazza08</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have tried all the online Microsoft tests to try and sort this i.e. Fix-it and so on, also done all the usual Troubleshooting/uninstall then reinstall/latest drivers

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur due to the following reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Antivirus security software installed on the computer blocking the app.</span></li><li><span>Outdated webcam driver.</span></li><li><span>Hardware changes made to the computer.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, have you installed any third party antivirus security software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying if any of the network components are missing or corrupted in the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Since you are facing issues on webcam not working on the computer, run
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows apps troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;to
 check if the any of the app files and folders are missing or corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, the
<strong>Windows Store</strong> will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: Check if the app is blocked by the antivirus security software installed on the computer. If blocked,
 unblock to check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link below on
<strong>Windows can’t find or start the camera</strong>:</span></p>

<p>if there was a problem with the camera how come <em>it works perfectly with Skype??</em> are you saying Skype drivers are better than windows 10 drivers ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did put the error message in the first message! the whole message was </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the issue persists, the above issue may be caused due to missing or corrupted app files and folders on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Run
<strong>SFC scan</strong> and <strong>DISM scan</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is caused due to any of the system files missing or corrupted on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Open an
<strong>Administrator command prompt </strong>window by</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Yes</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></li><li><span>Check if it says
<strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the
<strong>CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><strong>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong><span>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, check if similar issue occurs on another user profile. Create another user
 account by referring to </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Set up accounts</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;on
 Windows 10 article. This is only to determine if the issue is OS specific or user account specific.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the status of Camera app showing the above error code along with the error message for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Often older cameras use stream.sys drivers, so that they will work with desktop Skype, but not with Modern camera applications like Windows Camera. Given you stated this is an older&nbsp;Window 7 device this could be the case.&nbsp;If you check out the troubleshooting
 article, in the outdated drivers section, refer to step 2, if you see a stream.sys driver then this camera will not work with modern camera apps.

            <p>Hello Tom </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thank you for your time to help me with this problem, I have the disc that came with the camera which includes drivers and a program to use the camera, but that will not work either.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So what you are saying in effect is throw away a perfectly good working webcam because Windows 10 doesn’t like it, and Microsoft will not make older cameras backward compatible, so it wants you to buy new camera that it does like.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just feel I am being ripped off, because it worked perfectly when I had windows 7 then I upgraded to window 10 and now it will not work. So the problem in my eyes is Windows 10 is not compatible with my camera, not the other way
 round..</p>
<p>OK rant over lol thank you all again for your help </p>
<p>
</p><p>CASE CLOSED </p>

            It would be nice then if Microsoft had a way to uninstall the camera app that has failed since I upgraded from 8.1 to 10 so that we can reinstall the W10 camera app from the store, but current app just &nbsp;will not uninstall. Anyone have a fix?&nbsp;

            <p>None of your suggestions work because the pre-installed camera app on 8.1 no longer opens in w10, how do you uninstall it? please do not tell me to go to programs and features there is a grayed out uninstall button that does nothing, any other suggestion
 welcomed.</p>

            <p>A cerca de um ano meu x1 vinha fazendo um barulho, como um apito, bem raramente mas de vez enquando fazia... um saco...<br /></p>
<p>A uns quatro meses ele simplesmene parou de ligar... fazia o "plim" mas nao iniciava... descobri que a fonte ja tinha pifado. Comprei outra, original, tudo certinho, e em menos de um mes ele começou a ligar e nao aparecer a imagem na TV. Ja fiz de tudo, todo tipo de inicialização... consegui fazer ele funcionar por três vezes e mesmo assim o jogo trava toda hora, so volta depois de minutos esperando.... o pior que nao está mais na garantia.&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p>Sempre tive xbox... mas dessa vez desanimei bem... to pensando em sair fora...<br /></p>
<p>Alguém ai ja passou por algo parecido... oq foi feito!??<br /></p>

                    <p>Long story short:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows XP SP3 on Dell XPS 700 will no longer get past the Windows XP logo (stops at around 5 cycles of blue progress bar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can boot into safe mode with networking and did a chkdsk /f without problems.&nbsp; All drives show no errors and can be accessed.&nbsp; System time and date are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting into "Disable auto-reboot" shows the BSD with the following STOP message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>*** STOP: 0x00000050 (0xCD1D6350, 0x0000001, 0x8052BAA0, 0x00000000)</span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone help me get the PC booting up normally?&nbsp; Thanks.</span></p>

<p>Use <span><em>HD Tune Free (if you are using this for personal use)</em>&nbsp; to</span><span> check the health status (S.M.A.R.T.)</span><span>. Those will give you some hint if it is failing. But it is always better to make
 a backup of hard drive at least 2 twice per year or more if the hard drive is more than 3 years old. SSD drives fail with little warning.</span></p>

<p>I tried the HD Tune and it reported that the drive was healthy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried restarting the computer and it stopped booting at the same point as before.&nbsp; I shut the computer off, waited a minute or so and then turned it on.&nbsp; It booted normally then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be like a stuck pixel?&nbsp; What I mean is that a spot on the hard disk stays in the wrong position, the power gets withdrawn giving that bad spot to rest/reset and the subsequent boot works?&nbsp; I know sounds crazy.</p>

<p>It may be. How old is the hard drive? SSD drive give very little warning before they fail. You can try the manufacture tool for your SSD to check if it match the HDtune result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a client's SSD that shows healthy the day before and next day it died. Lucky I made a backup when I was checking it since it was 3.5 years old.</p>

<p>Boosting is a problem that I have experienced since cod 3. &nbsp;Mw2 was the worse of all. &nbsp;I contacted and started threads just like this in the past and found that boosting is not recognised by xbox as cheating, so you can't be banned for boosting!</p>

<p>Boosters are being banned. It just takes the security team a bit since there are hundreds of thousands of people playing and they check the players so that they don't ban/reset someone by mistake.</p>
<p>Don't worry, they will get their due soon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Mkae sure you report them in game through the devs report feature , not through your console to ms. They have already made it clear they dont care.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Also .... I havent heard how iw or whoever takes care of it in MW3, but I know reporting through xbox and treyarch always took the accuracy of your reports into consideration on how fast it was handled. I always watch theater before I report to make sure
 I get it right.</p>

<p>Fun fact: you can report someone as many times as you like. When I see this I spam the crap out of the "boosting" thing in hopes that the enforcement team will see 30983430298 boosting complaints. Regardless of if it's by one person, you'd think it'd get
 their attention. Can't catch everyone all the time or else there would be no crime in the world period. Just keep plugging away, friend.</p>

<p>I can verify that Activision does look through the reports and punishes those caught boosting. Significantly. Full positive reset (All good stats gone, bad stats stay, back to Level 1), and I believe a 24 hour ban.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Pretty awesome. Anyway, I noticed that I could also contact Activision's support, and they'll file a ticket in my stead. All they'll need are the gamertags of those responsible. So that's another option if they flee before the game is over.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Mine is working, so what I'd do is re-register the app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also Reset the app in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Solitaire &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.  
<br />
<br />Run the Store Apps troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />If that fails I'd uninstall the App, follow these steps to repair the Store, then wait a day or two to reinstall the app:
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then re-register the Microsoft Store app following Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>.  If there are other apps you can re-register them from Option Two or do all of them at once from Option One.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, all your suggestions have already been tried.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most attempts to start MSC briefly show the outline of a Window&nbsp; for it before it disappears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally I see the message,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>We’re updating Microsoft Solitaire Collection. It should be ready to use again shortly.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, this indicates that MSC, at startup, checks to see if an update is in progress.</p>
<p><strong>It finds an incorrect indication of an update and quits.</strong></p>
<p>Does Microsoft Store use the registry to flag when it's doing updates?&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other process to communicate update status?&nbsp; Can I somehow do a trace to see what is really happening?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there some way to directly remove any flag that indicates
 an update is in progress?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thanks</strong></p>
        </p>

            I carefully read what you wrote.  You did not say that you had re-registered the app which must be done to know that everything has been tried.  If you said that then show me where.  Otherwise why did you give me a bad rating for being as thorough as anyone would have possibly been for you?
<br />
<br />I also specifically told you how to remove the Updating flag by uninstalling the app for a longer period of time during which you Reset the Store again exactly as I said.
<br />
<br />If you want me to continue helping you then you'll need to give me a better rating.  As I specifically said I would continue working with you until you had it solved, just as I have done for tens of thousands of others all of whom got their problem fixed who works with me cooperatively.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first request contained,</p>
<p>
<strong>Deleting and reinstalling </strong>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Solitaire Collection hasn't helped</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Resetting the Microsoft store hasn't helped.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't give a blow by blow description of how may times I did that or how many times I rebooted my PC after removing MSC or resetting the MSFT store before reinstalling MSC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of those actions produced any improvement.&nbsp; MSC still finds an indication that an update is in progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your initial response didn't solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't realize that anyone would interpret a 3 start rating as negative.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 out of 5 stars, IMO, is a neutral rating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't rate anything again until the problem is resolved, at which time, I'll promise you a 5 star rating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still trying to find&nbsp; a solution that will get rid of the UPDATING&nbsp; indication, if that is in fact the problem.</p>
<p>
</p>

            Reinstalling is not the same as re-registering the app which you would have seen had you opened the link to the tutorial.   Would you please try that now because it does something entirely different?
<br />
<br />Then if that fails will you uninstall the app and reset the store following those steps I gave so that it removes the app Updating.  But give it at least a day to clear the system.

<p>Still no success.&nbsp;&nbsp; I talked to Microsoft Canada Support.&nbsp;&nbsp; They indicated that numerous customers are experiencing the same problem and that a new version of MSC will be available in 2 weeks or so.</p>

            Thank you for reporting back. Please keep us posted, as the default response has been to give it time. I was hoping we would find a way to do something sooner.

<p>Chances are, they are having the same problem I'm having and the same problem I'm seeing a lot of other people having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype contacts randomly getting blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UWP version not having any method of unblocking said contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>LeoShank, the answer is that you have to install the desktop program of Skype, go to Contacts menu, Advanced, then Blocked Contacts.&nbsp; From there, you can unblock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll then need to go into settings and turn off the option to start when windows starts, exit, then you can relaunch the UWP version and if you had set to sync to your phone, you'd have to put in a new code on your phone since launching the desktop version
 will destroy the connection.</p>

<p>If you use multiple copies of Skype, load them all up and in any chat window type /MSNP24 then restart the computers.&nbsp; If you are using Windows 10 Mobile, be sure to reconnect all your devices.&nbsp; Then click your picture, go to settings, go down to contacts,
 then go to "Manage blocked contacts".&nbsp; Hopefully by doing the /MSNP24 on all your copies, all your contacts will be set up the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contacts I had missing this morning(that have been randomly blocked before) did not show up in this list, they only showed up when I loaded the classic desktop program.&nbsp; After I did the /MSNP24 on all of my copies of the software, it would pop back in
 contacts that I had previously unblocked.&nbsp; Now that I've unblocked them on all of my devices, I can restart all of them and I'm back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't mean they won't toss out another update and I'll have the same fight, but, it got me cleaned up this morning.</p>
