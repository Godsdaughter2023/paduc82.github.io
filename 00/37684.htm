<h2>            Error 3 GenericRoaming error in Event Viewer.</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting LOTS of these errors in event viewer.&nbsp; I noticed it when trying to troubleshoot an issue with Outlook, but the error has been going on much longer than the Outlook 2013 issue.&nbsp; The error appears to be happening every 10 minutes or so while the
 computer is awake.</p>
<p>Source = GenericRoaming</p>
<p>Event ID = 3</p>
<p>Task Category = SettingHandlerTask</p>
<p>Level = Error</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Message =</p>

<p>"There was an error while applying setting unit D30723A8A045448F1667DDEC3071AF9F0E6728F2 for roaming collection Windows-Credentials. Access is denied."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've researched and can't find anything on this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyone else seeing it or have a solution for me?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply. I'm sorry I'm so late in responding, notification of your update got "lost".</p>
<p>At any rate, running the troubleshooter did provide some issues one of which let me to search further.&nbsp; I don't remember the exact message but it had to do with a daily sync quota being reached.&nbsp; Another thread (I wish I had kept the URL) led me to some
 additional steps for deleting synced (possibly corrupt?) data form the cloud servers.&nbsp; This thread also had me to stop syncing and once all that was done to wait a period of time (not specified) until the quota error disappeared.&nbsp; I then followed your instructions
 to disconnect the MS account and then to reconnect.&nbsp; I was still receiving the quota error so I waited until the next morning and that error no longer appeared.&nbsp; At that point I turned on Sync again - that was about 10 hours ago and there have been NO Error
 3 Generic Roaming errors to this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help, I'm thinking this is now resolved.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Something went wrong&#34; when trying to add a new user</h2>
                    <p>I just updated to windows 10 from windows 8.1. I went to add an account on my computer for her using settings -&gt; accounts -&gt; Family and other users and then "Add a Family member". All I get is a popup that says "Something went wrong". There is no error message
 nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another note is that I also can't access the store with the error "The Server Stumbled" with the error code "0x80072EFD". I've tried all the suggestions to fix that issue as well to no avail. I have a feeling they are connected. It seems like windows itself
 cannot connect to Microsoft services (though I can access and manage my site through chrome).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this? It is very frustrating!!!</p>

            <p>It is related to how Windows 10 connects to the remote server using encryption protocols<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel<br />
Then 'Internet Options'...<br />
Select 'Advanced' tab...<br />
Take the scrollbar to bottom...<br />
Mark these options:<br />
"Use SSL 2.0"<br />
"Use SSL 3.0"<br />
"Use TSL 1.0"<br />
"Use TSL 1.1"<br />
"Use TSL 1.2"<br />
Click 'Ok' button...<br />
Try again, the "Something went wrong" error should be gone...<br />

            I should have replied to this. What ultimately fixed all my problems was setting my network connection from "Public" to "Private". I have no idea why Microsoft would think that I wouldn't want to access users, the store, or any other Microsoft service
 when on a "public" connection, but they do (at least on my computer).

                    The mouse works fine on my Windows 7, but it lagged when I was using it on Windows 8.1. So now I am using the Arc Touch Mouse on my Windows 8.1, and use the Wedge Touch Mouse on Windows 7. But in the ideal world, I bought the Wedge Touch Mouse for my Windows
 8.1, please help to fix the issue. Thank you.

            Dear RajithR,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your pump reply. This is service! LOL</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am not an expert in computers. I do use computer a lot but I seldom fix computer problems. The methods you posted above are easy to follow, so I tried them all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 1: I went through d) and it said "Hardware changes might not have been detected" I believe the computer thinks everything works fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 2: Follow all the steps to uninstall and re-install the driver, which is the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center, and the problem still exists.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Action Center: It is similar to Method 1? I went through some of the issues and did not find any problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Check the Window Compatibility Center: I clicked in to have a look but could not find anything helpful.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So basically I tried the methods and they did not help. So I am now using the Arc Touch Mouse on my Sony Duo 13, which is running a build-in Windows 8.1. The Wedge Touch Mouse paired back to my MacBook Air, running OS X Mavericks and Windows 7. The Wedge
 Touch Mouse works great on my MacBook Air on either operating system, just not all the times I can press the right click; However on Windows 8.1, the clicking is fine, but the moving is not good. It lagged and stored and I do not have confidence that it will
 point to where I want it to. The Arc Touch Mouse works perfectly on both machines. I would recommend the Arc Touch Mouse to my friends if they look for a special mouse like me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The above is my own experience. I hope this can help to find a solution soon. Thank you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards,</div>
<div>Andy</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. If the Wedge Touch Mouse does not work well with Windows 8.1, what other mouse will you suggest?</div>
<div><br />

<div>Well, I've done all of these things a half dozen times, and it still doesn't work. Most of the time the mouse doesn't show up on the "Finding Bluetooth devices" screen. Sometimes it will work for 10 minutes then quit. &nbsp;Then 15 minutes of fiddling (away
 from real work) and if I'm really lucky, it will work for a few minutes. but mostly it is wasted time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Someone at microsoft has to look into this seriously. &nbsp;I believe it is a Win 8,1 problem; this all worked fine under Win 8. &nbsp;(At least for me it did),</div>

            <p>I am also having the same problems with my wedge mouse.&nbsp; However, I am a technology specialist and work with all types of machines, and devices.&nbsp; My wedge mouse worked great on Windows 8, but after the upgrade it all went wacky.&nbsp; The mouse is found as a
 Bluetooth, no problem.&nbsp; The software, I have installed and reinstalled to get the drivers.......however the mouse moves all over the screen, and will not go where you point it.&nbsp; I uninstall, unpaired, put in new batteries, and then I give up and put in my
 usb mouse, and I feel my ears burning as well as my hard earned cash.&nbsp; This mouse worked great before the update, and sometimes works for me, then&nbsp; I will reboot, or go from work to home, and bam, all is screwy again.&nbsp; Driving me crazy.&nbsp; So I have basically
 given up and tell everyone who asks me about my Surface Pro 2 that I love it, but DO NOT BUY the wedge mouse.&nbsp; I don't think this is what you want.&nbsp; I would be happy to work with anyone to help you see the problem.'</p>

            <p>I am curious if you found a solution or did you just stop using the mouse? </p>
<p>I have the same problem and I am really mad. I bought this - insanely high priced - original Microsoft mouse with my surface pro 2 and it went silly just after the 8.1 update. I was waiting for fixes with every patchday but nothing so far.
</p>
<p>Just mentioning that this device cost me 70€ (EUROS!!!!!!!!).<br />

            No the mouse didn't work for several months with 8.1. &nbsp;But after the recent update to "Windows 8.1 Update 1" (last week?) the wedge mouse seems to be working fine again. &nbsp;Weird but true (at least for me).&nbsp;

Either verifier was not enabled or the driver was not among those being examined.&nbsp; It was apparently related to the video driver.<br />
<br />
You can check to see if verifier is running by typing verifier /query .&nbsp; If it is running it will show you the list of drivers being examined.<br />

<h2>            Need Help Windows 7 Firewall Rules</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I am using Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate Edition, with all patches and updates from MS applied. I use the Windows Firewall as well as Microsoft Security Essentials. I have no other firewall or security software.</p>
<p><strong><span>I wish to make a firewall rule to do the following for one single specific program (executable file) that I specify:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>- block ALL incoming connections</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>- block ALL outgoing connections, EXCEPT to one specific remote IP that I specify</span></strong></p>
<p>I have tried doing this in many ways, but none of them work. By default, Windows Firewall blocks incoming connections unless you specifically permit them. Since I did not permit incoming connections for this program, this is not a problem.</p>
<p>The problem is with outgoing connections. I made a rule using the following procedure:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click Start, type WF.msc, and press Enter.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Click Outbound Rules, then choose Action-&gt;new Rule.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Choose Custom.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Choose This Program path, and specify which program this rule applies to.</p>
<p>5. Click Next twice.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Under Which remote IP addresses does this rule apply to, choose These IP addresses, and add IP addresses.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Choose Allow the connection.</p>
<p>8. Under Choose Network Profile, chose all 3, apply to all profiles.</p>
<p>9. Named the rule.</p>
<p>After doing this procedure, the rule was created. However, it doesn't work. The firewall continues to allow outgoing connections to ALL IPs, not just the single IP I allowed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I create a rule to block outgoing for all IPs, that works. But that's not what I want to do - I want to block outgoing to all IPs, EXCEPT the one I specify.</p>
<p>I even tried creating two rules - one to block all outgoing connections, and the second to specifically allow outgoing connection to one single IP. In that case, it just blocks all, including the one I want to allow.</p>
<p>Is there any way around this problem, or is this just a limitation of Windows Firewall?</p>

            You need to set windows firewall to block all outbound connections. Then create rules for what you want to allow to make outbound connections.

<blockquote>You need to set windows firewall to block all outbound connections. Then create rules for what you want to allow to make outbound connections.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, I figured this out a few days ago. Unfortunately, this is not the solution I was looking for. Although I have since switched to Norton Firewall, I will post what I found out here, for others who might have the same problem.</p>
<p>Here is what I wanted to do: I wanted to select certain programs on my computer, and (1) block all inbound connections to them, plus (2) block all outbound connections made by them,<strong>except</strong> (3) allow outbound connections made by those programs
<strong>only</strong> to the specific IPs that I permit.</p>
<p>This cannot be done with the default firewall behavior, which is to allow all outbound connections made by all programs. You can indeed make a firewall rule like the one I described above, but Windows will simply ignore it. So while your rule says "block
 all outbound except to this specific IP", in fact Windows will allow all outbound connections to all IPs. This is because the default behavior of the Windows firewall is to allow all outbound connections freely.</p>
<p>As you said, this default can be changed to block all outbound connections. If you change this default behavior, then your rule will indeed be enforced. However, changing the default behavior of the Windows firewall in this way is impractical for most people,
 because Windows firewall was not designed for this purpose. Let me explain what I mean.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you change the default behavior of Windows firewall to block all outbound connections, then all outbound connections will be blocked. However, many Windows services need to make outbound connections, and so all these services will<strong>stop working</strong>.
 Your Windows installation will be crippled. </li><li>What is worse, you will have no indication why it's crippled. All you will see is that some things stop working. Windows firewall provides no means to figure out what stopped working and why.</li><li>How do other firewalls let you do this then? It's simple - if you set default behavior on most firewalls to block outbound connections (hey, you don't even have to set it that way, that's their default behavior from the very start), then this is what happens:
 when a Windows service needs to start an outbound connection, the firewall detects it, blocks it, but then<strong>pops up a message</strong> on your screen telling you "Program X, located on your hard drive at the path Y, attempted to open a connection to
 IP address Z. Do you want to allow this connection?" Further, this pop-up box gives you the option to answer "yes" either temporarily (allow this once), or permanently (always allow this).
</li><li>As a result, Windows continues to work fine. The firewall just has an initial learning phase of a day or so in which you have to tell it "these Windows programs are fine, let them through", and it is easy to do so by just clicking "allow" on the pop-up
 warning. You remain safe from all other potentially dangerous programs, because the default continues to be that the firewall will block all outbound connections unless you specifically allow them.</li><li>However, Windows Firewall is broken in this sense because <strong>it does not give you any pop-up warnings</strong> when it blocks outbound connections. As a result, there is no easy way to allow certain essential Windows components through the firewall.
 You are left to your own devices to figure out what stopped working and why. Then you have to manually make an exception for it in the firewall, searching for the program on your hard drive, then making the rule for it. Worse, for many Windows components,
 it is not immediately obvious which program to allow. For example, if your Windows Update stops working and you think it's because of the firewall, even if you figure out which file on your hard drive does Windows Update, you still won't get it to work just
 by allowing that program through the firewall. This is because many Windows programs depend upon some other Windows service to do the job. In case of Windows Update, you would need to find out which Windows Service the Windows Update program uses to connect
 to the update servers, then allow that in your firewall. </li><li>Needless to say, this is no job for an amateur, and is very tedious even if you are knowledgeable about this sort of thing. You may ask why Windows Firewall has such broken behavior when it comes to outbound rules. The answer is, it was a deliberate design
 decision. MS figured that giving the user too many pop-up warnings was a bad idea, it irritated the users. Perhaps they were influenced by such complaints re: Vista and its UAC warnings. And they also figured that blocking outbound was not needed, on the premise
 that if a program is already on your computer, it must be okay. Therefore, they changed the default behavior on Windows firewall to allow all outbound, and while the option exists in the firewall to change this default, actually changing the default turns
 the firewall into an unusable mess, because it was never intended to be used that way.</li><li>I can't blame MS for making this design decision. They are probably right that most people don't like pop-up warnings, even though they only occur once per program or service. They are probably also right that if the program is already on your computer,
 it must be safe. Hey, if it weren't safe, wouldn't your anti-virus and malware detector have already caught it? You do run an anti-virus and anto-malware program, don't you? You know they're infallible, right? So everything's fine! Except for people like myself,
 who deliberately need outbound connection control. </li></ul>
<p>My answer to all this was to simply switch to Norton Firewall, which does everything I need right out of the box. The downside of doing so was that for some silly reason, Norton doesn't let you use their firewall alone, if you use their firewall, you must
 use their antivirus too. There is no way to switch one off without switching the other off as well. So I had to give up using Microsoft Security Essentials, which I thought was an excellent program. Ah well.</p>

            Let's revive an old thread but with a twist...<br />
<br />
Using the exact same scenario JV12 described but add ICS and clients behind it.&nbsp; I must block tcp:25 from the clients to the internet.<br />
<br />
1. I created an oubound block tcp:25 rule which did block the ICS box itself...BUT it would not block the clients.<br />
2. I then blocked all outbound with the exact same behavior as in #1.<br />
<br />
Poor wittle MS...maybe this customer will finally see the light and allow me to replace that undercooked Win 7 box with a linux/iptables box....a real HBF<br />

            <p>Heya! </p><p><br /></p><p>As gds1972 mentioned save files would be stored locally when offline. Generally speaking they would store in the same location on the console as the game.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thus you can control this somewhat by installing games on an external hard drive or transferring games and data to an external drive.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope that helps clarify and feel free to post back with follow up questions! </p>

 </blockquote> <p>Game saves are saved locally and to the cloud at the same time. So once you go offline you will still be able to play where your cloud save was when at your brothers house.</p><p><br /></p><p>another thing that you want to keep in mind first you will need to make sure that your console is set as your home console and also go into network settings and put your console into offline mode otherwise when you go to your brothers house it will not allow you to play your digital games.</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>this new UI really is just horrible.... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            this new UI really is just horrible....</h2>
                    
<p>let's be clear here there are some things this new UI does fanstaticly. it multitasks quite well, it pins things rather well, and it is overall quite seamless and runs smoothly. my beef however is several things seem to have vanished that the 360 could do.</p>

<p>1. you used to be able to set controller settings. you could set all games to invert controls, turn off vibrations, and seems like something else i cant remember. now you are the mercy of the game itself. Im not sure who thought removing this was a grand
 idea but it needs to return. those of us with carpel tunnel syndrome or other tendon problems really do hate you for this removed feature....its honestly almost worth trading in the system already for as my hand just cant take the constant vibration which
 really adds 0 to the gameplay. Ive yet to really meet a person in real life that likes vibration.</p>
<p>2. it really is not user friendly like it claims. finding stuff is a nightmare. things seem hidden all over the place. some things appear changed for no reason at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. speaking of unncessary changes....what braindead person said we need to remove the ability to manage our storage space especially given the size of game installs? Ive seen the xbox one pop up a message saying it will warn me when space is getting low
 so I can only assume there is an option for it somewhere that is inexplicably blocked off until storage gets too low. there is 500 GB and I assume 30 or so of that is to the OS and with 4 games I am sure I have probably used up 150 GB roughly but thanks to
 some bone headed development I have no idea.</p>
<p>4. Im not sure if Ryse is the only guilty one here but it will say while its install &nbsp;I can play the game however when I goto the game the in game menu tells me it is still installing...worse still this causes the install to glitch and forces me to restart
 it. if i cant manage the HDD space and not every game lets me play without installing.....that really is just stupid.</p>
<p>5. its no longer a simple press the center button to get to your friends....its press the center button, scroll to friends, press that, then find your friends.</p>
<p>6, achievement pop ups appear to be more intrusive for some reason....furthermore Im not sure there is an option to turn them off now. on the 360 i loved hearing them on the xbox one they are a bit annoying and intrusive. i also think they take longer to
 pop is the reason on the 360 it popped by showing it all at once on the one it says "achievement unlocked" then *insert achievement and gamerpoints unlocked here* and it stays longer. speaking of achievements the achievement menu to see what you have is just
 horrible. the 360 was a nice and neat list....this is scattered and mixed with the challenges inexplicably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. the xbox one has 3 main tabs....the 360 had 5 or 6? i cant remember. the bottom line is on the 360 if i wanted to goto music I could because there was a music tab. now the music is buried in some other section somewhere. everything doesnt need to be put
 under 2 main tabs as one of the 3 main tabs is just a tab for pinning things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i really probably could go on but overall this new UI is horrible. from top to bottom it is a nightmare and poorly designed. though i give the system credit for some amazing graphics and multitasking ability and the new kinect and other things. but the UI
 seriously needs to be redone and have a complete make over.</p>

<p>no it doesnt take getting used to because a fair amount of what i posted is removed features especially points 1-3 and point 4 is an illustration of how something doesnt work right and the rest are things are hidden, scattered, or made more annoying.</p>

<p>Ryse for instance does not have the option in the menu and Forza doesnt have much of any options(like many 360 games). again why remove such a great feature? as well as other things that have mysteriously been taken out. nevermind the fact you cant see your
 storage and manage it like you can on the 360 and make save back ups because we all know it will happen soon enough....saves getting corrupted mysteriously for no reason at all.</p>
<p>furthermore Im not really sure how others think this is a great new UI....it removed many things and buried other things in an endless array of submenus. Music and movies should have their own category not tossed into the games menu.</p>
<p>honestly it really seems like they spent a lot of time perfecting the 360 UI(one of the reasons i prefer it to the ps3) and just decided to go "screw that" and nuke it with a giant reset for no reason at all.</p>

<p>You clearly don't realise you can 'Pin' anything you want to your pins menu. Highlight Movies, Music or whatever you want and press the 'menu' button. You can Pin to home screen. Now they're always on the left of main home screen. Simple. Works for pretty
 much everything. </p>
Also if you use voice controls it's really easy and fast to get to stuff.

            As Sumit says, we are not allowed to tell you how to hack a computer.
<br />
<br />That being said I can give you general information. Since it is your computer you have physical access to it. That is the main thing you need. Next google for cracking passwords. There are a number of free utilities you can use to reset windows passwords.

The next version of Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703 is another release users will need to prepare for before upgrading. The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that. If you have been making attempts to upgrade without success, you probably need to check the manufacturers website for your computer model to find out if its compatible with the Creators Update or Anniversary Update or not.">

            <p>**** Greg,</p>
<p>I have taken your advice to do a clean install of which was great up to activation of my OEM asus laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to look around using admin cmd prompt to go through windows\system \. Key oem which worked I found the original key used then with help of a person named Rawaj from Microsoft Answer desk did a remote connect and then ruined six days of hard work trying
 to fix mess creators update caused when trying to make the update install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg I got the clean install done then because it wouldnt activate due to him doing a stupid thing caused by him asking me to explain how I got to state of doing a clean install to fix all update issues ive had since creators update was updated on 5/04/2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as said earlier I explained the story to him I had read in the community about a clean Install your advice and post so he went and read it when he got to that part about entering a key mention and photo of their default key used to upgrade home to professional
 he seemed to go then to my system then did my system same as that exact post and now I have a real problem,he said I have to find a computer with home edition and download home edition ISO file with media creator tool to make another usb stick of win 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when done another clean install using home usb media then activate it using my key originally used in OEM seting up originally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft gave me no help they caused this and didnt fix it up.I should not have to repair their errors its other way around isnt it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg Im lost now as I have not a clue how to make a usb stick with win 10 home on it from another &nbsp;persons laptop using home edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all ideas valued and i appreciate all the help i do get from yours and others posts in here its awesome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>respectfully</p>

            <p>Hi! I'm Gary! Greg is the expert ! I hope he will join us later! I'm really not sure what you are having problems with. Is the problem activating the OME Asus laptop. When you say the MS help expert messed up your PC. Can you be more specific. How did he
 mess it up. Does the PC have 'Creator' on it?</p>
<p>Is activating the Key your only problem?? Hopefully Greg or Andre will see this thread and join us. I'm going to be busy until this evening, and will check back later. Sorry you are having so much trouble, We'll get it solved, so don't worry! Sunday is a
 bad day to get help here on the forum! Please explain what problem your having!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;thank you mate for reply, I don't want to name and shame anyone Microsofts Answer desk operator Rawaj connected to me as I had done the Clean Install,after six days of trying to use new creators update it wouldn't update using
 their update assistant &nbsp;errors were all pointing to the drive being corrupted with un associated files this SSD drive is able to satisify the requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay he connected to me remotely as I did clean install ok </p>
<p>then it wouldn't activate at all using the original key he then proceeded to look for the reasons why my original OEM key wouldn't activate so he looked at my version, went into registery editor, altered the key for activation then typed in a key to activate
 the OS however it changed the version it did upgrade OS features from home to professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gary this caused my system to fail the activation again it's not a professional OEM Originally it was a Home version .I looked at the iso file he downloaded for me to make a usb install stick which was the wrong version &nbsp;it appears now to be windows professional
 one would assume all we had to do was activate it using a registered win 7 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft techie told me all they can do is advise me &nbsp;to actually make a bootable usb stick with win 10 Home on it to do another Clean Install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive now borrowed a neighbours laptop with win 10 Home on it,I am now trying to make this to try install home from scratch then try activation again using the original key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate what these answer desk techie do I just dont like how they left me with this problem he made I had a clean installed OS which was fine now after he typed in default key to alter features then downloaded wrong ISO to do another install I stopped
 him saying he won't be able to finish this because it wasn't home version he knew this at the start of the remote connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im left with a laptop under warranty with no OS working,it's not activated, I have used over 30 GB of data in last six days with eight attempts to use creators update has really given me a great look around this new OS.</p>
<p>I feel that this has long term problems with activation failing I say this as we even tried my uncles approved win 7 key which MS said was good to use of which also FAILED indicating OS is not able to be activated so I am reading the many thousands of consumers
 stories with similar problems after a clean install that's not allowing consumers to Activate their OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep going and will post up my results in about five hours.</p>

            <p>Hi! I will be on the forum for awhile now.&nbsp; I really don't understand what all has happened and what went wrong.</p>
<p>It is not a hard process to create a USB flash drive to install W10. You just go to the media creation tool site and follow the directions. You don't need a PC that has Windows Home. You decide that when your creating the USB flash for a different PC. If
 the PC has Windows home, that's what you chose. Also 32 or 64 bit. It's very simple. Here's tutorial by Shawn Brink that explains how do do this. You can do this with any PC. Here's a couple of links that should help you understand these things. Let me know
 if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>Gary!</p>

            Hi Md, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user. I'm sorry to hear about your loss.
<br />
<br />If you don't know the password to log into the laptop, you can follow the steps in the Microsoft Support article I've linked below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12429/microsoft-account-sign-in-cant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12429/...</a>
<br />
<br />It'll guide you through all the steps you'll need to log into the laptop. The last step is to reset the laptop, which will remove the files and apps. If all else fails, this step will definitely work.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need more support. Thanks!       
        </p>

            I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

    <title>Microsoft XP Professional OEM license that came with sticker pasted - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft XP Professional OEM license that came with sticker pasted over the OEM machine</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question regarding legitimate usage of Microsoft XP Professional OEM license with sticker pasted over HP machines. I bought a few such old desktops from a local vendor few months back. These machines have Microsoft XP Professional sticker pasted
 over the desktop body (the sticker also mentions that the license is not to be sold separately). I also formatted the machines and installed XP professional on the machines once again and activated the XP online using the key pasted over the desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Vendor had told me that these are OEM licenses and they go along with the desktop on which they have been installed. If the desktop is sold to anyone, it is legitimate to the buyer to use the Windows XP OS on that desktop legally. I want a re-confirmation
 on this. Can anyone please advise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jags</p>

            <p>Hello Jags,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the PC is sold on then the copy of Windows can go with it. Having an OEM licence simply means that a) the licence is less expensive than a retail licence and b) the licenced software can only be installed on the original machine. In other words you cannot
 use the CD of Windows XP that you have to install another copy of Windows on another machine. It must always be installed on the first machine you installed it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While 'retail' versions of the software are more expensive, the buyer is not restricted as an OEM would be. For example, with a retail copy, you could install it on one machine then, after a few years, scrap that machine and re-install the copy of Windows
 onto a new machine. With an OEM copy you can only install it on the very first PC. If that PC is ultimately scrapped the&nbsp;software licence dies with it.</p>

    <title>Oblivion Spell Crafting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dre g writer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Oblivion Spell Crafting</h2>
                    
<p><span>Ok, so This is my first playthrough as a Mage in this game. I've never quite beaten this game yet. I always stopped mid way through it when im about 70 hours in the playthrough to play some new game I might have gotten.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This time im not playing any game till Ive beaten this ***.<br />
<br />
SO far im 80 hours into this playthorugh according to raptr.<br />
<br />
So I just got into the mages guild university and I learned of the spell crafting. I didnt even knew this existed when I played the other playthrough because they were melee characters and didnt use magic at all. So I didnt even bother to go up to those podiums
 and see what they did till like two days ago.<br />
<br />
So what are some good spells to create??? From reading some of the tips in the loading screens, it said I was able to create some spells that can only be obtained through spell creation. And now I see what they meant<br />
<br />
I came up with some nice spells myself that I havent found in the game else where.<br />
<br />
Like I have these Elemental magic spells that I been using since I made them. And they are quite powerful.<br />
<br />
I use this spell on a enemy when I first see them&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Elemental weakness:<br />
100% weakness to fire<br />
100% weakness to frost<br />
100% weakness to shock<br />
<br />
After I weaken them I use the spells below<br />
<br />
Elemental Bolt:<br />
30 fire damage on target<br />
30 frost damage on target<br />
30 shock damage on target<br />
<br />
in groups of enemies I use this<br />
<br />
Elemental Bomb:<br />
30 fire damage in 10ft on target<br />
30 frost damage in 10ft on target<br />
30 shock damage in 10ft on target<br />
<br />
and then enemies get up close,<br />
I use this<br />
<br />
Elemental Palm Strike:<br />
45 fire damage on touch<br />
45 frost damage on touch<br />
45 shock damage on touch<br />
<br />
You guys have some unique spells you would like to share with us???<br />
<br />
*by the way* I closed down a lot of oblivion gates and enchanted all my armor with magicka enforcing sigil stones so I have like almost 500 magicka.<br />
<br />
I've been really enjoying playing as a mage since I started creating my own spells. I hope we can create spells in Skyrim. With the fact that you can dual wield spells and combine them for a unique and powerful spell, I will be very exited to see what we can
 come up with.<br />
<br />
Fire in one hand and lighting in the other, put them both together and............*** TIME!!!!</span></p>

            Hi Jellie,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and welcome to <strong>
Windows 10 </strong>family.</div>
<div><br />
This issue might occur due to corrupt or outdated display&nbsp;drivers or may be due to conflict with third party hardware/software.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Check if the issue occurs in safe mode with networking and perform clean boot.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode with networking.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Log in to the Windows 10 computer with any <strong>administrator account.<br />
</strong>2.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows + R </strong>to open <strong>Run command</strong>.<br />
3. Type <strong>MSCONFIG </strong>and press Enter.<br />
4. From the System Configuration box, go to the <strong>Boot </strong>tab.<br />
5. Under the Boot options section, <strong>check the Safe boot checkbox with network.<br />
</strong>6. Click <strong>OK</strong>, and when prompted, click <strong>Restart </strong>
to start Windows 10 in Safe Mode. Alternatively you can also click the Exit without restart button to continue working with the OS, and allow Windows 10 to boot in safe mode the next time the computer starts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2</strong>: If the issue doesn’t occur in Safe Mode with networking, then proceed to
<strong>Clean Boot </strong>steps given in the link below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the below link to learn how to perform a clean boot in Windows:<br />

<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the KB article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</strong></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Update the display drivers and check. <br />
</strong>1. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</div>
<div>2. Right click on <strong>Display Adaptor </strong>and select <strong>update driver</strong>.</div>
<div>3. Follow the onscreen directions. Once the driver is updated, <strong>restart

    <title>USB drive access denied No security tab Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> es_2017  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB drive access denied No security tab Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;<span>tried to access files from an usb flash drive and got access denied pop up, click continue &amp; was asked to set the permission in security tab, except there is
 no security tab on the next popup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My AutoPlay setting is Ask me every time.</span></p>
<p><span>The device shows up as Z drive under Windows Explorer but G under Device manager.</span></p>
<p><span>The event for the drive was device not migrated</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
This is the link I found that solved the problem couple years back but the menu items are different nowadays</p>
<p>
<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebooks-Archive-Read-Only/Access-Denied-on-USB-drives/m-p/3662944/highlight/true#M13140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebooks-Archive-Rea</a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I think the problem is on permission or some sort of security restriction because</p>
<p>
1. The drive works on other machines &amp; has no virus.</p>
<p>
2. I tried to Takeown on the drive but it won't take the command on a whole drive. And I tried to add Take ownership on the context menu, still didn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
3. Also turned off Windows Defender but didn't seem to matter.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This link didn't resolve the issue but I tried it anyway.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>try accessing it using the hidden admin to check if it will work: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/enable-the-hidden-administrator-account-on-windows-vista/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other option is to copy files to a different computer, reformat the thumb drive to FAT32 put the files back in and check if that fixes the problem.</p>

            Some USB drives have their own security software files on the drive itself, e.g. SanDiskSecureAccessV2_win.exe. If you run this "exe" file, you should be able to set up your password and then you can complete edit functions on the files contained on the
 drive. The feature is designed to protect your files should you lose the USB drive.

            <p>I upgraded from 8.1 Pro and everything was working fine until I tried using PowerDVD 15, an upgrade from PowerDVD 12 which came with my laptop, and it won't recognize DVDs; it says no media present.&nbsp; I've ejected the DVD, popped it out, moved it around,
 re-inserted, and still won't recognize the DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having no problems with 8.1 Pro before the upgrade, just didn't like scattered arrangement of everything in the Win 8/8.1 layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this isn't fixed soon, before the rollback deadline,&nbsp;I have no problem reverting back until it's fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an older laptop running Vista which works with no problems either but it's slower and not capable of upgrading to Win 10 but capable of Win 7.&nbsp; I've thought about upgrading to Win 7 on it but like I said it works without a problem and finding
 a new copy of Win 7 is very difficult.</p>

<p>You have until&nbsp;July 29, 2016 to upgrade for free. &nbsp;Not sure if you upgrade, then revert back to your previous version, if it will still be free, but if all functions of W10 are not working properly, it's pointless to upgrade. &nbsp;All my issues were resolved
 once I restored W7. &nbsp;I think I typed in restore in the windows start search box, then chose backup restore. &nbsp;I also created a backup of W7 as instructed, so I may have just restored from the backup, but I can't remember exactly how I did it. &nbsp;Now I am able
 to use the cd drive, and when I connect my iphone, I/a able to download the pix to the Win photo gallery with no problems.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem with my laptop where I lost sound (upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 Premium), Media Player wouldn't work and my DVD/CD-ROM drive seemed to be unable to read either a CD or a DVD disc. Doing a web I found a possible solution to
 my loss of sound. That was to switch my Sound, video and game controller to the Windows 10 "High Definition Audio Device". I did get sound back but I am getting some periodic sound distortion (a "BZZT" that occurs frequently enough to be irritating). My DVD/CD-ROM
 Drive is also working. &nbsp;My DVDs movies play via the Windows 10 "Windows DVD Player" and my music CDs play via "Windows Media Player".</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install the High Definition Audio Device, I followed these steps:</p>
<p>
1. Right click the Windows 10 icon on left end of your Task Bar<br />
2. Click Device Manager<br />
3. Click Sound, video game controllers<br />
4. Right click the S,v &amp; g controller and select "Update Driver Software..."<br />
5. Click “Select Browse my computer for driver software”<br />
6. Click "Let me pickup from a list of device drivers on my computer”<br />
7. In the next screen enable check box (if not already checked) - show compatible hardware.<br />
8. Choose from the list “High Definition Audio Device” and click next.<br />
9. If a pop up window (Update Driver Warning "Installing this device driver is not recommended...", select Yes<br />

 trying to read the disc with blinking green lights and grinding sound. Eventually it fails and shows the message "Please insert a disk into CD Drive".</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have before tried the filter removal method and controller 0 addition method using registry . I had powerISO third party software and uninstalled the same .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">None of them have worked . Is there something still i should be trying out ?</span></p>
