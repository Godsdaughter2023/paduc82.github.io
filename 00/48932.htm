<h2>            Windows Explorer -Closes unexpectedly</h2>
                    <p>When browsing my files using Win Explorer. it behaves strangely at times.&nbsp; Sometimes the cursor jumps to the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Actually this happens approx 90% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Less common is Win Exp will close and send me to the previous app.&nbsp; Then I must reopen Explorer and navigate back to where I was before I was taken elsewhere.&nbsp; BTW if I have more than 1 Explorer open, all will close.</p>

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />Could be palm drag if this is a laptop using a mouse.  This is why most touchpad software has a choice to disable it when a mouse is plugged in.  
<br />
<br />If this applies install the latest touchpad software from the PC's Support Downloads web page,  then go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad and also in the Additional Settings there at the right side of the page to open Mouse Properties and look at the last tab where the Touchpad software installs itself for a box to check to Disable touchpad when external pointing device is plugged in.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise What I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, it fixes most problems.  If not you'll know it's due to a program conflict and we can go from there. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Open Start, type: file explorer options 
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Under the General tab, click in the Open File Explorer to then choose  "This PC". 
<br />
<br />Try WinKey + E now. If it opens fine, then the problem is with Quick access cache, which can be cleared by deleting *.automaticDestinations-ms from the following directory, using Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: %AppData%
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Then navigate to that folder. 
<br />
<br />Could be an issue with your display driver.
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Display adapters
<br />Right click the current display adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />Exit Device Manager

<p>Is this an issue that has cropped up since the last update? Can someone trouble shoot it for me? I would like to be able to use skype.</p>

    <title>Blue Screen in XP Pro SP3 DRIVER IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atlbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen in XP Pro SP3 DRIVER IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL</h2>
                    <p>Ran an uninstaller several days ago which had been recommended to me by a computer tech as a good program. On the advice of the program I removed what were identified as remnants of old programs that had been uninstalled. I guess I removed some important
 files, because right after running the uninstaller things started going wrong. First I couldn't open MS Office. Then I noticed weird events in the internet browser. In the ad spaces I kept getting a request to install flash player.</p>
<p>The program that stood out to me of ones identified as missing by the program was Windows Installer. &nbsp;Pretty sure in this batch of files were some important things. &nbsp;Looking back, it's kind of like the installer program was set up to remove the Windows installer
 and replace it with itself. &nbsp;Not very good for me, since this installer is a manual installer while the Windows version is automatic.<br />
</p>
<br />
&nbsp;I did a system restore, and I was able to open MS Office. However, macro controls and active x objects weren't loading, and macros would not run for the most part. Reinstalled flash and shockwave and that resolved the problem. I have active x video controls
 in some of my Office files. The flash was the problem. For whatever reason, this had been affecting the macros. I soon discovered, though, that many of my programs had lost their functionality. They might open, but there was no function to them. An example
 is MagicIso and MagicDisc. I reinstalled all the programs that I noticed had a problem, and the problem went away.<br />
<br />
I also had one hardware problem. The two USB ports on the front of the machine were out. There was power and they showed up in XP, but they wouldn't function. I downloaded and installed the chipset driver, and that problem was resolved.<br />
<br />
Since this problem, I have had two BSOD which initiated full memory dumps. This most recent one is a 0x000000d1 if anyone is familiar with the various ones. Using Blue Screen View, I was able to determine that the dump was caused by ntkrnlpa.exe.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The BSs are happening randomly, so I can't associate them with any particular action, but I would like to see if I can come up with a resolution to this problem if possible. So far there seems to be a thread of reinstalling things. I do know that the files
 removed by the uninstaller were almost certainly .dll files. There were a number of error messages right after I removed the files about missing .dlls. I also remember .dlls going by during the uninstall process.<br />
<br />
I have attached the Crash List and the specifics of the memory dump in a picture. The previous dump was a 0x0000000A type. I didn't get the specifics, but I did do some research. Decided to wait to see if it happened again.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any idea what I should do, your input is fervently accepted...<br />
<br />
Oh, to see the notepad file best, turn off word wrap...

            <p>You can delete the MEMORY.DMP file anytime although&nbsp;this file can be handy in that it may contain more information than a minidump file.</p>
<p>But usually the minidump files are sufficient.</p>
<p>Looking at the minidump files with WinDbg of the Debugging Tools for Windows seems to suggest the problem is with USB.</p>
<p>This could be hardware or software.</p>
<p>One thing, there have reports of blue screen issues in some XP SP3&nbsp;setups that may be from an issue with the USB stack.</p>
<p>So I would suggest to install the following update for USB and see if it helps any:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969238</a></p>
<p>There is a link at the top of the article to request the hotfix.</p>
<p>Also, there does appear to be an issue with the USBAVCap.sys driver.</p>
<p>In one of the crashes the process that crashed was the <a href="http://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/process/dtsrvc.exe.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DTSRVC.exe</a> which is a process related to&nbsp; "Portrait Displays" software.</p>
<p>So there may be a clash between the&nbsp; AVerMedia driver and the Portrait Displays driver(s).</p>
<p>So try the hotfix first and if issues continue uninstall the Portrait Displays software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I just noticed this in&nbsp;some of the crashes:</p>
<p><em>BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER (fe)<br />
USB Driver bugcheck, first parameter is USB bugcheck code.<br />
Arguments:<br />
Arg1: 00000002, <strong>BAD_URB</strong> <strong>The USB client driver has submitted a URB that is<br />
&nbsp;still attached to another IRP still pending in the bus<br />
&nbsp;driver.</strong><br />
Arg2: 8977abc8, Address of pending IRP.<br />
Arg3: 8a8580a8, Address of IRP passed in.<br />
Arg4: 89429a48, Address URB that caused the error.</em></p>
<p>That&nbsp; URB issue appears to be specifically addressed in the hotfix.</p>

<h2>            Trending on Xbox</h2>
                    <p>I buy my xbox one and 360 less than 2 years ago, before i choose xbox i was a playstation gamer and got all consoles from sony since first playstation. But&nbsp;i am real frustrated to see that this console is more a place for spam postings in trending on xbox like a "facebook/instagramm box one" full of trash with content WITHOUT gamer stuff. Only people wich fishing "shares&amp;likes&amp;adds". My question is can xbox make this more individual? Dashboards full of trash is not what i want, maybe an option to for individual customisation or the choose for deactivation in xbox settings?</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope&nbsp;microsoft support do something, i am only intersted in stuff about gaming and not this. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Actions under Scanner Properties</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a multifunction Canon I've successfully installed on a Win 7/64 bit machine and shared across a home network.</p>
<p>I haven't installed any of the Canon utilities but can print from any pc and have used Windows Fax and Scan to scan a document so I know the unit is capable of working.</p>
<p>What doesn't work is the ability to used the controls on the Canon and save a scan to the PC (or pdf file).</p>
<p>Control Panel / scanner properties / events shows "Take no action" highlighted, but there's two more radio buttons, one with the statement "No application registered for this event". The other "prompt for which program to run".</p>
<p>What I'm trying to understand is the process of "registering" applications and more importantly what "applications"&nbsp; other than the Canon utility might be appropriate.</p>

            In Canon speak, registering means associating an application (ie software) to run when you press the button.&nbsp; It could be a PDF creator, or an image editor or indeed fax software.

<h3> cuzsal  say:</h3>
<h2>            .flac does no open the way it should, help&#33;</h2>
                    <br />
I have a very odd problem, I play my video files in media player, and audio files in Winamp. All play fine but, when I double click or even do an open with on a .flac audio file it opens up into media player. The file association is set to Winamp, even the
 icon on the .flac file is the Winamp one. If I drag and drop the .flac file into Winamp it plays just fine, if it’s in a playlist if plays fine, but if I try to open it with a double click or open with it opens media player and plays in that. I noticed the
 same thing for .ogg audio files as well actually. Also when I right click the .flac file Enqueue in Winamp does not show up, only Bookmark in Winamp. Many months ago it would be open in Winamp, this is a recent problem, and no idea when it started I just noticed
 it :/<br />
<br />
I use Windows 7 x64, Shark007 Win 7 and x64 codec pack. I uninstalled all codec’s even Winamp restarted pc, installed Winamp first set the file associations but still the same problem, so I don’t think it has to do with codec’s, I think. Really no idea what
 to do any help would be nice I’ve been stuck on this for a few days.

</span><span><span>b. Click on Non-Microsoft.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>c. Click on Ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now associate .flac files with Winamp and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Teh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might be able to get service for your product if it's out of warranty, but there might be a service fee. If you're unable to setup a service request, it's possible that you haven't registered your Surface product yet. You can go to this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/how-do-i-get-my-surface-serviced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>, and see steps under <strong>Open a service request</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're in the US, you can go to the nearest physical retail <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store</a> and have your Surface checked by our technicians.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any additional concerns, please let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>So I have the device registered to my MSFT account, it just shows that I need to pay $29 to contact Microsoft to set up a paid out of warranty warranty service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wasnt sure if there was another way to create repair order for the device so i dont have to pay an additional $29 on top of the service fee that is required to fix a broken screen surface not under warranty.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Clean Install stuck on &#34;getting files ready to install&#34;...</h2>
                    <p>My friend recently had windows disk errors with his laptop. I told him he should reinstall Windows 10, so I talked him through it, diskpart cleaning the drive, destroying all the partitions. Then it hung at 37-39% on "getting files ready to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at&nbsp;<a href="http://techlightspeed.com/6047/fix-windows-10-install-stuck-at-getting-ready.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a>&nbsp;which told me to turn off secure boot and enable legacy support. However, the Installation still hangs, the
 HP logo shows instead of the Windows one, and after 39% the USB disk light and Internal HDD disk light just stop blinking entirely. I've tried so many things...</p>

            Hi Caitlinga, you would be amazed how many users with HP Streams ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Caitlin, 
<br />
<br />Do you have an external HD or USB? We need to download the update to that, and launch it from there!
<br />
<br />Create a Windows 10 usb flash installer using the free Media Creation Tool at Microsoft. At least 8gb flash drive required:
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Select Download tool now, and select Run.
<br />If you agree to the license terms, select Accept.
<br />On the What do you want to do? page, select Create installation media for another PC, and then select Next.
<br />Select the language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------
<br />
<br />When the flash drive is prepared insert it in a usb port. Browse it and find Setup.exe. Click to run it and choose Upgrade

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />First of all, eliminate all useless files on C:/ by using Disk Cleanup.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3012-open-use-disk-cleanup-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3012-open-u...</a>
<br />Make sure you have checked System files option after the first scan.
<br />Also, 
<br />Treesize should tell you which files and folders are taking up the space.
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />It is worth checking the Users folder and its subfolders with it.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

    <title>How to create Win8 install media after update to 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wstidolph  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create Win8 install media after update to 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought Win8Pro for electronic download/installation, and installed it as 64 bit on &nbsp;my HP laptop (which came with Win7 Home Premium preinstalled). But, I (apparently) didn't create installation media at that time ... at least, I can't find it. It ran fine.
 Then I accepted the Store free update to Win 8.1, and all still runs fine. But now I want to move onto an SSD, by backing up my docs, doing a clean install/ update on that SSD, then restore my docs. For that, I need the installation media for Windows 8 - how
 do I get that image (without spending $25 to have a DVD shipped to me)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft instructions (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a>) are clear they won't work with my Windows
 8 product key. I can't find Microsoft instructions specific to Windows 8 (rather than 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the answer was the Microsoft instructions on how to Upgrade with only a product key (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only</a>)
 ... this offers me two choices, "Install Windows 8.1" or "Install Windows 8". Sadly, although they're downloaded onto and run from a machine running a fully updated and valid Windows 8.1 Pro, both of those fail during Compatibility testing - with no problems
 listed! (And chopped-off text letters, but whatever) Anyway, they won't continue, so I can't ever get to the part about downloading an ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple link to the ISO for Windows 8 installation media? All I want to do is download it and burn it to DVD, so I can use my Win 8 key to install Windows on my new disk. Or a way to create Win 8.1 media from my Win 8.1 installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might suggest I just 'clone' from my HDD to the SSD - and believe me, I'm trying, having used several clone and copy mechanisms. But that's a two-day disaster of boot records and such, much too long a tale for this post :( ...</p>
