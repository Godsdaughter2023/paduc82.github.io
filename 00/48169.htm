<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade fails to download</h2>
                    I am ready to upgrade Windows 7 o Windows 10.&nbsp; I click on the Windows 10 install icon and chose upgrade now option.&nbsp; Starting download symbol spins for some time, and the Windows Update window finally appears, but with no Windows 10 upgrade available.&nbsp;
 Neither is there an error code.&nbsp; There is no record of the download attempt in the update history.&nbsp; I have searched for updates and installed all important updates that show up without changing the experience when I try the Win10 upgrade again.&nbsp; The experience
 is the same whether I try it from the icon in my systray or go to the download from the Microsoft site.&nbsp; What do you recommend?

<p>You can reset Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page. But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>

<span>
<p>Suggest you download and save the Fixit. Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:</p>

<span>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously. Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode. Restart once it's done
 and see if the system can connect to the update servers. If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode. Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your New Year's Eve reply.&nbsp; However, this fix did not work.&nbsp; First to note, the Fix it did not offer me default and aggressive mode.&nbsp; It just ran after I agreed to the terms.&nbsp; After running, the Fix it said it had detected no problems and applied
 no fixes.&nbsp; This is not entirely surprising since I had been installing updates.&nbsp; It is only the Win 10 update that does not download (as stated in&nbsp; my initial statement of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional background not included in my initial question.&nbsp; I had been away from this Win7 computer for 3 months.&nbsp; In the update history, there was evidence of failed Win10 downloads during the time before I left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have applied the Win10 upgrade to another Win7 computer without problem.&nbsp; I certainly would like to solve this problem without having to do a clean reinstall of Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            After not receiving a response to my reply above, I abandoned my effort to upgrade to Win10 in this way.&nbsp; I was in a position to do so since I was able to upgrade through my university's license with Microsoft which also provided me a free upgrade.&nbsp; This
 did not rely on installation through Windows Update and went smoothly.&nbsp; Thus, I am now happily using Win10.&nbsp; Fortunately, the problem I faced appears to be rare.&nbsp; As far as I can see, others confronting the download problem I did without an alternative source
 for a free upgrade may be faced with having to do a clean install of Windows 7 in order to upgrade.<br />

    <title>Ring Continues After Other Person Picks up on Skype to Skype Calls - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ring Continues After Other Person Picks up on Skype to Skype Calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am trying to help someone fix their Skype issue. When they make a Skype to Skype call and the person on the other end picks up, Skype continues to ring.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They can end the ringing by having the person on the other end hang up and waiting for about a minute or two for the ringing to end. Then they make another call and the ringing will stop after the person on the other end picks up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have updated their Skype to version 7.40. We have also deleted files in the C:\Windows\Temp folder. And we have deleted files in the AppData\Local files as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what else to do at this point. Any ideas?</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since, Windows 10 did the update to version 1511 everytime I shutdown or restart the computer the next boot up windows will not detect the usb MJ dongle as a mass storage device. Itâs not in the disk

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Only MJ dongle does this. My wireless mouse and keyboard work along with the printer and my external hdd work as expected. I have formatted the MJ dongle and tried an older upgrade I saved. Did not

 The next day I clean installed 10 with version 1511 again and back to MJ not being recognized at boot again. I tried MJ on my HTPC running Windows 10 version 1511 but with an Asus mobo and an AMD processor. That made no difference. Window would not recognize
 the MJ mass storage device upon restart. Then I remembered my wife's computer had not been upgrade to 10 version 1511 yet. So I tried it there.Low and behold the MJ dongle was recognized at start and restart.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I am convinced that there is something wrong with that 1511 build but I donât have the skills to figure it out..

            <p>Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately your advice did not help. To be fare, I did as you suggested even though I have done that so many times I can't count.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read the link and even tried the compatibility&nbsp; troubleshooter. Set and saved for Windows 7 as I know this magicJack dongle worked flawlessly with 7. It does not work with 10 ver1511 build 10586.63.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though Windows say it is up to date, I checked for updates an only a Defender update was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could just explain how to revert, reinstall, go back to Windows 10.0 build 10240, I am sure that would work as I said earlier I had no issues up until that major update to 1511 build 10586.63. In fact, as I explained I tried it on another computer
 that has not been update to 10586.63 as of yet and it worked perfectly. In fact it worked without doing any of these things being suggested.</p>
<p>Does anyone out there know how to go back to that earlier build? I am beginning to think it can't be done.

<p>I don't get it. It works just fine with XP,7, and Windows10.0 build 10240. I upgrade to 10 ver. 1511 and what worked before now doesn't and there is no answers. It's some how the devices problem. I have to play jumping jacks.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;m having problems with a new user file called &#34;HelpAssistant&#34; and uninvited Remote Desktop activations</h2>
                    On January 27th of this year I received a new user file in Documents and Settings Called
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"HelpAssistant".</span>&nbsp; I've never&nbsp;checked the&nbsp;Remote Desktop box or the Remote Assistance box in the Computer properties.&nbsp;I do not know where it came from nor do I think it is legitimate.&nbsp; I access the "manage" user
 account settings to disable this user account (HelpAssistant); I then have to uncheck the Remote Desktop box in computer properties and press "ok"; then I have to remove the check in the box for remote desktop in firewall.&nbsp;What&nbsp;I'm doing restoring my original
 settings back to before this file appeared on my system in January.&nbsp; I restarted the system afterwards to ensure that all of my setttings are saved.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;log back on to windows XP, my changes are there exept for that user file (HelpAssistant)is still there.&nbsp;Then,
 after a short time, I notice that&nbsp;all of my settings for this &nbsp;local users account in computer management&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;reactivated, the Box&nbsp;for remote desktop is mysteriously checked off again,&nbsp;and the firewall remote desktop box been rechecked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I'm getting annoyed with this file because it is duplicating all of my personal files and using up my hard drive space.&nbsp;I really do not trust what is happening here. I've scanned this file for Viruses and spyware with a fully updated version of Spysweeper and
 with the latest Microsoft Malicious Software removal&nbsp;Tool with no detectable viruses or spyware.&nbsp;
<br />
Is it possible that someone has infiltrated my system through a service port to access my system without using malware?
<br />
Or is this a legitimate function of the system based on a&nbsp;new system&nbsp;update?&nbsp; <br />
The user file (HelpAssistant) restores its functions, files, and everything that applies to it as if it is sharing administrative rights, contrary to my changes as an administraror.&nbsp;
<br />
Is there a Microsoft security program expert out there who can give a detailed explanation for the existance of this file "HelpAssistant" and a reason for it to exist?<br />
Also, is there a reason for having "Remote Desktop" activated with no users on its access&nbsp;list?<br />
Update:&nbsp; I've changed my Windows XP Firewall settings by checking the box to "Allow No Exceptions" and that seems to have stopped whomever is changing my settings.&nbsp; It appears that I have several listed Firewall exceptions for "Services" with TCP port numbers
 that cannot be identified.&nbsp; I will not open Firewall for any unidentifiable exceptions&nbsp;until I get a satisfactory answer to my questions from a Microsoft Security Expert.
<br />
The HelpAssistant user account has unsolicited access to my system by overriding&nbsp;and reactivating&nbsp;the Remote Desktop settings. Its files have grown to over&nbsp;5GB in size and most of it is a duplication of "My Documents"&nbsp;"My Pictures" and other files which are
 private to my user account.&nbsp; For now, I have all of my&nbsp;firewall&nbsp;exceptions deactivated.&nbsp; Is there anyone who can&nbsp;give me some kind of an answer to&nbsp;my&nbsp;questions pertaining to this dilemma?<br />
I have all of my essential files backed&nbsp;to an external&nbsp;hard drive.&nbsp; If&nbsp;found necessary&nbsp;I will&nbsp;reinstall&nbsp;my original version of Windows XP on a new hard drive so that&nbsp;I can start all over from scratch with better security precautions.&nbsp;<br />
Update: In Windows Firewall "Exceptions" there are nine listed Services Ports.&nbsp; I performed an experiment to see what would happen if I&nbsp;unchecked them all and then check the box to allow all exceptions.&nbsp; In just a few minutes four exceptions Services and the
 exception for Remote Desktop was check off from an unknown outside source.&nbsp; In addition to that the User Account for HelpAssistant was changed from its disabled state by an outside source. The computer properties box for Remote Desktop was also changed&nbsp;with
 an added checkmark from an outside source.&nbsp; Services TCP Ports 65533, 52344, 3246, 2479 are&nbsp;what identifies the ones that are activated&nbsp;by an outside source first.&nbsp;I'm monitoring the other five ports (TCP 9835, 4133, 4109, 4054, and 3617,) to see if they are
 reactivated later.&nbsp; This only occurs when I am connected to the internet and when my firewall is open to allow exceptions.&nbsp; It is disturbing to see that unidentified outside source can change the exceptions for a firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp;My own personal home computer is
 a Dell XPS 600 which contains the original Windows XP Media Center 2005 and service pack 3.&nbsp; Everything is up to date as far as&nbsp;the system and Security&nbsp;using the latest&nbsp;version of Webroot Antivirus and Antispyware.&nbsp; I've downloaded&nbsp;used the Malicious Software
 Removal&nbsp;Tool.&nbsp; I can't find any online information which convinces me that these services ports are for a legitimate purpose and not just some tools used to violate my rights to privacy.<br />
I realize that there are some ligitimate services that are designed to insure the health of an operating system; however, I question the motives of this HelpAssistant user&nbsp;when it duplicates all of my personal files and fills up my hard drive. Any qualified
 help would be appreciated.<br />
Update:&nbsp; It seems as though someone is getting around my firewall event when "Exceptions" have been closed out.&nbsp; The intrusion begins when Services exceptions&nbsp;TCP 65533 and 52334 for Dynamic and/or Private Party&nbsp;and Services TCP 3246 for DVT System Port and
 TCP 2479 Secure Sight Event Logging Server are activated (checked off) from an outside source. Then the user account for "Help Assistant is reactivated" with the Remote Desktop box rechecked by an outside source.&nbsp; I just need to know why Remote Desktop is
 being activated and used by this outside source to collect information from my personal and email files which are configured as being "private".&nbsp; Blocking all exceptions in windows xp firewall seems to have little or no effect on what is happening here.&nbsp; I've
 searched every bit of information on the web to find out what is going on here in an effort to protect the security of my computer and I've found only vague and nonspecific info.<br />
<br />
The number of services TCP ports has increased to about 12 in the Exceptions tab for Windows Firewall.&nbsp; I&nbsp;tried deleting the user account file for HelpAssistant and disabling the user account itself, but when I open the exceptions&nbsp;tab in firewall and uncheck
 all of the Service ports, someone accesses my system and tries to restore all of these undesirable features.&nbsp; My firewall it supposed to block these intrusions and notify me according to.&nbsp; Is there anything that Microsoft can do to stop this from happening.&nbsp;
 I've already deleted the HelpAssistant file&nbsp;twice because it doesn't acknowledge the privacy settings on my&nbsp;personal&nbsp;and email files and because it is too large&nbsp;to exist on my hard drive.&nbsp; I use an external hard drive to store back ups of everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;PLEASE
 HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON HERE!!!!!!!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
More info:&nbsp; This problem began with the new Services TCP ports&nbsp;being added to and opened&nbsp;up on Windows Firewall's Exceptions checklist&nbsp;when windows starts up.<br />
I personally remove these check marks before I connect to the internet so that they cannot be used to reinstall the HelpAssistant virus or trojan.&nbsp; My computer is infected with commands to override and change the system's firewall settings by rechecking services
 exceptions and by adding new services exceptions to the list at start up. If I'm connected to the internet, someone at remote site who is working through these ports reactivates the Help Assistant Account in the Computer Management&nbsp;Local user settings and
 then activates&nbsp;the Remote Desktop funtion without invitation.&nbsp; They keep adding Services ports to my firewall exceptions list trying to bypass my commands for them to stay off of my computer.&nbsp; The infections are directly related to the command-line functions
 infecting my computer at startup.&nbsp; There are several on-line complaints associated with this weakness (HelpAssistant Virus or Trojan) that has been found to be seriously affecting the privacy and security of the Windows XP operating system.&nbsp; I need more information
 from a reliable source on this subject before I start deleting these ports from firewall and deleting the Help assistant user account itself from the Computer Management list of Users.<br />
<br />
Update:&nbsp; I'm stuck with having to unplug from the internet when I restart my computer.&nbsp; Four services TCP ports are automatically rechecked on the firewall exceptions list<br />
when I boot back into windows&nbsp;XP.&nbsp; With the internet connection unplugged the outside source of this problem cannot initiate the reactivation of the&nbsp;HelpAssistant user profile, recheck the box for Remote Desktop, and add its corresponding HELPASSISTANT user
 account file.&nbsp;Out of these four services TCP ports there is one that alternates with&nbsp;four other TCP Ports which have been added to the list and they alternate each time I restart my computer.&nbsp; The Website iana.org identifies them as Unassigned.&nbsp; There is an
 instaneous display on the task bar that appears immediately to the right of the "start" button just before my Antispyware and Antivirus program is activated.&nbsp; As this systems Administrator there is nothing that I can do to remove the malware that was introduced
 to my system on January 27th of this year.&nbsp; I cannot afford to have a professional look at it, so that is why I'm asking for some on line guidence to get rid of this&nbsp;hard drive hogging malware or spyware, whether it is legitimate or not.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP ME TO
 IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND SO I CAN HAVE BETTER CONTROL OVER THE SECURITY OF MY PERSONAL HOME COMPUTER.&nbsp; I do not want some program installed on my computer which alters my firewall settings during restart to allow this intrusion.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to stop uninvited and unsolicited activations of Remote Desktop ( is there a way to stop this unknown outside source from checking this Box in System Properties)?&nbsp; Or am I stuck with having to guess which Services to uncheck and to block each
 time I boot up?&nbsp; Is there a way to stop this outside source from reactivating the HelpAssistant users Account after I've disabled it?<br />
How do I&nbsp;prevent whomever is activating Remote Desktop from downloading the HelpAssistant user file&nbsp;onto my Computer?<br />
If HelpAssistant is truly a&nbsp;legitimate file then why does it&nbsp;copy&nbsp;my private information (checked as private in properties)&nbsp;and make it accessible to other users in its copied files?<br />
Why does HelpAssistant keep&nbsp;a record&nbsp;of my recently opened documents and why aren't they deleted when I empty this file in my user account file?&nbsp;
<br />
There is reason for me to alarmed here because all I can see is that an outside source is keeping&nbsp;a record of all of my private information in its user File (HelpAssistant).&nbsp; Why is this user file almost equal in size to my user file (which takes up&nbsp;too much&nbsp;of
 my hard drive space)? Why does this file contribute so much to the number of files that cannot be defragmented?&nbsp; What Services and Connections&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be permanently blocked and deleted from my list of exceptions in Windows Firewall to prevent this?<br />
<br />
I know that certain Services ports are made active on computer restart by .exe programs for legitimate purposes; however, those services ports that are opened to allow this intrusion need to be close or deleted permanently.&nbsp; The only problem is knowing which
 one is which. I started with nine Services ports (listed as exceptions in Firewall), now there are twelve of them.&nbsp; I do not want this HelpAssistant file on my system.&nbsp; I've never used the Remote Desktop Feature to invite anyone.&nbsp; Remote Assistance is always
 closed.<br />
<br />
In light of the conclusions for the cause of this problem, those very expensive&nbsp;and complex solutions which are being offered to fix&nbsp;it, and the lack of information&nbsp;provided by this forum and&nbsp;other forums; I've decided that the&nbsp;best solution is to back up all
 of&nbsp;my personal documents to an external hard drive and reinstalled my Windows XP operating system on a new hard drive.&nbsp;This time, hopefully, I&nbsp;can use better security precautions which will help me to keep a log of all new files or programs installed on it.&nbsp;
 It will be configured so as not to allow&nbsp;Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance from ever being activated or the HelpAssistant file from ever being downloaded.&nbsp; It will be&nbsp;configured in a way which firewall exceptions settings cannot be altered&nbsp;in any&nbsp;way during
 reboot by and .exe program or an outside source.&nbsp; The Services exceptions for Unassigned ports and the one Suspect system port will be deleted each time they appear or reappear on the list of firewall exceptions.&nbsp; As far as I'm concerned, I regard these situations
 as an uninvited stealthware (neospyware) intrusion and I'm very angry that there is so little information offered to prove to me that it is not a threat.&nbsp; I don't have the finacial resources to spend on this; for now, I'll have to make do with what I have.<br />
<br />
I found out that the Windows XP Firewall Exceptions list has one Services TCP port that is responsible for this intrusion.&nbsp; iana.org identifies it as DVT System Port TCP 3246.&nbsp; I've deleted this port only to have it restored and reactivated by the system when
 restarting my computer.&nbsp; Since, I have deleted the "HelpAssistant" user account folder several times from Documents and Settings; there have been several instances where this folder would be restored when this outside entity enters my system, checks the box
 to activate Remote Desktop, and downloads this file over and over again.&nbsp; I've edited my registry. I've looked at every startup file using WinPatrol. I've scanned for Viruses, Spyware, Windows Malicious Software tool, and Conficker without any detectable or
 verifiable results.&nbsp; I've tried disabling Remote desktop&nbsp;by&nbsp;using&nbsp;gpedit.msc and it still&nbsp;finds different ways to get&nbsp;through&nbsp;my firewall.&nbsp;It even&nbsp;adds exceptions to Firewall&nbsp;for Services and uses these&nbsp;alternate "Unassigned" TCP services ports&nbsp;in a deliberate
 effort to regain access to my system.&nbsp;I need to know what startup programs and what registry files need to be disabled or removed in order to keep this uninvited guest off of my computer and from downloading this blasted oversized and insecure file called
 HelpAssistant. Whomever is responsible for this activity from DVT System Port TCP 3246 needs to understand that this intrusion is not welcomed!!!!!&nbsp;

            You've got a Trojan/keylogger (win32.mebroot.bz), and unfortunately reinstalling Windows won't fix it - it's sunk itself into your master boot record, which is why all the scanner programs can't see it. I just spent last night clearing the same thing off
 of my husband's computer. <br />
<br />
Here's how we fixed it:<br />
<br />
1) Back up all your important document files, just in case. Do not do a system backup - copy folders to an external drive manually. I had no problems at all (nothing got corrupted), but I'm not going to take the fall if something is weird on your system. :P<br />
<br />
2) Boot XP from the CD and enter the Recovery console (push 'R' at the 'welcome to XP' screen)<br />
<br />
3) If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot computer, select the installation that you must access from the Recovery Console. If you only have one option, hit 1.<br />
<br />
4) When you are prompted, type the Administrator password. If the administrator password is blank, just press ENTER.<br />
<br />
5) At the C:\ prompt, type <strong>FIXMBR </strong><br />
<br />
<br />
(Notes from Microsoft resources:<br />
<p><strong>fixmbr</strong> [<em>device_name</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>Parameter</strong></p>
<p><em>device_name</em></p>
<p>The device (drive) on which you want to write a new master boot record. The name can be obtained from the output of the
<strong>map</strong> command. An example of a device name is:</p>
<p><strong>\Device\HardDisk0.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>The following example writes a new master boot record to the device specified:</p>
<p><strong>fixmbr \Device\HardDisk0</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
<p>If you do not specify a <em>device_name</em> , a new master boot record will be written to the boot device, which is the drive on which your primary system is loaded.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
<p>If an invalid or nonstandard partition table signature is detected, you will be prompted whether you want to continue. If you are not having problems accessing your drives, you should not continue. Writing a new master boot record to your system partition
 could damage your partition tables and cause your partitions to become inaccessible.)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
You will get the 'invalid or nonstandard partition table' error message. Hit OK. Again, we had no problems with this, but I have no idea what kind of partitioning you have on your system.
<br />
<br />
6) type EXIT and the computer will reboot. Go into C:\Documents and Settings and delete the HelpAssistant Directory.
<br />
<br />
We ran CCleaner, SpyBot and AVG to clean up afterwards, and so far so good. Wireless is back, computer speed's back up, and the intrusions seem to have stopped.
<br />

            Hello Gecko1534<br />
<br />
I think that you are right on the money about this Trojan/keylogger because of the symptoms I've been getting.&nbsp; One clue is that it overrides my mouse and keyboard when it activates Remote Desktop.&nbsp; I can hear the hardware disconnect alarm when it does.&nbsp; It
 will not function if I delete Services port TCP 3246 and all of these other unassigned TCP ports that it creates and switches with on each reboot.&nbsp; On the Computer Management Console there is a user account listed as "HelpAssistant, Remote Desktop Help Assistant
 Account" and is discribed as "Account For Providing Remote Assistance"; this is the listed user account that it is using to gain access to my system through these Services Ports.&nbsp; If I right click on properties and disable it, the account is reactivated through
 these services ports shortly before it adds the check mark to Remote Desktop to activate it after restarting my computer.&nbsp; It seems to be a combination of start up programs mixed with various registry keys supporting it.<br />
My little 250GB hard drive is five years old and it should be replaced.&nbsp; I have manually moved all of my personal files to an external hard drive.&nbsp; The only things listed on this external hard drive is personal files.&nbsp; All of the microsoft associated files
 have been removed from it as well as the "MY BOOK" backup quick-load features.&nbsp; I have my system set to display hidden file folders so as not to miss deleting those from the external drive&nbsp;as&nbsp;well.&nbsp; Is it possible for Malware to hide itself in combination
 with my personal files, such as in pictures, music files, or documents?&nbsp; If so, how do I find them?&nbsp; Would changing the names of my personal files before loading them onto a new computer help?<br />
It has always been my policy to never use a computer for banking or the storing information directly related to my social security and credit information.&nbsp; The only things that a hacker can use are family photos which identify the names of relatives and pets
 which are often used for identification purposes by banks and website log ins.&nbsp; I'm going to change these names to circumvent that approach.<br />
The "HelpAssistant" folder that I deleted from Documents and Settings contained all of my personal files from the system, including those stored on my external hard drive.&nbsp; What was especially alarming to me was that the personal files copied from the folders
 configured as "Private" from my&nbsp;user account&nbsp;were accessible through the Administrator Account in Safe Mode.&nbsp; While Logged in as Administrator in the Safe Mode I experimented by trying to access the "Private" folders in my account and access was denied.&nbsp; However,
 the same files copied to the "Help Assistant" folder could be viewed by anyone.<br />
For Now, my external drive is disconnected while online and recent documents are purged.&nbsp; All traces of personal documents have been removed from the operating system.<br />
When I buy a new computer,&nbsp;should I&nbsp;close out my current email account name and establish&nbsp;a new one,&nbsp;as well?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank You very much for your input<br />
All information is most seriously appreciated,<br />
Spacejunkie1<br />
<br />
I detected a virus using the Safe Mode after a sequence of restarts.&nbsp; It is identified as Troj/Mbroot-H and it is located in physical drive0 between the cookies scan and the drive analysis.&nbsp; I tried to quarantine and delete this virus using spysweeper without
 success.&nbsp; I ran spysweeper in the safe mode four times and it detected each time.&nbsp; In normal mode, Windows does not see it because the scanning is too fast or there is some way it conceals itself from detection.&nbsp;it appears just after a file called administrator
 at msn 1 txt which is a link to a website and is not a true cookie. The Windows operating system and WinPatrol cannot recognize or detect this txt.&nbsp; This virus appears to be more like a phantom because it passes through any attempts to quarantine it and then
 delete it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I emailed Webroot to see what they think and I'm waiting to see what they have to say about this problem.<br />
<br />
Update:&nbsp; Webroot is having me run a series of tests through email correspondance.&nbsp; The HelpAssistant user account was originally designed for the temporary use of technicians during online Remote Assistance troubleshooting sessions with the primary user present.&nbsp;
 It is not supposed to be opened without the invitation of the computer's primary user during an online session.&nbsp; It is not supposed to operate in the background without the primary user's knowledge.&nbsp; This feature is being exploited by hackers and Microsoft
 needs to generate a series of updates and modifications to end this intrusion.&nbsp; I will not allow this program to exist on my computer if these security flaws cannot be&nbsp;addressed.&nbsp; I've taken&nbsp;steps to identify the&nbsp;eight alternating firewall exceptions ports,
 programs, and files responsible so that they can be shut down or deleted after each computer restart.&nbsp; This is a major breech of computer security that Microsoft needs to acknowledge and remedy.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp;by far the most intrusive malware to ever be introduced
 into the Windows XP operating system.&nbsp;I'm very angry that Microsoft has not explained to me their thoughts and their courses of action in regard to this potential&nbsp;threat to the security and privacy of my computer.

<p>To all those concerned;<br />
<br />
Webroot has confirmed that there is a Master Boot Record (MBR) infection in my Windows XP operating system which allows hackers to&nbsp;abuse the HelpAssistant Remote Desktop features.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the infection cannot be removed&nbsp; from my system without damaging
 access to my operating system because of&nbsp;my custom boot partition.&nbsp; This situation will require the clean reinstallation of my operating system onto a new hard drive.&nbsp; I cannot afford to take my computer to a perfessional technician and it cannot be solved
 by email or phone correspondence because of the nature of the infection. For now, I'm stuck with it as it is until good fortune comes my way in this rough economy. All of my personal&nbsp;documents, photos, and other media have been&nbsp;manually moved to a malware-free
 external hard drive and detached from the system.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I need to know if deleting the HelpAssistant account in the Users section of the Computer Management console will minimize the effects of this intrusion or will it be restored in the same way as the Services ports when the system is restarted. The control Panel
 console for User Accounts does show the HelpAssistant account, so it cannot be modified or deleted from there.&nbsp; The only way to prevent a hacker from activating it and using it for their background mischief&nbsp;may require deleting&nbsp;it from the computer in lieu
 of repairing the MBR.&nbsp; If I can identify the registry keys or files that it uses to activate these Services ports during system restart that may help as well.&nbsp; Any Help or advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />
Spacejunkie1<br />
<br />
Deleting the HelpAssistant User Account from the Computer Management console will stop intrusions if Windows Firewall is reset to its default settings, when&nbsp;the&nbsp;exceptions for&nbsp;Remote Assistance and Remote&nbsp;Desktop are unchecked,&nbsp;and when all Exceptions for Services
 TCP Ports&nbsp;are Deleted after restarting your computer.&nbsp; You must disconnect from the internet before you restart your computer and then delete all of the checked Services port exceptions each time you log on to the system before reconnecting to the internet.&nbsp;
 If you do not delete these services ports, the HelpAssistant account will be reinstalled and activated by the hacker that is using one of these ports.<br />
<br />
All of my questions have been answered and the solution is to use this strategy until I can afford to purchase a new computer.</p>

<p>I have the HelpAssitant problem, too, and I'm able to control it with Spacejunkie's suggestions of deleting the exceptions for Service TCP ports in the firewall and deleting the Help Assistant folder in Documents and Settings. &nbsp; At that point, I can reconnect
 my cable modem and all runs fine until the next boot when deleting the Services exceptions has to be repeated.&nbsp; The Help Assistant folder has not returned after being deleted the first time, but I understand that's because I shut down the Services exceptions
 while disconnected from the Internet.</p>
<p>I'm working on following Gecko's suggestion above about the MBR fix.</p>

<p>I'm confused about your tips about the partition messages.&nbsp; I booted the computer using the win XP CD, hit R, went to C:\ and got this response from the map [arc] command:</p>
<p>?Fat 16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 47 mb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \DEVICE\HARDDISK0\PARTITION1</p>
<p>C:NTFS&nbsp; 233609 MB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \DEVICE\HARDDISK0\PARTITION2</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please be more specific about what you'd do about the fixmbr\device command ?&nbsp; I'd assume it would be the partition2 item, but I'd appreciate knowing more before I mess something up.&nbsp; I am able to use the computer as explained below, but I'd like
 to get rid of this thing.</p>

<p>Hello Myrmyd;</p>
<p>Have you been reading the blogs about this virus in the other forums?&nbsp; It is very confusing to me as well because some people are successful at removing this virus and restoring their systems to normal and others are using the same technics without success.&nbsp;
 Some are losing&nbsp;access to their hard drives by using fixmbr the wrong way or because of the complexity of their boot partition and the progressive changes to files and registy caused by this virus.&nbsp; There's some blogs on the Dell forum's that suggest there
 is a problem using the older Dell&nbsp;OSM&nbsp;Windows XP&nbsp;SP 2&nbsp;disc to repair a partition related to the service pack 3 update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I know is that I can detect the Virus&nbsp;only in the safe mode&nbsp;and it cannot be quarantined&nbsp;after Webroots "Sophos" antivirus engine&nbsp;detects it. It probably replicates itself on each attempt. If you try googling "HelpAssistant" you will see the various
 solutions presented on other forum sites.&nbsp; There is something mentioned about a low-level&nbsp;rewrite of the boot partition of the affected drive or Drive C: windows&nbsp;XP along with using Malwarebytes to&nbsp;identify the infected files and registry for deletion as well
 as removing the virus.</p>
<p>It appears that you have&nbsp;two other&nbsp;devices sharing your partition in addition to Drive C.&nbsp;It is beyond the scope of my knowledge to advise you how to proceed because your confuration may be too complex to risk any changes to remove this virus.&nbsp; I've had
 mine examined by a computer professional and he recommended a total reinstallation of everything.&nbsp;Installing the original XP service pack 2 with a simple single version of the Windows&nbsp;partition (and not the Dell version), with updated drivers and Service pack
 3 on a new hard drive.&nbsp; The virus has changed to many essential windows and internet files and has created too many registry changes to sort through.&nbsp; I know that your situation is different than mine in some ways, because you may have to detach these other
 drives or visa versa and have them checked for viruses before you make any changes.&nbsp; The Drive C: partition 2 is your windows xp drive and is probably the one to select.&nbsp; However, you'll need to get more info on what to do about the other drives before you
 proceed.</p>
<p>All I can tell you is to close your services ports and watch for subtle changes when you go on line because, whoever this hacker is, he has found a way to identify and use other means of getting into the system.&nbsp; I had one instance the other day where the
 hacker was accessing my computer through the IP or Email port.&nbsp; I unplugged from the internet after the hacker had reinstalled the HelpAssistant user account to the Computer Management Console, reactivated Remote Desktop in the System Properties, and downloaded
 part of that oversized HelpAssistant File folder in Documents and Settings.&nbsp; I checked my Windows Firewall Settings and nothing was checked off and all of the services exceptions were still deleted.&nbsp; How did this hacker get past a closed firewall, undetected?
 It seems that this hacker has been able to access our systems and sneak past the ISP's noses undetected with the help of that virus.</p>
<p>I hope that you'll have better success that I've had. Good Luck;</p>

<p>Hey back spacejunkie1,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply at least as a fellow sufferer.&nbsp; I've just been using that infected computer offline as I suspected that it might not be secure even with the steps I was taking on startup.&nbsp; I haven't looked at other forums for a week hoping that new
 fixes would start to show up.&nbsp; As I started looking tonight, I found your reply.</p>
<p>My computer is a Dell, and evidently that's why it has extra partitions.&nbsp; I've considered calling Dell's tech support about the fixmbr command, but I haven't yet as I don't have a lot of confidence that I'd reach a service person that really had experience
 in that area.</p>
<p>I noticed some small&nbsp;missing things&nbsp;in my mirc.ini file.&nbsp; I am getting more memory dump blue screens and lockups even when booting offline and shutting down the services exceptions first thing.&nbsp; I still haven't had the helpassistant folder come back, though.&nbsp;
 I've always been totally opposed to the wipe/reinstall solution, but that might be where I have to go.</p>
<p>I'll keep looking and go read that forum at Dell.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>myr</p>

<p>Hello Myr;</p>
<p>I did get a hit by the HelpAssistant hacker a few hours ago even with all of the Firewall Exceptions turned off.&nbsp; I left the internet plugged in this time when using a website to troubleshoot my sister's car.&nbsp; I went outside to work on the car while the
 system was still on that website.&nbsp; When I returned the HelpAsstant hacker found a way to get in through the internet and add six exceptions to Windows Firewall complete with checkmarks.&nbsp; Four of them were for the services that I had previously deleted, the
 remote desktop was activated in firewall and system properties and the hacker added a management access to the list of exceptions in Windows Firewall.&nbsp; I discovered this just as this hacker was loading the HelpAssistant file folder itself.&nbsp; I immediately deleted
 that blasted folder and the account again and unchecked the remote desktop several times until the hacker gave up rechecking it each time.&nbsp; All of my personal and sensitive info has been removed from the system, so there is nothing of value left for a hacker
 to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been losing some template files associated with Corel Photo Album and others.&nbsp; It appears that this hacker is helping themselves to my templates for picture frames, photo album pages, collages, and other photography related graphics.&nbsp; When I had a
 dual boot system I could replace them easily by copying them from the same program installed on the other operating system.&nbsp; Now, I would have to run a repair from the original source disk which adds some things that I don't need.</p>
<p>I get an occasional blue screen, now and then, that is memory related.&nbsp; It appears that my Dell XPS 600 Motherboard has two failing electrolytic capacitors that are leaking intermittantly through the diaelectric barriers.&nbsp; The capacitors are located on a
 sensitive area of the mobo where the memory modules are located.&nbsp; I do have extensive experience with repairing printed circuit boards, however, because of the strong possiblity of static discharges from&nbsp;tools and heat sources for soldering and from the replacement
 capacitors themselves; that would not be practical.&nbsp; Dell&nbsp;has no technical specs on this propriatary&nbsp;Dell Nvidia SLI Foxconn LS-36 nforce4 mobo and no replacement parts or version for it.&nbsp; I can't afford to replace anything, now.&nbsp; So, I'll have to make do
 with what I have. and try to keep these intrusions to a minimum.&nbsp; Since Dell has not been reliable as for replacing parts during the life of its products; my next computer will be generic or custom built using parts that will be readily available from many
 sources.&nbsp; Dell has not been very helpful in way of do-it-yourself resources that do not cost more than an arm or a leg.</p>
<p>I downloaded the free version of Malwarebytes and found about ninteen infected objects in the registry and other files.&nbsp; All of them proved to be ligitimate hits, so I deleted them.&nbsp; The Troj/MBroot-H cannot be removed using this program.&nbsp; Removing this
 one will require using fixmbr to rewrite the MBR.&nbsp; The red Dell OEM version of Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 (part # YD337) reinstallation DVD, that came with my computer, may not have a compatible version of fxmbr.&nbsp; When my system was changed to the
 dual-boot configuration the mbr was modified to accomodate both the XP and Vista operating systems, so this disk would not be compatible for repairs to the MBR or restoring my system to a single boot configuration.&nbsp; If I had a good mobo, I would have already
 reloaded (clean install) the MBR and&nbsp;the Windows XP operating system in a single drive configuration.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't afford to&nbsp;do that right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you find what you're looking for</p>
<p>Best&nbsp;Regards</p>

<p>Hello Waterbender;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has already been determined that the only way to remove this virus is to start all over with clean install of the operating system and MBR.&nbsp; I can't afford to replace my computer or to do any servicing at this time, so I will have to make do with what
 I have.&nbsp; I've been having problems with a failing mobo, so replacement may be my only option. I removed eighteen infected registry files and system files after a scan with Malwarebytes.&nbsp; The boot sector virus can be detected with Webroot's Sophos antivirus
 program, but it cannot be removed because the virus replicates itself each time it is quarantined.&nbsp; The best I can do for now is to find ways to render the virus ineffective by deleting the HelpAssistant Account and Files and Restoring Windows XP Firewall
 to its default settings after each restart while off-line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm currently&nbsp;trying to identify the files or registry that the virus&nbsp;uses to configure the system to add four or five active items to the Firewall Exceptions list after each system restart. If I can delete, override, or disable them then that would render
 the virus ineffective. By doing this I can regain full control over Windows XP Firewall which is the way the system was originally designed to work.&nbsp; I can't tolerate the idea of having an outside source having this kind of control over my computer where they
 can add TCP or UDP ports to Windows Firewall at will and without my knowledge and consent.&nbsp; I have seen the solutions offered from the website you've suggested&nbsp;and others. The technicians I've consulted with advise a complete clean reinstall of everything.&nbsp;
 I would appreciate any help you can offer in regaining full control over my Windows XP Firewall.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,<br />

Yes but if you have a rogue or phony antivirus its name was shown as well probably trying to get you<br />
to buy the bogus program. We need to know its name.</p>

any advice is welcome.<br />
AND on the MUSIC files deletion thing- appears only full albums&nbsp; or CD's were hit, none of y youtube songs were hit, weird..

<p>To install an upgrade version of Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did Windows XP/Vista/7 which upgraded from come preloaded with your computer? If so, changing the motherboard will invalidate the Windows XP/Vista/7 license which means your Windows 8 Pro upgrade will no longer have a qualifying license when you install
 the new motherboard.</p>
<p>This means, you would need to invest in a full version Windows 8 license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try the following work around:</p>

    <title>DVD DRIVE reads only CDs. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DVD DRIVE reads only CDs.</h2>
                    <p>hello experts</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I bought the ASUS DRW-24D5MT model optical drive from a local store on 23-09-2016 and recently I am facing problem with the optical drive. At first when I ran the DVD in the said drive it would start and then there is some spark
 kinda sound and it ejects the tray with a message"please insert disk in drive F". I thought the DVD disc might be spoiled and tried another DVD disc&nbsp; but with same result. Next day before going to local store i checked the DVD disc with a local internet cafe(running
 windows7) and the disc was running as it should. i went to the local store and told him about the problem and I insisted him to connect it to his pc and confirm it that the drive is spoiled. The store owner runs windows7 on his system and he plugged in the
 drive and inserted the DVD. i was surprised the DVD drive was playing fine and he said that its working and there is no way you can ask for replacement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The problem is the same DVD drive doesn't play DVD discs in my windows 10 64 bit system and today i learn that it can play CDs flawlessly. even in properties window of the dvd drive it says type: cd drive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">please help me to resolve the issue</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">thank you in advance</p>

            <p>Inability to read DVD media may mean physical damage of the drive. DVD drives have two lasers, one for CD media and other for DVD. So the DVD laser may burn out. Try to replace the drive or borrow a removable USB drive.</p>

            Hi User359, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting.
<br /> 
<br />See if this helps :
<br />
<br />Right Click the Taskbar - then uncheck "Cascade Windows".
<br />
<br />If that is not the problem is it cascading within a program?
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

<p>Having finished the games multiple endings, doing the Hardcore run,&nbsp;and completing the DLC's, I deleted a lot of stuff, to clear some space!!!! big mistake, got rid of stuff I should have kept, now only have 2 games that go back to level 40 after DM, so,
 having finished OWB for the 2nd time, I deciced to start from scratch!!!!!, when building this general build character, I was able to pick, Good natured and Skilled as my 2 Traits,&nbsp; and I have chosen to collect the skill books and store them until I have them
 all,&nbsp; At present I have just got to Novac level 8, I am just wondering has anyone else thought about starting over,</p>

<p>That's just what I've done twice. I'm on my 3rd play now and wondering if I should just do #4. I still have to get OWB first though. I'm holding out on the House always wins adventure because quite frankly, I think he's a crazed maniac. Who would want to

            Thank you for your response.&nbsp; The issue is not confined to a specific program.&nbsp; Everytime I want to uninstall a program, I get the same response about a program not yet finished loading.&nbsp; The solution and link that you provided helped me in uninstalling
 the programs that I wanted to uninstall, but it did not solve the core problem that everytime I try to uninstall a program I get the same answer.&nbsp; And I am curious as to what the program is that is supposedly not completed loading.<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            BSOD windbg says Probably caused by &#58; ntkrpamp.exe &#40; nt&#33;Kei386EoiHelper&#43;17d4 &#41;</h2>
                    Hi I've been getting 0x7F 0x8 blue screens since yesterday and I ran memtest and the ram was ok so I downloaded windbg and ran the dmp file which gave me "Probably caused by : ntkrpamp.exe ( nt!Kei386EoiHelper+17d4 )" I can upload the dmp file since I
 dont know how to use windbg that well.

    <title>Wifi limited&#47;disconnected when Bluetooth is enabled on Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roneymichael  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi limited&#47;disconnected when Bluetooth is enabled on Win10</h2>
                    <p>My Bluetooth connection seems to be interfering with my Wifi connection. The interference persists even if no Bluetooth devices are connected to my system. I'm working on Win10, updated from Win7 a few days ago. I did not have this issue before the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both Bluetooth and Wifi are off</li><li>Switch on Wifi</li><li>Connected to Wifi with full Internet connectivity</li><li>Switch on Bluetooth</li><li>Wifi connection changes to limited connectivity (no Internet) or disconnects</li><li>Disable and re-enable Wifi adapter; alternatively, restart system.</li><li>Connected to Wifi with full Internet connectivity immediately after reconnect</li><li>Wifi connection changes to limited connectivity (no Internet) or disconnects, after a short while (&lt;1m)</li><li>Disable Bluetooth</li><li>Disable and enable Wifi adapter; alternatively, restart system</li><li>Connected to Wifi with full Internet connectivity (same as step 3)</li></ol>
<p>Is anyone else facing the same issue. If yes, is there anything I could do to fix it? My drivers are all up-to-date and I'm working with an&nbsp;Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2230 adapter on&nbsp;Windows 10 Home 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp;As suggested by&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/dc0451bf-9db2-4956-b3c1-7c7d8caecadb" title="Bendito999">Bendito999</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_web/unable-to-connect-to-wi-fi-using-intel-centrino/e424a5f1-d92b-43a7-a7b2-f244da168481">here</a>,
 changing the advanced power settings of my Wireless adapter to "Maximum Performance" seems to circumvent the issue. This is however not a hard solution and only serves to work around the problem.</p>

            <p>That was the first thing I'd tried; it only causes my adapter to get reset, which fixes the issue for less than a minute before the Wifi fails again. Basic troubleshooting has already been done.</p>

<h2>            Speech to Text</h2>
                    <p>Cortana on Windows 10 can utilize the onboard microphone to recognize speech and convert to text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that I must have an external microphone to set-up and utilize the speech recognition (Control Panel --&gt; Ease of Access--&gt; Speech Recognition).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there not a method to set up speech recognition for the onboard microphone? If there is, I would like a tutorial please! If not...why not? if Cortana can do it, why not utilize this in other applications?</p>
<p>
