<h2>            Missing sign in button using Microsoft Edge &#47; Office 365 OWA</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Anyone having problems logging into Office 365 web app with Microsoft Edge and Windows 10 Build 10240? Missing sign-in button, only a cancel button shown.<br />
<br />
Go to Office 365 portal under Microsoft Edge, enter office 365 login details. Asks you whether it is a Work/School account or personal? Select Work account, type in login details, no Sign-in button shown.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Lyj</p>

<p>Can you open up Word and does it shows signed in or can you sign in there? Or try the Manage Account button there.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I can sign-in first time no problem with Chrome or Opera or IE11. Outlook.com works fine with Microsoft Edge. Word manage account or switch account works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use Microsoft Edge to go to Outlook.Office365.com, I get the initial sign-in page. I sign-in and then it asks me to select Work/school account or Personal account. I select Work/School Account and that is when I get the CANCEL only button.<br />
<br />
What I have found is, at this stage I&nbsp;can press the Enter key on the keyboard and it will log me in OK.&nbsp;When I sign-out and then go back to Outlook.Office365.com without shutting down the&nbsp;browser window it will log me straight into&nbsp;OWA with the first initial
 signin. If I close the browser window I get the same problem as above.</p>
<p>

                    <div>I have a button on Sheet1 that executes a macro. &nbsp;After a user has started the macro, I need to prevent him/her from clicking on any other sheet in the active workbook, or clicking on any other open workbook in Windowsâ€™ Taskbar while the macro is running.<br />
<br />
Can someone kindly advise me on how to go about doing this?<br />

I don't understand why the macro runs fine on your machine, but not on mine.</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm afraid I don't understand that either, in fact I'm at a complete loss. I've tested it extensively and even with 2 instances of the Excel application open it works perfectly on my machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll test some more to see if I can make it fail here but as as I said, I'm at a loss as to what to do next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, I think it's because you have the Excel Window maximised when you run the code, Try this instead. In the workbook I gave you this replaces the code in Module1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Your_Code()<br />
Application.WindowState = xlNormal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call Show_Hide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UserForm1.Show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'lots of code written by you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Wait (Now + TimeValue("0:00:10"))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Call Show_Hide<br />
Application.WindowState = xlMaximized<br />
&nbsp;End Sub<br />

Thanks again for your help.</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not something I would do unless there is a very good reason. If you code crashes then you could be left with the application hidden but still open. In fact any abnormal termination of the code could give errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How you implement this in your code is something that will need working out but this is how you can do it in a test workbook and I suggest you do that first. Create a new workbook and in VB editor create a userform. There's no need for any controls on the
 userform because this utilises the 'Click' event of the userform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click this userform, view code and paste all the code below in.</p>
<p>Run the userform.</p>
<p>Click it to make the Application invisible/visible. Note you can still see Excel in the taskbar but the taskbar icon does nothing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private AppLeft As Long<br />
Private AppTop As Long<br />
Private WState As Long</p>
<p>Private Sub UserForm_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If (Application.Left + Application.Width) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AppLeft = Application.Left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AppTop = Application.Top<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Left = -(Application.Left + Application.Width)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Top = -(Application.Top + Application.Height)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Left = AppLeft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Top = AppTop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WState = Application.WindowState<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.WindowState = xlNormal<br />
End Sub<br />
Private Sub UserForm_Terminate()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.WindowState = WState<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT.... Here's how it can be implemented in a more user friendly way. Create a module in your workbook and paste this into it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private AppLeft As Long<br />
Private AppTop As Long<br />
Private WState As Long</p>
<p>Sub Show_Hide()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If (Application.Left + Application.Width) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AppLeft = Application.Left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AppTop = Application.Top<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Left = -(Application.Left + Application.Width)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Top = -(Application.Top + Application.Height)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Left = AppLeft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Top = AppTop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this is your code in another module. The for next loop is simply to provide a delay where you can see the app vanish then re-appear at the end and you would replace this with your code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Your_Code()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WState = Application.WindowState<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call Show_Hide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'lots of code written by you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For x = 1 To 100000000: Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Call Show_Hide<br />
&nbsp;Application.WindowState = WState<br />
End Sub</p>

<h2>            My sons name has started appearing on emails sent from my email account</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have just noticed that emails sent from my email account are now being displayed (in my sent box) as my sons name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having checked several other sent emails (from my account)... via display details option... it appears the sent name has normally been:
</p>
<p>a) my Christian name</p>
<p>b) my full name</p>
<p>b) *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>c) "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last 2 email I have sent however are from &nbsp;my sons full name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not made any changes to any email settings ever, thus unsure why my sent email is now showing my sons full name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system has recently updated itself, being the only thing that could have changed something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hotmail address is set as recovery address for my sons gmail account, being the only link I am aware of between the two accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help uncomplicated this for me, I have read about similar, but not exactly the same problems..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi! Are you using the official Windows 10 Mobile upgrade which can be download through the Upgrade Advisor app? Does the message show up when accessing a specific website, or with all sites? Some sites have ads embedded on them which will ask you to install
 something, etc. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that the app or program is already installed on your phone. It's best to ignore these ads to avoid any unauthorized downloads on your phone. BTW, are you using MS Edge or a 3rd party browser app?</p>
<p>

            The problem is the Store, not the update.&nbsp; Check the version against the Store on another device and you may find that the problematical Store has not been upgraded for a while.&nbsp; I have two like that.&nbsp; The giveaway is where the profile is in the upper
 right and the kind of "hamburger" menu it has.&nbsp; I haven't looked at it yet, but I suspect it will a require a repair to the Store.&nbsp; I have never done that so please post back with instructions if you know how or figure it out before I do.&nbsp; I will do the same.

</p><p>I am also having this same issue. Currently using Outlook 2016 16.10, uninstalled Outlook completely and rebuilt the profile and the issue occurs after the profile is built. The computer has 400GB free on the hard drive so it appears to be an issue with
 the space that is allocated to Outlook 2016?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this issue since Outlook 2016 15.32 but it works fine with Outlook 2011 but it no longer receives security updates.<br />

hi can you say what web page does this? and did you ran some test for the web page? why you need to do that you ask, it is because many web site have error and are not up to date with the latest web standard. in some case they are not even ready for i.e.8.
 so often it is not the browser at all but the web page that you visit that is problematic. you can run some test with the f12 tools or use the free Microsoft web tool for test compatibility: you copy the url of the web page that you have problem with&nbsp; and
 paste it on that site next to scan&nbsp; and press scan. it will tell you if they find some problem.&nbsp; right now what Microsoft need to find out is how to make those web site solve their problem, and also make i.e.11 work with problematic web site. for temporary
 solution you can run i.e11 in emulation mode to i.e.9 it use older web standard probably like chrome so that you do not have those error showing up. so basically you are using a downgrade version of browser to read a down graded web site, that is not up to
 date, with the latest standard.

hi I have no add on and enhanced protection mode is not on it was close with the new up date to 11.0.1 so that is not the problem. problem is web site related. before the update to version 11.0.1;&nbsp;I have talk with 2 Microsoft tech a level 1 and a level 2 and
 the problem is not on the pc they encounter the same error when accessing those web site. problem are the web site that have error and are not up to date. best know temporary solution&nbsp; press f12 and emulate i.e.9 on those problematic web site.

<p><br />
some site not only are they not up to date with new standard, but have many error on them can you find a way to be compatible with all the error that have been made? that is probably the problem that Microsoft i.e. 11 it devs&nbsp; are facing. you can always use
 emulation mode to go back from i.e.11 to i.e.6 sometime it will solve some error sometime not. yes there is a compatibility tool where you can put some web site. but it does not correct the error on the web site. basically when&nbsp; you use emulation it is for
 making the web site think that you are another browser so that the web site see you as another browser and give you the line and the feature for that browser. since some web site does not use the best practice.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the simple fact is that some web site owner and&nbsp;it devs&nbsp;think that it is not important to correct web site error and update the web site to the latest standard. they say it is working and we do not want to put resource on this. in the next year they should
 start to change their mentality. since many people will buy new system that use the latest standard. since windows xp support and update ends in April 2014.

well I have no add-ons enabled and it works fine. I have just tested it. with i.e.11.0.1, add-ons are not needed with i.e.11 some are all ready included in i.e.11. the add-ons you can use with older service or service that require those add-ons to work. what
 is your os? 7 or 8 or 8.1? why I am asking it is because 8 and 8.1 as soon as you put your info to start your brand new pc it connect to your Microsoft outlook account.&nbsp; in windows 7 you probably have to do some manual setting. also if you have more then one
 email account linked to your outlook&nbsp;program and that&nbsp; email use push to sync sometime it can conflict. example: mail from apple icloud. since outlook use a complete sync and not a push sync.

<p>Microsoft need to produce a useable IE. Workarounds are not acceptable, the program should function without these problems!!!</p>

</p><p>I agree IE 11 is stupidly slow although I don't have any problems with Chrome, Mozilla or even Safari. They ALL load faster than IE 11.&nbsp; All those browsers load up in a second or two, IE 11 take 20-30 seconds for it to finally appear.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the IE browser is open is seems to work all right but who the&nbsp;heck cares if it takes that long to start?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed all the 'advice' described here and it has done nothing. Here's the real solution - Microsoft need to fire the IE team and hire a new one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    <p>I have created a form for people to fill out daily.&nbsp; I am trying to get them to use "Save As" to keep the original blank, but that doesn't always work.&nbsp; Is there anyway I can get the "Save" button, Ctrl+S, etc. to take them directly to the "Save As" screen?&nbsp;
 If not, is there a way I can get it to give me back an error and not allow the "Save" feature without effecting "Save As."&nbsp; We run Office 2013 and 2010, not sure if that makes a huge difference.&nbsp; Also, I have tried using Macros, but haven't quite figured it

 That new document would not overwrite your template when saved.</p>

<h3> estelle1958  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change table cell margins in Word 365</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Word 365. In the past, I was able to do precise formatting of table cells by choosing align right, then unchecking "Same as whole table" in Table Properties-Cell, and changing the number for the right margin. Ever since I upgraded
 to 365 that hasn't worked. I try over and over to change the right margin, but it never takes. Has anyone else run into this?

Skype 7.56, macOS 10.12.5.<br />
Steps:<br />
called one person.<br />
Using + at bottom of call, added second person.<br />
Added additional people the same way.<br />
I wanted to remove some people from the call after they completed their part of the conversation.</p>
<p>Select their icon at the bottom of the call and right clicked but found "Remove From Group" was greyed out on several of the group members.</p>

</p><p>Are you trying to&nbsp;remove a person while on an active call? If you are,&nbsp;it&nbsp;cannot be done. We cannot remove&nbsp;a participant while on an active call. You can only remove a participant of the&nbsp;group once the call has&nbsp;already been ended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are trying to remove&nbsp;members of the&nbsp;group&nbsp;and&nbsp;is not on an active call, but&nbsp;still cannot remove them, I suggest&nbsp;trying the&nbsp;troubleshooting steps below:</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure Skype is no longer open. Quit Skype, then in the menu bar click Go &gt; Go to folder.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ~/Library/Application Support/Skype/ into the box and click Go.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drag the file called shared.xml to the trash.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the folder that has your Skype Name, and locate config.xml and drag it to the trash.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Empty the trash and then launch Skype again. </p>

            Ah. &nbsp;I think I see the problem. &nbsp;The web apps only allow you to add stuff into placeholders on the slide. &nbsp;Try this:
<div><br />
<div>Add a new slide; make it one of the slides that includes a content placeholder.</div>
<div>Once you've added the slide, you should be able to insert pictures, clip art, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or at least that's how it works here ... there may be limitations on the iPad because it doesn't have the kind of filing system that would allow the browser to locate and upload image files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perhaps there's a way to insert images that you've already uploaded to SkyDrive, but if so I haven't tumbled to it yet. &nbsp; Anyone?</div>

    <title>Line Spacing &#40;Double Spacing&#41; Japanese Text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Line Spacing &#40;Double Spacing&#41; Japanese Text</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing a strange issue in which my document, which is primarily in Japanese, does not seem to respond to line-spacing settings. Whether I set it to single, 1.5, or double spaced, nothing changes, and I only see any difference when I try setting
 it to 2.5 or triple spaced. I also tried highlighting the whole document and changing things in the "Paragraph" dialogue box under spacing, but nothing seemed to stick (i.e. I would change something in there and hit enter but nothing would change in the document).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen a few forum posts about documents with mixed languages having issues, but this seems different. I have a few headings and scattered words in English, but the rest in one language and single vs. double spacing simply doesn't seem to work. How can
 I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screenshot of one of the pages. This is what it looks like regardless of whether I hit 1, 1.15, 1.5, or 2 under Line Spacing.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To further isolate if the issue with the line spacing is due to the specific font that you're using, we'd like to clarify if you've tried using a different font. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you may try uninstalling and reinstalling the Japanese font for us to check if it's the one causing the issue. to do so, you may check this article:

<br />
We'll keep an eye on your response.

 time, please try again later". This is unacceptable! This is the second major problem I have had since Hotmail has changed to Outlook and the major reason I try to avoid Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can put up with the continual page refreshing which occur while I am trying to read/send emails but this is getting a bit ridiculous. Is this going to be fixed tonight or do I need to complete my switch to a different company? I am willing to supply information
 to support, as I did the last time, in order to get this fixed if you would PLEASE look into this matter instead of letting it go on for weeks like the last situation.</p>

<h2>            Set up iCloud alias account in Outlook 365</h2>
                    <p>I have an iCloud account, where I only use the iCloud alias, not the original iCloud account. Is it possible to set up this alias account in Outlook 365, to send and receive emails with the alias rather than the original iCloud account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried setting up the alias using the same process as adding the original iCloud account to Outlook (following the manual IMAP set up process and using the app-specific password from Apple) but it's not working.</p>

<p>Hi JennyTFox72,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in our forum. According to my tests on this problem, it is not feasible to let the calendar owner to get a notification email about what the delegates did on his calendar. However, the calendar owner can view if the
 meeting event has been declined or accepted by clicking the meeting request email.</p>

 I would sugegst to ask them more details about the mail issue you're facing.' all help gratefully recived!!<br />

            <p>Dear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve, Please try changing MX records with Domain Registrar in DNS Control Panel.</p>
<p>
By the end of July 2014, you won't be able to add or remove any account. There are no other quality free email hosting services on the web.
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are looking for low cost email solutions then you can have it from Iwebslog. They are based out of Asia-Pacific and provide both POP3/IMAP access and a secure webmail platform at a lower price than office365 or you can alternatively try the Microsoft
 Exchange Hosted on Iwebslog Servers. </p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3914ea4e-a484-4b23-91c4-1e77f6a94804?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3914ea4e-a484-4b23-91c4-1e77f6a94804?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I'd suggest that you may create two separate drop down lists from your two types of items. To check the detailed steps of creating a drop down list that hide the used items, you may refer to the following link:

<p>
</p><p>I know that &nbsp;by adding my mail id in their safe senders list makes me as a trusted sender.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">But i would like to make my mail id Globally as a trusted sender with that green shield.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>My personal id - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>I want to make it as a trusted sender as default by Outlook.com . Whether it is possible to do that.</p>
<p>I am using my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account from 2011 and i want to make as a trusted sender by default. I had never used my mail as spammer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give me some suggestions to make it possible.</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ac47f055-313f-416d-b37e-cfeebe60e073">HetAlkristal</a>,</p>

<p>Thank you for posting your issue in Microsoft Community. You mentioned that
<em>"But i would like to make my mail id Globally as a trusted sender with that green shield."</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like you want to add the green shield in your mail. For reference, Outlook.com doesn't have the option to add the green shield to any email address. The green shield is system generated only.</p>

    <title>Emails showing up as unread twice - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emails showing up as unread twice</h2>
                    
<p>We have several clients running both Windows Mobile 5 and Windows Mobile 6 all syncing to Exchange 2003 SP2. The client will receive an email via mobile activesync, they'll read the email it will show as read then
 several minutes later the same email will appear as unread again. Has anyone else seen this, suggestions...?</p>

<p>Thank you,<br />

<p>Do the duplicate emails have the same "sent" time and date. If they are different then you may have an email getting CCed or forwarded to itself.</p>

            No, the emails have the same stamp i.e. time and date, also the items are&nbsp;not duplicated in Outlook,
<p>the user will&nbsp;see the email on their phone, read it, two minutes later it will be there again marked us unread. It's not always happening and not with all emails.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br />
