<h2>            Issues with tsstcorp cddvdw su-208bb on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Toshiba Satellite L75D-A7280 with a tsstcorp cddvdw su-208bb CD/DVDRW drive running Windows 8.1.&nbsp; The drive is practically a brand new and has only been used a handful of times, but I noticed the other day that it will not recognize DVD-9's, i.e.
 Dual-layered DVDs.&nbsp; Single layer DVD's and CD's do not seem to have any problems.&nbsp; I have also successfully burned single layer DVD's using this drive.&nbsp; Drivers are up to date, BIOS is up to date.&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drive via the
 Device Manager, still with no luck.&nbsp; Anyone out there with some insight to this issue would be greatly appreciated as I am very frustrated with what appears to be a relatively new product malfunctioning out of the box.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute as to why the audio device on your laptop stopped working after the recent update. This could be caused by the update having missing components or the compatibility of the device drivers need to be verified.
 For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you attempted to download and install the latest available device driver for Windows 10 on the device manufacturer's websites?</li><li>When you reinstalled the device drivers, did you perform the operation when the device was docked or when is was undocked?</li><li>Were there any error messages that showed up when you attempted to use the audio output of the device when it was undocked?</li><li>Which version and build of Windows 10 is installed on your laptop?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has been done on the laptop except the feature update install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Have you attempted to download and install the latest available device driver for Windows 10 on the device manufacturer's websites? Yes. Installs fine. Makes no difference. I also installed the Lenovo hotkey pack again based on search results. No fix. The headphones
 still work but that's no real fix.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
When you reinstalled the device drivers, did you perform the operation when the device was docked or when is was undocked?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Undocked.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Were there any error messages that showed up when you attempted to use the audio output of the device when it was undocked? No. for Windows all works fine except that there is no sound via speakers</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Which version and build of Windows 10 is installed on your laptop?</li></ul>

<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I answered you questions in a previous post, just a few moments ago.&nbsp; A couple of other points.&nbsp; I have figured out that if security software is off I can see the Linux PC then I click on network.&nbsp; However, if I try to open that Linux
 PC my clicking the Icon for it I get an error message below Network Error,&nbsp; when I then click on Diagnose I get the Windows Network Diagnostics message.</p>

<h3> cmbro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to wireless network but can connect with ethernet</h2>
                    
<p>Our network contains 2 computers running WinVista, connected directly via ethernet. Our router includes wireless, and for several months I have had no problem connecting our two Win7 computers to the network. The router is a Linksys WRT160N. This morning
 I am unable to connect to the wireless network using the Win7 computers. I am however still able to connect via the ethernet, WinVista computers.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, nothing has changed with our network (located in a small business, I'm the only one with a basic working knowledge of all things technology related).</p>
<p>I have verified settings, reset the router, updated firmware to latest available version. I'm out of things to try and need suggestions on how to fix this issue.Help??</p>

<p><span>Hi cmbro,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Temporarily</span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>disable
 antivirus software</span></span></a><span> (and any other security software) and
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>firewall</span></span></a><span>
 on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If disabling the antivirus software fixes the issue, you may have to configure the settings of the antivirus program accordingly. Please contact
 the software vendor for further assistance in this regard. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Make sure you enable the antivirus software, other
 security programs, and firewall.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Warning</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus
 software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check for the status of&nbsp;<strong>WLAN AutoConfig</strong> service.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 “Start”, type “services.msc” in the Start search box and hit “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Locate
 “<strong>WLAN AutoConfig</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the service and select “Properties”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check for the “Service status” and “Startup type” information under the “General” tab.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the service is stopped, start the same. Alternatively, you may also right-click the service and click “Restart” to restart the service.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Set the “Startup type” of the service to “Manual” or “Automatic”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and check for the status.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>

<p>Hello, here's my problem. I'm trying to install the software LogMeIn Hamachi on my computer and I get this Windows Installer error :
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>"There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A DLL required for this install to complete could not be run. Contact your support personnel or package vendor."</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have just reinstalled Windows x64 on my laptop and I have installed most of my drivers. I don't understand why Windows isn't giving me the missing DLL name, so now I can't download the file.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Could someone give me a list of the required DLL for Windows Installer ? Or find another solution ?</span></div>

<br />
1. Does the issue occur only with LogMeIn?<br />
2. What is the .dll file that is missing? </span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 1 </b>: Run the Fixit and check whether the issue is resolved.<br />

<p><span><br />
<b>Method 2:</b></span></p>
<p><span>As a work around you may also try to follow the steps provided below, which would help you to unregister and re-register Windows installer.</span></p>
<p><span>a. In the "Start" menu, Type Run in the search bar and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the "Open" box, type <b>"msiexec /unreg",</b> and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>c. In the "Start" menu, Type” Run” in the search bar and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In the "Open" box, type <b>"msiexec /regserver"</b>, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue is specific only to LogMeIn then I suggest you to contact the program manufacturer for assistance.</span></p>

            <p>I am running Win7 (and am perfectly satisfied with it, BTW). I get the "Reserve your copy of Windows 10" pop up nearly
<strong>once an hour</strong>! It is <strong>incredibly annoying</strong>!! If Microsoft keeps up this intrusive pestering I will never "upgrade". Ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't the company design-in a menu right in the notification itself which would allow one to disable this idiotic pest? Or how about a "don't show this again" check box?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand, after all Microsoft has been through, why it continues to treat its customers with such contempt. Have they learned nothing? This company was reviled last decade. It seems to be doing everything it can to keep it that way.</p>

            I had two different files labeled KB3035583 and both were listed as Upgrade for windows 10. I removed both of the files, but the Windows 10 icon is still in my toolbar and it stills pops open at least every other day. If I removed both of the KB3035583
 files why is the Windows 10 icon in my toolbar and why is it still popping up?

            To stop this nagging is simple.&nbsp; Go to the website Ultimate Outsider and down load the small program GWX Control Panel.&nbsp; It is safe and if at a later time you might want windows 10 you can do so.&nbsp; I've use it for about three months and it gets rid of the
 nags.

            Thanks for the suggestion but now I went on this morning and it looks like it tried to install Windows 10 without me wanting it. I pushed decline twice on the prompts and now my computer is saying Restoring your previous version of Windows. For the past
 hour and now I can't do anything.

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death only when streaming video</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>In Windows 7, started getting the dreaded BSOD about 7 months ago. I have done everything from updating drivers to cleaning out the registery to just making sure my machine is in tip top running order, not the least which is ensuring I have enough RAM</div>
<div>I have cleaned out any dust in the CPU (this is a mini desktop connected to my plasma TV), ensured the unit is not overheating, etc. And yet it still crashes. Albeit intermittently, who knows when it will happen again? I can go hours between crashes and
 at other times I will have 3 crashes in 10 minutes!</div>
<div>I have run the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool, all fine. Microsoft Security Essentials is installed, run that all the time. Microsoft Safety Scanner, like clockwork download it every 10 days and run it. I have pretty well done all I think I can.</div>
<div>Now, the message I get is the IRQL one. Every time that is it. And it just dawned on me that I can use my computer with Word, Excel, email, watching any downloaded video, but the crashes ONLY occur with streaming, ie NetFlix, Hulu Plus and YouTube. Does
 that mean anything??</div>
<div>Thanks a ton for any help or suggestions!</div>
                </div>

Thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just ran HitMan Pro, it detected traces of threats, but nothing outright. The rootkits link brings me the 404 error, but will try Steps 1 and 4 when I have some more time.</p>
<p>For number 4, I will ask though.&nbsp; I take it Windows Updates does not catch that? I did run another program that told me I had 16 outdated drivers, but now they are all, supposedly anyway, up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per my original post, the crashes are very irregular. I have noted though something of a patter. After the 3 crash in 10 minutes or 2 in 5 sort of thing, then I go hours without it happening. We are talking watching 3, 4 full length movies in which nothing
 happens. Then maybe during the 5th one, it crashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your suggestions. Much appreciated.</p>

As per experience, I find it best to download Video Card drivers from the manufacturer as far as NVIDIA or AMD only - not for intel. This is because I think drivers thru Windows Update is not really the current and up to date. Microsoft has to patch up first
 updates from Manufacturer before they'll roll it as an update- my opinion only.</p>
<p>Of course, I always make a habit of creating restore point before forcing any update.</p>

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

                    <p>A fonte de meu xbox one esta apresentando problemas, fica piscando intermitentemente com a luz laranja. Ao visitar os tutoriais da microsoft e conversar pelo chat com um técnico, foi constatado que a mesma deve ser trocada. Ai começa meu problema, simplesmente
 não existe fonte nova original para comprar, inacreditável que para um produto com um valor agregado tão grande (tenho dezenas de jogos, assinatura da live e xbox game pass) vocês não possuam um serviço para&nbsp; troca de periféricos defeituosos. O atendente do
 chat me passou uma lista de 'lojas oficias' no entanto encontro dezenas de fontes alternativa e pasmem, não encontro um único anuncio com a fonte original para venda.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gostaria de saber o que devo fazer? Onde posso encontrar uma fonte para comprar, original com nota fiscal, garantia, essas coisas que um cliente deseja.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desde já agradeço se alguém puder me ajudar e externo meu completo descontentamento que algo tão trivial e obvio seja tratado com tanta displicência pela empresa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Edit - Translation] - <span>
The source of my xbox one is having problems, flashes intermittently with orange light.
</span><span>When visiting the tutorials of microsoft and chatting with a technician, it was verified that it should be changed.
</span><span>There
 is no original source to buy, unbelievable that for a product with such great value added (I have dozens of games, live subscription and xbox game pass) you do not have a service to exchange faulty peripherals.
</span></strong><span><strong>The dochat attendant gave me a
 list of 'official stores' however I find dozens of alternative and amazing sources, I do not find a single ad with the original source for sale.</strong><br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>I wonder what I should do?
</span></strong><span><strong>Where can I find a source to buy, original with invoice, warranty, those things that a customer
 wants.</strong><br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Thank you in advance if anyone can help me and external my complete
 discontent that something so trivial and obvious is treated with such carelessness by the company.</span></strong></p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I understand that you are looking for a power supply, brand new, with warranty included. Unfortunately, the original Xbox one power supply (With the big power brick)&nbsp;is no longer being manufactured, nor is it
 able to be repaired/replaced through Microsoft. Through the "official stores" your best bet would be a used power supply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for your understanding.</p>

<p>Olá Potrodomato,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Realmente acho lamentável a empresa não ter a fonte para reposição, mesmo a lei obrigando a empresa a fabricar peças de reposição por 5 anos após a descontinuação de um modelo de produto. Pesquisei no Mercado Livre e consegui encontrar fontes originais para
 o xbox one. Mas antes de comprar uma nova, você já tentou levá-la a uma assistência técnica para ver se há como repará-la?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation - Hello Potrodomato,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I really find it unfortunate that the company does not have the source for replacement, even the law obliging the company to manufacture spare parts for 5 years after the discontinuation of a product model. I googled the free market and managed to
 find original sources for the Xbox One. But before you buy a new one, have you ever tried to get her to a technical assistance to see if there's any way to repair it?]</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>I play no huge RPG games, most are HO's, I've been playing them forever with no issues. I had to send Laptop in for repair and of course, they do no repair, just wipe it So, since then I have had to re-load Windows 10 and have trouble loading my games. Display
 Driver has stopped and has recovered, game shuts down.&nbsp; I have looked every where and tried 2 different walk around's in regedit, nothing works.</p>
<p>I have an Aspire E1-522 with AMD Radeon HD 8240, 512mb GSM, 6gb mem, 500gb HD.&nbsp; I barely have anything on the Laptop space wise. I can get some games to work, most that don't&nbsp;seem to be new downloads. All things are updated, Windows 10 and AMD.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Thanks Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Games seem to be newly loaded games, ones without a game app like Steam, loaded from Windows store. The latest to have issues is from Artifex Mundi. &nbsp;Have played most of their games without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error box shows "Display Driver has stopped and fully recovered". There is more at the bottom of the box but I can't scroll it up to read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try your FIX as soon as I can, Thank you.</p>

            <p>In looking more at my issue with the games, the one's that won't play are all downloaded from Windows store and as I try to play, that "display driver has stopped" shows and now the little wings show up saying "metroapp has crashed, no solution".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now, I'm wondering if it has to do with AMD at all, perhaps it's Windows store on W 10? Have not reinstalled the Graphics driver yet.</p>

            <p>Thank you but drivers are up to date, I went there first. I have actually got things fixed, I think, so far, so good. &nbsp;In looking at other threads I found that the issue was really with Windows Store, did a powershell fix that was suggested, then ran WSReset.exe,
 (I think that was it), and things are running better. As I began to realize the problems only happened with games loaded from the Store and then I had a Critical Error with Cortana and the Start Menu, I looked farther in the Community and found several people
 were having these same issues. &nbsp;These fixes have seemed to work for me. &nbsp;Thank you all.</p>

    <title>NFL video is freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spitfirex007  say:</h3>
<h2>            NFL video is freezing</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I try to watch video using the NFL app, the video keeps freezing and loading every 10 secs or so. I have no problem streaming on any other app. In fact I watched probably 20+ world cup games on the ESPN app without a single issue. Hulu, netfix,
 youtube.. they all work just fine! NFL season starts any second, and I can't stream the damn games to my xbox. (Yes I have Sunday Ticket) That is the biggest reason I even traded in my PS4 for this system. Really getting frustrated. My NAT is moderate but
 I have no problems when playing games online. And the test I ran on xbox all came up has working. I tried resetting my router and that has done nothing. Any suggests?</p>

 only about windows XP, Vista and windows 7.</p>

    <title>EFS&#58; Encrypted folder encrypts only some contained files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> specialsymbol  say:</h3>
<h2>            EFS&#58; Encrypted folder encrypts only some contained files automatically</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
I encrypted my "Downloads"-folder in Windows 7 Professional using EFS. I marked the folder, went to properties, chose encrypt and the option to also encrypt contained files.<br />
<br />
The folder's name colour should have changed to green then, but it didn't. So I opened the folder and voilà: some files have not been encrypted. I marked them manually and encrypted them- then the folder's name turned green.<br />
<br />
However, though the folder is now marked as encrypted, some files are not automatically encrypted when placed in it.<br />
<br />
Obviously this happens mostly to files downloaded from the internet (using Firefox 3.6). A file test.txt created there was instantly automatically encrypted, as were two links I moved from the desktop.<br />
<br />
<br />
So my questions are:<br />
1. Why does EFS act this way?<br />
2. How can I get Windows to enrypt *all* files automatically?<br />
Is this an issue of alternate data streams or the zone identifier?<br />
3. Are alternate data streams encrypted anyway?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!

            This link is pretty old, but I think it may have the right information:<br />
<br />
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457116.aspx<br />
<br />
Read the section "What can be encrypted?"<br />
<br />
It states that folders themselves are not actually encrypted, just marked so <br />
that files created in them, or moved or copied to them "by using My <br />
Computer" are encrypted.<br />
<br />
That phrase may be the clue.<br />
<br />
I don't know the answer with regards to ads--not sure if that is covered in <br />
the reference. I'd originally thought perhaps the zone was the issue, but <br />
now suspect that it is the mechanism by which the file arrives in the folder <br />
that may govern the behavior.<br />
<br />
If your OS crashes in a way requiring a repair install, do you know how to <br />
recover your encryption key?<br />

            Thank you for asking, yes, I know how to recover my encryption key.<br />
<br />
So in the text it says:<br />
"All data streams in the file are copied to a plaintext temporary file in the system’s temporary directory."<br />
<br />
That means, as I see it, that ads are enrypted as well. However, my system should be able to decrypt also the zone identifier anyway, so it wouldn't make sense to leave files unencrypted just to keep the zone identifier "readable".<br />
Since I'm not on my system I'll test that tomorrow (if zone identifiers are affected by encrpytion - I'll simply encrypt a file with zone set to internet and see if it complains when I try to execute it).<br />
<br />
In the meantime- what exactly does "My Computer" mean? If I download files using Firefox I use my computer as well, don't I?

            Things got more complicated. I downloaded a few more files using Firefox, some were automatically encrypted, some were not.<br />
<br />
The zone identifier seems not to be affected by encryption - I tried to execute a downloaded, encrypted file and the warning still pops up.<br />
<br />
The question still is: How can I get Windows to encrypt ALL files put in a marked-for-encryption folder automatically?

<p>To your questions:</p>
<p>1. No. At least not that I'm aware of. I didn't join a group or connect to a domain. Does W7 create a default group/domain and join it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Not really a pattern..</p>

<p>.jpg were automatically encrypted (I downloaded only two, so it's hard to tell if this fits a pattern)</p>
<p>.xpi (add-ons for Thunderbird) : one was automatically encrypted, two more <strong>
not</strong></p>
<p>.pdf : <strong>none</strong> was automatically encrypted (quite some files, different sources)</p>
<p>.zip : <strong>not</strong> encrypted (only one file)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<p>.txt (I created this one and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">didn't download</span> it): this was automatically encrypted at the moment of creation (I did this as a test)</p>

    <title>Halo 4 Title Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cory gross  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo 4 Title Update</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Xbox 360 4GB slim console that I am attempting to play Halo 4 multiplayer on. I was able to play the campaign just fine and I think I remember doing the Title Update then, but after I attempted to install the multiplayer content from the second
 disc (onto a flash drive, because its larger than 4GB), I copied the title update to my flash drive. It got corrupted and I had to download it again. The download failed and since then I have reformatted the flash drive with my Xbox, and I have tried to download
 the title update to both my xbox local hard drive and to my flash drive and have received the following Status Code, the update is not even getting anywhere on the progress bar. I receive the same update everytime and I cannot get past this to play online:</p>

<p>Status Code: 3F4A - 0000 - D080 - 0200 - 8007 - 2746</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi SamSan7,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted system files is one of the possible reasons why the Storage Sense feature is not working on your Windows 10 computers. For us to assist you better, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li><li>Which version and OS build number of Windows 10 is currently installed? To check, press the Windows key, type winver, and press the Enter key.</li><li>Do you have a third-party security software installed?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest that you try to run the System File Checker tool and the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool to scan and correct any issues. System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool in the operating system. SFC checks for system
 file corruption. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a command-line tool that can be used to service a Windows image or to prepare a Windows Preinstallation Environment image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow the steps in this article posted by <strong>ZigZag3143 (MS-MVP) </strong>
to perform SFC and DISM: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your fast reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it's about corrupted system files, we have the issue on all machines and they were installed all in different years/months. My one is the latest installed (1 month ago) and it has the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I haven't made any changes to the system beside them I described above</li><li>I haven't done troubleshooting unless searching for similar problems but the most are a 1-2 years old and with old Windows 10 Builds</li><li>Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.112)</li><li>Yes, we have Kaspersky in use and we cannot deactivate it to test because it would take 1 day at least&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Should Kaspersky causing the issue I will solve the case with a scheduled task and a PowerShell script, just thought I try it with a Windows system tool if it worked.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Two things I will provide.&nbsp; How to get back to 7 from 10, and how to prevent this "conversion" from happening to you again without your really controlling it.</p>
<p>
Re-build Windows 7
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed</strong>, you are unlikely to ever get Windows 7 working again satisfactorily unless you do a complete re-install.&nbsp; The Windows 10 reverting program just does not do the job correctly, and will leave your system
 in a state that you will not find satisfactory.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.&nbsp; This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
Clean Install tip
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong>
</span></em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at that point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<p>Microsoft has turned a decades-long respected process — Windows Update —&nbsp;into a malware distribution system.&nbsp; It is for all intents and purposes forcing innocent and content&nbsp;Windows 7 computer users into “upgrading” to its new Windows 10 version.&nbsp; It promises
 to allow return to Windows 7 within 30 days.&nbsp; That return process is flawed and leaves your computer virtually unusable and requires re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; For some owners without a re-usable Microsoft product key or a factory restore partition on
 their computers, it results in a useless thing that used to be a computer.</p>
<p>Windows 10 is a completely new and very different Windows.&nbsp; Nothing like anything you have used before.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>It is primarily an advertising/sales vehicle.&nbsp; That’s the keen motivation and reason it is free.</li><li>By adopting Windows 10, you sacrifice any privacy — essentially, anything on your computer is Microsoft’s and its partner’s to use as they see fit.</li><li>Windows Update becomes non-optional.&nbsp; You, as owner of your system no longer have control over what happens to your computer.&nbsp; Microsoft will re-make Windows (on your computer) into what serves its purposes without asking your permission or opinion.</li><li>Windows 10 as a system is still full of un-fulfilled promises and bugs.&nbsp; Many of your programs will not run on Windows 10.&nbsp; In fact, the “upgrade” process removes some.</li></ol>
<p>So, if you like Windows 7, and most do very much so, I advise you to reject Windows 10 for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Be advised that Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January, 2020.&nbsp; Most of your current computers will last that
 long.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;advise my clients to&nbsp;change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;on&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015, not a single update that was not security, was something that improved Windows 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some may scoff at this idea.&nbsp; Well they are incorrect.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control and the responsibility
 of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>Some may believe that Microsoft would not do such a stupid thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 files.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer&nbsp;shortly anyway. &nbsp;Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download and run GWX Control panel.&nbsp; A free app:&nbsp; <a href="http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2979572/microsoft-windows/gwx-stopper-an-easy-way-to-permanently-delete-get-windows-10-nagware-in-windows-7-and-81.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2979572/microsoft-windows/gwx-stopper-an-easy-way-to-permanently-delete-get-windows-10-nagware-in-windows-7-and-81.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove any of Microsoft’s installed or attempts to install spyware.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed, enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC.&nbsp; It may take a long time to process this.</li></ol>
<p>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiding accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is more than annoying.&nbsp; It goes way beyond that.&nbsp; It is underhanded, dishonest and just plain wrong for Microsoft to do this.&nbsp; There is no offer to accept or refuse.&nbsp; There is no informed consent.&nbsp; There is not even an idea of what it is&nbsp;your getting
 and what the result is if you change your mind.</p>
