<h2>            How do I create a clean reinstall disc following successful Win7-to-Win10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello smart people,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have twice tried to make a Win10 reinstall disc without success. In both cases, booting to the resulting disc begins a clean install, but then I'm prompted for a Product Key (XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX) which, when I enter my Win7 Product Key, gets
 rejected. It appears that either of the ISO images below assume I'm attempting to install a retail version of Win10 (via a Win10 Product Key) instead of an upgrade version of Win10 (via an existing Win7 Product Key).<br />

We were promised the ability to create a clean reinstall disc, but were never told how to actually accomplish it -- I have searched and searched and ...<br />
<br />
My Question: How do I create a clean reinstall disc following successful Win7-to-Win10 upgrade?<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />

<p>
</p><p>That link takes you to the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; You have to install this and when you run it, it starts by downloading the version of Windows 10 you need, either Home or Pro.&nbsp; It will ask if you want to make a DVD or USB.&nbsp; I did a clean install with this
 on a Windows tablet and it's running well and I like it, with the exception of the Edge browser.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It means, if you want to get it for free, you have to UPGRADE from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1.&nbsp; Your copy of Windows 7/8/8.1 has to be genuine and has to be activated.&nbsp; You cannot create a DVD from the iso and to a clean install.&nbsp; Your FREE Windows 10 has
 to come in through Windows Update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be legal jibberish to you, but it says to me that Microsoft is looking for a way to cut down on pirated copies of the Windows software.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That directly contradicts what Microsoft has written. We supposedly are able to upgrade, and then use the ISO file to make a DVD (or USB stick) and perform a clean install. You are contradicting that.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry, I am not contradicting anything. I said you have to upgrade&nbsp;from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1.&nbsp; You then have to use the media creation tool to download the iso and make the DVD or USB media.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, say I am currently using Windows 7.&nbsp; I want to get Windows 10 for free.&nbsp; I cannot go to the Microsoft&nbsp;website&nbsp;and download the iso and do a clean install when I am running Windows 7.&nbsp; You have to have Windows 10 already on the system&nbsp;before
 you&nbsp;can do a clean install of Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you can do the upgrade with the DVD or USB media, then make sure the OS is activated, then afterwards (wait a day or so), do the clean install.&nbsp; Upgrade first, clean install second.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that is clearer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<p>Well, I did a clean install after the upgrade on one disk, but then I switched to a blank disk to do the clean install. Does that mean I'm in trouble?</p>
<p>
</p><p>...Hey! Wait a minute...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you wrote makes no sense. A clean install is a clean install. "You just can't do it from Windows 7/8/8.1" makes no sense. In a clean install, you don't boot an operating system. You boot an installer in DVD (or USB). What does it matter whether the
 HDD has Windows 7, or Windows 10, or Linux on it, or is blank?</p>

            <p>Brenda, I appreciate help. I really do. As a tribute, I have advice for Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Windows 10 upgrade is important. It needs to be done well for future customer relations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions need to be simple, straight-line steps, without internal branches or decision points. If that means writing 10 sets of instructions (each set for a differing circumstance), then that's what Microsoft needs to do. If the sets have 90-percent
 the same wording, then repeat the wording. DO NOT, repeat: DO NOT combine sets and then attempt to differentiate them in the internal text. Keep the sets separate and repeat 90-percent of the word content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to employ professional writers. Not programmers who think they can write. Not marketing people who think they can write. Writers. Professional writers. Professional writers who know how to write simple, effective, non-ambiguous text; text
 that utilizes a single fact per sentence, and a single idea or concept per paragraph; text that does not ramble from one principle to another inside sentences or between sentences in a paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to test the written procedures using focus groups of ordinary people, not programmers, not supervisors, not customer support people. Focus groups of ordinary people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to listen to people like me. I'm an electronic hardware engineer. My single-board computers went to Iraq and Afghanistan in tanks and aircraft. I've designed wireless access points, chips, video processing boards. I also have produced professional
 programs in 8051 &amp; 8080 &amp; 80286 assembly language, 6800 &amp; 68000 assembly, Nova-4 &amp; PDP-8 assmbly, C, C++, PL/1, Pascal, Snobol, Spitbol, Forth, Java &amp; Javascript, FORTRAN, and probably more that I've forgotten.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft kindly start taking this stuff seriously?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replied to your message in the first place because it didn't seem that you completely understood the information that was given to you by&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/55598f48-7ebb-43fa-bb60-a1ac4ebe63c0" title="SujataMoktan"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">SujataMoktan</span></a>.&nbsp;
 Sometimes, someone else saying or trying to say the same thing helps to get the message across. Everyone who helps in this forum is a volunteer, as am I, just an ordinary person trying to help someone....but this is also how I learn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I did a clean install after the upgrade on one disk, but then I switched to a blank disk to do the clean install.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you see? I don't understand this at all. Do you mean you did a clean install on one computer or one hard drive?&nbsp; You then switched to an empty hard drive or a computer with an empty hard drive and did a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I upgraded from an activated Windows 7, nonetheless, I WAS prompted for a Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Click Do this later</p>
<p>Windows 10 will automatically re-activate within a few days."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do this later? How about Do this never?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long will it be before Windows 10 insists on a Product Key and stops working until it gets one?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ha!&nbsp; Perhaps you are still in shock over getting an operating system for free. You are getting it for free!&nbsp; No one will ask you for a product key because the product key is already built in to Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You didn't understand Mr. De Costa's wiki article, "How to Activate and resolve common Product key issues in Windows 10"?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how frustrating it is with sooooo much information being said in half a dozen different ways, but what I take out of it is this,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a computer with an&nbsp;empty hard drive and you want to install Windows 10, you have to purchase the retail version. You can't get it for free for that computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a computer or tablet with genuine and activated versions of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1, you get Windows 10 for free for the first year, but only as long as you do the upgrade to Windows 10 first.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. De Costa says it this way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>Can I&nbsp;perform a clean install using the Free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>No, it will require that you are running a previous qualifying version and start the upgrade from within the qualifying version."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. De Costa goes on to say,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>Please be aware that you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
cannot</span> use the free upgrade offer to perform a clean install on first attempt. You must first upgrade from the qualifying version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 (whether you do it through
</strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-install-the-latest-windows-10-build-from/21b5cd8a-d96d-4cda-a9aa-7d936a9a0b88"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)"><strong>Windows Update
</strong></span></a><strong>or using the .ISO file)."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had read that you can do the upgrade to Windows 10 using the upgrade option with the .iso file, but I had a hard time trying to find that information again, but Mr. De Costa says it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark, if your clean install is not activating, I would think starting over might be your best option, that is......reinstall the Windows 7 that was originally on the computer.&nbsp; Make sure it is activated and then do the upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Use either
 Windows Update or use the .iso file, but&nbsp;your computer&nbsp;has to be upgraded first.&nbsp; Make sure it activates.&nbsp; If you then like to have&nbsp;a clean install, you can do that.&nbsp; I'm happy with my clean install and with the exception of the Edge browser, I'm liking 10
 very much.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the latest drivers for your laptop touchpad for Windows XP from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you disable the touchpad to verify if it’s creating a conflict with the mouse or if the sensitivity of the touch pad is high.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to temporarily disable the touchpad from Device manager and verify if the mouse works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to access device manager and disable touch pad.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start. </p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Run window and type “devmgmt.msc” and press enter. </p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Mice and pointing device. </p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on Touch pad and Disable it. </p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer and verify if it works fine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incase if you find the mouse is working fine, you need to contact computer manufacturer on this issue to verify if it’s the sensitivity or the drivers causing the issue and get their assistance to fix it.</p>

<h2>            Does &#34;Remove files and clean the drive&#34; option make your PC unusable&#63;</h2>
                    In the past, I have used the "Reset this PC" option because my computer wasn't running well. I have always selected the option "Just remove my files" since I was keeping the PC. However, let's say I wanted to do a "deep-cleaning" of my PC in a sense. If
 I choose the option of removing files and cleaning the drive, will I still be able to use my PC again? The only reason I would doubt it is that it says "Use this if you're recycling the PC".

            Hi Charlie.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes, it's only a deeper clean that still doesn't completely wipe the drive so it isn't by definition a Clean Install.  You will set it up again just like it's a new PC and need to reinstall your personal programs and apps as you would in either case.
<br />
<br />If you want the gold-standard Clean Install follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create the latest Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 black screen, unable to start in Safe Mode</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspirion N5050 laptop. I've had Windows 10 for a couple of months and it's been mostly OK, but this week I was forced to install an update. After resetting the laptop to do that, I get the black screen problem before any option to sign in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told that starting it in safe mode might help. I got on the desktop PC and downloaded the Windows 10 Disk Image ISO file, saved it to a blank DVD, and put it in the laptop, but still get the same black screen. I even hit F12 to tell it to boot from
 the CD/DVD/CR-RW Drive but it didn't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I need to access documents on the laptop ASAP!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately pressing F8 isn't working. When I turn it on, the Dell logo appears, with the options for F2 (setup) or F12 (boot options). After a couple of seconds the screen then goes to the black screen with the flashing white line
 in the top left hand corner. It never gets to the Windows screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can give is appreciated.</p>

    <title>Transfer of space from one drive to another stalls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vagulus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer of space from one drive to another stalls</h2>
                    <p>I have</p>
<p>Intel Core i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20GHz, 8,0GB RAM, Intel HD Graphics<br />
MS Windows 7 Home Premium v. 6.1 64-bit SP1<br />
RealTek High Definintion Audio on Motherboard<br />
I have Kaspersky Internet Security 2014, and I have Google Talk, Skype, and Memeo Backup Premium Pro running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to increase the space available on C;.</p>
<p>My disc is partitioned into CF:, D:, and E:.</p>
<p>I understand that space transfers can only be done between adjacent partitions so I freed 40GB from E: and was going to transfer it to D:.</p>
<p>Eventually that space was to be transferred from D: to C:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am following the instructions at http://www.ehow.com/how_8064718_transfer-space-one-drive-another.html.</p>
<p>I have detached 40GB from E: (it was the same size as D:).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb96bec2-e32d-416f-8d1c-3eb4c4e370de" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to transfer the unallocated space to D: but when I try to do so I find the
<em>"Extend Volume"</em> option is deactivated (greyed out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I proceed?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>In order for space to be transferable to D: it would have to be&nbsp; released from the beginning&nbsp; of E:. Disk Manager only has the ability to release free space at the end of the partition, the dialogue is rather limited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mini Partition Tool from <a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partitionwizard.com/</a> is free for personal use and has&nbsp;a full GUI for the resize tool so allows you to set it to release space at the end you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you will need to rejoin the unallocated space back to E: the run the 3rd party partition tool to re shrink the partition</p>

<p><span>Hi MAWZ,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might have to do with your video driver. It appears that the computer is probably changing back to low resolution settings after sleep
 mode and hence large icons on your desktop. To correct this issue, I would suggest you update the drivers for your video card.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Log on to the computer manufacturer website and
 check for any updated drivers especially the Video drivers. Apart from that if there are any other driver updates you can install them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check if you have the latest Windows Updates
 installed. If not, install them and check. Also, check for any optional updates which might have the related drivers. Refer the below mentioned link.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 stuck in Failure Configuring Windows Updates,Undoing Changes,Don&#39;t Turn Off Your Computer</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I checked for updates and I ticked all the important,recommended and even optional updates and attempted to install them all at once by pressing the install key.It downloaded and started to install.The installation took almost 3 hours and I went to
 do some gaming and surfing and at around almost 80% of the intallation it just stuck there completely solid.I was really mad and I checked the
<strong>update history</strong> and there are some <strong>"Pending for restart"</strong> and some
<strong>"Successful"</strong> and as well as a lot of <strong>"Failed to install".</strong>Initially the system said the total size of updates was around 1558 mb but I looked at my disk space it changed from 448GB to 436GB and so forth and yet half the updates
 weren't even installed yet did the system just lied to me 1558MB when the space it took was almost 20GB? Throughout the installation my computer went to sleep occasionally due to my settings for conserving battery but I<strong> doubt</strong> if this can cause
 delay and corruption in the update.I also have previously installed Office 2007 and it was updating in the process too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then goes on the story,I became impatient and restarted my Laptop and it went into the blue screen Updating.. mode and it is stucks at 54% out of 60 something and I went on to force turn off the laptop.Then I turn on again and it says configuring windows
 update please wait,and then at around 60% of the configuring it fails and went into
<strong>"Failure Configuring Windows Updates,Undoing Changes,Don't Turn Off Your Computer"&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A messed up and long Repunzel-like story but....</p>
<p>I need <strong>help</strong> to tackle this crisis and in terms of my <strong>
concern</strong>: will the reverse in update cause a duplicate in update sizes thus
<strong>eating away</strong> more of my storage space?</p>
<p>So on it just stuck on an infinite boot loop of that and it just stucks right there.<br />
</p>
<p>Seriously a simple task of manual updating and it has to stuck here,stuck there and stuck everywhere? Wasting my whole day away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love to hear some solutions from you all.</p>

            I'm having the same problem. I even rebooted into Safe Mode (that wasn't easy) and queued up chkdsk c: /f to run when I restarted. Then I restarted and it looked like the chkdsk ran. But I'm still getting the same notification.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may have to renew the client DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) lease. The DHCP client
 will attempt to get a new IP address from the DHCP server.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform these procedures, you must be a member of the
<b>Administrators</b> group, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can manually release and renew the IP address of the client by following these steps:</span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Type
<b>ipconfig /renew</b>, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To verify that address conflicts have been resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click

<h2>            Why is Microsoft Help so damn worthless&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After 6 months with a pre installed windows 10 HP ,I haven't been able to fix one single problem based on your help page. I am not a computer wiz so when you tell me to open a powershell and type in a 15 digit code with numbers letters and symbols,I am scared
 to ruin my PC because I don't know what the **** you are talking about. I can't update 21 apps from THE WINDOWS STORE,nor can I download anything else from it. For the sake of anyone else like me ,can you just make simple instructions that will explain what
 is going wrong? I see many other people on the help page that ask questions and repeatedly are unable to fix their problems ,using your information.I am so disappointed in your HELP PAGES, I wish you would realize that when someone needs to know what time
 it is telling them how to build a watch is no help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>THERE, I wrote this whole thing without a cuss word,if you need help understanding this ,look in a mirror and type in a%3## ****(**&amp;.com</p>

            It's best to create your own thread instead of bumping an old thread. In this case, you would want to email&nbsp;xboxambs@microsoft.com&nbsp;for information.

============================================<br />
This works for me with a .wmf file.<br />
<br />
If you open Paint and go to...File / Open...and cannot find <br />
the clipart...try opening the drop window and choose 'All Files".<br />

    <title>SMS Relay -- Can&#39;t Get it to Sync with Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> granitestatecolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            SMS Relay -- Can&#39;t Get it to Sync with Phone</h2>
                    <p>I had been using the SMS Sync relay for months. After Skype app updates I did often have to resync the phone with my various computers, but it always worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, even after uninstalling and reinstalling everywhere, the PCs don't see the phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the phone (Windows 10 Mobile) it shows "Skype is set as the default SMS application" and "SMS backup and sync is currently turned on." All are logged in to the same account and do correctly show all the same Skype text messages, so there is no question
 that they are all connected to the Skype server properly. However, in the Skype app on every Windows 10 PC, it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; SMS sync is enabled (No phone connected)</p>
<p>&nbsp; We were unable to find an SMS Relay enabled phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Check that SMS Relay has been enabled on your phone by</p>
<p>&nbsp; going to Skype &gt; Settings &gt; SMS &gt; SMS backup and sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted above, "SMS backup and sync" is turned and shows as enabled on the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix this so that Skype on the Windows 10 PCs properly see the phone and let me sync them?</p>

            I figured out the problem -- when you turn on "SMS backup and sync" it takes several minutes before it shows as available on PCs. I had assumed it would be instant following my reinstall (which may not even have been needed). By just waiting for a few
 minutes, it became available on all PCs. Entering the sync code did sync them instantly.

                    <p>I have a Windows 8.1Pro PC and I am considering updating to Windows 10Pro</p>
<p>I recently bought a new laptop with Windows 10Home installed, however, I had that upgraded to Windows 10Pro. In order to upgrade it to Windows 10Pro I had to buy the Windows 10Pro disc.</p>
<p>I am wondering - Can I&nbsp;update my Windows 8.1Pro PC to Windows 10Pro using that Windows 10Pro disc, considering my 8.1Pro PC is eligible for the Free Update?</p>
<p>I have very limited quota on my internet connection due to it being a satellite service, besides the speeds being useless to download sizable files.</p>

<p>Call the manufacture and ask tech support for recovery media (explain you problem, as you need to repair Windows and not reinstall it). You other option is if you have friend who has a Windows 7 installation DVD (same bitness as yours).</p>

<p>Hi bluecew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, the game crashes on startup if the computer is not updated. Can you ask your friend if he installed the latest Windows Update on his computer? If not, he can update it first by going to
<em><strong>Settings &gt;&nbsp; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates</strong></em>. Also, ask him to update his computer drivers as well to make sure that they're not affecting the issue. You can give this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> to him on how to update his drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to give us an update after he performed the solutions we provided.</p>

<p>I asked my friend, he says he does not want to update to the latest version of windows 10 (version 1803), he currently has the version before the latest (version 1709). The reason why he does not want to update is because he is scared
 of encountering problems in windows. He is correct and i understand why because i have friends who just updated and encountered multiple problems. I also had problems with the latest version, but managed to fix most of them myself (tech guy). To conclude,
 he doesn't want to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, all his drivers are up to date (used remote control to check it for him), including graphics driver, motherboard drivers, etc.</p>
<p>The problem was&nbsp;<strong>temporarily </strong>fixed by him reinstalling the game. The next day, the game decided to crash on the logo splashscreen again. I am not sure what to do, need help or else im going have to play the game by myself.</p>

<p>I appreciate your reply. We respect his decision for not updating his Windows 10 computer at this time. You can ask him to reset the app by performing the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows key, then select the gear icon to access Settings.</li><li>Select Apps.</li><li>Under Apps &amp; features, locate State of Decay 2.</li><li>Click State of Decay 2, then click Advanced options.</li><li>Click Reset.</li><li>Restart the computer to save the changes.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, let him check if he will able to play the game. If the issue persists, I suggest that he try to perform a clean boot on his computer to eliminate software conflicts. You may give this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> for the steps.</p>

<p>Hello, i am experiencing the same issues as the person above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have so far updated all of my drivers for GPU and updated my Windows to the newest version, i have reinstalled my game, ran a troubleshooting program from Microsoft and also resetted the game several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it is still not working and crashes after the "State of Decay 2" Logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that i am not able to view the content of the State of Decay 2 Game Folder which is very odd for a game these days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to get some help on this issue since i basically couldn't play the game at all yet.</p>

<p>Resetting the game does nothing. It still crashes at the logo.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this game will be ported over to Steam because the Microsoft store always has problems like this.</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue. Just downloaded the new huge State of Decay 2 patch. All Nvidia drivers are updated and windows is all updated. Loads the state of decay 2 logo then just closes without saying anything.</p>

<p>Hi i finally resolve this problem, looks like is a problem with the localization system of the game in the recent patch, try this:</p>
<p>Go to languaje preferences, and change it to English united states, ant the region to the same, if you alread have it, just download and put another english *english from australia for xample, and the region too... download the spanish spain or mexico pack
 too, restart de pc an try to open you game with the new languaje, if it works just take back yor original languaje settings and ready.</p>

<h2>            Birds Of Steel</h2>
                    
<p>Due out next week ( 18th March ) to me this is looking pretty good ( If you like this type of game ) it's getting some high praise from some sites ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong><em>If you've dedicated the past three years to IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey, your next purchase has arrived. Birds of Steel picks up directly where Birds of Prey left off; instantly accessible and yet hugely challenging,
 depending on how you tune it. The environments are huge, the plane list is long plus it looks gorgeous and sounds great. The action is thick and visceral; aerial stoushes can go from tense, one-on-one affairs to grand, epic encounters against swarms of enemy
 fighters and bombers. For three years Gaijin's Birds of Prey remained the best and most nuanced flight game on consoles. Birds of Steel builds on the excellent Birds of Prey and refines Gaijin's formula further. Birds of Steel is an exceedingly confident and
 robust game that will reward fans with its depth and detail. It's easily the best flight game on today's consoles.</em></strong></div>

<p>Cheers for&nbsp;posting&nbsp;this Lofty,&nbsp;<br />
I have always enjoyed flight sims but news of this got passed me. I would rather&nbsp;give this a whirl&nbsp;than Ace Combat which has gone a little downhill judging from the demo of the latest incarnation. And&nbsp;AC seems to be about the only other option on the 360 for
 air combat.<br />
<br />
Aside for Appache Air Assault, but I never did get my&nbsp;fiddly flight control system&nbsp;phd :)..<br />
<br />
The thread acts as a double reminder for me, I wanted Sturmovic but I missed it on release and until reading this forgot it was on my want list. At least it will likely be extremely cheap now so forgetting about it might work out if I can find a copy in my
 local store.<br />
<br />
Do you think there might be a demo released on the marketplace at all for birds of steel?.<br />
<br />
Cheers again.</p>

<p>@ Mr Codger ... I know what you mean, I've got Mass Effect to finish, Skyrim, not even started Assassins Creed or Asura's Wrath yet so I've done the sensible thing and placed an order for Birds Of Steel on Shopto lol ( I just can't resist as I love this
 sort of game )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@ Mr Pilgrim ... I've not seen any word of a demo but I shall keep looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all the years I've been gaming I've loved these type of games but the older I get the more difficult I find having to remember millions of buttons on the more modern games, i.e Apache etc so games set around World War 2 etc I find alot easier to cope
 with :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sturmovic is a fantastic game in my opinion, I've seen it selling new in HMV ( This was a few months back ) for under £10, probably find it cheaper online if you shop about a bit but definately worth picking up if your a fan of this type of game.</p>

<p>Cheers Lofty, a demo would be nice but it doesn't sound entirely necessary if the game is even half as good as it sounds. When I was younger I could play these games on my Amiga and remember all the functions for the keys with no problems.
<br />
<br />
Its not so easy now, the old neurons are starting to grey out a little and I can only fit so many post-it notes&nbsp;around my TV :P.<br />
<br />
Under a tenner is bang on :), next time I'm in town I will have a mooch and see if I can find a copy.There is only GAME and HMV locally so hopefully one of those will still have it in stock.</p>

<p>I couldn't even count how many 'Flight Sims' I had for the Amiga and PC, like you though if I tried to play them now, well let's just say there's not enough post-it notes in my house ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sure it has it's flaws according to the reviews I've read but once again they said this is 'The Best Game Of It's Type On a Console'! I was also looking Achievement.org and according to the Achievement list it has some form of co-op modes included which
 is always a bonus for me.</p>

<p>The only flying game like this iv invested alot of time in was called Flying Corps, remember grabbing it in a triple pack with Carmageddon and Total Annhililation. Was a quality little flying sim type thing. Had a skim over the IGN review and the mission
 editor and co-op make it sound quality!</p>
