    <title>Multiple keys getting registered via single touch on type cover - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> siddharthmallya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple keys getting registered via single touch on type cover</h2>
                    <p>Howdy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title suggests, my type cover for Surface registers double keys from single touches - like c will be cv, v will be cv too. Same with 2 and 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its incredibly exasperating. What should I do? The keyboard is shiny clean, so I dont think this is a dust issue. The adjacent keys aren't getting pressed together as in Chiclet keyboards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>S</p>

            <p>1. No, i have been having this problem for about 3-4 months now. I tried finding solutions for it on my own,but came out empty. Thats why i decided to post here as a Hail Mary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The driver is updated, the keyboard has been detached and re-attached multiple times, cleaned the surface fo dust particles and oil. So all software, hardware and physical troubleshooting has been carried out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Have you tried visiting the manufacturer's website? NVidia has made Windows 10 drivers available months ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Updating your BIOS may also help with this, same -&gt; manufacturer's website</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Is everything fine when you disable/unplug the GTX and boot up using the onboard/integrated graphics?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps,</p>

<h2>            Does Microsoft use Logmein &#40;support.me&#41; legitimately&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I was having trouble activating Windows 7 so I contacted Microsoft Support. The tech could not help me after many steps and attempts to activate. I was later given a case number and my call was transferred to an<i> "advanced support specialist"</i> or something
 of the matter. After a short while I was instructed to visit support.me website and enter a code. After downloading and running the application the tech had access to my computer and even rebooted and kept on going. The tech was on the phone with me most of
 the time, there was just a short span of time where he had me on hold while getting an ID through the phone activation system. He also entered the command prompt and entered many commands like ipconfig etc. I also saw him enter an AppData folder and delete
 and add stuff (not sure what it was). At the end he did activate my Windows online, after having to reissue a new key.<br />
<br />
Now, I was curious and did a search on the logmein site and found horror stories. Also, doesn't Windows 7 have a Remote Assistance program built in, why use support.me (Logmein)?<br />
<br />
I also tried searching if Microsoft legitimately uses this site to provide support but only come up with sites where people were called&nbsp; out of the blue, but in this case I was who called support.<br />
<br />
Also, are there any leftovers from the logmein site that I should remove to prevent future access? I checked my Installed programs and there is none, but since he still have control of my PC after a reboot, I keep wondering if there is something left of the
 program on my PC.<br />

            <p>Its possible the Support Technician used those as his means of connecting to your machine.</p>
<p>Could you provide links and the phone number you used to reach Microsoft Support?</p>
<p>I would highly suggest running a scan of your computer with your antivirus/antimalware software. If you need it, you can also use the Microsoft Safety Scanner, it's free:</p>

I called using the phone number given by the Windows activation program's "activate through phone" option. Since I am activated the option no longer appears. I called the US number, tried activating through the phone, failed and then was transferred to a rep.<br />
<br />
I did not visit any links to reach the support center, it was all through phone.<br />

            <p>Good Afternoon,&nbsp;&nbsp; sorry for the late reply but if it's of any relevance to you still, the answer is yes, Microsoft technical support are using LogMeIn to troubleshoot with customers directly via remote access tool, only this tool is not like malicious RAT,
 it's used only to troubleshoot and the architecture of LMI is made this way that your pc/notebook can only be accessed via LMI using a special 1-time-only, 6 digit code, that the pc owner is inputting, and this code is generated randomly and allow you for
 1 time only access remotely and once the connection is terminated permanently via the LMI tool, it cannot be reinitiated unless the customer goes to
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/help</a> and request a new generated code, and even then, the customer has to re-launch LMI applet again in order for a technician to access his pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also the LMI certificates are updated constantly to provide protection against any emerging or currently known exploits that can be used to gain access to your pc/laptop maliciously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            I also had a situation today where my computer started beeping and a large message popped up that said suspicious activity had been found and to call 888-681-5610.&nbsp; I did so and then was instructed by the person who answered to go to the "run" box and
 type in www.support.me.&nbsp; At this point I told him I was not comfortable doing that and he got real huffy with me and said either that or he could arrange an appointment for me at one of their stores. When I said I didn't think there was a store in my area,
 he hung up on me, which led me to believe this was a scam.&nbsp; Then I also wondered if he could have downloaded something on my computer.&nbsp; Still no clue why my computer was beeping with that message either<br />

</p><p>After cleaning up whatever is found by both scans and reading closely the tutorial from AdwCleaner that precedes its cleanup which will explain how to avoid 90% of infections, check your browser Add-Ons, Extensions and Search Services to disable anything

            Are you in business with Logmein.Inc.?? I had a message on my computer while I was in Facebook to called their number. The tech told me I needed Internet security and that I was in a very ''SERIOUS'' position and that people were trying to get into my
 personal banking accts./emails/ He tried to sell me this protection for $155.00, which I could not afford. Now I am concerned THEY can get into my computer. ARE YOU DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM AND GIVING THEM THE AUTHORITY TO CONTACT MICROSOFT CUSTOMERS WITH
 THIS KIND OF MESSAGE ON MY COMPUTER? I am protected for viruses, which he also said I had, yet my Trend Micro Maximum Security scanned and found NO VIRUS. WHAT IS GOING ON?????

            <p>&nbsp;No, MS will never call you unless you prearranged a time for a phone appointment with someone at MS you contacted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer TeamViewer for unobtrusive and reliable remoting.&nbsp; If I find any others I uninstall them as suspect for spying or causing problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example, yesterday an Upgrade failure case here was failing due to an unsupported Display adapter.&nbsp; When I had them look in Device Manager there was a perfectly good Display device but also a second Display device called "LogMeIn." &nbsp; I'd never heard
 of such a thing and knew it was wrong and probably more trouble caused by remotebloat.&nbsp; Sure enough as soon as I had them uninstall Log Me In their Upgrade proceeded.&nbsp;

<h2>            All defender updates get installed twice</h2>
                    Starting with this update:<br />
<br />
Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.51.937.0)&nbsp; Installation date: ‎2/‎23/‎2009 8:45 PM<br />
<br />
All Windows Defender updates since this one have been installed twice.&nbsp; According to the update history, this did not happen prior to 2/23/2009.<br />
<br />
I have windows update configured to notify me, and I will tell it to install the update, and it reports success.&nbsp; 1 minute later it tells me again that the update is available.&nbsp; I install it a second time and it reports success again.&nbsp; It never wants to install
 more than twice, but it is ALWAYS twice.<br />
<br />
Weird.

    <title>Problems with telyhd - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenyoung31  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with telyhd</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just purchased a telyhd all in one Skype device. I have followed the instruction on setup, connected it to my home network and performed all the updates and setup. When I go to connect to Skype I am faced with nothing but failure. I have always used
 my e-mail address to sign in but the tely doesn't accept any special characters like the @ symbol. So as advised by some technical FAQ I try setting up a new account under my wife's name through the tely device but keep getting errors like (network or connection
 problems) Even though just 20min before the dvice was able to perform firmware and program updates. My network is as it always is, I have no issues with any other devices getting online or using my old Skype of the new profile I created for my wife on other
 devices. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If there is anyone out there that could shed any light on this issue it would be greatly appreciated. I have already tried to contact the manufacture but haven't been able to get in touch with anyone and all the call in numbers listed with the device or
 on their website are no longer in service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>So bad knowing that Microsoft Skype won't work anymore on TelyHD&nbsp; devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How all of us, users of TelyHD with Skype could we continue taking advantage of our devices, besides&nbsp; as an "ornament"&nbsp;above our TV units?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we configure them using one of the SIP-based providers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TelyHD producers has shown so un-professionals not making us aware of this situation, even worst, disabling all of their contact means to provide us any information/support in regards. I've been trying to get some information googling, visiting Tely's Website,
 calling their published phone numbers without any success after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I own two, there are effectively doorstops unless I can find a way to re-purpose the hardware. &nbsp;I am not currently aware of any solutions or workarounds that would allow those devices to work. &nbsp;Supported devices that might work for older people are mobile
 phones or tablets. &nbsp;Some people have posted that they switched to using an Amazon Fire HD device due to affordability.</p>

            The problem with the Tely devices and obtaining alternate firmware they provided for a price, is the fact I recently discovered that company filed for bankruptcy earlier this year with their operations dissolved or in control by another party. &nbsp;This is
 the reason they no longer respond to customers. &nbsp;Unless someone develops a way to flash it with that firmware without Tely's assistance (assuming that SIP firmware is still usable) or develop their own firmware, neither the Tely devices or any other TV devices

Hi, my elderly parents who have a Base edition Tely HD have had it suddenly stop working in the past two days. As they are completely tech illerate this simple easy to use device had been a god send for them to keep in touch from ireland as I am in Australia.
 Would the Tely Pro still work ? Or are there any other simple options to connect to TV for Skype. &nbsp;Thanks&nbsp;

<h2>            Print issues when printing gmail emails</h2>
                    When I go to print an email off of gmail, the print screen only allows me to "Save" or cancel. &nbsp;prior to installing Windows 10 the third option was to "Print" which no longer exists on that screen.

            <p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I appreciate your interest in windows 10 and I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will&nbsp;help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to first&nbsp; save this mail from print&nbsp;screen and then open that&nbsp;mail which ever you are trying print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try to press Ctrl + P key from the keyboard. you will be able to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.<br />
Let us know the status of the issue so that I can assist you better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks.</p>

<h2>            What happens to the Windows 10 license once I sell the device&#63;</h2>
                    So a great deal has been posted about installing Windows 10 and the free upgrade from 8.1 but given the install is likely to be linked to an account what happens once the device is sold and no longer linked to that account i.e. is the installation still
 licensed or does the new owner need to purchase a new license at the prevailing rate?

            It's not linked to an account; it's linked to the hardware.&nbsp; If you currently have an OEM version of Windows (installed by the manufacturer), the license transfers with the machine if it's sold.&nbsp; If it's a retail version that's upgraded to 10, you would
 do well to remove the operating system before selling the computer, thus retaining your license to use the OS.

            <p><strong>Q. What happens to the Windows 10 license once I sell my device?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A. </strong>This is a great question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the deal: Windows 10 will retain the current system's product key; it'll simply be transferred over,&nbsp;'renamed'&nbsp;a Windows 10&nbsp;product key, and saved in the Windows store. Save your product key&nbsp;somewhere now for future reference, as retrieving it later
 is possible, but now is preferable. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Later,&nbsp;if you need to sell the device, you will need to simply&nbsp;de-register the product key from the&nbsp;hardware. Use
 the system using their own product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail copies of Windows 10 will&nbsp;come&nbsp;with their own product keys, so the next owner may purchase their own product key, activate the&nbsp;installation,&nbsp;and you will still have the product key you uninstalled.</p>
<p>

            <p>None of these answers are sufficient, and I have a similar issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Friend's computer crapped out. &nbsp;I barely use my Dell Laptop, so I offered to give it to him. &nbsp;I used Windows 8.1 Pro + Media Center and upgraded to Windows Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove my Microsoft Account from the System, and he registers his Microsoft Account as a Login on the System, what will happen to the Windows OS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Will it stay Windows Pro and allow him to use all features (like being able to Remote into it), or</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Will the license revery to Windows Home because that's what he had on his previous Notebook, and what is registered to his Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't seem like anyone at Microsoft is able to answer these questions in a clear and concise manner. &nbsp;This can affect the resale value of PCs, since a Pro Upgrade is a $99 purchase there is no point in even considering which edition of Windows is installed
 on a PC someone is selling if you're going to be using a Microsoft Account that is either new and has no License Associated with it or was used previously on a PC with Windows Home Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the whole deal about the hardware being registered in Windows Store, but it really isn't clearing up anything because Microsoft has made a big deal about Licensing Keys being stored in your Microsoft Account, among other things. &nbsp;At this point, it
 seems like a Windows License is only as usable as Video Game Downloadable Content. &nbsp;You only get what was registered to your Microsoft Account, not on the actual Hardware and you run the risk of a legit copy of Windows being downgraded to a lesser SKU if you
 log into it even though a valid license key was used to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need someone to give a definitive explanation on how these things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like literally every response on Microsoft Answers is ridiculously convoluted and often responded to by people who don't even understand the question, but simply want to throw their word in with hopes that it'll get marked as an Answer and they'll
 get brownie points for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop polluting the forum with convoluted, borderline worthless responses.</p>

            You could test this out for yourself if no clear answer is forthcoming by creating a new MS account and registering the system with that.If the version changes which I dont think it will,you can always re-log back in on your own account to revert back.<br />
I feel the confusion comes from MS stating the OS is registered to an account which personally I dont think it is, I think its just fingerprinted on their server for registration purposes irrelevant and seperate of the account its associated with.

<b>Prompt</b></em>.</p>
<p>III.- In the list of results, right-click <b>Command Prompt</b>, and then click
<b>Run as Administrator</b>. </p>

<p>The most reliable and quickest way to install Windows 7 SP1 is to install manually</p>

<p>For 64-Bit Windows 7 download: windows6.1-KB976932-X64.exe 903.2MB</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Download, *<b>save</b>*, and install the Service Pack with <u>no</u> security software (antivirus/security suite) installed,
<u>disconnect</u> from Internet, <u>disable</u> the fire-wall &amp; <b>close all non-essential</b> process in the
<span><font color="#000000">task</font></span> manager.</p>
<p>I also recommend taking off USB keys (e.g., flash drives) or any external media as this takes place.
<span><span><font><font>(like USB drives, printers, scanners, etc.) </font></font></span></span></p>
<p>When it is downloaded <b>right-</b>click on the file and select Run As Administrator from the menu.
</p>
<p>(<b>Pl<span>ə</span>ase</b> <b>do not use the computer while the installation is in progress</b>)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>• Your computer will restart several times during the installation process: </p>
<p>Make certain you've saved your work and closed all open applications before beginning the install.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>• The installation process can take an hour or more: If you're installing SP1 on a portable computer, make sure that you plug-in the power cord and have the battery inserted into its bay.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After the final settings have been made following the reboot, I usually perform an
<b>additional reboot</b> to test out the change and to give the PC a fresh start after applying the service pack.

I researched about the different apps and "mobile.HD" was mentioned a lot early on (when Windows 8 was freshly released) but I also noted as time went on, it was mentioned less in positive lights and "PowerDVD" was mentioned more with the caveat that it costs
 more than the others.&nbsp; Of course everyone *really* seems to want VLC, but it has had its delays.&nbsp; :-)<br />

<div>I went to do something with partition magic (it recognized something with the pointers I believe, so I allowed it to automatically fix the error) and now I'm not even able to access Partition Disk #0, Partition #1 which is a drive that I used to store
 data (No OS). &nbsp;It doesn't appear in 'My Computer', but does appear in Disk Management but it doesn't seem like I can do anything with it besides delete the partition. &nbsp;There's a lot of data that I have stored and I don't want to lose it all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I used a partition tool to find out what sectors each of the partitions are starting at and for one of them it's sector 15 and the other it is sector 33. &nbsp;I'm not sure if that has any significance to my problem, but just thought I'd let it be known.</div>

            I solved this problem by going into device manager and uninstalling the usb drivers. Then when I plugged the hard drive back in it reinstalled the driver and worked.

Try using diskpart to assign a drive letter to Disk #0, Partition #1.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start Orb </strong>&gt; type <strong>diskpart</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click
<strong>diskpart</strong> in results above &gt; click <strong>Run as administrator</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Once diskpart loads type
<strong>list volume,</strong> press <strong>enter</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You should notice that you will see your partition that you use for your data, it should not show a drive letter assigned to
 it.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<strong>select volume </strong>6<strong> </strong>(replace 6 with the volume number assigned to the partition in question)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<strong>assign letter </strong>Z (replace Z with the letter that you want to assign to it)</span></p>
<p><span>When you look in Computer, you should be able to see your partition.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps</span></p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I understand your concern, we will try our best to help you.</div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This error message indicates that another computer on the network is using the same IP address that your computer is using. Each computer on a network must have a unique IP address. To fix this problem, run the Network troubleshooter.</p>
<div>&nbsp;<span> </span>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I suggest you to run network troubleshooter to check for any Internet connectivity issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
a. Press the <strong><span>‘Windows + W’ </span></strong>key on the keyboard; this will bring the search interface.<br />
<br />
b. Click ‘<strong><span>Troubleshooting’ </span></strong>in the search result.<br />
<br />
c. Under ‘<strong><span>Troubleshoot computer problem’ </span></strong>click on ‘<strong><span>Network and Internet’</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
d. Click on ‘<strong><span>Network Adapter’ </span></strong>to start the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<div>If the issue occurs even after running the troubleshooter then try the following steps.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;Open<strong> Command Prompt</strong> (Admin)</div>
<div>b. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>
ENTER</strong>:</div>
<div><strong>ipconfig /all </strong>(there is a space between ipconfig and /)<br />
&nbsp;The ipconfig /all command displays Windows TCP/IP settings for all your network adapters.</div>
<div>c. <strong>ipconfig /release </strong>in the command prompt and press ENTER. This releases your current IP address.<br />
&nbsp;d. <strong>ipconfig /renew </strong>in the command prompt and press ENTER.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>The DHCP configuration for all adapters will be renewed. To renew the IP address for a<br />
&nbsp;specific adapter, type the adapter name that appears when you type ipconfig at the command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information helps you. Kindly post back with the updated issue for further assistance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you</span></span></p>

<h2>            Photoshop interface is blurred after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I've spent ages googling this and still not come up with an answer. Can anyone give me some advice as to what I need to do so that the interface looks sharp again? I saw somewhere about upgrading graphic drivers or something, but I have no idea how
 to do this or where from... Many thanks in advance as I need to use photoshop this week for work (I work from home).&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><ul>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to update the latest graphic drivers and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a blurred interface not only in photoshop, but when I experienced Windows pop-ups and in Open Office - I use Thunderbird for my email and that was ok. I'm assuming though that there were probably other programs I have that would also be blurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the driver from&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">NVIDIA is not yet compatible with Windows 10, and even when I ran it in compatibility mode for Windows 8.1, it still came up with an error message saying
 it wasn't possible to update.</span></p>
<p>I was happy with all the other features of Windows 10, but unfortunately am unable to work with a blurred screen especially with photoshop as I use this a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I've reverted back to Windows 8.1. I'm happy to return to Windows 10 as soon as the relevant driver providers have updated their software so they are compatible.</p>
<p>

<h2>            My display looks terrible after upgrade</h2>
                    After upgrading to Windows 10, my display only fills part of the screen and the fonts are blurred and stretched. How do I fix this? It's a brand new monitor and computer that was perfect before.

            <p>I think this is part of a wider problem that MS has yet to address. Like several others, my default resolution for my monitor is no longer available which has resulted in a less-than-sharp display and this despite running SFC and ensuring the manufacturers
 drivers were up to date. But it seems its a WINDOWS issue as the AMD driver will acknowledge my default resolution but Win 10 refuses to act upon it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You have to do only one thing,</p>
<p>UPDATE all your drivers through windows update, especially your graphics driver. It happened to me too and i did that and now its looking awesome........ :-)</p>

            Hi 22Graham22
<br />
<br />If that is a Windows 10 laptop, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Camera 
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your Camera' is turned on and make sure the Skype app is also set to On

            1. Windows Key+i &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera &gt; Make sure that Allow apps to access your Camera is ON 
<br />Also down below Choose apps that can use your camera is ON for Skype 
<br />
<br />2. Turn off your Antivirus for few minutes and then test it as AV can block your camera. Turn on your AV after diagnostics is completed.
<br />
<br />3. To isolate the issue, can you make call using Web Skype (Edge / Chrome browser) to see if issue is with Skype client
<br />
<br />Web Skype - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />4. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype. 
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />

<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a> 
<br />
<br />5. If above doesn't work - Share with me your DirectX Diagnostic report 
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type dxdiag and Enter &gt; Save All information (down button) to a Text file &gt; Upload text file to Onedrive and share the link here

<p>Good thought, thanks for that but the settings are OK, I added a couple of other as to access Skype.</p>
<p>It was working OK but now for some reason it won't see any of the cams.</p>
<p>I can't uninstall the stupid app either, using control panel or the Microsoft store app so it's screwed!</p>

<h2>            gmail in windows live mail stopped working &#40; win 7 Ult&#41;</h2>
                    Hello, I am using windows 7 Ultimate &nbsp;with windows live mail for 3 email accounts. My Gmail account is an IMAP server, and now it stopped accepting my password to sign in. I Have changed the password 3-4 times, and it still will not accept it. However,
 when I go to a web browser, I have no problem signing in to Gmail. Any suggestions? -Bufort

<p>Sure, so the problem isn't the password itself, but something else. Did you&nbsp;'allow less-secure apps ...' like I suggested? &nbsp;</p>
