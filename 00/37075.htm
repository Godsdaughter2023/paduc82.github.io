    <title>Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000 keyboard initial keystroke delay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjdennis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000 keyboard initial keystroke delay</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased a Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000.&nbsp; When I move the mouse, it responds instantly.&nbsp; When I start typing on the keyboard, it takes a couple of seconds before acknowledging that I'm typing so if I am not paying attention I will miss the first
 word or two of the sentence.&nbsp; The keyboard works fine once it "wakes up", but if I stop typing for a few seconds it "falls asleep" again and I get the delay again when I start typing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very annoying and if I don't find a solution here I will have to take it back to where I bought it.</p>
<p>My old wireless keyboard responded instantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why did they make the Surface Book with a 3&#58;2 aspect ratio and put - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdandrews  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why did they make the Surface Book with a 3&#58;2 aspect ratio and put 3000x2000 pixels on a 13&#34; screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm coming from an original Surface Pro that was great for everything... Office, Web Browsing, watching&nbsp;videos, older games, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was really excited about the Surface Book and got one for my birthday. But I'm finding that it's awkward to use with anything other than&nbsp;Office and&nbsp;Web Browsing-type tasks that aren't graphically intensive due to the aspect ratio and resolution. I have
 the model with a GeForce in&nbsp;it, but it doesn't seem suitable for anything that Intel HD graphics couldn't handle.&nbsp;The resolution is very high, and the aspect ratio results in black bars with both 4:3 and 16:9 content/resolutions that most things are designed
 around. While it's a great machine, I have to scale Windows up to 250% in order to see what I'm doing on the screen, which effectively means I'm using it like a 1200x800 display. If I want to actually use the entire 3000x2000 resolution at 100% scaling, I
 have to hold it less than an inch from my face. So... what's the point of having such a high resolution on a 13" screen in the first place, if I'm just going to have to scale everything up so big that the higher resolution does no good? It just introduces
 additional graphics processing overhead that limits what I can do with the graphics hardware because it has to drive a higher resolution than necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also has 16GB of RAM and the fastest SSD I've ever seen. Again, I have no idea what to do with it... just open a few thousand&nbsp;tabs in Edge and Excel, I suppose? I feel like I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;$3000 netbook that's very, very comfortable to use and in no way limited
 from running any productivity application I can imagine, but which has a completely impractical design that wastes most of the potential of the hardware inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I'm probably not the sort of user this is targeted at, but could someone tell me exactly what this is for? People keep saying that 3:2 and the huge resolution on a tiny screen are a selling point, but I'm just wondering what it was intended for.
 I'm personally probably going to end up using it when I don't want to be tempted to use YouTube or play games and need to focus on work, because this computer discourages both activities... and also, the pen is very useful for writing out Mathematical stuff,
 which is one of the few things I still did on paper. Also seems a little better than the Surface Pro's pen, which was already very good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like I must be missing something here, because if it were only good for the uses I'm thinking of, then it should only have 4-8GB&nbsp;of RAM and Intel HD Graphics... what's the point of putting a GeForce and 16GB into a machine like this? All that extra
 power won't put a dent in the 3000x2000 resolution, at least not enough to actually do 3D rendering of any kind. And the only thing I can think of to do with 16GB of RAM that doesn't involve graphical workloads would be running Virtual Machines, but that seems
 like a strange thing to do with a laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I'm not saying that there's no one out there that would use this, but I just want someone to tell me why anyone would want to&nbsp;use all this perfectly good hardware on a screen with a weird aspect ratio and a resolution that taxes the GPU so heavily
 you can't do much other than run 2D desktop apps. In my mind, it's a waste... sure, you can plug in an external monitor, but that sacrifices the portable nature of the machine. Is there a niche out there that likes this resolution and aspect ratio, and if
 so, why do they like wasting large&nbsp;resolutions on small screens&nbsp;and using awkward aspect ratios that no one else likes? What do they do that makes those things an advantage or selling point for them? People keep saying it or hinting at it&nbsp;as if I should just
 know what kind of person cares about those things, but I have no clue. I can't even imagine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't sure whether to post this as a question or a discussion...&nbsp;I went with discussion because I don't actually need help and I'm happy with the device's operation. I'm just inquiring about why it was designed the way it was designed...</p>

            <p>3:2 is a strange aspect ratio, however 3000x2000 is just beautiful. Note that Macbook Retina 13-inch has 2560x1600 native resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with SB is that some applications are not designed to display properly on a scaled resolution. As far as I know, this is Microsoft's first try on a scaled display with super high native resolution. They still have a lot of bugs to fix.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I primarily use my Surface Book for trading using Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation, Microsoft Office 365 and for my photography avocation using Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop CC subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The native aspect ratio for 35 mm photography is 3:2. &nbsp;Being able to see and work with my full frame photos at native 3:2 resolution on my Surface Book 3:2 3000 x 2000 screen is absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the applications I use scale to 3000 x 2000 beautifully. Having the additional real-estate of 3:2 for all my applications is truly liberating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using the 3:2 aspect ratio there is no way I would ever want to go back to the old elongated, squat 16:9 "movie" ratio. &nbsp;Quite frankly, after using 3:2 with my Surface hardware for the past year and a half, 16:9 now looks weird to me.</p>

            <p>Yeah, some applications have issues with Windows scaling anyway. Luckily, I found a registry hack somewhere that lets me set lower 3:2 resolutions. Now I'm using 1200x800... honestly looks about the same to me as 250% scaling, just very&nbsp;slightly blurrier.
 Also seems to improve performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do like the square aspect ratio, but it sacrifices compatibility for aesthetics now that everything is designed around 16:9. That's actually the reason I reluctantly stopped using my old 4:3 monitors a few years ago. Now I feel like I'm back in the same
 boat, tweaking and hacking things to make them work with unusual resolutions, struggling with those nasty black bars that so many applications "thoughtfully" use to maintain the aspect ratio.</p>

            <p>I do like using this thing for Office 365... probably the best machine for it I own. Totally agree on that point.&nbsp;This is the kind of answer I was looking&nbsp;for. Never would have considered stock trading... definitely need more&nbsp;vertical space there.&nbsp;I always
 preferred my old square monitors for stuff other than watching movies, but when so many&nbsp;applications started pushing 16:9, it became really hard to use any other kind of monitor when configuration settings went away and a lot of stuff started going "letterbox
 or nothing." I guess you use stuff that was programmed a little&nbsp;better than what I use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know 3:2 was used in photography. I&nbsp;always thought&nbsp;photography and the film industry liked 16:9 because&nbsp;of widescreen theater-type movies and photographers wanting to&nbsp;take wider shots for&nbsp;landscapes and such.&nbsp;Honestly, 16:9 isn't an&nbsp;aspect ratio&nbsp;I
 would have picked myself... I always liked my old 4:3 monitors, and even that one 5:4 monitor I had that time.

            <p>JDAndrews,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the 35 mm standard aspect ratio has been 3:2 for decades. &nbsp;It's only recently that digital cameras started offering different aspect ratio choices. &nbsp;Many folks choose 16:9 to display photos full screen on their phones and 16:9 ratio TV's. &nbsp;If I choose
 anything other than 3:2 aspect ratio, my camera crops the image to fit and doesn't deliver as high resolution. &nbsp;I only use 3:2 aspect ratio for my photography.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the proliferation of High Resolution monitors in the past few years it is nice to see that most of the better software has been updated to be resolution agnostic and is written to automatically scale to any resolution and aspect ratio. &nbsp;If you run updated,
 quality software it is unnecessary to cripple your Surface Book resolution in order to run it. Absolutely everything I run scales to my incredibly sharp 3000 x 2000 Surface Book screen. &nbsp;I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

            <p>Think of 3:2 as having more pixels at the top and bottom of the screen, where traditional PC laptops have plastic bezels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it has black bars for video playback at 4:3 and 16:9. But video playback is not the only thing that people do with their computers. Having more pixels vertically helps to see more content using Word, Excel, Visual Studio, and many other applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how 13.5", 3.2 screen area compares to a 13.3", 16:10 screen (MacBook Pro):
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://displaywars.com/13,3-inch-16x10-vs-13,5-inch-3x2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://displaywars.com/13,3-inch-16x10-vs-13,5-inch-3x2</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and here is a comparison between 13.5" 3:2 and 13.3" 16:9 (Dell XPS 13):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://displaywars.com/13,3-inch-16x9-vs-13,5-inch-3x2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://displaywars.com/13,3-inch-16x9-vs-13,5-inch-3x2</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, the Surface Book screen is taller than MBP 13 without losing any width, and taller than XPS13, with only a tiny reduction in screen width.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In words of Linus Torvalds:</p>
<p>
</p><p>“I don't understand why people complain about "black bars", when I can't see why it would be any different to have "no pixels at all", which is what the silly widescreen displays do.”</p>

            <p>- Viewing photos which tend to be between 4:3 and 3:2 native proportion is much better.</p>
<p>- Viewing A4 or A3 documents is much better, with the screen being much closer to the A series 1.41:1 ratio than 16:9 is.</p>
<p>- More lines of text are visible with less scrolling required</p>
<p>- Using GPU demanding programmes like Autocad and Photoshop is better, giving a more usable editing space (16:9 requires far too much vertical scrolling).</p>
<p>- using the device in portrait mode feels far more natural than 16:9</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the opposite opinion to the OP. Apart from viewing widescreen movies I can't think of any aspects where a 16:9 screen is better than a 3:2 one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if only the software manufacturers would sort out their dpi scaling and Microsoft would actually make reliable and repairable hardware thar wasn't riddled with glitches and battery failure problems.</p>

            <p>I'm motivated to respond here simply because we live in a world of people who seem to think 16:9 is a suitable screen ratio for computing, so much so that it's become almost impossible to find laptops and displays that aren't 16:9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>16:9 is an absolutely terrible screen ratio for computing.</p>

</p><p>For me, the single most important reason to get a Surface Book is the screen ratio. &nbsp;I made up my mind 5 or 6 years ago to never spend money on a 16:9 laptop, and I have stuck to it. &nbsp;What this means is that after my 2006 laptop died (Toshiba with 16:10
 display) I simply had to live without a laptop for a while, sometimes awkwardly making do with a work-issued 16:9 laptop (insufferable). &nbsp;I eventually bought a MacBook Air with a 16:10 display which is Boot Camped and running Windows. &nbsp;I've never been able
 to buy anything else because all the PC manufacturers switched to 16:9 screens for the sole purpose of saving money. &nbsp;Some people think their screens got wider. &nbsp;What they really got was shorter (vertically). &nbsp;In order to have the same kind of screen real
 estate in a 16:9 lappy that I had on my 15" Toshiba, I would have to buy a 17" or larger (does larger even exist?) laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that are awful to do in 16:9 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming (my job)</li><li>Spreadsheets</li><li>PDFs/DOCs other text documents</li><li>Photo editing</li><li>Video editing</li><li>Audio editing</li><li>Web browsing</li><li>Graphic design</li><li>4:3 videos</li><li>Some games</li></ul>
<p>Things that 16:9 is good for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movies</li><li>Some games</li></ul>
<p>I think these lists make the problem pretty evident. &nbsp;16:9 is not good for using computer software, it's only good for movies. &nbsp;There are much better devices for watching movies than laptops. &nbsp;Obviously, the best is a TV. &nbsp;If you're going mobile, then use
 a tablet. &nbsp;I guess some strange people use their phones, even. &nbsp;So why, then, if 16:9 is not good for computing but is good for entertainment, did virtually all manufacturers change to this ratio on their displays? &nbsp;In other words, why did they make computers
 more geared toward the thing they aren't meant for (entertainment) and less geared toward the thing they are meant for (computing)? &nbsp;The answer is cost. &nbsp;They stripped away a bit of vertical space and made a concession to the Asian companies who cheaply churn
 out LCD displays by getting rid of the variety of ratios that had to be manufactured. &nbsp;They bet on people being not observant enough to care, and to a great extent they won that bet. &nbsp;Thankfully Apple did not capitulate, and now other manufacturers have started
 to realize how terrible their 16:9 laptops are, especially when trying to shrink them ever more to sizes well under 15". &nbsp;I could not commend Microsoft enough on the Surface Book and its decision to go with a work-friendly aspect ratio. &nbsp;Unless other manufacturers
 get their acts together on this, the Surface Book with performance base WILL be my next computer. &nbsp;Just gotta save a little coin!</p>

            See, there's so much discussion about 16:9 being horrible for things - but I actually prefer it.&nbsp; I just see it as basically the same thing - just expanded to show more info on the left and right...&nbsp; I mean 2000 vertical pixels is just that...&nbsp; It doesn't
 matter if it's 3000 wide or 4000 wide...&nbsp; The height doesn't change...&nbsp; Just now there's more room each side for content.&nbsp; Eg. if you do a 'fit to screen' the content will look pretty much the same.&nbsp; And with 16:9 I can have 2 Word documents open side by side
 and cut/paste between w/only switching focus and not needing to move one window "to the back" and out of site...&nbsp; As someone whose job is more around writing documents or comparing/researching, the wide display is so much better than a 3:2 or 4:3 could be
 for me.<br />
<br />
And for people like the people doing photographs/editing - full screen on 16:9 is not ideal for presenting but I would assume using something like photoshop (3:2 or 4:3) where you have tools on the left 'and' the right it's actually a lot easier to work with
 the image as it would fit easier to the top of the monitor and the bottom instead of having the "black bars" on the top and bottom of the image.<br />
<br />
For awhile I had my center 16:9 monitor turned to Portrait mode - so 9:16 I guess.&nbsp; For Word and Excel I now had significantly more vertical information than before and the ribbon/toolbars at the top didn't take up so much of the screen.&nbsp; It was great...&nbsp; Problem
 is that it was a 30" monitor and I kept looking "up" which made my neck sore after long days and switched back after a couple of months.&nbsp; And for cutting/pasting i went away from my side-by-side windows and had to use another monitor because all my main display
 became good for was "one document at a time".<br />
<br />
Anyway - I think there are merits for both but 16:9 is getting too bad of a rap.&nbsp; I think it's more on the application developers (mostly MSFT) to not embrace the wide angle in things outside of Outlook or Powerpoint.&nbsp; If they had a decent ribbon on the left
 that took up an 1/8 of the screen and another on the right for optional info or settings, you would essentially be left with a more traditional window to manipulate your data - whatever it is...

    <title>Windows 7 Windows Explorer&#58; cannot open libraries, search in Start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derphysiker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Windows Explorer&#58; cannot open libraries, search in Start menu, or open certain files&#47;folders</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Windows Explorer on my Windows 7 HP laptop is all of a sudden very screwy. Clicking on any of the Libraries ("Documents," "Music," etc.) on either the left hand side of the screen or within the main part of the window does not open the library as it is supposed
 to, it just expands the sub folders. Clicking on any of the sub folders also amounts to nothing except to expanding further sub folders. Because of this, the only way I am able to access any of my documents, music, etc. is to right click and go down to "Open
 folder location," from where everything pretty much acts as normal.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
The Start menu search function is also not working at all--I can type things in but there is no response whatsoever when I do this.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Also, certain file types do not like to be opened. At first I could hardly open any file types, but one of the many, many things I've tried must have worked--probably the file association fixer I used. The only remaining file type I can never open is PDF (no
 file association fixer for PDF for the two programs I used), so I tried reinstalling Adobe Reader, thinking it might just be a problem with that program, but now I can't get the Adobe Reader .exe file to run! There have also been a couple other applications
 that I've tried to run in this long process and haven't been able to.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
So far, I've run 4+ different antivirus/antimalware software (the leading cause of the problem from what I could tell from online), so I'm hoping the system is clear of all that, but maybe not. I've also cleaned up the registry using the Registry Revival Tool
 (which supposedly fixed almost 1200 errors) and tried a number of other methods I found suggested online for similar but different problems, but to no avail.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Any ideas on what the problem could be and/or how to fix it? If you need any more info, let me know.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Thanks so much!</p>

            <p>If the problem just began recently, you can restore Windows back to an earlier time, called a restore point. This restores backups of your registry and system settings, but doesn’t touch any of your files. It only takes a couple of minutes, and you can undo
 the process or try another date if it doesn’t fix the problem on the first try. When you aren’t sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.&nbsp; This works best if you use it immediately after a problem shows up.&nbsp; Waiting
 more than a week or two means the good backups can be too outdated to use.</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. The installation shouldn't be stopped or interrupted to prevent issues with the game in the future. To install the game faster, we recommend that you perform the following methods on your computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>. <span>Click on this </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link</span></a><span> for the steps to perform a clean boot. This
 process will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>. <span>Remove temporary files.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Temporary files are automatically deleted after exiting an application or a game. However, restarting your computer without exiting an active Windows session won't delete temporary files. These files may cause issues running games on Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Windows key</strong>&nbsp;on your keyboard, and then click the Settings&nbsp;icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Storage</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>This PC</strong>&nbsp;and click on&nbsp;<strong>Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Remove files</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>. Start the computer in normal mode to disable the unnecessary apps running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows + R</strong> on the keyboard.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li><li><span>Type <strong>msconfig</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li><span>On the <strong>General </strong>tab, click the <strong>Normal Startup</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <strong>Restart</strong>. </span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Start the installation again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us updated with the results after performing the suggested methods above.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I hope that some of you are able to help me, because Im stuck in a situation, which is very frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My server setup is:</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows 2008 64 Bit server,</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Via this server Im supposed to connect to several IBM Lotus Notes 8.5 databases, which are placed on other servers.</p>
<p>I'd like to install the latest Lotus Notes ODBC (8.5.1) driver and use this&nbsp;for connecions between the Lotus Notes databases to the SQL Server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I run the installation, I get a dialogbox with information about the installation. It states that this partikular installation has succeded.</p>
<p>My current sequential problem is, that Im not able to see the driver anywhere. (either througt datasources nor c:\windows\syswow64\odbcad32).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

If you have not tried anything then some things you would want to ckeck would be the screen saver settings and power management settings, as both of these determine how the screen will behave once the PC starts to idle.<br />
<br />
To do this:<br />
Right-click on the "Desktop"<br />
Click "Personalize"<br />
Click "Screen Saver" and verify that your "Wait" time is what you expect it to be<br />
After, click "Change power settings"<br />
Choose the selected power plan setting currently in use and click "Change Plan Settings"<br />
Verify that your display wait time till turn-off is what you expect it to be<br />
<br />
Please try these above steps, if this answer resolves your issue mark it as answered, if not then reply back here and we will continue troubleshooting this with you.<br />
regards,<br />

            I've tried everything in the tips section and still no luck.<br />
Even toshiba update dosent work.<br />
But not to worry i'll be upgrading to a MACBOOK as they seem to be a bit more reliable in their OS.<br />
It a shame as i've always been a microsoft user since the at/xt genaration running DOS.<br />
Thanks to everyone that helped.<br />

<p><strong><span><span>Hi Loftyjoyce,</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. Do you remember making any changes on your computer?<br />
‘The requested operation cannot be performed on a file with a user-mapped section open" indicates that the file is in use by other process.<br />
Step 1: <br />
Check in task manager whether there is any process running for the application in question.<br />
a. Right click on the taskbar, select task manager.<br />
b. Check if any process running for the game.<br />
c. If yes, right click on the process and end it.<br />
Step 2: <br />
You may also put the computer in a clean boot state and then check for the issue.<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

<strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.<br />

==============================================<br />
If you open the document in Word and copy/paste the contents into an <br />
image editor...Windows Paint (for example)...you can save it in a&nbsp;picture <br />
format. .jpg or .bmp would be good choices.&nbsp;Then you can import the <br />
picture into Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
If the document is large and complex you probably cannot read it in the <br />
resulting Movie Maker Movie file.

            Hi 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1903, if you can, I recommend you wait a bit until Windows 10 1903 matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />If you must upgrade, here are some things you can do to ensure the upgrade goes smoothly:
<br />
<br />- Ensure you have a minimum 10 to 16 GBs of free space. Its a major requirement in this release:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-free-up-disk-space-in-windows/2458cc31-bd19-482f-ace5-7e3bd9da8098">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />- If you have an SD card reader installed, uninstall it or disable it
<br />- If you have any USB devices attached, disconnect them all except for mouse and keyboard.
<br />
<br />Additional things you can try:
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Have you checked the manufacturers website to determine compatibility?
<br />Check this List to Determine if Your Computer is Compatible with the Windows 10 1903
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />perform the following tasks:
<br />12 Things You Should Do Before Installing Windows 10

<br />
<br />Again, block the upgrade and wait a while if it still fails to install.

<br />
<br />Another way users have been able to successfully install the update is by using the Update Assistant. Go to the following page then click 'Update Now'

<h2>            Controller not working for Fallout 4 in Xbox for Windows </h2>
                    
<p>I have a Windows 10 computer, and I have been trying to use the Xbox streaming app to play Fallout 4.&nbsp; The controller works everywhere, EXCEPT with this game.&nbsp; When Fallout 4 starts, the controller just won't work in-game.&nbsp; It works in other games, it works
 on the Home screen, and I can run through all of the apps on the Xbox.&nbsp; Fallout 4 is the only problem game.</p>

<p>ive had the same problem with other games and it is to do with game streaming. what u have to do is start up the game through your tv first and u will find the controls work normally when the game has loaded and then if u start streaming it will work properly.
 i have found if u start the game while u are streaming the controls dont work.</p>

<h2>            Ancients of Ooga awards</h2>
                    
<p>Recently I unlocked the first award; the Hearler Mask.</p>
<p>I then went to put it on my avatar. As usual with slightly older games, the editor gave me a message to update some clothes. Didn't take long, and continued to the awards section.</p>
<p>The problem is that it's still showing an exclamation mark on the Healers Mask tile. If I quit the editor and come back, it updates again, but doesn't fix the problem. I have deleted the mask from my HDD and went back into the editor. It now shows the correct
 tile and actually displays the mask on my avatar. However, if I then select it to wear, it tells me it's not on my HDD and wants to download. After it's done downloading the ! is back and the item doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem. Has anyone found a fix yet? Is it being worked on by the publisher or MS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI: I've tried clearing my system cache as well. Also deleted the avatar asset update cache to no avail. Recovering my gamertag does not work.</p>

            That is why im trying to figure out black level because when it tells me to turn the brightness all the way up and then turn it down so you dont see the closed eye but you can still see the open eye but when i turn the brightness all the way up the closed
 eye does not show up and i dont know why do you know why?

<p>
</p><p>I am gonna save you heart ache. Do what you feel looks nice. You can spend hours adjusting stuff or you can do what you like</p>
<p>

    <title>windows 10 strange &#34;subtitle&#34; crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefan mijatovic  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 strange &#34;subtitle&#34; crash</h2>
                    <p>ok, so this is by far the strangest thing happened to me on windows, I suspect it could be a virus but so far none of the antivirus/spyware/malware software I tried had any detection ("avira antivir", "spybot s&amp;amp;d" and "microsoft safety scanner").
 however, I still feel it could be a virus:</p>
<p>I had this movie in my downloads folder, nothing unusual, played it and it works. meanwhile, I installed "kmplayer" (God knows why), tried it, didn't like it, uninstalled it. later that day I decided to watch that movie and as always I used "bs
 player" to download subtitles (everything still works). after i closed "bs player", nothing was the same. I couldn't even reach that movie without explorer crashing, no error message. not only that movie, but now downloads folder itself triggers explorer crash
 if I wait a few seconds. some folders and files I could reach if I click fast enough, but others (around the letter "T") cause crash instantly, and I couldn't move them, copy them or delete them. also, when I navigate to "downloads" folder with any other software
 ("chrome", "gom player", "blitzblank"), that software crashes too.</p>
<p>then I used "blitzblank" to delete some of those files and folders, and I also moved one to another location (d:\temp), just to see what would happen. as for the movie, I downloaded it again, this time it was on my desktop. downloads folder still
 crashes, but now it takes a few seconds longer. "d:\temp" folder now also crashes. movie on the desktop works fine, so I tried to download subtitles with "bs player" once again - result was the same, only this time explorer crashes at desktop which created
 crash loop. again, I used "blitzblank" to delete everything that caused crash: "downloads" folder, everything on desktop and "d:\temp" folder.</p>
<p>now this is where it gets kinda funny. I cannot download any subtitle to my pc :) not as .zip, not as .srt, not as .sub etc, because "chrome" or "edge" both crash. however, any other .zip download works fine. also, now any other media folder causes
 explorer to crash (picture folders are fine). someone said it could be thumbnail issue, I turned thumbnails off but the problem is still here. what should I do? one option is a clean win10 installation, but ALL MY WORK is on d:\, as well as my music collection
 and my pictures... please, help.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Stefan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue could cause due to </span><span>any third party software conflicts</span></span><span>
</span><span><span>or computer is infected by malware.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the steps below to check the issue occurs in <strong>
safe mode</strong> if not perform a <strong>clean boot.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device drivers
 aren't causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the article below:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Cleanboot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I&nbsp;also suggest you to do a clean boot and check if any third party apps are causing the issue.
</span><span>Placing the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer to the article below for steps to perform a clean boot.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(46, 116, 181, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span> </span><strong><em><span><span>Note: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot "to reset computer
 as usual. </span></span></em></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would recommend you to download the Microsoft Safety Scanner from the following link and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>

            <p>first of all, thank you for your help!</p>
<p>but the problem is still here... I tried Microsoft Security Scanner and it found nothing. safe mode boot doesn't work, explorer still crashes, which means the problem would have to be in default settings and basic device drivers, right? what's odd to me,
 is when and where crash occurs, it's pretty selective: some video files I can play, others I can't even reach; I can download any .zip file with no problems, but if it contains subtitle file, it crashes.
</p>
<p>clean boot doesn't work either. I also found out that any folder would eventually crash, if I wait long enough. the ones with media files crash immediately. I can't even copy music to my phone...</p>

            <p><span>Hi Stefan,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for replying.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Appreciate the steps that you have taken so far to fix this issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I suggest you to follow the methods below and verify the result.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> End the Windows Explorer process and create the new one.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc, under Process tab, search for Windows Explorer.<br />
2. Right click on it and click on End task.<br />
3. Click on File in the Task Manager at top left corner of the window and select Run new task.<br />
4. Type explorer.exe and click on OK.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: System restore:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I also suggest you to perform a System restore and see if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System Restore is a way to undo system changes by using restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point in time without affecting personal files of users. System Restore uses a feature called
<strong>system protection </strong>that regularly creates and saves information about your PC's drivers, programs, registry, system files, and settings as restore points.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are having recent problems with Windows 10, then you could do a System Restore to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer the link below and refer the section <strong>Restore from a system restore point
</strong>and see if it helps:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>System Restore disclaimer: </strong>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span></span></p>

<p>Nothing works. First thing I did was to manually restart the explorer. As for System restore, i haven't created any restore points.</p>
<p>Now I'm really starting to like the idea to just install new, clean win10. However, this would be the second time I do that, just because of some tiny problem that nobody can help me solve. Feels like I'm sweeping it under the rug.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;When I call my skype number it rings twice and then I get a single "disconnected" tone and the line goes dead. &nbsp;There is no voicemail option. &nbsp;Can anyone help me, because it is pointless having the number if no one can call it !!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the community and only found one similar problem which doesn't appear to have been resolved and I when I look up the issue in HELP there is no information and no link to live chat.<br />

<h2>            External hard drive on firewire not detected</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys!</p>
<p>Your help remained my last option. I have a WD MyBook Studio 1TB external drive that is working fine with my laptop via USB, BUT DOES NOT on firewire. Please advise on how to make it working. Already tried to solve based on&nbsp;KB948911 and KB927827 with no
 success.&nbsp;In the method given in &nbsp;KB948911 I had no SBP2 in the registry, so used USBSTOR instead (?).</p>
<p>My configuration:</p>
<p>Vista x64, SP1 on HP 6710b</p>
<p>WD external drive is connected via 4-to-9 pin cable (upon connection the WD powers up, but no detection by Vista)</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Attila</p>

<p>AttilaO,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Microsoft works closely with many OEMs and 3d parties and had made efforts in providing compatibility with hundreds of devices and applications Microsoft does not guarantee the functionality
 of these devices or applications. It is the responsibility of the OEM/3rd party to provide drivers or updates for their products in order for them to work in Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To narrow down which device is causing the driver incompatibility, you will need to test your IEEE1394 device [firewire] with another hard drive / hardware. Our recommendation is for you to contact
 your device manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows DVD Maker will not add files.</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7. I have made several DVDs using Windows DVD Maker without problem. Now suddenly, for no reason I can detect, it has started to refuse to add files (first screen). It will not add files in any format -- not .avi, not .wmv, not anything
 -- but some files, in the same formats, it can still add. The files it cannot add are mostly newer than the ones it can, but there is no other difference between the files other than the dates they were created on. When I try to add a file, be it through the
 "add files" button or by dragging-and-dropping, there is no error message displayed; the program simply freezes. I have converted the files into numerous and varied types, and cannot find any variation that works. As there is no error message displayed, I
 have no idea what's wrong. I have already attempted to fix the problem by disabling other video filters in the compatibility tab, to no avail. I've also seen to it that Windows is all up-to-date, and otherwise functioning correc

            <blockquote>Thank you so, so much for all of your detailed and helpful advice. I fear I have no idea if any of that solved my problem though, because I haven't even bothered trying to implement it yet. Instead I downloaded Freemake, and
 used it to burn my DVD, and it worked beautifully. In fact, it fit more onto my disc than Windows DVD Maker ever has, which was an added side bonus. I'm so delighted to have this problem, if not solved (because I didn't bother to see if I could), then decidedly
 averted. Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br />
