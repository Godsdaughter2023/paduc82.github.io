<p>The answer to your question is a simple NO.&nbsp; There is no free ride here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must have a qualifying W7 or W8.1 license that is updated to current date to move to W10.&nbsp; The simple participation in the W10 Preview gets you nothing.&nbsp; Keep in mind that all W10 Pro releases have the same Product Key and all W10 Enterprise has the
 same product key.&nbsp; W7 and W8.1 Enterprise do not have a gateway to W10.&nbsp; I exclude W8 because W8 has the gateway to W8.1 so the gateway for W8 does exist.&nbsp; The current W10 product keys have expiry dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A good way to test my theory is to look for the new "Windows" Reserve icon now appearing on the lower toolbar of qualifying W7 and W8.1 PC's.&nbsp; An update was released in later May that set the stage to reserve a copy of W10.&nbsp; I have 3 qualifying W8.1 PC's
 and I see this new icon on each one.&nbsp; When I click on the new Icon, this triggers a request to MS and I get an email back from MS saying that my copy of W10 is reserved and to look for the d/l even before July 29th.&nbsp; I am promised another email when I am authorized
 to use W10.&nbsp; I still have the option if and when to&nbsp; install and I can back out altogether.&nbsp; The W10 final will come as an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we come to all the folks running W10 in VM.&nbsp; It is well documented that you have a choice here.&nbsp; With a qualifying W7 or W8.1 license, you can delete the W10 partition and you are back to your original O/s.&nbsp; You can also delete the partition with the
 original O/S and you are now W10.&nbsp; You clearly don't get to use the same key in 2 places.&nbsp; You can still play around with Preview releases but not with Final release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is clearly no free ride here.&nbsp; You must have a qualifying prior license.&nbsp; It is all based on Product Key.&nbsp; The W8 O/S has an embedded Product Key right in BIOS but this is no big deal.&nbsp; You can take it to the bank that W10 Preview has your prior O/S
 Product Key stacked so not hard to know who is who here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let the games continue.</p>

    <title>Store calculated data in bound field &#40;form&#47;subform&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Store calculated data in bound field &#40;form&#47;subform&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ok... so here's something I cannot seem to solve:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a table (TblInventory) for my inventory and created a form (FrmInventory) for it. Every item (shipment) in the inventory must have a calculated volume (length x width x height).</p>
<p>I also have a table called TblColli in which the details of a shipment are stored (nr of different boxes, their dimensions, etc). For this table, I have also created a form (FrmColliSubform).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the name of the latter suggests it is a subform in the main form FrmInventory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the main form I type general info on the shipment and total number of colli (let's say 10).</p>
<p>Then in the subform I enter the data, such as:</p>
<p>2 boxes 40 x 30 x 20 cms</p>
<p>8 boxes 50 x 40 x 30 cms</p>
<p>
</p><p>This results in the subform in a volume per line (which is calculated on the After_Update event of the length, width and height fields).</p>
<p>I have a hidden textbox in the footer, which has control source =sum([Volume]) for the total volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to transfer this to the TotalVolume in the main form, which is stored in the table TblInventory. Obviously I cannot change the control source for this. I have tried through the After_Change event of the hidden footer textbox, but this doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely stuck now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully anyone can help...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Yes, Don't do it! As a general rule we do not store calculated values. This violates normalization rules. You have an expression that does the calculation for you. use that expression whereever you need to display the value. What you store are the components
 that are used in the expression, NOT the results of the expression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response!</p>
<p>I know that many people would not recommend storing that value. However; I need it. It is an essential field for shipments. In the further process it will be used to calculate costs of storage, invoicing, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Access 2010 MS even has built in an option for calculated fields in the tables... One would say that they didn't do that for nothing, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would there be no way to achieve what I am looking for?</p>

            <p>I didn't say there was no way to do it. But I dispute that you need it. If you can calculate a value then you can calculate that value AT ANY TIME, using the SAME expression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Calculated datatype added in Access 2010 was more for Sharepoint compatibility. There are several things that Microsoft has put into Access that violate normalization rules and standard design practices. Doesn't mean they should be used. In fact I've
 written about the Calculate data Type in my blog. It doesn't store a value but rather stores the expression so it can be recalculated at runtime, exactly what a query does.

<p>thanks Lawrence...I know you and most Insiders know all this... but we were told by GA that we would get the final /build today.... so where is it? they did not say we have it already.... I ve had b10240 for a few weeks already and activated! so.... where
 is the final build? I know that everyone here is saying 10240 is the final.. but why is it that MS/GA officially does not give us that info and lead us to believe that today would come the final build/update?

<p>It's not that they are lacking in communication!</p>
<p>It's that they don't need or appreciate us :(</p>
<p>Really how hard would it have been for MS to</p>
<p>1. Give a mass update notice to us.</p>
<p>2. To have actually thanked us beta testers on at least July 28th for helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing different with the NEW MS!</p>
<p>Even changing CEO has done nothing to cure the absolute disrespect by MS staff of anyone who does not get a pay check from MS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So sad!</p>
<p>But alas as all good karma they'll slip back again to not being liked by customers and they will leave again like happened over the last few years! This time they (we) won't come back!</p>

<p>thanks Lawrence...I know you and most Insiders know all this... but we were told by GA that we would get the final /build today.... so where is it? they did not say we have it already.... I ve had b10240 for a few weeks already and activated! so.... where
 is the final build? I know that everyone here is saying 10240 is the final.. but why is it that MS/GA officially does not give us that info and lead us to believe that today would come the final build/update?

            <p>Did you try powering off the device (so you see the "goodbye" message) then powering back on to see if it works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still does not work then I would hard reset (and NOT restore from a backup). Verify that the camera is working after you set it up BUT EFORE you reinstall any apps. If it works then you can add back your programs you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do hard reset, make sure all your pictures have been saved to OneDrive if you want them!!</p>

<h2>            o365 hybrid calendar free&#47;busy not wokring</h2>
                    
<p>We have o365 configured with exchange 2010 in hybrid config. &nbsp;The exchange servers are at two different locations/networks connected over VPN.</p>
<p>Each of them has had hybrid wizard ran and both are federated. &nbsp; We did have some issues getting this working initially with proxy servers getting in the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have since resolved this and tes-federation get-federation test-hybrid commands work fine.</p>
<p>I had noticed that the get-sharingpolicy on prem and in o365 differed for calendarfreebusy. &nbsp;Both are now the same however we still cannot get o365 mailboxes seeing free/busy to on prem mailboxes.</p>
<p>Suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi GarySmith5724,</p>
<p>So this is a Free/Busy information sharing issue in an Exchange 2010 hybrid deployment. And I also would like to know the following details:<br />
1. Is this a one-way issue? Can on-premises mailbox users see the Free/Busy information of Office 365 mailbox users?<br />
2. How do users check the Free/Busy information of others? It is suggested that they all use the Scheduling Assistant feature provided by both OWA and Outlook. And please try OWA to make sure whether this is merely an Outlook client issue.<br />
3. About “noticed that the get-sharingpolicy on prem and in o365 differed for calendarfreebusy”, could you provide more details? And how did you then make them the same?</p>
<p>Moreover, please use the <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remote Connectivity Analyzer</a> to do a test. Select
<strong>Office 365</strong> -&gt; <strong>Free/Busy Test</strong> -&gt; <strong>Free/Busy</strong>. Specify the email addresses of the
<strong>source mailbox</strong> and <strong>target mailbox</strong>, and then run the test. If the test result is failed, please provide it for further investigation.</p>
<p>I have sent you a private message to collect the test result. Please see it at
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allen</p>

</p><p>Dear sir, </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I checked&nbsp;<span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Explorer\User Shell Folders</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>but which it was correct as per you have mentioned like&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Below steps i handled to solve said issues</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. </span>CCleaner</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Two times uninstalled MS Office 2007 &amp; installed</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. C Disk Clean up, Add-ins empty,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. MSO.DLL file placed</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5.</span><span>Kaspersky Anti-Virus uninstalled</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am facing this problem when i installed Kaspersky Anti-Virus. Before that it was not happened</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>When i open MS Office Excel/word, Power point file , i can see following errors</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This error may appear if you attempt to open a file marked as damaged or disabled by a Microsoft Office system program. Each time an attempt is made to open the file ? even if the file was recovered or repaired ? will cause this error to appear and other
 currently open files or programs to suspend.<br />
</p>
The file is in the Disabled Items list because, in previous attempts to open the file, it has caused the program to fault or shut down more than once.<br />
Microsoft Project, Microsoft SharePoint Designer, and Microsoft OneNote: If the file was properly recovered, replaced, or deleted, you can remove the file from the list of disabled files (re-enable the file) by selecting Help, About Microsoft Office &lt;Application
 Name&gt;, and then clicking Disabled Items. Select the disabled item that you want to re-enable, and then click Enable.<br />
Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Publisher, and Microsoft InfoPath: If the file was properly recovered, replaced, or deleted, you can remove the file from the list of disabled files (re-enable the file) by selecting Tools, Trust Center, and then
 selecting Add-ins. In the Manage list, click the arrow and select Disabled Items, click Go, and then select the disabled item that you want to re-enable.<br />
Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Word: If the file was properly recovered, replaced, or deleted, you can remove the file from the list of disabled files (re-enable the file) by clicking the Microsoft Office button, and
 then clicking &lt;Application Name&gt; Options. In the Manage list, click the arrow and select Disabled Items, click Go, and then select the disabled item that you want to re-enable.<br />
Re-enabling a file does not guarantee the application can open it. The file must be recovered from either a backup or undamaged recovered file.<br />

<h2>            Excel 365--&#62;Get Data from SharePoint Online Excel workbook&#58; Access to the resource is forbidden</h2>
                    <p><span>Questions:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>(1) How do I enable Excel 365 Power Query to display SharePoint Online (SPO) libraries/lists as data sources in the "Get Data" menu?</span></p>
<p><span>(2) How do I get data from Excel 365 workbooks stored in SPO document libraries?&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Situation:&nbsp; </span>I have tried to create Power Queries in Excel 365 workbooks stored in SPO document libraries that Get Data from other Excel 365 workbooks stored in SPO libraries.&nbsp; I don't see SharePoint document libraries
 (or lists) as a data source in the "Get Data" menu.&nbsp; (However, I see that displayed as a menu item in instructional videos &amp; blogs that I've seen.)&nbsp; When I try to source it as an ODBC source, I get an "Access to the resource is forbidden" error message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp; I have no problems sourcing from Excel workbooks stored on our on-premise file server from which we're moving content, local drives, etc., but we are trying to store all shared content in SharePoint.&nbsp; I also have no problems with Power Queries that
 source data from Access databases stored on the file server, local drives, etc.&nbsp; I am running Excel 365 (O365 Business Premium license) over Windows 10 on a Surface Book 2.&nbsp; I use MS Edge as my browser, but I run Excel 365 in desktop mode for development.&nbsp;</p>

            It's not getting sent over and over again. &nbsp;I suspect you're using a Samsung phone which contains a bug that causes it to make duplicates of the items in the Sent folder, but it's not resending. &nbsp;See Ron Sommer's post here:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-osend/my-hotmail-account-keeps-sending-an-email-that-was/2d36643f-cb77-4426-9255-4f1045a187a3#LastReply">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-osend/my-hotmail-account-keeps-sending-an-email-that-was/2d36643f-cb77-4426-9255-4f1045a187a3#LastReply</a>

<h2>            Nokia 6085 screen went dead.  Can anyone tell my the buttons to press to enable bluetooth&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My phone somehow acquired water damage and now the screen is blank.&nbsp; I can still make calls with it and otherwise use it, but I can't see what I'm doing.&nbsp; I have some stuff on there that I don't want to lose, and I usually connect it to my computer via bluetooth.&nbsp;
 Can anyone tell me which buttons to hit and when to hit them to enable bluetooth?&nbsp; I usually connected by hitting the blue button on the very top-left part of the keypad and going from there.&nbsp; I just never memorized the menu layout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Any luck? I am int he same position. With my old nokia 6360 and even my older 600 series I knew the menu based off the numeric codes. I believe it was menu 2 3 1 to set the alarm. (I have a history of being very tough on my phones)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My flip top is missing completely so I get no speaker or display and have been making all my calls via speaker phone for the last two weeks. I think it is time to get a new phone now and I want to salvage my stuffs.&nbsp; If you ever figured out the sequence
 (or anyone else has) I would be super appreciative to know how.</p>

<p>Floyd,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My situation actually has turned around.&nbsp; My screen eventually came back on.&nbsp; I guess if you leave it on after water damage, there's a chance it may come back eventually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm not sure how much different our phones are, but I will tell you what I have to do to quickly access bluetooth:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, let me categorize the buttons.At the very top left and right, you have two different 'selector' buttons.&nbsp; They are used mainly for 'clear' and 'options' and such.&nbsp; Then, I have a center button surrounded by 4 directional arrows (up, down, left,
 right).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's hope this works for you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press the left selector button once</p>
<p>Press the down arrow once</p>
<p>Press the center button</p>
<p>Press the center button again</p>
<p>Press the up arrow once</p>
<p>Press the center button</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was via the quick-menu.&nbsp; I'll give you more detailed instructions to access it via the conventional menu system:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press the 'end call' key couple of times to make sure that you're out of all menus</p>
<p>Press the center button</p>
<p>Press down once</p>
<p>Press left once</p>
<p>Press the center button</p>
<p>Press the down button 7 times</p>
<p>Press the center button</p>
<p>Press the center button again</p>
<p>Press the center button again</p>
<p>Press up once</p>
<p>Press the center button</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That does it for my phone, so I hope it works for yours too, cheers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit:&nbsp; Also, you may have to click the center button to confirm connectivity with bluetooth.&nbsp; If you follow these steps and you still aren't connected, wait a minute or two, then click the center button and see what happens. Click it again twice if nothing
 happens after that.</p>

<p>It seems to have been pulled everywhere. It is no longer available for me too. I'm only speculating but apps are sometimes pulled if they find bugs in them and they should be back in the Marketplace as soon as they have it sorted. Keep an eye out.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Hacked account, blocked access, code of conduct violation</h2>
                    <p>Hi there all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had an account that I have not been able to access for a long time, it was hacked and I never used it. Recently when I tried to retrieve it I thought I blocked myself out because I made too many failed attempts, used incorrect password, didn't pass
 the security questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there were sensitive emails of threatening nature and I needed to get into this account to be able to take the evidence to relevant authorities. When I contacted Microsoft, I was advised that it was blocked due to violating the code of conduct,
 has this happened to anyone else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this account as a child and did not have anything listed under the code of conduct - what usually causes these triggers? Are failed attempts definitely not the reason?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Different First Page option is enabled, this option will automatically remove any header and footer from the first page and user can create a different header and footer value, only
 on the first page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check this

            <p>Hi Michael</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question relates to Excel whereas the article mentioned in your reply relates to Word. &nbsp;I suspect that the information you gave about selecting Different First Page option may also relate to Word as it doesn't seem to do anything in my version (15.31)
 of Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can select a different first page in Excel for Windows 2016 (there are a couple of YouTube videos showing it, but they show a different ribbon configuration from the Mac version. &nbsp;I am still hoping that there is some way of doing it in Mac, otherwise
 why did Microsoft include the check box in page setup &gt; headers and footers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi Rjkbee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the incorrect information I gave you. As for your concern regarding the different first page option, it has the same functionality in Word 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that, if different first page option is enabled, the custom header and footer you created will be applied to the second page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For creating custom header and footer, navigate to File &gt; Page Setup &gt; Header &amp; Footer. Then click on the Custom Header or Footer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>Hi Mike</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, many thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must be doing something wrong as this does not work on my version of Excel 2016 365 (v. 15.31). &nbsp;The header always appears on all pages irrespective of the order I enter the data. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried checking the different first page box before entering the header, after I've entered the header, in normal page view and in page layout view. &nbsp;Even entering the data in the header box on the second page in page layout view ends with the same result.
 &nbsp;None of it works and any header or footer is applied to all pages including the first. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now solved the problem I was trying to overcome in a different way, so it is now not such a pressing issue, but it could be a useful feature for me (and others) if it worked. &nbsp;Again I am struggling to understand why Microsoft would have included it
 as an option if it doesn't work - and still assuming that there must be something I'm doing wrong.</p>

            Hi, i'm having the same problem, how did you change the permission/userid thing you talked about? I'm using migration assistant from my old mac to my new one, I have microsoft office '08 and want to transfer the app directly. I can't get anything more
 than setup assistant every time I try word/excel etc.

<div>Hi All,<br />
<br />
Friday all working perfectly, the following Monday morning, open outlook and nothing in there, none of my 3 email accounts, 4000 emails etc, it's like new, fresh out of the box.&nbsp;<br />
I have yet to do anything to try and retrieve my data as wanted to fully understand before I proceed.</div>
<div>Also, I searched in spotlight to find the emails, did the search, found the emails, but they started disappearing right in front of me. When I did another spotlight search and quickly clicked on one of the mails before it went, it opened up in Outlook
 'as normal'.&nbsp;<br />
I thought posting this was appropriate as I haven't yet read that this has happened to anyone else?<br />
Your ideas most welcome.<br />
Thanks<br />

            I don't think re-buiding will do anything if you are using a new blank Identity.<br />
<br />
Normally this is user error. Most likely you have accidentally moved your data. Hopefully, you have not deleted the file. If you have deleted the trash, it's gone. Sorry!<br />
<br />
Outlook stores your data in this location:<br />
<br />
YOUR User's folder/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/your identity
<br />
<br />
If you move the Main Identity, Office 2011 Identities folder or Microsoft User Data folder&nbsp; to a different location, Outlook will create a new blank Identity.<br />
<br />
Check the size of the database in your Main Identity folder. If it's 22.8 MB it's a new blank identity.<br />
<br />
Four options why your data can go missing:<br />
<br />
1) You moved your Identity or Microsoft User Data folder<br />
2) It's in an invisible folder called 'lost &amp; found' <br />
Under the 'go' menu, select 'go to folder'. In that dialog, enter<br />
"/lost+found" (without the quotes).<br />
<br />
If there is a lost+found folder it will open, if not, you will get a 'folder<br />
not found' error.<br />
<br />
3) Virus software quarantined your Identity. You will need to read the directions on how to release.<br />
<br />
4) Sometimes updating software (including the OSX) can cause problems where<br />
files go missing. Check in the invisible folder 'lost &amp; found'. If it's not there it could be unrecoverable.<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<br />
If you have a backup you can restore. You need to restore the entire Identity.<br />
<br />
Fix if you have more than one folder...<br />
<br />
If you have not used a new identity, move the entire identity folder you want to use to the Office 2011 Identities folder and let it overwrite the blank one. Your identity is named "Main" by default.
<br />
<br />
If you have used the new Identity.....Be sure to rename one so you do not overwrite.
<br />
<br />
Your identity folder can contain more than one identity. Switch Identities to view your old mail. If you have not used the new identity, delete it. If you have used it and want to combine the new mail with your original database, export your data as .olm file
 and import into the other Identity. I suggest exporting the Identity with the smallest amount of data.<br />
<br />
You can delete the old Identity after you are satisfied with the transfer.<br />

<p>Hi Neeraj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To investigate this issue, I'd like to first confirm the following things: </p>
<p>1. As you mentioned SharePoint Online, please access your OneDrive for Business library (click OneDrive tile in Office 365 app launcher), check if you can open files in your&nbsp; OneDrive for Business library.
</p>
<p>2. Is the issue related to all files in this SharePoint Online site? Change to other libraries/sites which you have permission. See if they run into the same issue. Meanwhile, do you try opened the document with Office Online or Office desktop apps?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. For that problematic SharePoint Online site, do other users run into the same situation when opening the same file?</p>
<p>4. Which browser do you use? Open a private window of it and open some other browsers. Check if they have the same issue.
</p>
<p>5. Could you share with us the URL of that problematic SharePoint Site/library? For privacy protection, I have sent you a
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">private message</a> to collect it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

    <title>Calculated field in table using Start Time and End Time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flopbot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calculated field in table using Start Time and End Time</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
<br />
I have a table called <span style="font-weight: bold">THours</span>.&nbsp; It logs the hours worked by volunteers on particular days with the following fields.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">HoursID</span> ~ AutoNumber, Long Integer<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">VolunteerID</span> ~ Number, Long Integer<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">DateWorked </span>~ Date/Time, Short Date<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">StartTime</span> ~ Date/Time, Medium Time<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">EndTime</span> ~ Date/Time, Medium Time<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">NumberOfPeople</span> ~ Long Integer<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">OtherHours</span> ~ Number, Long Integer, Standard<br />
<br />
I'm switching over my DB from Access 2003 to 2010 and I'm looking for a cleaner way to calculate total hours worked.&nbsp; In my old DB, I added calculated fields to all my queries, forms, etc. which were some variation of this...<br />
<br />
<span>(Sum(Nz((DateDiff("n",[StartTime],[EndTime])/60)*[NumberOfPeople])))+Sum(Nz([OtherHours]))</span><br />
<span>(Sum(Nz((DateDiff("n",[StartTime],[EndTime])/60)*[NumberOfPeople])))+Sum(Nz([OtherHours]))</span><br />
<br />
<br />
They worked in 2003, but were rather tedious and confusing, especially after now working on the DB for awhile.&nbsp; I've read about calculated fields in 2010 and I'd like to add a calculated field called
<span style="font-weight: bold">HoursToday </span>to <span style="font-weight: bold">
THours</span>.&nbsp; My problem; how should I set up the Expression &amp; field Format.&nbsp; My current calculated field, which doesn't work, has a Standard format and this expression...<br />
<br />
((([StartTime]*[EndTime])/60)*[NumberOfPeople])<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I want the field to return 2.5 hours when:&nbsp; StartTime (9:00 AM), EndTime (11:30 AM) &amp; NumberOfPeople (1).<br />
<br />
Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Thank you!<br />

            <blockquote>Thank you both for your help!&nbsp; I have one related question but this time it's more philosophical.&nbsp; Everything I've found about using calculated fields in tables
<br />
(ex. They say that if you change John's name to Johnathan that the Calculated Field will remain John Doe.)<br />
<br />
FName:&nbsp; John<br />
LName:&nbsp; Doe<br />
FullName:&nbsp; John Doe <br />
<br />
I did a quick test in my table and Access DID automatically updated my calculated field when I changed FName.&nbsp; It changed it to Jonathan Doe.<br />
<br />
I wrote a blog article on the new Calculated Field datatype. My take is that it does work, but I'm still loath to use it unless I'm connecting to a Sharepoint list.

<p><span><span>I don't know when you were able to get Skype to call for a minute to an Offline contact, but it's a normal behaviour that the call disconnects after a few seconds.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Perhaps in the past, the contact was shown as Offline, but was actually in an Invisible mode. In this case, Skype will call this contact the same way as if they would be Online.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi T77_C11,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be happy to help in guiding you through how to insert the *.xlsm file into PowerPoint 2007.
<br />
Before we proceed, I have a question:<br />
Have you tried inserting the excel file (*.xlsm) into PowerPoint 2007 earlier? If yes, then did you get any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps to insert the <b>*.xlsm</b> file into PowerPoint 2007:<br />
1. Open PowerPoint Presentation.<br />
2. Go to <b>Insert</b> tab -&gt; Under <b>Text</b> box -&gt; Click on <b>Object</b>.<br />
3. Select the option <b>Create from file</b> -&gt; <b>Browse</b> to the <b>*.xlsm</b> file -&gt; Click on
<b>Open.</b><br />
4. You can select either insert as a<b> link</b> or <b>display as icon</b> -&gt; Click
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
