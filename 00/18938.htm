            I'm not sure if I am missing just what you are asking.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The MyPhone service is currently a means to backup and restore all of your PIM data as well as photos, video, music and documents.&nbsp; And there is a neat feature to&nbsp;<span>configure your My Phone account to share photos on social network sites such as Facebook,
 Flickr, and MySpace.</span> <br />
<br />
If you are referencing a TOTAL backup and restore of the device's installed programs, that is not possible at this point in time (nor do I think it is even a consideration).

    <title>suggestions for antivius for an old system - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            suggestions for antivius for an old system</h2>
                    Can somebody recommend a free antivirus for an old, outdated XP system? Lately Microsoft Security Essential has been slowing down my machine, even when I disable the "real time protection" and set it to only scan incoming downloads.
<br />
This is an old computer I use as a print server, file server, and playing old games like Baldur's Gate, Diablo I, or Final Fantasy VII &amp; VIII.
<br />
It's specs are<br />
Dell Optiplex GX110<br />
1ghz processor<br />
512mb of RAM<br />
Windows 98SE/Windows XP Professional dual boot.<br />
Since the decent graphics card broke, the computer lacks an AGP port and I don't have any other PCI graphics cards, I'm stuck with the built-in integrated video.<br />
<br />
Anyways, can somebody suggest an antivirus program for this system at least on the XP side? I'm using AVG free on my newer system, but ever since whatever version (8.something I think) was the final one to support Windows 98 AVG brought this system to a crawl.
<br />
<br />
I need something to protect it primarily from downloading a virus, especially browser-based attacks. I can screen everything else with the newer computer, but there is also somebody who occasionally uses it that is stupid enough to click on virus links in e-mails
 or fall for those "you are infected with a virus, click here to disinfect your system" even though I have tried for over fifteen years to education them on such internet dangers, but they are not very computer iterate, so I need some protection. Yes, I restricted
 their account AMAP for that reason.<br />
<br />
The only free ones I can think of off-hand are AVG, Avast, and MSE. I haven't tried any of the modern alternatives as I've been using MSE since whatever version of AVG that was the first not to support Windows 98.<br />
I have no preferences, so long as it doesn't put a big drain on the speed, the system is slow enough as it is.<br />
<br />
Before anyone mentions upgrading, this is NOT my primary system. At least, it hasn't been my primary system in over five years (ten years ago it was still my primary). It's my backup, and also my second best WORKING desktop.

It only started in the last couple months, and if it's not MSE, why is it that disabling MSE and only MSE in msconfig and services.msc instantly fixed the speed problems upon reboot?<br />

            The system is a Windows 98SE/XP dual boot. I just found out that Avast is offering version 4.8 again for Windows 9X users, and I still have a copy installed. I couldn't renew the definitions last summer, but it looks like they were persuaded to offer it
 again.<br />
<br />
I decided to use the installer to install it on the XP side as well, since it doesn't slow down my system under Windows 98SE except for when it's updating the definitions.<br />
<br />
It seems to work just fine.<br />
<br />
So, Avast 4.8 is a good solution for both Windows 98SE and XP on obsolete systems.<br />

<div><br />
<div>If you don't want to upgrade, You can try installing AVG or Avira. The newer versions of both the Antivirus might slow down your computer as it &nbsp;will be needing more resources to work. Or you can try installing the old versions of these software's from

What exactly are you proposing I upgrade a system designed for Windows 98SE to?<br />
It has a 1ghz single-core processor and 512mb of PC-133 RAM. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I had experience with a laptop that had a 1.7ghz dual-core processor with 1gb of RAM. It performed poorly with 32-bit Vista Home Premium even though that was the OEM software and what was on the COA sticker on the bottom. The performance increase
 I got when I installed Windows XP on it was so great it wasn't even funny. This desktop is less capable than that laptop.<br />
So after that example with the laptop, I wouldn't try installing a later version of Windows on anything less capable than the laptop. The laptop also had superior video capabilities, even if they both have integrated video.
<br />
<br />
As for MSE, I'd have agreed with you until a month ago or so, when it suddently started slowing down the system. Also back in October automatic updates also started slowing down the system even more. It would take at least forty minutes to check for updates
 every day, during which it would hog the CPU and bring the system to a crawl. I was forced to disable automatic updates entirely. That has been well documented in other threads, with no solutions that actually work.<br />
<br />
I think it's deliberate on Microsoft's part to encourage people to upgrade.&nbsp; Break XP and make those old systems seem even older by slowing them down so people will buy Windows 8, that they say hasn't been doing so well in sales, much like Vista.

 every day, during which it would hog the CPU and bring the system to a crawl. I was forced to disable automatic updates entirely. That has been well documented in other threads, with no solutions that actually work.<br />
<br />
I think it's deliberate on Microsoft's part to encourage people to upgrade.&nbsp; Break XP and make those old systems seem even older by slowing them down so people will buy Windows 8, that they say hasn't been doing so well in sales, much like Vista.

<p>It sounds like you've purchased or retained some very outdated and weak performing systems, though you already know it so it isn't necessary to discuss that particular issue any further.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It isn't that Microsoft is consciously trying to make Windows XP perform any worse, it's simply that the core operating system and Windows Update systems as well as security designed into XP are ancient in computer terms and as such had limits.&nbsp; Originally
 these were intended to last roughly 10 years, but this had been extended in the past to roughly 13, so the overhead and inefficiencies are rearing their ugly head.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since the last Windows XP&nbsp;Service Pack 3 was released over 5 years ago in May of 2008, all of the updates since that time have been individual packages which has the effect of overloading the simple local&nbsp;database used by XP as had occurred before SP3 was
 released, so this is likely happening again.&nbsp; However, since the end-of-life for XP is only just over 2 months away, fixing this at this point is really pointless.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A key difference that exists between Windows Vista and 8.x is that there were real problems occurring with Vista like outdated&nbsp;or unavailable drivers from PC&nbsp;manufacturers and 3rd-party applications&nbsp;that didn't behave well within the new security paradigm
 that Vista included.&nbsp; In the case of Windows 8, the only real common complaints are with the new GUI and how it operates on non-touch enabled machines like desktop/laptop systems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since many users don't have a problem using Windows 8 (or 8.1 as in my case), this is really just a learning issue and the wiliness by some and not by others to deal with change.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I personally say leave the "PC" desktop/laptop version&nbsp;as it was in Windows&nbsp;7 and let it die with these physical systems, since their sales are collapsing quickly in the consumer segment and will begin to in business as soon as the necessary apps are available.&nbsp;
 This has little to do with Windows and more to do with the cost of producing these larger and also outdated legacy hardware technologies.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I haven't recommended a desktop or laptop PC to any of my consumer friends or relatives for over a year now and have even suggested that those with a small business take a close look at whether one of the newer tablets&nbsp;or even smartphones&nbsp;might do everything
 they really need.&nbsp; I came close myself last year&nbsp;and now that I see how the applications are being handled for the future I'm very close to being able to drop a PC for my own purposes.</p>

<br />
It's a system that's been serving me faithfully for many, many years. It is ancient. I was middle of the road when I obtained it, but has been obsolete for a long time. It has been replaced twice, but the first replacement suffered hardware failure of the motherboard
 forcing me to obtain my current computer, that is also starting to become obsolete, but still performs well.
<br />
<br />
I was just asking what my options were to maintain the ancient thing. It's also my oldest computer still in use, although I do have a fully functional Apple IIGS in storage which I keep for nostalgia as it was my first computer. Funny thing, that Apple IIGS
 outlasted the Mac that replaced it in 1997, as that Mac died in 2010 with some weird power-up issues, but since it had a propritary power supply, I didn't think it was worth it to try to find a replacement on the off-chance that that would fix the issue as
 I could obtain a cheap TV set for the same price that wouldn't need a digital converter. I was using it as a TV set as I bought TV tuner when I went to university in 2000; and to run AOL Instant messenger or display stuff from gamefaqs while playing full-screen
 games.<br />
<br />
As for the laptop I mentioned, all the laptops I've ever owned were obtained second hand for free from relatives when they upgraded. The only time I ever really needed a good laptop was back in 2006-2007 when I was a field service technician, and the company
 issued one to me for that purpose loaded with everything I needed. Other than that they have been luxuries, except for one class when I went back to school when I needed a laptop with a word processor in the late 2000s, and I was able to make due with a 300mhz
 laptop running Word 97 with Windows 98 (I wouldn't get the one I mentioned until the next year). It did the job perfectly in spite of the obsolescence. Any vulnerabilities were not an issue since the laptop didn't have Wifi or even an Ethernet port, so the
 only source of infection was via flash drive or floppy.<br />

                    <p>Is there a way to disable Auto Capitalization on the first word of a sentence?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OneNote Version doesn't have a ribbon on top, a radial menu, or File Menu on top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to Windows all settings and looked for TYPING SETTINGS and turned off</p>
<ul>
<li>Autocorrect misspelled words</li><li>Capitalize the letter of each sentence</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There's also nothing the options menu</p>

<p><span>For
<strong>OneNote 2016 desktop application</strong> you can follow the below procedure.</span></p>
<p><span>After opening OneNote If you don’t see the file ribbon, Press
<strong>Ctrl+F1</strong> to unhide the file ribbon and to lock it. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: P</span><span><span>ress
<strong>Ctrl+F1 </strong>t</span></span><span>o hide file ribbon again.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To
<strong>Disable Auto Capitalization</strong> follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open
<strong>OneNote.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on
<strong>file</strong> then select <strong>options</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Select
<strong>proofing</strong> and then <strong>Auto correct options</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4. In the
<strong>AutoCorrect</strong> tab, <strong>Uncheck capitalize first letter of the sentences</strong> and click on
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance, we will be happy to help you.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank You.</span></p>

            <p>To expand on Deepak1709's answer, note that you can download the "desktop" version of OneNote 2016 for free here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.onenote.com/download/win32/x86/en-US</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also get it from the "Also Available On" section here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.onenote.com/download</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop version has quite a few more features than the Windows Store version.</p>

            <p>One way is to use INDIRECT().</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made a simple&nbsp;example with excel files names <em>Jan source</em>, <em>Jan dest</em>,
<em>Feb source</em>, <em>Feb dest</em>, etc., to illustrate the approach. The month abbreviations are each 3 letters.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These formulas go in the <em>dest</em> files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In F1 this returns the containing file's name (as long as the file has been saved).
</p>
<p>&nbsp; =MID(CELL("filename"),SEARCH("[",CELL("filename"))+1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEARCH("]",CELL("filename"))-SEARCH("[",CELL("filename"))-1)</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Jan dest </em>you get</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan dest.xlsx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In F2 this returns the name of the file to draw from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =LEFT(F1,3)&amp;" source.xlsx"</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan source.xlsx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In F3 this returns cell A1 of Sheet1 of the source,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =INDIRECT("'["&amp;F2&amp;"]Sheet1'!$A$1",TRUE)</p>
<p>The idea is to use string concatenation to piece together the reference desired for INDIRECT. In the example,
<em>Sheet1</em> and <em>$A$1</em> are fixed strings, but these fragments can be calculated&nbsp;if needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the daring, the formulas in F1, F2, and F3 can be folded into one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you already have formulas linking to other files in the Destination workbook and those links have to be changed/updated to other files, then you can use the Data &gt; Edit Links functionality.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 520, errors when using SD card &#40;music won&#39;t sync properly and apps won&#39;t download&#41;</h2>
                    Hi I have had my Nokia Lumia 520 now for about a year and it has been fine and functioning well. When I originally got it, I borrowed an old SD card from my previous phone which happened to be an 8GB class 2. It worked perfectly fine and I was able to
 download apps onto it and sync music and photos fine. As I was using up the data I thought I would buy myself a larger card. I now have a 32GB class 10 card. It was working fine till I tried to download apps onto the SD card rather than the phone itself and
 I would get the error code : 80004005 When I tried downloading onto the phone itself it was fine. Then because it was a new card I wanted to sync my music back onto it and in Windows App For Desktop I had errors on some songs error code 80004005. I have looked
 around but this error code seems common across the different windows devices so I wasn't exactly sure what to do. I have tried formatting the sd card yet the problem persists. Please help me find a solution as its pretty annoying

<p>Hi ASH-Nan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no entry to change the section number in the Marketing mix diagram. As a workaround, I think you can create one that fits your needs and save it as a stencil for further use:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-save-and-share-custom-stencils-a4c2235c-677d-4117-9673-1fef0a0ee22f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create,

<p>Hi Jomel,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you have not understood my question and sorry to say this the reply is irrelevant, i never asked for how to create a calendar event manually&nbsp;in outlook web.<br />
<br />
What i am asking is (to be more clear)-</p>
<p><br />
We have live web application used by many of our customers. In this web application we are displaying Tasks and Service Orders created by our customers.<br />
Here we are providing a menu link "Add to calendar" to each task/service order to create a calendar event in outlook web.<br />
By clicking that menu link our app will open a browser window to navigate to the following link that in turn will land on outlook (live) web calendar ui with 'New Event' form opened with pre-filled start date, end date, subject, etc., values.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>https://outlook.live.com/owa/#startdt=20150128T090000&amp;enddt=20150128T110000&amp;subject=Task+100+-+Task+test+44&amp;location=1921+Bel+Air+Road%2c+7+Boug+Road%2c+Los+Angeles%2c+CA+90077&amp;body=Number%3a+100%0d%0aName%3a+Task+test+44%0d%0aClient%3a+Vartan%27s+Fine+Jewelry%0d%0aProject%3a+R603+-+Smart+Home+System+-+Control4&amp;path=/calendar/action/compose<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the above link no longer works and the outlook calendar "New Event" form is not showing at all, Could you please tell us what is the correct (url) link format to create calendar event, so that i will update my web application with the correct
 link.<br />

<p>Hi Narayana Karthik (narayanak),</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to replicate your concern here on my end. I was able to share the link to a new event, however, when clicking the link it opens a new tab but does nothing. I'd like to share the steps I've performed to do this, so you can verify if you've done
 the same. If not, kindly share the steps you've done so I can try to replicate it properly. See the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Outlook.com (web browser).</p>
<p>2. Go to Calendar.</p>
<p>3. Clicked <strong>+ New event</strong> &gt; Hit <strong>View event</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ece83f95-10b9-4212-9106-8cdc61354fad?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ece83f95-10b9-4212-9106-8cdc61354fad?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>4. On the new window, select <strong>Open in new window</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0bd48b7b-ff64-40be-b3b2-990ca78ff39f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0bd48b7b-ff64-40be-b3b2-990ca78ff39f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>5. Copied the link provided on the new window and hyperlinked it to an email.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/479d0398-effb-471a-beef-316edad2bc5f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/479d0398-effb-471a-beef-316edad2bc5f?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h3> tcsmint  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving messages to folders &#40;using IMAP&#41; creates duplicate email in gmail</h2>
                    Since the recent upgrade to 14.2.0, every time I move an email from my inbox to a folder (let's call that folder "Work") in outlook, a duplicate message is generated in gmail. One message has the label "Work" and another message doesn't have any label
 at all (so it is only visible in "All Mail"). There should only be one message in gmail, one that has the label "Work" -- this is the way outlook has been working for me since I began using it over a year ago.

<h2>            Add-in&#47;Plug-in  support for Microsoft Outlook 2011 on Mac</h2>
                    Is it possible to write add-ins for Microsoft Outlook 2011 on Mac?&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have a requirement where we want to add a button on the main toolbar of MS Outlook on Mac and also want to customize the behavior of existing buttons – like the Send button. Just wanted to know is this possible.
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>After searching we found that it is not possible to develop add-ins on Microsoft Outlook 2011 on Mac.</p>

            <p>Outlook does'[t support any form of plug-in very unfortunately. You can only extend its functions through AppleScript.<br />&nbsp;If that's an important feature for you, I would strongly encourage you to use the Help &gt; Send Feedback command from within Outlook to let MS know, and help them prioritize future development.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corentin</p>

            Sounds like you have the wifi issue.&nbsp; For you I hope they push.&nbsp; If it were in the release build (14393) they probably would, but none of us are using previews for our primary computing so they may not be in such a hurry.&nbsp; A new preview build has to be
 signed off on before it can be flighted and that may be a hold up on busy days.

            They have a Feedback Quest ongoing to check if the peer-to-peer Delivery Optimization makes things faster for build downloads. Between that and the Wi-Fi and video issues, they may be motivated to flight another Insider build, if it doesn't introduce too
 many new issues.

<div>When you specify what you want to merge, there are two steps, and the way that you specify the records that you want is different in each of those steps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the first step, when you define the data source, you specify the excel file, (optionally) the worksheet within the workbook, and (optionally) an Excel Range.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let's suppose you specify that the Excel range is C5:T15. Then row "5" of your sheet would be the header row. Row "6" in the sheet would be "record 1" in the merge. ROw "15" would be "record 10."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let's suppose that rows "6" to "8" of your sheet are blank. That would mean that you do not want to merge "row 6", "row 7," and "row 8". These are "record 1," "record 2," and "record 3"</div>
<div><br />
<div>In other words, what you want are records 4 to 10.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, in step 6 in the Mail Merge Manager, when you specify which records to merge, you don't specify the Excel range. You specify the first and last record numbers you want to merge, i.e. 4 to 10.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have to say that I can't help feeling that there is a much simpler way of conveying all that information, but that's the best I was able to do this time.</div>

            <div>Do you have blank rows between the header row (that contains the column names) and the first row of label data? The rows could have been hidden.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If so, as far as I know you will either need to delete those rows in Excel before doing the merge, or &nbsp;specify the range of records to merge in Word (you can do that in the "Complete Merge" part of the Mail Merge Manager dialog box).</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as I know, Word 2008 expects your Excel data to have a header row (with column names) followed immediately by data rows. If you have empty rows above the header row, Word ignores them. If you have empty rows below the header row, Word treats them
 as data rows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My understanding of Mailmerge on both Windows and Mac is that by default, Word does not in fact take any notice of any Print_Area you might have defined. It is possible that older versions of Word on Mac behaved differently in this respect, but that's
 how it seems to be here with the copy of Word 2008 that I have.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Print_Area is an "Excel range name" that Excel creates when you define the print area. In order to restrict Word so that it saw only the rows in the print area, you would have to be able to specify "Print_Area" when you specify the data source. In fact,
 you can do that on Windows Word, but in Mac Word 2008, you only seem to be able to specify</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. a worksheet name (you can try typing Print_Area as the name, but then the OK button in the dialog is greyed out)</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. a range of cells, e.g. A1:C3. You do not appear to be able to specify "Sheet1" as the sheet and "Print_Area" as the range, either.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>[Even if you could specify "Print_Area" as the range of cells to merge, you would need the header row to be at the top of the Print_Area. In the situation where you have a header row followed by blank rows, followed by non-blank data rows, that isn't actually
 what you have (i.e. you would have to do something like duplicate the header row prior to merging.)]</div>

<h2>            Unable to set up POP3 using OUTlook 2013 &#40;office 365&#41; and Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I am unable to set up my optonline email account. The email account is a POP3. The computer is running Windows 8.1 and I am using Outlook 2013 (office 365 Home subscription). I understand that Windows 8.1 does not support POP3 accounts. But I have been
 told there is a work around for this issue.

</p>
<p>First step in getting an answer is providing information about what exactly the "issues" are that you are encountering by including any error messages in their entirety (exactly as displayed with no para-phrasing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also provide any other relevant information (i.e. confirm Outlook version etc) such as steps followed (as in - was this an "in place" upgrade from 8 to 8.1 etc). Simply upgrading Windows from 8 to 8.1 on the same machine would not result in any changes to
 your Outlook settings.</p>

            Hi Barry,<br />
<br />
To address your concern, which version of Outlook are you using? Is it Outlook.com or Outlook app?<br />
<br />
If you're using Outlook.com, you may remove the signature that you set up by following the steps provided below:<br />
<br />
1. Click the gear icon on the upper right side of your account.<br />
2. Select <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Mail </strong>&gt; <strong>Email signature</strong>.<br />
3. Next, uncheck the box and remove the signature that was set up.<br />
4. Then, click <strong>Save </strong>so that changes may take effect.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you're using Outlook app, you may follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Click on <strong>File tab</strong> &gt; <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Mail tab</strong>.<br />
2. Under <strong>Compose message</strong>, click on <strong>Signatures</strong>.<br />
3. Highlight the signature that you would like to remove.<br />
4. Then, click on the <strong>Delete </strong><strong>button </strong>and select <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.

<h2>            microsoft word 2016 for mac</h2>
                    I've been using Microft Word for many years. One year ago I updated my Microsoft program and found that I'd lost my ability to easily enter characters and/or symbols by hitting the Insert icon at the top of my page and seeing a long list of special characters
 to choose from. Now, after making the upgrade a year ago, I can only find an icon that says something like "ultimate symbols" (probably under a slightly different name) and then a much smaller and more limited window is displayed from which to select the symbol
 I need. When I hit "Enter" I then need to close that window, and the next time I need such a symbol in the same document I'm working on I have to go to that "Ultimate" item again and start all over. One month ago I spoke with one of your staff and was "guaranteed"
 that this problem would one solved "within 30 days," but of course nothing has happened. This change in your offerings is a bad one and needs to be fixed. PLEASE GET THIS CORRECTED! Thank you.

            <p>I previously asked this question and received an answer from Daniel G. Grau. That answer was inadequate and partially incorrect. I subsequently found out how do insert accented letter as follows:</p>
<p>1. Start with the document in which the accented letter is to be added, and be at the point where the letter is to go.</p>
<p>2. Click Control + Command + Space keys all at once.</p>
<p>3. When the next screen appears, type in the letter to be added to be added into the "search" field, using upper or lower case letter as is appropriate.</p>
<p>4. Find the letter with the appropriate accent, mark it with a single click, and then double click that letter.</p>
<p>5. This will add the desired accented letter to be added to the document in the marked place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeat as needed for further accented letters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I've been trying to obtain this information for almost an entire year and nobody at Microsoft has been able to help me until now. None of your support staff seems to know anything about this feature and it has been most frustrating, as you might recognize.
 Seven weeks ago I spoke with one of your support people who had no idea, but she promised to pass it on to your staff and "guaranteed" that the problem would be fixed "within 30 days!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for others who ask this simple and obvious question, please provide easy and accurate answers, as outlined above, and everyone will be happy! Thanks.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure why you claim Daniel's reply was "inadequate and partially incorrect"... It seems to me that the steps in your reply are exactly what he suggested: Use of the OS X
<strong>Character Viewer </strong>which also can be accessed from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu:
<strong>Edit&gt; Emoji &amp; Symbols </strong>:-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, if the concern is for inserting international characters, the easiest method is to press &amp; hold the character key, then type the number of the variant that appears or click the one you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, most international characters can be inserted by direct keystrokes, such as
<strong>Option+a </strong>followed by <strong>a</strong> to insert ā or <strong>Option+n
</strong>followed by <strong>n&nbsp;</strong>to insert <strong>ñ</strong>. This list is rather dated so some combinations may no longer work due to Apple remapping the keyboard in later version of OS X, but most still are valid:</p>

</p><p>Moreover, I believe what you referred to in your original message was the <strong>
Advanced Symbol </strong>dialog available from the <strong>Insert</strong> menu or by clicking the 𝛀 on the
<strong>Insert</strong> tab of the ribbon. That window does not have to be closed in order to continue working in the document. It can be left open as long as it's needed. Just click into the document while the window stays open: click back in the Symbol dialog
 to select another character. Also, to insert a character there is no need to press return - double-click the character to insert it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seriously doubt that the old Symbol Browser of special characters is slated to be restored due to the more sophisticated Character Viewer now provided by OS X. If you feel you can justify the need for it, don't hesitate to submit a feature request at&nbsp;<a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304942-word-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="View all ideas in Word for Mac">Word

</p><p>Finally, to clear up an apparent misconception, this is not Microsoft Support. The Community is hosted by Microsoft but the overwhelming majority of contributors are users of Office software volunteering their time &amp; experience to assist other users. I have
 no idea who you may have spoken with, but please understand that no tier 1 phone support personnel (quite probably outsourced) are in a position to "guarantee" anything, especially when it pertains to software design. If you have any comments for Microsoft,

            Well, you can't place the blame entirely on the user :-) In an effort to sell more product he industry in general has brainwashed the population with overuse of terms such as
<em>intuitive</em> &amp; <em>discoverable</em>. It's understandable that most folks get the impression that there is nothing more to learn than how to power up... everything else is expected to be controlled purely by thought processes.<br />

            <p>What I did was that I made another account with my alternate, professional E-Mail Address. (Another Outlook.com), and made that an Administrator account as well as my Primary account (Former Hotmail.com to Outlook converted address.) Then I signed into the
 alt. account, and Waited for things to install over there. I then proceeded to sign out of that alternate account, and sign back in to my primary account.</p>

<h2>            Cannot receive replies&#47;messages unless I sign out and sign back in.</h2>
                    Having problem with Skype app for Windows. I am not getting any replies/messages. I have already tried restarting laptop, re-installing Skype, used tablet but still not getting messages unless I sign out then sign back in from the app. I already contacted
 ISP and they said that internet connection is fine. Any help will be appreciated.
