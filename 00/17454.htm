<h2>            OneDrive PCs freezing when doing sync of Sharepoint folders updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a small office of 20 users. We have a number of Sharepoint Document Libraries synced to these PCs using OneDrive. We all use Office 365 Business Premium accounts. Most of our users are using Windows 10 on a variety of laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one user makes a lot of changes to one of the Document Libraries then all the other PCs start to sync these changes but then all the other PCs freeze and become unusable. We end up either having to reboot the PCs and then stop or pause OneDrive and stagger
 the syncing process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing us a big problem as no one has any confidence in OneDrive now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are we doing something wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

Hi RevealLJ,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To clarify the issue, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</p>
<p>
1. What OneDrive sync clients are you using, the new OneDrive sync client or OneDrive for Business 2016?</p>
<p>
2. Upload a full screenshot showing the version information of the OneDrive sync client you are using.</p>
<p>
3. Check if the issue happens when the users update a specific file or any file.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you are using OneDrive for Business 2016, I suggest you directly use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the new OneDrive sync client</a> to see the outcome.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you are using the new OneDrive sync client, I suggest you run C:\Users\UserAccountName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\OneDrive.exe /reset in the command prompt to reset the client and then restart it to check the outcome after you click Pause syncing.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks,</p>
<p>
Cliff</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using the latest OneDrive Sync client. Picture below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs when either a lot of files or a few big files are uploaded by one user. Everyone else starts to download the files and then all the PCs freeze and no one can do any work. This impacts everyone's PC in the office who is syncing that particular
 folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to do a OneDrive Reset on everyone's PCs as that will force everything to be downloaded again</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;Hi Lee,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the issue happens when uploading a lot of files by one user, I’d like to confirm whether the clients can work fine after removing
 the files. If yes, I suggest you upload a few files once to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the clients can’t work fine even uploading a file, you may need to reset the clients first to see if the sync can be generated and
 then upload a few files once to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is difficult for me to do any tests as everyone is busy working so I can't make any major changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before, what we see is that every PC that is syncing Folder A will freeze when a number of files are updated in that Folder and they then try to sync the changes at the same time. We can get the syncs to complete but only after rebooting the PCs,
 pausing OneDrive and then doing the syncs overnight or on one PC at a time.</p>

<p><span>Hi Lee,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, as the users are syncing the shared site library in SharePoint Online with the new OneDrive sync clients, the changes
 on the files will make other sync clients on other PCs sync changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that the sync works fine on all PCs after uploading multiple files. However, about “We can get the syncs to complete but only after
 rebooting the PCs, pausing OneDrive and then doing the syncs overnight or on one PC at a time.</span>”, I’d like you to confirm the following.</p>
<p><span>1. List the detailed reproducing steps for our troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>2. It seems that the sync clients will sync overnight after rebooting the PCs. If yes, how many PCs are affected? Does the issue happen in a
 specific computer? Can the sync be completed? If it can be completed, I suggest you do a test again to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue happens in a specific computer, I suggest you pause other clients and reset the computer to see the outcome as resetting the OneDrive
 sync client is a good way to troubleshoot the sync issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>We have a template set up which includes a logo at the top of the page and then a small 2x4 table underneath.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intermittently, when printing, the printed copy has moved the table and half the content halfway down the page, with the logo still at the top, leaving a large gap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>has anyone experienced this, or have any ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have spoken with our printer technician, who does not believe it's a printer issue. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Steve,<br />
<br />
<br />
This sounds like an issue with the printer itself but we would like to clarify a few thing here for us to check on what else we can do to help you further. Kindly answer the questions below:<br />
<br />
1. Does it happen in all the documents that you're trying to print out?<br />
2. Have you tried to checking it on the print preview? How does it look like?<br />
3. Can you send us a screenshot of the print preview?<br />
<br />
Regards.

            Hi Lance,<br />
<br />
Good to know that the issue is resolved. Here I’d like to write a summary:<br />
<br />
=================<br />
<br />
<br />
You can’t access your OneDrive for Business. Error message is “Sorry, you don't have access to this page”.<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue is caused by a PUID mismatch between the user account (lh***s@ym***s.org) and SharePoint Online user profile data. Below are the scenarios.<br />
<br />
a. A deleted user is re-created with the exact same account name.<br />
<br />
b. A user is synced from Active Directory organizational unit (OU) and then moved to a different OU and resynced with SharePoint Online.<br />
<br />
The above will allow the user to access the SharePoint Online site collection with an incorrect PUID.<br />
<br />
More information can be found from the Scenario 2 under the INTRODUCTION section in the article below:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3026385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to remove users from SharePoint Online</a><br />
<br />
<br />
We have deployed a fix to make sure all the data is matched.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not recommended to delete and re-create a user with the same user principal name, or move the directory synced user to a different OU.<br />
<br />
=================<br />
<br />
If you have any other questions, please feel free to post a new thread, and we will continue to assist you from there.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Spike

    <title>move section navigation to top - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yh_2017  say:</h3>
<h2>            move section navigation to top</h2>
                    How can I put the section navigation bar on top, page bar on right instead of left in the version 16.2? I use the ipad pro. I couldn't change back to the old version of the onenote. Unclick the "" Enable experiment feature" doesn't work. I tried the new
 navigation layout, but I need to change the sections to look for materials frequently. So I really need the section navigation on top. If any of you know how to download the old version, please let me know. Thank you very much.

            Normally that would not be a problem. <br />
Make sure you use ActiveSync for the computer that runs Windows XP and Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC) for the computer that runs Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
Please before syncing with the netbook make a proper backup, than you're absolutely sure no data will be lost.

option<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdncache-a.akamaihd.net%2fitems%2fit%2fimg%2farrow-10x10.png" height="10" width="10" />&nbsp;to
 change the data through the field list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or Can you delete check boxes in the field list that you don't want someone to open or that are not in use for that particular pivot table. Sometimes the information is confidential and you don't want someone who knows pivot tables to look at something they
 are not supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a link that I have posted in another question but can be used in this example.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">http://1drv.ms/1zkUEO8</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in the field list on the right there are so many empty boxes. I want to delete them.</p>
<p>

            <p>If you add the table that the PivotTable is based off of to the data model, then you can define which columns are visible to the users such as described in this Microsoft Support Article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Hide-columns-and-tables-in-Power-Pivot-ddf5b1f2-2ed2-4bdb-8f78-6f94503ca87a?CorrelationId=58e7808d-f127-47fd-8980-d576c5854f1d&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US﻿" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hide Columns and Tables in Power Pivot</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This would get rid of the extra noisy checkboxes/columns in the field list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would not prevent the user from accessing the field list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I know of doing that is to click Protect Sheets, then Protect Workbook.&nbsp; Your user would lose the option to interact with the workbook by taking that measure however.</p>

    <title>Disappearing&#47;duplicating contacts in Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> falgorin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disappearing&#47;duplicating contacts in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Each day I am having to battle with contacts that mysteriously disappear and others that duplicate existing ones and have no idea how to prevent it. The daily solution is to delete all contacts in Outlook.com then import a .csv download from my Personal
 folder (luckily this one never changes)&nbsp;in Outlook which temporarily fixes part of the problem, the second part are the resulting errors in my Outlook/Outlook folder and on my Windows 8 phone. Usually I delete all contacts in both, sync the phone whilst the
 Outlook folder is correct then delete all contacts in the Outlook/Outlook folder and copy them across from the Outlook/Personal folder at which point everything is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;few hours later the various files start to corrupt as contacts disappear whilst others get duplicated, even when my PC is turned off so I guess it ain't that, yet my phone drops dozens of contacts which when I am out and about and want to call someone
 and their details have gone missing is excruciatingly annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me make one final point, everything was fine when I was running Windows 7 Ultimate, it's only since I upgraded to Windows 10 that this has all started. Any ideas anyone?</p>

            <p>Hi and thank you for your speedy response, however, I'm afraid this doesn't seem to be the answer. I did my usual clean-up by following your suggestion of running Explorer without addons, deleted ALL contacts from Outlook.com and uploaded a clean .csv file
 with the correct ones. This worked well and I could check that the number of contacts was correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then deleted ALL contacts from my Outlook folder in Outlook and copied across the correct ones from my Personal folder, again everything matched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem immediately occurred when the moment I did a send/receive in Outlook all my contacts in the Outlook folder were duplicated, luckily those in my Personal folder were left untouched. Likewise, my Windows phone contacts on this occasion remained
 correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Returning to Outlook.com still using Explorer without addons I find that I already have 1 duplicate entry. Continued use of either Outlook or my Windows phone seems to generate further duplicates or I start to find that entries have been deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my original post, this all started to happen post Windows 10 upgrade, my Windows 7 Ultimate gave me no such problems. My upgrade to Win10 was very smooth, I did have to uninstall 1 incompatible piece of software which the pre-installer found
 but that apart everything else is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the time that I have been writing this every contact in my Outlook folder has again been duplicated. Very, very frustrating.</p>

            What do you mean by "in an editing capacity"?<br />
<br />
If you mean that people who receive the email can open the resume in word and make changes in it, that's exactly what's supposed to happen with a Word document. If you don't want people to change it, send it as a PDF file instead.<br />
<br />
To send a PDF file, open the Word document in Word, click File, click Share in the left column, then click Email, and click the Send As PDF button.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The initial upgrade to Windows 10 can be initiated via use of the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>Initially Windows 10 must be installed as an Upgrade over your existing Windows 7/8.1 or Insider Preview.</p>
<p>Your device will be registered as a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Windows 10 Device</em><span>&nbsp;</span>during the initial upgrade from Windows Update. Essentially its hardware profile will be submitted to a Microsoft Product Activation Server.*</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Failure to perform an initial upgrade will&nbsp;result in an unactivated Windows 10 Installation.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>* Attempted direct Clean Install will lead to an unactivated install because the system isn’t verified as a Windows 10 Device. You will need to Reinstall your Base Windows License, update it and perform the Upgrade via Windows Update. In other words direct<span>&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Clean
 Installation</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span>of Windows 10 won’t work but the<span>&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Initial Upgrade</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span>via Windows Update and a<span>&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Clean Reinstallation<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></em>of Windows 10 will
 work. Initially I named my website DellWindowsReinstallationGuide as it was based on a Dell Windows Reinstallation DVD but the name is&nbsp;well suited to the procedure necessary to get a<span>&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Clean Reinstallation</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span>for&nbsp;Windows
 10. Clean Reinstallation = Clean Installation with Product Activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will provide some information about the&nbsp;previous licensing scheme and the ability or restriction of downloading installation media. I will also provide pitfalls with each licensing scheme that users will encounter with the likely possible scenarios...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1. Windows 8.1 OEM</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For a new UEFI/SecureBoot BIOS. Windows 8.1 product keys are embedded within the BIOS. A utility like RWEverything can be utilised to read them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;will take advantage of the fact that Windows 8.1 as BIOS embedded SLP keys and make them interchangeable with Windows 10 media...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they done this and&nbsp;provided a&nbsp;direct link to a .iso&nbsp;this would facilitate moving from Windows 8.1 to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft do not provide a means of upgrading this way, users who purchased a system with Windows 8.1 with Bing or Windows 8.1 Single Language with Bing and do not have recovery media will be left in a situation where it is impossible for them to utilise
 the free upgrade as the Windows Media Creation Tool does not accommodate these editions:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a>
</p>
<p>It is also a waste of time, money&nbsp;and effort to purchase reinstallation media to&nbsp;reinstall an old operating system in order to migrate to a new one. Especially when Windows installation media can detect that there was a genuine key in the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Solution: Install the Windows 10 Insider with a Microsoft Account to get a free upgrade to Windows 10 RTM. Microsoft are not allowing new Windows 10 Insider Devices as RTM is being released.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2. Windows 7 OEM</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 OEM on the other hand utilises a generic OEM SLP key and cert file, input from the installation media. There are markers present in the BIOS for "Windows 7" however there is no unique product&nbsp;key residing&nbsp;in the BIOS. Moreover these markers do
 not have any distinguishability on Windows 7 OEM&nbsp;Edition. e.g. a Dell Windows 7 Home Premium Reinstallation DVD will install and activate on a system which came with Windows 7 Professional. The user will be incorrectly licensed&nbsp;but it'll work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their license depends on the&nbsp;COA affixed to the system however&nbsp;many/most COAs fade and users&nbsp;cannot get help from Microsoft or the OEM for recovering a faded COA. Therefore if the key on the COA must be used, many users will be stuck without help from the
 OEM or Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand if a utility is required which detects the previous install. Users&nbsp;who went&nbsp;from Windows 7&nbsp;→ Windows 10 Technical Preview would likely have&nbsp;to Reinstall their Operating system in order to prove they had an original Windows OS. However it
 may be impossible for users who didn't backup their installations in advance using the OEM utility such as Dell Backup and Recovery, have a faded COA and don't have Windows 7 Installation media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible Microsoft will have a utility that certifies that their BIOS was Windows 7 compliant (had the Windows 7 SLP markers) and then provides them with a new product key, as mentioned there is no distinguishability on Edition; would a user with a
 Windows 7 Starter License get the same Edition as a user with a Windows 7 Ultimate license?&nbsp;Likewise for Windows 8.1 it&nbsp;is also a waste of time, money&nbsp;and effort to purchase reinstallation media to&nbsp;reinstall an old operating system in order to migrate to a
 new one. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Solution: </em></strong><strong><em>Install the Windows 10 Insider with a Microsoft Account to get a free upgrade to Windows 10 RTM.
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Microsoft are not allowing new Windows 10 Insider Devices as RTM is being released.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3. Windows 8.1 Retail</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 Retail has the Media Creation Tool which works well for all Retail versions:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An installer which prompt users to input their retail Windows 8.1 product key and issues them with a new Windows 10 product key would work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be better if&nbsp;the keys were made interchangeable (in a similar argument to the OEM license).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>No current issues with Windows 8.1 Retail.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">4. Windows 7 Retail</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's deployment for Windows 7 Retail has needed work. There&nbsp;are the Digital River .isos which worked well for almost all cases but omitted some languages. These were never listed as download links on an official Microsoft website however and had to
 be found manually and listed&nbsp;by Jan krohn:</p>

</p>
<p>Now there is&nbsp;a new utility:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery</span></a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This new utility however has failed our preliminary tests on the Dell Community Forums:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/virus-spyware/f/3522/p/19615454/20720047#20720047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/virus-spyware/f/3522/p/19615454/20720047#20720047</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not accept some retail keys from Amazon or from&nbsp;student discounted retail&nbsp;versions&nbsp;like software4students. If such a utility is used to issue the free Windows 10 Upgrade then many users will be misinformed about the free upgrade as it doesn't work
 in the bulk of cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Ignore the lack of Digital River .isos and the Microsoft Software Recovery Tool.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Solution: </em></strong><strong><em>Install the Windows 10 Insider with a Microsoft Account to get a free upgrade to Windows 10 RTM.
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Microsoft are not allowing new Windows 10 Insider Devices as RTM is being released.</em></strong></p>

<p>There has been no statement for product keys, how they will be issued and&nbsp;whether they be linked to a Microsoft Account for future clean installation with&nbsp;the .iso. This is particularly important after the first year upgrade as otherwise almost everyone
 will lose their product key. Microsoft could make the key one use only or&nbsp;remove the .iso and force users to pay for a new product key or/and a download link for reinstallation (its unlikely they would do this but due to the broken Microsoft Software Recovery

<p>
</p><p>There is still the issue that the Windows 7&nbsp;Digital River .isos have been removed and repalced with the non-functional Microsoft Software Recovery Tool at least 6 months too early and users are feeling forced to install Windows 10 Insider in hope that Microsoft
 still deems their system as eligible for a free upgrade because they don't have a working Windows 7 recovery partition or Windows 7 installation media. These users concerns are still unanswered and there is also the number of users who will attempt the upgrade
 break their recovery partition and end up with an unbootable installation and essentially be in the same scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been rumours about Windows 10 being free for Windows 10 Insiders to combat this however there has been BBC news articles stating it'll be free for&nbsp;pirates also. Again I'm skeptical.

<p>absolutely pointless when one wants to transfer the license to a NON test machine or VM .....</p>
<p>We have all (MOSTLY) used non final machines - we need a private full key for 10 Pro for ANY machine we chose to install it one. Without that - the Insider program is utterly pointless and degrading to users.</p>

<p>well, since Windows Vista, MS allows interchangeable licenses between the two architectures of the same version and edition of windows. Even i had a Windows Ultimate original Dvd, but it was 32 bit, i used the same key with an equivalent MSDN copy of Windows
 Ultimate 64 bit(downloaded iso), and it got activated successfully and automatically without any flaws. But if you have no idea, whether the key provided to you was a MAK key or just Single time use key, in that case its better to take a backup of your license
 activation using "Microsoft Toolkit" or "Advanced Token's Manager" softwares. (Both have not been developed for Windows 10 as of now, but are expected to be released by the end of August).</p>

    <title>Upon hitting &#34;Save&#34; for encrypted OneDrive document, Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trilobite53  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upon hitting &#34;Save&#34; for encrypted OneDrive document, Word 2016 instead opens &#34;Save As&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a new problem with Word and OneDrive.</p>
<p>Today I was editing an encrypted Word document (Password-protected) that is located in my PC's OneDrive folder. But when going to "Save" my work, instead of uploading to OneDrive as expected, Word opens the "SaveAs" dialog box. The default folder in the
 dialog box is the corresponding folder on the actual OneDrive server (http:// web address), NOT the local OneDrive folder on my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem occurs only with encrypted Word files located in my local OneDrive folder (not the OneDrive server)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In actuality, after the encrypted file is opened, I can execute one "Save" which successfully saves the document to my local OneDrive folder. The little "Uploading to OneDrive" window displays on the taskbar. But all subsequent "Save" commands do not execute,
 and are followed by the "Save As" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can place the same file in another folder on my hard drive and save without any problem. But when opening from my OneDrive folder, the problem occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove the password protection from the file, it then saves to my OneDrive folder as expected. But when the password protection is restored, the problem comes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed this problem with new files created in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a full repair of Office 365 and run a system file check (sfc /scannow). No improvement. My Windows 10 Pro 64 is fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Office and OneDrive together since OneDrive first was released, and I have never had this problem before. The files I work with absolutely need to be password protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?</p>
<p>Fixes?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>Word files that are password protected <strong>cannot</strong> be viewed or edited in a browser window, including Word Online. And to open and edit an encrypted Word file, you need to
<strong>download</strong> it to your local PC and open it with <strong>Microsoft Word</strong>.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding. But with all due respect, your reply utterly fails to acknowledge or address the problem that I have articulated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else out there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working with encrypted Office and SkyDrive / OneDrive since the inception. Using OneDrive with Office 2007, Office 2010 and Office 365. Never had any problems opening, editing and saving Office files in my OneDrive folders ... until yesterday.</p>

</p><p>My desktop PC at work has Office 2010. As an experiment, I opened the same encrypted Word files in that desktop's OneDrive folder -- the same encrypted files that I couldn't save last night. I was able to edit and save normally, as I have done for many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the problem does not appear with Office 2010 but DOES appear with Office 2016 (confirmed again today), I am led to hypothesize that the save problem is because of errors in Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am right, I hope that the Office team will quickly fix this problem.</p>

            <p>Talking to myself here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that if I convert a Word 2016 *.docx file to the earlier Word 97-2003 *.doc file format -- using the "Save As" action in Word -- Then I can repeatedly "Save" the encryped file to OneDrive normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then after converting the file back to *.docx, I lose my "Save" funtionality and the "Save As" problem returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it looks like it is a Word problem related to the Word *.docx file format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could maybe ONE of the thousands of engineers at Microsoft, kinda, sorta take a look at this weasily and annoying bug? PLEASE!</p>

            <p>I'm having exactly the same problem. So I feel your pain. I have spent over an hour on the Microsoft chat help, with two different "support staff" who are failing to acknowledge there is an issue. I was told "so don't save the document with a password to
 OneDrive". But I have a password-protected document that I edit every day and I have been doing this for the past 8 months or more and never had this issue before. One of the updates that Microsoft have released during September for either OneDrive or Office
 365 (Word 2016) has caused this. It is a change in behaviour for the product but they refuse to acknowledge it. I proved it to the chat support assistant that it was only&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">encrypted Word documents (Password-protected)
 located on my PC's OneDrive folder. I opened a new document. Saved it as a .docx requiring a password to open. Typed a few words. Hit Ctrl+S, and it "saves" the document. Type a few more lines, hit Ctrl+S and Word opens the "Save As" dialogue box.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I asked the support assistants to please report the behaviour change/issue with the developers, but they didn't seem to regard it as an issue.</p>
<p>The Ctrl+S Save was working fine for me when I went away on holiday on the 9th of September and when I got back on the 24th of September the problem started manifesting itself.</p>
<p>If any Microsoft technicians are interested, they can review my Microsoft Answer Desk case number in this regard -&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">SRX1357356585ID.</span>&nbsp;All of the details of what I went through with the support assistants
 are there.</p>
<p>And for the record, a&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">full repair of Office 365 and a registry reset for Word do not resolve the problem.</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2013 - Rules don&#39;t run from cell phone</h2>
                    <p>We recently upgraded to Outlook 2013.&nbsp; Before we had 2010 and I have 2 email accounts configured.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have my primary account, and another account I use for work only requests.&nbsp; Both are listed in my profile as separate email accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my phone I have the ability to only see 1 exchange account, so in order for me to see email that is going to my work account, I created a folder under my Inbox in the main account and created a rule under my Work Account that will "move a copy of message"
 to that folder.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked perfectly.&nbsp; My cell was able to see any new messages coming in to that account simply by just being able to view that folder I created.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Outlook 2013 doesn't work the same.&nbsp; I have the rule running, and it works fine as long as I have my Outlook on the computer running.&nbsp; When I don't and I do not get new messages on the new folder when looking at it from my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means, the rule does not run or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something new or different I need to do in order to view new messages on the other account I have?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

            <p><span>Hi Mike,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Generally this issue occurs if the rule created in Outlook 2013 is a client side rule and not a server based rule.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also refer to the section ‘Server-based rules versus client-only rules’ in the following link and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-HA102749402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-HA102749402.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For information on how to setup a Server based rule in Outlook, I would recommend you to post your query in the Exchange Forum for better results.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Server and client side rules is what I don't seem to grasp.&nbsp; According to how I read the definition on your link, I think my rules should run on the server. I just can't tell by looking at them.. there is no checkbox saying, run this on the server.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This rule is created on the alternate email Inbox and it works as it should.&nbsp; For every email that is delivered to that inbox (email address), I want a copy moved to a folder I setup under&nbsp;my Personal Inbox.&nbsp; It works just as it should as long as I have
 Outlook opened.&nbsp; I don't know how to make it work when I open my phone and go to that folder.&nbsp; It used to work in Outlook 2010.&nbsp; Here is the rule:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply this rule after message arrives</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; move a copy to the&nbsp;<em>&lt;foldername under my personal inbox&gt;</em>&nbsp;folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I need to do.. that is, to move a copy to that folder....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I am going about this the wrong way...&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help on this is greatly appreciated...&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Can not see all the contacts&#40;in the phone 6230&#41; from contacts folder on PC</h2>
                    hi,<br />
I am having difficulty seeing contacts (in the phone) from contacts folder in Nokia Browser on PC.<br />
<br />
I have more than 200 contacts saved on my Nokia 6230 phone which I want to see from PC, update them and then transfer to my new phone Nokia 6680. But I am able to see only 3 contacts from Nokia Browser on PC.<br />
Same thing is happening when I sync my contacts with Microsoft Outlook, it is transferring only these 3 contacts from phone to Outlook.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhelp on how to see all the contacts from Nokia 6230 and sync with Microsoft Outlook will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

            With Microsoft Outlook sync you can try to open PC Sync, select settings and create new settings. That should set the PC Sync to run the sync successfully

            hi Visionary/All,<br />
I tried putting new sync settings as well but still it is able to transfer only 3 contacts to Microsoft Outlook.<br />
<br />
Could you guide us in more detail? I am sure there are lot of other users who are facing the same issue and it would be quite helpful to them as well.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

            I will give you advice that may sounds really weird but I have seen it work:<br />
Open your outlook and add new contacts to your contacts folder, you need to add say 100 new contacts so add something that is easy to delete then afterwards like : a with number 1, aa with nr 1, aaa with nr 1 and so on, make sure you have those dummy contacts
 say all in "a"-something so that it will be then easier to delete those afterwards.<br />
<br />
Once you have added say the 100 new contacts to Outlook, then connect the phone and select settings, create new settings and run the whole wizard through and then press sync and see what happens.<br />
<br />
If everything gets syncronised to both phone and Outlook, then go to Outlook again, this time delete all the dummy contacts you made and sync again (it should delete the dummy ones from phone too)<br />
<br />
Let me know if this helped :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
And by the way, I hope you have the newest PC Suite in use (6.80.22) from www.nokia.com/pcsuite

            it is the latest version: 6.81.130<br />
What happened yesterday is that if I added a new contact to my phone (only phone memory) and this contact is now visible in my PC Suite. It is really a pity because in the previous PC Suite version, which was delivered with the phone, everything went well.
 Now I have a big problem because I have more then 300 contacts stored in my mobile (incl. Fax, office nb, email, street adress etc). I hope you can help me with this problem.<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

            I have a very similar problem on my 6230, but I can't see any contacts at all on the PC. I have removed, refreshed, downloaded latest version, etc., but I still can't save contacts to PC file. Why can't Nokia software work as Panasonic's does. I have just
 bought their latest Dect phone and I can save, edit etc. via USB with no problem at all.

<h2>            Help&#33; Can&#39;t connect to internet via WLAN</h2>
                    I can't seem to connect to the internet via WLAN using my Nokia N95. I've defined my access point, entered my WEP key, but when I got to "start web browsing" I get the error message "Unable to connect. WLAN network not found."<br />
<br />
Any ideas??<br />
<br />

            Have you ever connected to any other wlan before? If you have then this rules out a possible problem with your phone.<br />
<br />
Apart from just entering the WEP key, you will also have to go into the WLAN security settings and set the WEP key settings to match those on your router. eg. WEP encryption 64 or 128 bit, WEP key format Hex or ASCII etc.<br />
<br />
Also you could try disabling the security on your wlan and see if you can connect. This would tell you that your phone is fine and the problem is probably with one of the security settings.

            Yeah, thanks for the reply but tried all that. Set to 128 bit, entered WEP key etc, then went to WLAN wizard and it shows 1 network availible. When I then click on "options" and "start web browsing" it says "connecting via BTHub... blah, blah" and then
 gives me the same error message.<br />
<br />
I know the router's fine as I have two laptops and a PS3 using it - one which I only hooked up to it a couple of days ago. I have never been able to connect via WiFi from my N95 -- must be a duff phone?!?

            Well if you cannot connect to open unsecured wlan then you probably have a problem with the phone.
