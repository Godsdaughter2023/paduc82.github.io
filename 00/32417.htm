<h2>            Surface Book 2 - Overheating Problem</h2>
                    I have recently bought a Surface Book 2 and I've been having a problem with overheating. Whenever I try to charge the laptop while it's turned on, it quickly overheats and the fan turns on too. I do not have a problem charging it when it's off. The problem
 seems to occur only when it is charging/on .

<h2>            Sound&#47;Audio Crackling and Warping&#47;Distorting - Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Due to the flexibility of the nature of this issue, I felt need to ask this question of my own rather than review problems and solutions of other people's similar questions. I came to this decision because every machine seems to have one major difference
 or another which need/won't apply to my own machine.</p>
<p>My system is running Windows 7 64 Bit Ultimate Edition (Provided by MSDN) and the question I have today asks as to how to deal with a nuisance of an issue; the audio crackling and distortion issue. Many claim that one needs to download/update the latest
 drivers for the sound card/Windows version of the driver, but as many have already seen, this answer is far from what one would call a panacea to this issue. I'm unable to set my audio quality above 16 bit / 32000 Hz output. Anything above that, say 16 bit
 / 44100 Hz and up, I hear this irritating popping noise from my speakers, as though I were listening to an ancient piece of vinyl with a dirty needle. Over a short period of time, the audio becomes very distressed and busy, even warping in pitch, tone, and
 synchronization with the PC's activity itself. I've checked all my hardware and even went so far as to purchase a new set of speakers, believing perhaps the source was my old speakers, circa 1998. Alas, that was a fruitless expense. Though nice they are, they
 don't fix the issue at hand. I've spent days on and off, trying to research this issue to see if I can find any answers or similarities to my problems.</p>
<p>The oft thing is, my system was running fine the previous install of Windows 7. I was able to enjoy HD level audio at 24 Bit / 192000 Hz. It was only up until a Windows update that I performed on my<em>previous</em> install of Windows did this problem air
 shortly before the hard drive it was installed on had a sudden, fatal hard disk failure, completely dying out to the point where BOOTMGR was corrupt/damaged. It has persisted on into the next installation of Windows on a different hard drive altogether and
 I've completely had no luck in finding even the slightest clue as to how, why, and what this all came to be or how to fix it. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>My system specs are as follow.</p>
<p>ASUS P5N-T Deluxe motherboard<br />
Intel Quad Core 2 Duo Q8200 (2.33 GHz)<br />
8 GB -DDR2 RAM<br />
300 GB Seagate "Barracuda" SATA Hard Drive (Boot Device)<br />
NVidia 460 GTX (1 GB DDR5 VRAM - Drivers Updated: 01-21-11)<br />
All Drivers Signed And Updated 01-24-11</p>
<p>If there's any additional information needed, please ask away. I paid 800 dollars for the entirety of the machine, parts, and software, so I'd like to get my money's worth by enjoying the HD audio I worked for. Thanks.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall all the traces of the sound component from your computer and then restart the computer. Allow windows to check for the necessary drivers

            Hi Axel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.

<br />	If the rotation lock is off or does not appear, you must turn it to vertical mode. After rotating your laptop, you should be able to click again on the rotation lock. If your device does not &amp; so; If you switch to vertical mode automatically,
<br />
<br />	You may have to change manually by following these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Go to Search and enter Settings
<br />
<br />2. Open Settings and go to System&gt; Monitor
<br />
<br />3. Find Orientation and choose Portrait from the menu.
<br />
<br />4. Your device should automatically switch to vertical mode.
<br />
<br />	Use your laptop in-store mode:
<br />
<br />1. Put your device in-store mode.
<br />
<br />2. Click on the Action Center icon in your Task Bar and the Rotation Lock will be available. Now you can disable the rotation lock and your screen should rotate to the correct position.
<br />

<br />
<br /> 2. When the Activity Center opens, click on Tablet Mode.
<br />
<br />	Uninstall and update your display drivers:

<br /> 
<br />3. Right-click on the driver and choose Uninstall.
<br /> 
<br />4. After you have uninstalled the driver, restart your device.
<br />
<br />       If the problem persists, you may need to update your display adapters. To do that, 
<br />
<br />       follow these steps:
<br />

<br />

<br />Please explain this in more detail, where is the address currently and where do you want to save that to?

<br />What Email program do you use or do you access Email through a web browser?
<br />
<br />Whatever application you are in right now, if your right click the Email address do you get 'Copy Link Address'?

<h2>            Recore Achievement progress stuck &#40;various&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm about a third of the way through Recore and a number of cumulative achievements (extract 100 cores, dig up 10 items with k-9 frame etc) are now stuck , and will not increase as I'm playing through the game. I have tried deleting my local save and
 syncing, and the other way around, which does nothing. I've started a new game , again nothing . At least one other player has posted the same issue over on XboxAchievements. Does anyone have a fix for this ? Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Why would you risk these things just for win-10 upgrade</p>
<p>Luckily you got the error</p>
<p>I may have misjudged M$ error reporting it is working very good :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get your priorities straightened out</p>
<p>1st should be to buy another 1tb Western digital Black hdd (really need 2)</p>
<p>2nd would be to create a full system image with Macrium free onto it,</p>

<p>
</p><p>3rd would be to copy and paste all of your personal files on yet another partition on the 1tb new hdd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all of that clean all your personal data off the existing hdd</p>
<p>Then you can upgrade if you wish but you actually need a larger hdd you have out grown the existing one :)</p>

Hey there.<br />
<br />
<span><span>I'll be honest</span> <span>and</span> <span>say</span> <span>that I</span>
<span>do not know</span> <span>if it's possible</span> <span>getting</span> <span>
Microsft</span> <span>to give</span> <span>the game files</span><span>. I'm not sure
</span></span><span><span>it's possible to</span> <span>get them through</span> <span>
Microsoft</span> <span>because I do not</span> <span>think they have</span> <span>
the files</span> <span>anywhere.<br />
</span></span><span><span>I tried searching</span> <span>around on</span> <span>the various</span>
<span>Microsoft</span> <span>website</span> <span>hoping to</span> <span>find</span>
<span>an email or</span> <span>a phone number for</span> <span>you, but</span> <span>
unfortunately</span> <span>I have not found</span> <span>anything.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><span>So</span> <span>I suggest</span> <span>you to do</span>
<span>one of the things</span> <span>I suggested</span> <span>you earlier</span><span>.</span>
<span>Otherwise</span> <span>I can</span> <span>not help</span> <span>you anymore,</span>
<span>unfortunately.</span> <span>I</span> <span>would</span> <span>if I could,</span>
<span>but</span> <span>am not sure</span> <span>what else you</span> <span>can do.</span></span><br />

    <title>Unable to Factory Reset SP3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firemedicmcse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Factory Reset SP3</h2>
                    <p>I got 2 Surface Pro 3's from state surplus. Drives have been wiped clean (obviously) and have no recovery partition. I downloaded the recovery image for both windows 8.1 and windows 10. I boot into it successfully, chose my language, and go to troubleshoot,
 reset my computer. Once there I get an error that a required partition is missing. I have went into diskpart and did a clean, rebooted, same error. Went back to diskpart, created partitions similar to those on another SP3 and still get same error. This is
 getting very frustrating. I have also gotten a drive is locked error on previous attempts. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and Merry Christmas</p>
<p>

<p>Hello i need to change my region from US to EU (UK) . I do not live into US but i get all the time thrown against opponets from US couse my account says i'm from US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BUT i do not live in US i live in EU and i wan't my account changed to UK. I talked to someone from support.. They said it coudn't be done but i am sure it is possible. &nbsp;(I think it would be totaly retarded not to be able to change your country since people
 move from country to country all the time.)</p>

<p>So what am i tellin you is to change my account FROM US to UK. This is an imperative statement not a question and a bargain,. I curenlty live in EU and i want to play in EU region. Thank you and have a &nbsp;nice day</p>

<p>as with everyone</p>
<p>MS and other online retailers must abide by international laws on content distibution and copyright not to mention online billing laws</p>
<p>this does include psn and wii and WoW and your regional content providers like skytv or netflix</p>
<p>ask any online service like sky if you can change your region&nbsp; you can have different region netflix but you need to create it at the appropiate website you cannot use US netflix in UK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the answer will be no you need to create an new account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>content laws and distibution rights do prevent content from being imported into other regions</p>

<p>You CAN NOT Change your XBL account once set up from one region to another.. &nbsp; &nbsp;If the account was set up in USA, you need to purchase GOLD and Microsoft Points from a US seller as they are now region locked., you can continue to use your console in EU on
 a US set up account but you are unable to DOWNLOAD paid content while your console is using an EU IP address.. &nbsp; &nbsp; I am an Australian, i moved to Sweden, i speak english to Swede's as every swede speaks english, i dont know swedish, yet i am forced to have
 Swedish in my XBOX account etc.. with no options to change it.. &nbsp; i cant change my settings without getting help with the language. &nbsp; Regards your comment you mentioned your playing US players, as far as i am aware game matching is first matched to regions
 first, so other EU players, then may need to use other locations depending on players available. This is also the reason to help prevent delay and lag in game play</p>

                    When I got onto my computer, Skype asked me to sign in. So I clicked sign in through Facebook like I always do, but it told me I could not. I went to the page where it told me how to fix it, but the information was not clear. All I want is to get onto
 my Skype account.

<h2>            not able to open zipped and compressed files using windows 10</h2>
                    <p>up until just a few days ago I was able to open zipped/compressed files just by right clicking on them and clicking extract files.&nbsp; Now I just constantly a pop up saying "Cannot Complete the compressed (zipped) folders extraction wizard.&nbsp; and that the compressed

<p>
</p><p>What could have happened all of a sudden to make it impossible for me to open them</p>

            Hi TL.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you using a zip utility or depending upon File Explorer to extract files.  If you have a utility installed for this I'd uninstall it and try File Explorer Extract Files which works well.
<br />
<br />I also use 7Zip which is reliable and quite popular.  It is also the best way to create passworded archives.  
<br />
<br />If this is FIle Explorer then Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it may remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

            What is the default App set for the file type .zip at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps &gt; Choose Default by File type?   Try setting 7Zip there to make sure it gets tried.  
<br />
<br />Next go into 7Zip File Manager in Apps list, try opening a zip file to see what happens.  
<br />
<br />Complete all other steps and report back all results.

    <title>Turtle Beach PX5 Presets&#47;Suggestions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattks&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turtle Beach PX5 Presets&#47;Suggestions</h2>
                    
<p><b>So after trying to resist the temptations, I picked up the TB PX5's today, and wow.&nbsp; I've previously owned Turtle Beach X31's, Tritton AX720's, and most recently the Astro A40's, and I can safely say that the PX5's blow all of those out of the water.&nbsp;
 The offering of 7.1 (although the most I'll normally get is 5.1) surround sound, the ability to pair a device via Bluetooth while gaming (double tap Bluetooth button on headset to initiate voice dialing via paired mobile phone = insane on a gaming headset),
 and the ridiculous amount of optional audio customization makes this the new bar for high quality gaming headsets, and that's without mentioning the sleek appearance and the fact that it's wireless.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Enough with that mini-review.&nbsp; I'm actually looking for suggestions for editing the audio settings.&nbsp; I've paired the headset to the PX5 Audio Editor software, and tweaked a few settings for Black Ops while running through a private match, but I'm not
 entirely clear on what each setting actually does.&nbsp; The stock presets aren't horrible, but none of them have the game/voice/audio combination that I'm looking for.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>With that said, if anyone has some suggestions, or would even like to share your Master Preset .xml with me, let me know.<br />
</b></p>

<p>I messed a bit with the presets. It seems as if the guide on the website is outdated, mostly referring to the Preset Manager rather than the new Advance Sound Editor (which replaced PM). I found some of the presets to work (namely the master presets, but
 game/chat/mic ones do not even appear, if you know something I don't please tell me!). I started with Bass+Treble boost, then brought the mids up a bit and even out the blast cap and tweaked the thresholds a bit. Really you have to just fiddle with it to see
 what each knob does. I found this to be best for my games (mainly Gears of War, and other shooters). You may prefer higher trebles, or mids, or basses. Just mess with it.</p>
<p>The mic mods are fun, but my friends all say its too hard to hear me. I didn't want to bother messing with it too much while playing, but I'm sure you can come in crystal clear if you adjust thresholds as you adjust pitch.</p>
<p>My chat is default with some volumes and threshold turned up a bit so I can always hear people when the game gets loud. Start with game sound then do chat. Mic I would always leave as standard unless you want to disguise your voice.</p>

<p>Please can you send me the master preset for Black ops, i just went from x11's to Px5's yesterday and with the presets i have i have to say that the x11 sound was much better but this is probably just because i havent played around with the different settings
 enough. </p>

<p>Hey MaTtKs, if you get a moment i would really appreciate if you sent me the link to the blops preset. Also I went from x11 to the px5's and even though i haven't optimized the presets, i am still finding the sound quality to be superior. but this may also
 be due to the upgrade from component to optical audio. if you aren't using the correct, and optimized connection setup, you aren't getting the best sound quality that your device is putting out. one final note, i have a kind of interesting story on how i attained
 my headset. message me if you care to hear it. </p>

<h2>            Win 10 Version 1709 Upgrade always fails at 82&#37; - but tries to install again and again</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am getting frusting with Windows 10. The automatic update downloads Version 1709 almost every day (the record so far: 3 times on the 20th when the pc was running the whole day) und tries to install it, but always stucks at 82 per cent. When I force a restart,
 it recovers the current version, which is 1607. I cannot prevent the install/update process. So my computer is blocked by the update about two hours every day and uses internet data like 5GB per day.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bdffd03-3838-4ed1-b891-08e92afce87e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bdffd03-3838-4ed1-b891-08e92afce87e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For me there are two possible option: Either find a solution to install 1709 or block the automatic update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I couldn't find a way to install 1709 (I tried several solutions posted online), I focused on blocking the windows update. Unfortunately, I failed too, as Microsoft doesn't allow to deactivate updates. I uninstalled the Windows Upgrade Assistant several
 times, but it comes back again and again. I also tried wushowhide, but the Upgrade Assistant ignores hidden updates (currently hidden are KB4023057 and 1709). I switched to Windows 10 Pro, but the defer upgrade option does not prevent to Upgrade Assistant
 everyday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It feels like beeing <strong>Prometheus</strong>, as Microsoft forces me to download and install an broken update, from which I know, that it is not working</p>

<div>Hi, I had the same problem as you with the computer freezing at 81%. My computer is over 7 years old. After some thread searching I found this:<br />
Quote:<br />
I was having a similar problem, and after multiple attempts (over 7 times) trying different solutions like disabling virus protection, disabling startup programs, running update database corruption repair, etc. My computer never got past 81% before freezing
 and not updating.</div>
<div>I stumbled across a forum talking about problems with&nbsp; Anatel&nbsp; PCI-E Wlan cards (wi-fi) and old drivers that would hang up their computers and after removing the card (not just disabling) their machines would update and run fine. Since I was running my
 machine through an Ethernet connection, connected to an access point, I could remove the Anatel card in my computer and still have an internet connection. I tried it, and my computer a Gateway FX6860 updated to Windows 10 Fall Creators version without any
 problems. </div>
<div>Check to see if you have an Anatel wifi card and remove it and replace it with something newer or an Ethernet or usb connection to the internet and try the update. this worked for me."</div>
<div>I took out the Anatel wi-fi card and tried the upload again. IT WORKED</div>

    <title>Lost game progress after resetting Xbox One even though achievements - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost game progress after resetting Xbox One even though achievements show that I have progressed in-game.</h2>
                    
<p>So after Microsoft's disastrous update to xbox on August 1, I experienced many "took too long to open" errors and was told by xbox support to reset my console. They also told me that all my games and their individual progress would be stored in-cloud and
 thus available to me when I set it up again. At this point, I got all my games back but alas, I LOST A LOT OF PROGRESS IN JUST CAUSE 3. I opened this game and logged in with my account and jumped in, but found that I was heavily behind in the story that I
 had previously completed ( much before resetting the console). Along with being behind in-story, a lot of the items I had collected and towns I had liberated were just not there. It was like the cloud had only registered part of my game progress and had then
 stopped. All this happened even though I had played the game online and I'm assuming, the cloud had recorded everything. The weirdest thing is: all my achievements that I got while playing the game before are still on my account, so it seems very odd that
 my progress is gone, but my achievements for the progress after that part in the game are still unlocked. Have tips, questions or even a solution? Please reply to this. Thank You kindly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Tschnetzler!</p>
<p>Your achievements will remain on your Microsoft account regardless of whether you`ve reset your Xbox or not. Once you`ve unlocked a achievement, you`ll always have it. For example, if you`ve completed a mission, got the achievement for it, and then reset
 the console, and lost the game data, when you load up you`ll find it`s still there unlocked as a achievement.</p>
<p>Now as far as the data goes, I`d try doing a re-sync of your game data. Normally, this should occur when you boot up the game and are connected to the internet. &nbsp;It should then allow you to get into your saved game and see everything you know you should
 have.</p>
<p>Should it not appear after syncing, then it`d imply to me that before re-setting the console, the data wasnt syncing over to your cloud storage, and was rather singlely saving to your HDD. Which if that is the case, then I`m afraid any progressive data over
 what you are seeing now would be lost.</p>
