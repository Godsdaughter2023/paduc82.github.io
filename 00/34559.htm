<h2>            asus smart gesture</h2>
                    my two finger scrolling has stopped working and i looked online to fix it, everyone was saying you need to download or upgrade smart gesture so apparently i uninstalled it to try to reinstall the new one and now when i go to install the new one it says
 that source file is not found and says to verify that you can reach it. Theres an option to try again and it just keeps popping up if you click it and wont continue to install, its either try again or cancel.&nbsp;

            Hi Shauntelle.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sounds like it could be a bad download.  Try another browser, delete the old download and download it again from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model or serial number.
<br />
<br />Uninstall the software first in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features and Device Manager &gt; Mice, restart PC, right click Download to Run as Administrator.  
<br />
<br />If any problems try in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>how do i flag an email with windows mail &#40;windows 8 pro&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teachmewindows8  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do i flag an email with windows mail &#40;windows 8 pro&#41;</h2>
                    I received an email about a flight I booked. I want to flag it so that I can easily find it in the future (ie closer to when I'm flying). I use the default windows 8 mail app that came with the os. I've tried right clicking the email along with looking
 at all other parts of the screen I can think of, but can't find any way to flag an email. What are my options for flagging? (there's gotta be a better way than "mark as unread" or creating some kind of folder and moving it)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, despite the notifications being turned on, the mail app does not give me a pop up notification on the upper right of my screen when I receive a new email. I also find that my phone (through both wifi and a cell network) and the hotmail.com website
 will notify me about a new email long before the windows 8 mail app does. How do I get rid of this delay?</div>

            <p>I'm sorry, but whose BRILLIANT idea was it to not include the ability to flag a message, especially on an app that supports ActiveSync?&nbsp; Really?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on, Microsoft!&nbsp; Apple products support flagging, and let's see.... oh yes, Android products support flagging.... am I missing anything.... Oh yes..... WINDOWS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please tell the IDIOT (I don't care if it was Blamer himself) what a monumentally STUPID move it was to not allow you to do something AS BASIC as flagging a message for follow-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is this some feeble attempt to strong-arm people into Outlook 2013 (which has it's own issues, believe me)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THESE LITTLE THINGS are why Apple is kicking Microsoft's butt....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW... don't even get me started on what a piece of junk Microsoft Sync is in my 2013 ford escape!</p>

            <p>Wow...I don't know if anyone from MS reads this - or will even care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I have been working with my new Surface for 2 weeks now - and just figured the flag feature was somehow hidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a basic function to have missing......I mean overall, the mail client is dismal at best - but not even the flag made it....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly, I am on the verge of just sending this thing back anyway - but this product had some real promise....but once Outlook was missing - and this mail client was what was left&nbsp; - how disappointing to say the least.</p>

<p>This is did not resolve the issue of the Virtual Switch Manger being unable to create the Default Switch that is supposed to exist in Hyper-V.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I did try the suggested procedure, it si my understanding this fix is intended for addressing problems with user created switches, not the Hyper-V "Default Switch".&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Andras, are you clean installing Windows 10 on your laptop or are you just updating.
<br />
<br />If you are clean installing Windows 10, do you then install a full set of drivers after the clean installation from the Acer website?
<br />
<br />When you say your laptop is crashing, are you getting a Blue Screen, a black screen or is it just freezing?
<br />
<br />If you get a Blue Screen, do you know what error is printed on that screen?

            You should do a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            The laptop is starting and it is freezing but its useless if i try to open the internet or my PC or any program it is instantly freezing and i have to shut it down. I install a clean installation and I format everything, i`m not installing any drivers
 because its says that i have the latest drivers installed.

<p>Hey there</p>
<p>I will be happy to help</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Is the USB disk locked, I know sometimes they can be locked and the system will not detect it.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The other thing I can suggest is try using the stick in a different USB Port on your Xbox 360. Or even try re starting your Xbox 360 and see if it notices it then</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you with your results</p>

 it to work for a couple days now and have run out of ideas on what the issue might be. &nbsp;Thank you for any and all help.

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Safe Mode and Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1: </strong>If the issue persist, boot your PC in <strong>
Safe mode</strong> by following the steps from the link below and check if you are facing similar issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Safe mode</strong> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Expand the options to boot into <strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To exit from <strong>Safe mode</strong> follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Open <strong>Run command</strong> by pressing
<strong>Windows key + R </strong>on the keyboard and type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the command box.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Under <strong>Boot </strong>tab uncheck the <strong>
Safe boot </strong>option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Reboot </span></strong><span>the system and check if the changes are effective.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To know more about <strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on
<strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode) </strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>If the issue does not persist in <strong>
Safe mode</strong>, perform <strong>Clean boot </strong>by following the steps from the link below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. By the statement "formatted the system"&nbsp;do&nbsp;you mean that you&nbsp;performed a reset on your system?</p>
<p>2. Was your issue resolved after the "format"?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you still require assistance on these issues, you may follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<p>From the errors mentioned above, Chrome, Opera and VLC applications may have got corrupt and therefore reinstalling the applications after successfully uninstalling them might have fixed the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Error 193 0xc1</strong> means that the path for the service (in your case, Windows audio service) has been modified. You may have to manually assign a path to your service.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R </strong>to open the run command.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Type&nbsp;<strong>services.msc </strong>and click <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Locate <strong>Windows Audio Service</strong>.</p>
<p>4.<strong> Right-click </strong>on the service and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Under <strong>Path to Executable</strong> note down the path provided to notepad or wherever comfortable. Also, note the<strong> Service Name</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Now, again press <strong>Windows key + R </strong>to open the run command.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Type&nbsp;<strong>regedit </strong>and click <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>8. Locate the following: </p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</strong></p>
<p>9. Under Services in registry editor, find the services which is not working (in your case,
<strong>Audiosrv</strong>).</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;<strong>Double-click </strong>on <strong>Image Path</strong> and copy everything from
<strong>Value Data</strong>.</p>
<p>11. Save this path in the same file where you saved the previous path. This will be used in comparison.</p>
<p>12. Now, compare the two paths and see if they are similar.</p>
<p>13. If they are not similar you have found the cause of the issue. Now, you need to modify these paths with the correct path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make&nbsp;sure you create a back up of your registry before making any changes to the&nbsp;registry editor. Click on the link below and follow the steps for Windows 8.1&nbsp;to create a backup of registry.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>&nbsp;Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that
 you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.&nbsp;

<h2>            Disable Windows Shortcut Keys</h2>
                    Is there any way to disable the Windows Shortcut keys to avoid conflicts with other applications use of these same shortcuts.&nbsp; Or perhaps redefining selected keys.

<h3> brain burnout  say:</h3>
<h2>            Workgroup No Longer Recognized</h2>
                    
<p>I support a peer-to-peer network. File server is Windows 7 Pro, one workstation is Win 7 Pro, three other workstations are Windows XP Home. Power went out, server and all computers down (server on UPS, controlled shutdown). All PCs come back up, the file
 server, Win 7 client and one of the XP clients all work fine. Other 2 XP clients work fine except they cannot access the server or other computers on the network. When I attempt to go to shared files on server I get the message in My Network Places pop-up
 box: [Workgroup name] is not accessible. You might not have permissions to use this network resource. Contact the admin of this server to find out if you have access permissions." The workgroup name is the correct workgroup name of the network and on the computers
 that are working fine.</p>
<p>Everything was working the day before, and the two other client computers are both on the same workgroup name and work fine. The computers that cannot access the file server both have Internet connections and send/receive mail in Outlook and can IP ping
 the router and each other so the wiring and routers are OK.&nbsp;I have rebooted both computers several times (reboots and full boots) and get the same error. I have verified access rights on the server are correct (they were the same when I checked them the previous
 week). The access is the same for all the computers, both the ones that are working and the ones that are not.</p>
<p>I would like any suggestions on how to resolve the network access issue on the XP computers that cannot connect. Thank you for any assistance.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Many things can happen from Network hardware that does not work well because of the power issue. To IPs that changed when all the system Rebooted again.</p>
<p><br />
The way to deal with is go over Network system and make sure that everything is still configured correctly and id if needed redo some of the sharing’s.</p>
<p><strong>Check every thing, do not assume that if something worked before than you do not have to look at it.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe this can Help.</p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has three types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p><strong>Since you have a Network with Win 7 and other version of Windows you need to configure Win 7 as Work Network.</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong><br />
<br />
*Note. Some of the processes described above are done Not for Windows sake but to compensate for different Routers and the way their firmware works and stores the info about the computers that are Networked.</p>

<p>Make sure the <strong>File and Printer Sharing</strong> on the Network Adapter is Enabled and also the service for<strong> Browser service</strong> is started.</p>
<p>Also, you can Turn the Firewall on those two machine temporary to see if the Firewall interfering.</p>

<p>Thank you for all the suggestions. I had already gone through several of your suggestions during my first round of trouble-shooting. I understand the fickleness of networks after power outages having worked through&nbsp;dozens of them at various sites over the
 last 10 years.</p>
<p>This particular issue resolved itself. I returned the day after the problems started and everything was working fine without any further action on my part. My clients claim they did nothing, which I believe because, and I don't mean this in a bad way, they
 are not very computer literate and know almost nothing about networks. They did not reboot any computers, routers, change any wires, etc. It just started working. This has happened to me twice in the past when many functions on a network were not working after
 a power outage one day and everything is fine the next. I have no idea what changed (the ISP said they did nothing) and certainly don't like the uncertainty, but I have learned to accept what happens without question if everything is working as expected on
 a network. If they wanted to pay for my time to reseearch further I would but they do not so the ticket is closed.</p>

<h2>            Harddrive sometimes not detected by OS</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I hope you can help me. <br />
<br />
First some Specs:<br />
<br />
Desktop PC, big tower case</p>
<p>
</p><p>I7 3770k not overclocked</p>
<p>Nvdia 760 GTX, 2 GB VRAM</p>
<p>2x4GB DDR3 RAM, 1600 MhZ</p>
<p>Asus p8Z77-V LX2 Mainboard</p>
<p>C: 60 GB SSD over SATA 3</p>
<p>D: 1 TB HDD over SATA 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since yesterday my D: Harddrive sometimes just fails to be detected on startup or even in normal running mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I encountered this, I was playing ArmA 3 which froze. Quitting to desktop was impossible since the OS went terribly slow. I made a hard reset, which resulted in Win10 not starting properly. I thought that I had rebooted while an update was
 installed, so I wiped both Harddrives (C: is a 60 GB SSD, D: is a 1 TB HDD) and reinstalled Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked the hardware, opened and cleaned the case, un- and reconnected both harddrives and checked the cables for damages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While installing windows, both harddrives showed up properly, I wiped and formated both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the installation was complete, D: did not show up in the Explorer, but was listed in Disk Management. Strangely, although I am pretty sure I formated it during the installation it showed as RAW. However I could format it with Disk Management after that
 it worked properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few hours later everything crashed again. This time I did not reset, but rather tried to perform a restart. The resource monitor showed a 100% usage of D: for a couple minutes, without a corresponding task showing up. I disconnected the LAN cable for security
 reasons.<br />
<br />
When it finally restarted after almost 15 minutes, D: was gone again. Neither showing in Explorer nor Disk Management, in the Device Manager only listed as "unknown device". I went to bed to tackle the problem today.<br />
<br />
When I started the PC today it just ran perfectly right away. Hasn't crashed yet too.
<br />
<br />
I'm very confused now. So far I've come up with the following origins of this weird problem:<br />
<br />
1. The HDD is dying. Possible, since it should be over 6 years old.<br />
<br />
2. The Mainboard is failing. Unlikely, since C: never had problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Software Issue. No Idea how, but that's why I'm asking here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Virus. No Idea how and why but maybe something tried to encrypt D:, failed and crashed the system in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. ???<br />
<br />
I hope you guys can help me figure it out. If it is just a broken HDD then no problem, but I want to make sure that there is no softwareproblem or virus involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>:EDIT: </p>
<p>
</p><p>After the most recent crash the HD is shown in the Task Manager as Disk 1 without a corresponding letter. It shows up in the Device Manager, but not in Disk Managment. Trying to scan it with HD Tune leads to an almost unbearably slow performance for the
 whole OS, a benchmark only returns an error.</p>

            Well, its either the drive is going bad or the motherboard itself.
<br />
<br />Do you have spare HDD you could try using to isolate the problem?

</p><p>I did perform a scan for errors, it did not show any. Unfortunetly I forgot to save the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now it shows up in the Device Manager, but has no properties. In HD Tune it shows as a 4 GB HD which is unable to perform a benchmark and shows only errors in the error scan. It does not show in Drive Management. The HD has been working properly today
 until the PC crashed again out of the blue.</p>

I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. <br /><br />Sometimes there are glitches in the installation / update process that don't pop up an error message so we end up thinking the installation is all ok when it not the case, which can cause strange behaviors as the one you describe.<br /><br />May I suggest that you uninstall Skype, restart your device, re-install Skype and try again? <br /><br />Hope this helps! <br /><br />I wish you a great day/night :)! <br />Maggie

<p>I have Windows 7. </p>
<p>I tried to go to Device-manager and reinstall the driver for a "Xbox 360 Controller for Windows" but it doesn't work. Apparently the Controller is searching for a connection and doesn't recognize my receiver anymore.</p>

            Make sure you have disconnected the controller from your 360, use the sync button, and make sure your Xbox is off when you are doing this, it could be that it is not syncing with the correct device.

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12-how to change the aspect ratio of a video</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 / Aspect Ration on WPM12</p>
<p>Windows media Player 12 does not give me an option to change the aspecet ratio of a video. I really adore WMP12 more than the VLC player that I use on my windows 7.The sound codes work awsome!. But it is the problem with the aspect ration. If a video is
 coded at 4:3, there is no option in WMP12 to change it unlike most other player which gives an option to change the aspect ratio. Is there a way to force WMP12 to take&nbsp; the default video aspect ratio?<br />
<br />
I thank you for the time taken to answer this question in advance.</p>

=========================================<br />
I do not have a copy of WMP 12 available right now so I cannot <br />
verify that the following info applies but it does work for WMP11...<br />
maybe it would be worth a look:<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player has an option to change the Aspect<br />
Ratio but it's complicated and does not work for DVDs...<br />
though it does work for video clips...wmv, .avi, .mpg, etc....<br />
<br />
Open Windows Media Player and go to...<br />
Tools / Options / Devices tab / Display / Properties button...<br />
Drag the slider to a new position / Apply / Yes / OK / OK...<br />
<br />
If you try it...let us know if it applies to WMP12.<br />

            Thank you for the post.. I did not find the time to check that ... will try it first thing in the morning and will let you know. But if this is the only option, that will be too much of a task to do for each videos. I think you will have to think of an
 option to change the aspect ration on the fly( a good example is K-Lite Code's Player).<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot again....<br />

            Hi,<br />
it seems that the media player does not interpret the aspect ration information auf the video file.<br />
If you play 16:9 encoded videos (DVDs work well), the Media Player does not "stretch" it to the correct aspect ration like other players automatically.<br />
<br />
I like the media player, but this is a big issue.<br />
<br />
The advice from John does not solve the problem the right way.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Manuel

<blockquote>Windows media Player 12 does not give me an option to change the aspecet ratio of a video. I really adore WMP12 more than the VLC player that I use on my windows 7.The sound codes work awsome!. But it is the problem with the aspect ration. If a
 video is coded at 4:3, there is no option in WMP12 to change it unlike most other player which gives an option to change the aspect ratio. Is there a way to force WMP12 to take&nbsp; the default video aspect ratio?<br />
<br />
I thank you for the time taken to answer this question in advance.

=========================================<br />
I do not have a copy of WMP 12 available right now so I cannot <br />
verify that the following info applies but it does work for WMP11...<br />
maybe it would be worth a look:<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player has an option to change the Aspect<br />
Ratio but it's complicated and does not work for DVDs...<br />
though it does work for video clips...wmv, .avi, .mpg, etc....<br />
<br />
Open Windows Media Player and go to...<br />
Tools / Options / Devices tab / Display / Properties button...<br />
Drag the slider to a new position / Apply / Yes / OK / OK...<br />
<br />
If you try it...let us know if it applies to WMP12.<br />
<br />

I tried this method myself however there is only a horizontal slider , nothing for vertical!!!<br />
i too would really love to use WMP12 as my default player but since i cannot change the aspect ration im stuck using VLC which doesnt work with my media keyboard!!!<br />

            I have been using K-Like! That lets me choose the aspect ratio. Unless MS gives me an option to change the aspect ratio on the go.. I think I will stick to the MediaPlayer Classic.<br />
I also looks like it works with the MM keyboard that I have!<br />
BanTam.... Check if that works for you...<br />

Yes I have used this (setting the ratio to 1.333) and it works with WMP 11 on Windows XP. But it doesn't work with WMP 12 on Windows 7 (64 bit).&nbsp; From what I've read elsewhere on the web, my guess is, it's not WMP's fault but Windows' fault.</p>
<p>But the deeper issue is, hey WMP (or Windows), IT'S A 4:3 VIDEO. PERIOD. WHY ARE YOU CHANGING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE?</p>

<p>Hi, all</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has never been possible to change your Skype Name. And s<span>ince the migration of Skype accounts to Microsoft accounts, the option to create a unique Skype Name has been
</span><em><span>removed</span></em><span>. This is because we want to focus on&nbsp;allowing you to login-in with a single sign-in to Microsoft services with just one password.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The steps on how you can change your profile photo vary on the version of Skype that you're using. You can refer to this support article to find out how you can change your profile picture:
</span><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA3571/how-do-i-change-my-profile-picture-in-skype?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I change my profile picture in Skype?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you delete your Skype account, it will also delete the Microsoft account connected to it. This means, you will lose access to all Microsoft services connected to it. For more information about closing a Skype account, please visit this support article:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How do I close my Skype account?</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For your concern about deleting a contact, please respond to this thread with the exact version of Skype that you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>The point is it SHOULD be possible to change your Skype username. </p>
<p>My Skype account has a username tied to an old employer. I can't use it anymore. Since you migrated this to my Microsoft account, and I can't delete my Skype account with losing my access to my Microsoft services, or change my username, it effectively means
 I can never use Skype again. I'm locked into a dead Skype account that has no possible use for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you not think about this use case?</p>
<p>That strikes me as ridiculous on its face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there really no remedy for this?<br />

    <title>The Surface Docking Station is great except for the very short - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lewis d. eigen  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Surface Docking Station is great except for the very short connecting cord.  Are there plans to lengthen the cord or supply an extension&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The Surface Docking Station is great except for the very short connecting cord.&nbsp; Are there plans to lengthen the cord or supply an extension?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one is using the docking station in the classic mode -- with an external large screen and an external keyboard -- the cord is just right.&nbsp; However,there are other modes.&nbsp; In my case, I have physical handicaps making the classic arrangement untenable.&nbsp;
 I sit in a large armchair, with an external keyboard and trackball on a lapboard.&nbsp; On an arm that extends from the wall, I have a 48 inch monitor.&nbsp; To the right of the arm chair I have a Table Cabinet whhich houses the docking station and two external hard
 drives.&nbsp; The Surface computer is on the top of to the table cabinet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This arrangement works well EXCEPT sometimes I want to move the surface laptop from the top of the cabinet to my lap and work directly with the PC.&nbsp; The cord connecting the PC to the docking station is so short, that I have to swing my chair all the way
 to the right, and move the laptop.&nbsp; the cord is not long enough to place the laptop in my lap ironically, so I have to balance it on the chair arm.&nbsp; Anither 18 inches in cord length would solve the problem,&nbsp; As would an 18 inch to 36 inch extension cord.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have talked with the staff at my local Microsoft store, and they tell me that they literally receive hundreds of requests for longer cords or extensions that people would buy.&nbsp; I certainly would.&nbsp; Will I be able to soon?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 still downloading after 3 days - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ukflyboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 still downloading after 3 days</h2>
                    Hi Windows 10 is still downloading after 3 days, I know it's windows 10 because the folder $Windows.~BT has been created and it now has a size of 4.87gb and on disk it's 3.33gb and GWX has network traffic. Is there anyway to tell how long the update will
 take as there is no progress meter. If this continues for another day I am going to revert back to&nbsp; previous image and uninstall KB3035583. I use my PC for my work and this is killing me ? I am on a slow connection of about 100k to 127k a second .. Thanks
                </div>

            <p>Try downloading the ISO file manually to your Mobile device. If you have 3G or 4G, it should download fairly quick compared to what you're saying above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also look for a Free Wi-Fi spot and connect your phone to download the ISO file, then transfer it to your computer with the USB cable all&nbsp;smart phones&nbsp;come with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To stop the automatic installation, attempt a System Restore to the nearest point since before you accepted the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there,&nbsp;it's suggested you flash your bios, clean your disc with Command Prompt at boot—re-install your previous version of Windows and activate it; update your bios and chipset; and then&nbsp;use the method I've&nbsp;provided to properly create your Windows 10&nbsp;installation
 disc and successfully upgrade while retaining&nbsp;your activated status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should give you a perfectly clean transition to Window 10. Once that's in, create a System Image and System Recovery Disc to ensure that you have a secured backup of Windows 10 if say the upgrade truly cuts off in all ways later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel → Backup &amp; Restore (Windows 7) → Create System Image</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to flashing the bios and cleaning the disc from boot...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>To do this, unplug the power cord from your computer, open your case, and remove the battery from the motherboard. Leave this removed for a few minutes. Press the power button to expel any lingering electricity in the system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put the battery back in, then press [DEL] to enter the bios upon start up. Navigate the menu and adjust the time, date, and then make sure that the [Boot Menu] option is enabled. You'll need this in order to boot from disc.
</p>
<p>Save your settings and proceed to boot from the installation disc of your original version of Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There in the opening menu, select the "Repair your computer..." option. </p>
<p>Navigate this menu and find the Command Prompt option. Open that and when the CMD window pops up, enter the following commands in sequence.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>diskpart</p>
<p>
</p><p>list volume</p>
<p>
</p><p>select volume #<span>—</span>enter the number listed as your hard drive
</p>
<p>
</p><p>clean</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will totally wipe your hard drive clean, including your boot records. This can be used to solve extremely technical and comprehensive problems affecting your hard drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close the window<span>—</span>reboot the computer<span>—</span>and proceed to boot from your Windows installation disc and fresh install your original version of Windows.
</p>
<p>Once you have that installed and activated, you should be able to pop in your Windows 10 installation disc and jump straight to Windows 10 without any problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just make sure keep your computer physically disconnected from the internet while you perform this recovery<span>—</span>and change your IP address as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this by simply unplugging your modem for 30 mins and plugging it back in—or you may have to change the MAC Address Clone in your router (you can just enter in anything)—as well as change your Subnet Mask. This is if your Internet Service Provider
 assigns your IP based on MAC Address.</p>

</span></span></span><span>And check if you find the apps and are you able to open them.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow
<b>Step 3</b> from the link to start the computer to <b>Normal start up mode.</b></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses
 and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while
 your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            That sounds very much like a problem I was having with my start screen and the tiles disappearing.
<div><br />
<div>After installing the most recent updates, when I search for anything it makes the start screen go blank. None of the search results are displayed; all of the tiles disappear. Even if I exit the search or go back to the desktop and then hit the start button
 everything is gone. However, if I search for something that doesn't exist (or at least use a search that doesn't return any apps such as zzz), then the search results properly display, the tiles come back and then I can search for the app that I was originally
 looking for just fine. However, it took me quite a while to figure out how to get this to work. For a while it just seemed like the apps were appearing and disappearing randomly.
<div><br />
<div>Hopefully this helps anyone else that is having this problem. Also, hopefully Microsoft will get this fixed ASAP because it's very annoying.</div>

<p>Well it looks like explorer.exe had stopped responding which is what would cause this.&nbsp; As for now just reboot the os and it should come back ok.&nbsp; there should be another "fix" provided by Microsoft to address this issue..</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Creators Update install fails with partition problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update install fails with partition problems</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to install the Creators Update for several months now and have been met with nothing but frustration. I'm running Windows 10 Home, Version 1607. After repeated errors stating that the system reserved partition couldn't be updated, I followed
 instructions on a Windows Help page in order to increase partition size and allow for the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it runs through the download/install process, but after seeming to complete it while simultaneously getting my hopes up, it then errors with the message
<em>"This PC can't run Windows 10"-- </em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">despite the fact that that's what it's doing</span> -- and following that, it tells me
<em>"We couldn't update the system reserved partition."</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so tired of this endless loop of attempting to update, alerting me that I
<em>should </em>update, then telling me I <em>can't </em>update -- and now claiming I can't run Windows 10 on a machine which is running Windows 10. Now what do I do? Any help would be sincerely appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help so far. I have finally had a chance to try this solution, but I am having difficulty. I am able to resize the partition, but after that happens and I go to disk management to try and extend the System Reserved Partition, all options
 for it are greyed out. I am unable to do anything with it and am unsure what to do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I am using the partition manager correctly. It is a little confusing, but I think I did it the way it's supposed to be done. However, I don't know what to do now. Any further help you could offer would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Gregg</p>
        </p>
