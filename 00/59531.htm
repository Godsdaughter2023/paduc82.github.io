<h2>            My account security</h2>
                    <p>Hi... Any advice will be helpful but i would be thankful if a registered Skype moderator can help assist me please.</p>
<p>In January 2018 this year i downloaded Skype and everything seemed fine until one time (for the first time ) i signed out of my account. I immediately tried signing in using the correct password but i got surpised when i got an " unknown error " message.
 I kept on signing in and the same message appeared. As a result of signing in unsuccessfully on numerous amounts of time , i must have triggered a security feature which caused my account to be temporarily suspended. I did ty resetting my password but i couldn't
 because of my suspended account. A month later i went through the process of unblockiny my account, and was able to change my password. Please note that i was using a slightly older version of Skype ; after doing some research i saw some posts about having
 sign in problems with slightly older or much older verions of Skype.&nbsp; When i unsuspended my account i downloaded / and updated the latest version of Skype for my android phone. Right now i don't have any login issues with my Skype, but I'm just worried if
 while i had sign in issues if there was any unauthorized sign ins or hacking into my account. I would be very thankful Skype could just look into my account for security reasons. I just need some closure. Thank you</p>

    <title>Even With Valid Proof, Microsoft Not Honoring Warranty on Mice... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ampersat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Even With Valid Proof, Microsoft Not Honoring Warranty on Mice...</h2>
                    <br />
I purchased a pack of Microsoft Intellimouse Optical mice a few years ago from an online computer/electronics vendor. Earlier this year, one of the mouse's left button started acting up but since it was intermittent I decided to just deal with it since I had
 plenty of time left on my warranty (I have been using these mice for many many years, sometimes a few at a time - and know the standard warranty is for 5 years). Recently the mouse had gotten much worse as the left mouse button clicks multiple times even though
 it is pressed just once.<br />
<br />
I called into Microsoft's order department to submit my warranty for possible replacement.&nbsp; After faxing my invoice, I received a call from a person I believe from their warranty dept telling me that the mice was no longer under warranty and I was no longer
 eligible for support. I asked him how that is possible, and I was told that the warranty for the Intellimouse Optical is 3 years and that i had purchased this mouse 3.5 years ago. I was speechless. I told the rep that the warranty for the Intellimouse Optical's
 were for 5 years but he denied this and insisted the warranty was for 3 years only. I asked him if this policy had changed recently but he said no and that it has always been 3 years. I had the box for another separate intellimouse optical sitting in one of
 my desk drawer but could not find any mention of the warranty printed on the outside like they used to. So I quickly went to Microsoft's support site for the Intellimouse Optical and found the following PDF which clearly shows that the warranty on the Intellimouse
 Optical's were 5 years:<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/B/5/3B54A015-3714-4BFF-8BF0-003BA0B15F5C/X17-31699-02_EN_XC_FR_EL_IW_IT_PT_ES.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/B/5/3B54A015-3714-4BFF-8BF0-003BA0B15F5C/X17-31699-02_EN_XC_FR_EL_IW_IT_PT_ES.pdf</a><br />
<br />
"<span style="font-weight: bold">IntelliMouseÂ® Optical</span>; Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer; IntelliMouse Explorer for Bluetooth; Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer with Fingerprint Reader:
<span style="font-weight: bold">Five (5) years</span>"<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
After informing the rep of this, he reiterated there was nothing he could do and kept insisting it was 3 years according to his documentation. I asked him to take a look at Microsoft's website since it shows the warranty being listed at 5 years but he did not
 seem to care. I asked to speak to a manager or another agent but he would not let me and told me they would tell me the same thing... that it was 3 years. After pleading with him again to check the site, he
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hung up on me</span>!<br />
<br />
I couldn't believe it. I phoned back MS' order dept to express this frustrating experience. When I spoke to a different rep in the order department, he told me according to his documentation, the warranty for the intellimouse optical's were listed at 3 years
 as well. I asked how this is possible since on Microsoft's own website, they list the warranty for 5 years. I asked the rep if I could find my warranty booklet that came with my mouse&nbsp; would take a look into this matter and he said that would be fine. I spent
 last night wading thru boxes and boxes but could not find these papers. <br />
<br />
Luckily I remembered the software cd that came with the mouse. So I decided to check the&nbsp; intellimouse software disc for any information on warranty and THERE IS a RTF file included on the disc (Eng.rtf) which states:<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<span><span style="font-weight: bold">IntelliMouse</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Optical</span>; Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer; IntelliMouse Explorer for Bluetooth; Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer with Fingerprint Reader:
<span><span style="font-weight: bold">IntelliMouse</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Optical</span>; Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer; IntelliMouse Explorer for Bluetooth; Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer with Fingerprint Reader:
<span style="font-weight: bold">Five (5) years</span></span><br />
<br />
This <span style="font-weight: bold">SAME file is posted on Microsoft's website</span> at:<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/7/8/278BFC91-3E3F-4784-BCF6-2D9418722CCE/MSHWEULAWARRANTY/Eng.rtf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/7/8/278BFC91-3E3F-4784-BCF6-2D9418722CCE/MSHWEULAWARRANTY/Eng.rtf</a><br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Also if you have the intellipoint software installed on your computer you can see that the mouse is indeed covered for 5 years.
<br />
<br />
Open the Quick Start guide that's installed with the program &gt; Go to 'Need help'&nbsp; icon &gt; click on the Microsoft Pointing Device User's Guide &gt; Go to Legal Information &gt; and then to END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT and LIMITED WARRANTY.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
On this page under LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY it states:<br />
MICROSOFT POINTING DEVICE: IntelliMouse Pro; IntelliMouse with IntelliEye; <span style="font-weight: bold">
IntelliMouse Optical</span>; Trackball Explorer; and Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer WARRANTY PERIOD:<span style="font-weight: bold"> 5 years</span><br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also,<br />
If you go to newegg and search for the intellimouse (discontinued) it will show you the manufacturer warranty being listed at 5 years.<br />
If you go to amazon and look at the product photos, there is one uploaded by a customer which shows 5 years printed on the box.<br />
<br />
<br />
So with all this proof, why does Microsoft refuse to honour their warranty and tell me that it's only 3 years when it's advertised as 5? I am upset the first agent I spoke to would not make any sort of attempt to validate the correct warranty length even though
 there is published proof on Microsoft's own website (let alone hang up on me).<br />
<br />
As a consumer and supporter, I am very let down by Microsoft with this incident. Even trying to contact the correct department to explain the situation has been extremely&nbsp; difficult. (After calling back to Microsoft support this morning, I was redirected to
 another department which took me to an answering machine.) At this point I'm not even concerned with getting a replacement/refund for my mouse - just a genuine apology and a explanation as to why the warranty dept and consumers are given conflicting sets of
 information. It's the principle of the thing. I don't feel that anyone at Microsoft wanted to accept their facts might have possibly been wrong or go out of their way to find the correct information even though the proof is posted above (multiple times) on
 their OWN website for all to see.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 &#58; I need to keep resetting my Network Adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every few days when I browse on Google Chrome or any other browser, there's a time when I keep getting an error which says "ERR_CONNECTION_FAILED".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a little bit of research on how to fix this problem, and there's one which is to reset the network adapter. I do this by running the command "netsh winsock reset" via command prompt. Once I restart my computer after I run the command, the error no
 longer appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it will resurface in just a matter of days, so I have to keep doing this again and again. Though it's not something especially annoying, it can be pretty rage inducing if it occurs when I'm in the middle of a game, for instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely enough this does not happen on my phone even though both my phone and pc are connected to the same network, so I believe the problem lies with my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running Windows Network Diagnostic but it never returns any error (it always says "the problem could not be identified").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a permanent solution to this, I'd very much appreciate it. T</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            I recommend you check these methods to repair any Windows problem.
<br />
<br />1.- Run System File Checker (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>) or SFC to fix any system file corruption from the resident component store.
<br />
<br />In an elevated CMD (<a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-command-prompt-as-an-administrator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-comma...</a>)  execute the following command:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />This does not require Internet access.
<br />If this not help, you may need to repair the Windows Component Store itself.
<br />2.-  To do this, you need to Run DISM. (<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-dism-command-line-utility-repair-windows-10-image" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-dism-com...</a>)
<br />
<br />In an elevated CMD execute the following command:
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />This will fix any system image corruption from a Windows Update source. This may require internet access.
<br />This should resolve all issues.
<br />3.-  Additionally if you feel, you may run SFC again.
<br />This will fix potential system file corruption from the new repaired component store and verify that DISM was successful in repairing the errors.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />If the problem persists can you provide the following information which may help determine any issue(s): 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Also, can you do the following: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .evtx file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.

    <title>Is this game worth buying&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is this game worth buying&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>It's going to be a long wait for Mass Effect 3, Battlefield 3, Skyrim, etc. So I need a game to keep me entertained until then. My friend just bought Dead Rising 2 and he says it's a fun game. He said I should buy it and I was planning on doing it. I told
 my brother about it and he said the game is terrible. Due to the time limit you have, the bosses in the game are humans, and you can simply ignore the zombies (according to him). I really want this game but I don't want to waste good money on a crappy game.
 Is this game long lasting hours of fun slaughtering zombies?</p>

<p>I have only played the original Dead Rising but from what I've heard the sequel is much of the same. It's true that you can (try) to ignore the zombies but they will get you sooner or later if you do that. And it is pretty much your decision how you want
 to spend your time in the game. If you want to kill zombies until the time limit expires you can do that. The time limit didn't bother me too much. But really how you want to play the game is pretty much your decision , at least in the first it was your decision.
 If everything I know is right than the sequel only adds things to the first (for example a crafting system) . So I don't think it is a bad game. I'm planning on getting it...</p>

<p>Dead Rising (both 1&amp;2) are good mindless fun. &nbsp;There are so many zombies that it is hard to ignore them. &nbsp;The bosses are human, but there is literally hundreds of zombies to kill on-screen. &nbsp;And beating zombies around the head with an electric guitar never
 gets old!</p>

<p>the dead rising series is one of my favorite series of all time and definatly one of the best on the 360 i have played dead rising 1 case zero dead rising 2 and case west and have gotten every single achievment in all of them Dead Rising rocks the story
 is great and the gameplay is super fun. The game encourages you to replay it many many times as it is pretty much impossible to do everything in one sitting. All in all i HIGHLY recommend picking up dead rising 2 and dead rising 1 if you can theyre probably
 mad cheap and deffinatly worth the money i bought both games for the full $60 price when they both first came out and dont regret it at all.</p>

<p>Â£10 in HMV, worth every penny. The online VS game show thing is near dead with no one around, but it doesn't matter. The campaign is good with plenty of areas to explore plus co-op with a mate is always good.</p>

<p>Buy it but boss battles are harder then expected usually. Zombies progressively get harder to kill. But u have to play and level up a while before completing the campaign</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Dear friends,</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;I have a "GENX" 2GB pen drive. I used it for about six months without any problem. But now I am suffering from a serious issue that its file system changed to RAW accidentally. I didn't really know what is the reason for it! I didn't connect it
 with any dangerous computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its file system was FAT 32. It contain some songs, some softwares,some photos,videos e.t.c. but they are not important. So I don't want to recover any files/data from it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;My question is:- Is there any software or any way {command that we type in command prompt e.t.c.} to format my pen drive? I don't want to recover anything from it, I just want empty it change the file system into FAT 32 or NTFS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;I am using Windows X P Service Pack-3. For 2 months I searched whole internet to solve my problem, but no use. I tried many softwares! They are not useful to me, because they just help to recover files in it.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;When i connect my pen-drive an error message is displayed "Disk in drive G is not formatted. Do you want to format it now?" When I click YES an another error message is displayed-"Windows was unable to complete format"</strong></p>
<p><strong>If anyone help me that may give happiness to thousands of people. Because when i searched/ inquired &nbsp;about this problem I realized that many are suffering from this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dear friends please help me......</strong></p>

<p>Dear friends..</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its with great pride and joy that to inform you that I successfully formatted my pen-drive. After almost one and a half-years hard work.I tried several softwares but they all failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I request you all to try Transcend Online Recovery tool for doing this.(link:-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.transcendusa.com/Products/ORTCount.asp?URL=Software/OnLineRecovery.exe&amp;action=Download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.transcendusa.com/Products/ORTCount.asp?URL=Software/OnLineRecovery.exe&amp;action=Download</a>&nbsp;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its a small tool. It format RAW file system even though our pen-dive is not made by Transcend. Even though the format completed successfully we are not able to use the device because it shows that it is write protected. So you may kindly follow these
 steps:</p>
<p><span>1) Click Start-&gt;Run.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2)Type regedit and hit enter.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4)Click on the plus sign next to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5)Click on the plus sign next to SYSTEM&nbsp;<br />
<br />
6)Click on the plus sign next to CurrentControlSet&nbsp;<br />
<br />
7)Click on the plus sign next to Control&nbsp;<br />
<br />
8)Click on the plus sign next to StorageDevicePolicies&nbsp;<br />
<br />
9)Write click on WriteProtect and click modify.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
10)If the value data is 1 change it 0 and click ok.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
11)Close Registry editor and restart the computer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now you are done. Your pen-drive is ready now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But one problem is we don't get the same space as earlier. In my case my device's earlier capacity was 1.87GB. But after I repaired it, capacity reduced to 1.67GB. I am not worried at that because I think I am the only one to format this sort filesystem.</p>
<p>Thank You Friends........ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            how do i fix my laptop sony vaio VGNFW235DH &#40;windows 7 64 os&#41; &#63;</h2>
                    <p>When i was doing something on my laptop(i was charging it), there was a blackout that suddenly happened and my laptop didn't shutdown on a right way. So when the power got back, i already have this windows error recovery which has 2 options</p>
<p>(1. Launch start-up repair)</p>
<p>(2. Start windows normally.) </p>
<p>When i choose the first option, it loads up the repair and it takes almost an hour to finish and it asks me to restart but the error is still there.(sometimes it says the problem was not fix and i need to send it to microsoft)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i pick the 2nd option, it loads the windows image but not the windows itself, sometimes it goes on a blue screen then restart again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now i press the f8 but when i choose the other options there (e.g *last known good configuration *safe mode *safe mode with networking and others.) I get the blue screen error when i'm about to start the windows. In the start up options, i tried all the
 cmd commands (that i have found useful) but none of them worked. I cant try to use system restore because i have no restore point. I tried the windows memory diagnostic tool but it doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i tried the easy recovery essentials but unluckily my laptop doesn't recognize it, i putted it on a bootable usb (i followed the instructions on making a bootable usb here https://neosmart.net/wiki/easybcd/tips-and-tricks/easyre-recovery-usb/).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have system recovery disk and windows 7 installer but everytime i insert it on my laptop, my laptop doesn't recognize it. Instead it shows me the windows error recovery everytime!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me on how to fix my laptop, if there's no way of fixing it , then maybe you can just help me on how to rescue my files.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Hard Drive&nbsp;is OK, you should have a Recovery partition on there to reinstall the Operating System from,&nbsp;hoping that&nbsp;the rest of the Hardware in the Motherboard is OK.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>In the sony site you have given me, it says that after pressing f10 when the edit boot options shows up u just press enter directly. The site didn't mention any boot command that shall use after pressing f10. So I followed it and after pressing
 enter, it shows me the windows logo and it stays shown for 20 mins I think then boom, restart! I don't get the vaio care rescue the site mentioned.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>and one thing, u said I could just create system repair disk for this laptop, is the system repair disk and system recovery disk different from each other? And if I created the system repair disk, will the laptop read it? I have windows installer

            <p>I will try to make a repair disk as soon as I can. I don't really have computer right now and I'm using an iPad.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The sony recovery disk , they gave it to me as I had bought the laptop. And I haven't tried it to reinstall the OS. As I have said, my laptop doesn't recognize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And about changing the boot order, I'm sorry but I don't even know what it is. We'll you could give me an example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The results in the windows diagnostic memory tool? It doesn't finish actually, the loading bar stops and after half an hour, it doesn't move so I just restart instead. So I didn't have the results to it but now I will try it and I will reply to you the results.
 Actually there are 3 types of scan for me to choose(if I am right) what type of scan should I choose?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only thing that I haven't tried is pulling the hard drive. Can you give me a video tutorial in doing it so that I can't destroy my laptop when pulling the hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, u have mentioned that I can use knoppix. And I have visited the website and it says that it is a Linux boot cd. Are you sure this will work? It's free though but it has a large amount of size and if I wanna save myself from trouble, it's gonna cost
 almost 2 dollars, so before using this, I must assure that this will work.</p>

            Hi Wheeze, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Suspending processes then reactivating them can work or not, depending on how the process responds to the suspension.
<br />
<br />Probably the only surefire way to fix these errors would be to reboot. Try rebooting, then see if the processes are working again.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, let me know what specific processes you've suspended and I'll see if I can do more research on the  problem for you. Thanks!

            Hi
<br />In newer Windows 10 versions, windows automatically suspend processes if needed and resume them too.
<br />I don't think you have a need to suspend them manually.

<p>I'm having a similar problem, but it's happening automatically -&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's one game (app) that I'm playing, and on occasion, Windows 10 would automatically suspend it after launch - freezing it immediately and leaving my screen black.&nbsp; I'd have to use CTLR+ALT+DELETE to open task manager and kill the process.&nbsp; When this
 happens, relaunching it does nothing - Windows immediately suspends it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before, a reboot would allow me to play the game, but now even that's stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it's just suspending it - in the middle of using it!&nbsp; I'll be in the middle of clicking something while using the app, and Windows will suspend it while I'm using it, freezing the app completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using task manager will not resume it.</p>
<p>Using Process Explorer will not resume it - it shows active for less than 1 second and then it's back to suspended.</p>
<p><br />
How do I stop windows from doing this?</p>

<h2>            Corrupted graphics</h2>
                    Looks like whenever the system is rendering graphics they are corrupted. Most menus display fine and video on apps such as Netflix work ok but games are unplayable and even little things such as my avatar on the dashboard are massed up. Tried All the tips
 on the support page for display problems but I am thinking this is a problem with the gpu.

<p>Yes that would be a sign of a GPU hardware error.</p>

<p>Maybe it just has not tossed enough of an error to send the GPU into panic.</p>
<p>But not being able to play games is enough that it should be sent in for repair.</p>

    <title>How to Reset Local Security Policy Settings to Default in Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iamkrazashell  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Reset Local Security Policy Settings to Default in Windows XP from DOS</h2>
                    I goofed up my premissions for Windows XP (SP3). It was my old work computer and the company gave it to me when we upgraded our computer systems. I was given the Administrator password and reconfigured the system so I could use it at home. I later (3 months
 later) ran into HDrive low on space problems. So I went to delete the old User accounts and folders (except for Admin and mine). well I ran into *Access Denied* when trying to delete user folders. So I figured I'd change the permissions to allow my Administrator
 and My accounts to have permission (Full Access), but was still unable to delete those folders. So I decided (without thinking it threw) to just goahead and set full access on the Local Hard Drive C. It took a while to go threw every file on the computer.
 When it finished all my Icons on the desktop (Except the recycling bin) were gone. I realized I had majorly goofed. So I went to the start Menu to redo the permissions again, but found there were no programs at all Nothing was there except the shutdown button
 and log off buttons.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm at a loss because I don't have the Windows XP Pro Setup CD (because it was a bussiness designed computer) and it doesn't have a Factory restor option (because it was a bussiness build PC) Plus I don't want to loss all my work and programs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a fix I can do to restore or reset my permissions back so I can log back onto my PC?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm no computer geek, but I can run a program if I can do it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So in short I need to be able to fix it from the DOS or command prompt, because I can't login on my PC. It goes back to the login screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh BTW Will Windows 7 mess up my installed programs if I had to upgrade?</div>

<div>I read it over and over, but was completely lost.

<div>I'm not a IT pro nor even close to one, lol.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can't even get Windows to boot into DOS, much less try to reset my rights.</div>
<div>As my post states: "I" goofed up my permissions.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was trying to delete old stuff off, but wound up hanging Windows at the login.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can"t login to Windows (not a Server or Domain) Main Windows OS.</div>
<div>I know I have to reset the permissions, but I'm lost and the link made me even more so, lol.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you tell me in plain (non IT)&nbsp;English&nbsp;how I can restore my security to a working state?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Because I'm lost.</div>

<div>Thanks for the info though, I did read alot, lol.</div>

                    <p>original title: Windows Explorer will not pin to the taskbar.&nbsp; I've tried all these solutions...</p>
<p>Windows Explorer will not pin to the taskbar (or start menu either).&nbsp; The only right-click option is "Close Window".&nbsp; Dragging a folder to the taskbar only shows a red circle with a line through it.&nbsp; Other programs pin just fine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Registry search for "NoPinningToTaskbar" and "NoPinningToDestination" show no results.</li><li>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\lnkfile IsShortcut registry entry exists</li><li>"Store and display recently opened programs in the Start menu" option is checked</li><li>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations and<br />

            <p>Just to clear up a point,</p>
<p>Pressing the windows logo key and typing your search is using windows explorer,</p>
<p>Pinning windows explorer to the taskbar,</p>
<p>Are you referring to the yellow folder which really only opens the win-7 libraries page ?</p>
<p>Windows explorer is a vague term there are many listings on the start menu which can be referred to as windows explorer,</p>
<p>One would be the search box at the bottom of the start menu,</p>
<p>Right click the start button and select properties,</p>
<p>Customize button,</p>
<p>Most all of these listings are considered windows explorer, to me anyway ?</p>
<p>Then you have the Bing desktop search feature which is another story all together ;)</p>

            Yes, it's "the yellow folder".&nbsp; I know it's limited to the libraries page, but it also has a jump menu where I can pin other folders.&nbsp; I'm constantly in and out of folders, not having a shortcut to Windows Explorer is killing me!

            <p>Paste this into the start menu search box,</p>
<p>%windir%\explorer.exe</p>
<p>You should then be able to either right click and select Open file location or point at send to and click on (desktop) create shortcut,</p>
<p>And drag the desktop shortcut to your taskbar.</p>
<p>You need to create a shortcut before pin to taskbar is available.</p>
<p>If you made changes to your machine system restore to an earlier time might cure the issue faster.</p>

            <p>Hadn't thought of that one yet.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.&nbsp; I get the same red circle with a line through it ("No" symbol - there has to be a real name for it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-clicking the shortcut doesn't give me any pinning options, start menu nor taskbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a new install, so there is no system restore point to use.</p>

            <p>The red circle with the slash mark will usually disappear when you get to the taskbar/ destination.
</p>
<p>Click the start button and click on All programs,</p>
<p>Click on the accessories folder,</p>
<p>Is the yellow folder (window explorer)&nbsp;listed here ?</p>
<p>If so right click it and select Pin to taskbar.</p>
<p>If it's not listed in the accessories folder,</p>
<p>Drag the desktop shortcut to the start menu button, (do not release yet)</p>
<p>Wait a second and the start menu will popup, (do not release yet)</p>
<p>Then drag it to the accessories folder, (do not release yet)&nbsp;it will expand drag it down until you see a horizontal line between listings and then release/ drop.</p>
<p>Then right click it and select Pin to taskbar :)</p>

            <p>While I appreciate your effort, I think we're on different pages.&nbsp; If you read my original post, you'll notice that I've already answered your questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am an IT professional.&nbsp; Please assume I know things like dragging and dropping, what the start button is, etc.&nbsp; I'm sorry if I come across as a little grumpy, but I have literaly been working on this all day.&nbsp; I have been editing registry entries, booting
 to Mini XP with Hiren's boot disk&nbsp;to replace explorer.exe, and trying to actually get some work done at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't doubt your ablities, I just don't think you are familiar with this particular issue - it's widespread, just not enough for everyone to know about (probably because most users don't even know you can pin anything to the taskbar, so the&nbsp;issue is never
 raised).&nbsp; The solutions I've listed above were found scattered across different forums, each one worked for some people and not for others.&nbsp; My intention here was to start a thread for those, like me, who have tried ALL of these solutions and are still having
 this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who have come to this forum in search of an answer, you can try any one of the bullet points listed above.&nbsp; Some have had success with them.&nbsp; Sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanent (so far).&nbsp;&nbsp;The most popular fix, by far, was to delete all
 files in "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations"&nbsp;and reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have another solution?</p>

            <p>No worries.&nbsp; Like I said, I appreciate your effort (and quick at that).&nbsp; Thanks for the instructions on uploading pics too, I was actually wondering how I should go about that.&nbsp; I may put some together later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have access to our group policies.&nbsp; However, I do have 2 Win7 machines (same version)&nbsp;on my account.&nbsp; One can pin folders, the other can't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point in time, when I had a folder open and tried dragging another folder to that icon in the taskbar, it would say "Pin to Windows Explorer".&nbsp; But it still would not show up in the jump list.&nbsp; Right-clicking on the taskbar icon also had a "Pin to
 Taskbar" option, but it wouldn't stay pinned when I closed the window.&nbsp; Somewhere along the way I have lost those options as well.&nbsp; Now a right-click only shows "Close Window", and dragging any folder to the taskbar shows the red circle/slash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now I've put a folder shortcut (full of folder shortcuts!) in the links menu.&nbsp; It's Friday, I'm calling this "good enough for now". &nbsp; Sigh.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps resetting background file slideshow back to &#34;pictures&#34; folder</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and I am setting my background to run as a slideshow of the pictures I have in a folder called "wallpaper".&nbsp; It works for a few hours and then suddenly resets on it's own to my folder called "pictures".&nbsp; Every time I set it back to the
 folder "wallpaper", it automatically resets to the folder "pictures" after a few hours.&nbsp; It is very annoying!!!!!!!!!!

Just download the offline update to a usb stick, and follow the instructions on the website. If you don't have any of those, then asking a friend or using a library computer will work just as good.</p>

</p><div>----------------------Original post--------------------------------------</div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since I moved Windows Search folder to another drive, I can't run any msc or regedit from start menu search (cortana) anymore.</p>
<p>No error message, just loading circle on mouse cursor then nothing, consoles don't show in taskmanager either.</p>
<p>However I can run services.msc this way... And Perfmon if I don't add .msc.</p>
<p>Still can run all msc through Win+R.</p>
<p>Index wipe+rebuild, user/search folder wipe, sfc /scannow: no success.</p>
<p>Reinstalled 10 pro from scratch, as soon as I moved search folder and reboot, it breaks again.</p>
<p>I can keep tearing my hair out, I don't understand what's wrong.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

</p><p>Tried automatic repair, it failed.</p>
<p>In SrtTrail.txt, everything correctly ended, but last lines (approx translation):</p>

</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Initial cause found:<br />
---------------------------<br />
OS version is not compatible with system restart tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I've (once more) reinstalled Win10 from scratch and this time I didn't move Search folder but only user folders.</p>
<p>And problem occurs.</p>
<p>S0 I said a mistake: it's not Windows Search folder moving that causes this problem.</p>
<p>I think it's either user folders move, or index reconstruction.</p>
<p>I keep on reinstalling/testing to find the cause (and, I hope, also the solution).</p>

            <p>Hi Sachin, you're very brave trying to solve a problem that's already self-solved :p</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the fun:</p>
<p>1/ Two custom PC and one old HP laptop.</p>
<p>2/ For the towers: USB Win10 install tool made with official 10586 home+pro iso and rufus (mbr for uefi, fat32); for the laptop which can't boot from USB drives: official 10240 home+pro DVD.</p>
<p>3/ Towers: boot from uefi usb, delete all partitions on system ssd, install. For the laptop: boot from DVD, delete all partitions except data one, install. I like it clean.</p>
<p>4/ Nope. As I said, there was loading circle for a split second then nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I forgot to mention, is this error occured only when using "enter".</p>
<p>I mean the combo "win, regedit, enter" failed, while the combo "win, regedit, clic on regedit" worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bug is obviously one of the many that comes with Win10 which, being honest, is not what one can call an RTM.</p>

    <title>Surface book not consistently recognizing peripherals connected to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cdh228  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface book not consistently recognizing peripherals connected to Dock.</h2>
                    <p>I have a fully up to date Surface Book. I have new Surface Dock with a Samsung UHD monitor connected via Display Port, wireless Microsoft keyboard/mouse dongle, and external hard drive connected to it. Even thought the small white light on the Dock connector
 always comes on when I connect it to the Surface Book, it is very inconsistent in which peripherals it recognizes. Sometimes the Dock will recognize all, sometimes just the monitor and external drive, but not the keyboard/mouse and usually just the keyboard/mouse
 and external drive but not the monitor. The Surface Book via the Dock always seems to recognize the monitor (because the monitor will flash up that it recognizes a DisplayPort connection when I connect the Book to Dock, but more often than not the extrernal&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;screen
 will be black. Other times it works fine, or if I connect and reconnect the Dock to the Book, it sometimes then operates all peripherals, but not always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when the Surface Book is sleeping but still connected to the dock, the monitor will turn on and off every few minutes which is very annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to fix would be appreciated. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>In regards to the external displays flashing on and off, I found a post for <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfdrivers/surface-pro-4-screen-flashes-with-dock/0e87aa45-50ed-4d0a-a67c-1beef19a71be">
SP4</a> that might help.</p>
<p>It was suggested that using active adapters instead of passive ones might help with this behavior.&nbsp; Have you tried that&nbsp;at some point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Western Digital Elements Desktop External HD NOT being seen by Windows 10</h2>
                    My Western Digital Elements Desktop External drive is not being seen by my PC since I had to update to Windows 10. &nbsp;This seems to be a major problem for many Western Digital drive owners. &nbsp;Have there been ANY sort of driver updates to fix this issue? &nbsp;This
 is my primary back up for my PC and I need this to work going forward. &nbsp;Right now it is just a very expensive brick.

            Hey there :)<br />
<br />
Have you tried the drive on another computer with another OS? It wouldn't hurt to try the drive on other USB ports with a different cable just to be on the safe side that this is not this type of a problem. If you get the drive to be recognized on another system
 I would recommend downloading and running <a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=w1tdr9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic</a> tool and make sure the drive passes both the quick and the extensive tests. &nbsp;This way you can rule out any problems with the drive, which is a good thing to do whenever you are doing such type of troubleshooting.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You may try reverting to an older version of the OS if the data is critical. Contacting the MS live support is also a good idea. :)<br />
<br />
Post back with some test results! :)<br />
<br />
Captain_WD.

<h3> curtnv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one Kinect adapter</h2>
                    <p>recently I purchased a Kinect to go with the Xbox one s and you are sold out of a $35 Kinect adapter and you can find them on eBay for around $300 and up. Is the Kinect being discontinued or something. I donât understand why this plug is sooo hard to get. Please let me know.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thx Curt</p>

            <p>The Kinect has been discontinued as CrazY1985 has said and the adapter is no longer produced as well. They can be found on Amazon and marketplaces and the reason the prices on places like eBay is so high is a classic supply and demand. The supply is low and the demand is high so prices are inflated. I'm in the same boat after picking up the One X and keeping my old Kinect. Hopefully, over time as people with the adapter don't sell them due to the price they're asking, it'll come down to slightly more affordable prices though likely still more than when the adapter was sold by Microsoft. <br /></p>

            <p>Microsoft lies and deceit. I bought an xb1x and there was no adapter in the box. I cannot use my Kinect. This is BS. I thought $40 was overpriced for an adapter, $300 is absurd. Thank you Microsoft for screwing me over with no warning of discontinuing the adapter as well. You said the XB1X would support all of our accessories including the Kinect. Now you're going back on your word. You owe us all adapters the same as the Xboxone S.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Store Says not Connected to the Internet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Store Says not Connected to the Internet</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>So basically when I try to launch the Microsoft Store, it says "Check your connection. Microsoft Store needs to be online. It looks like you're not." And then it displays an error code of&nbsp;Code: 0x80072EFD. This is having an affect on other apps I have downloaded
 from the store, saying that I don't have internet connection, even though I do have clear and full connection, as I am writing this message. I have tried troubleshooting my internet connection, updating my computer, doing that cache reset thing, and nothing
 seems to work. Sometimes when I troubleshoot, it says that I am not logged into my Microsoft Account, and I double check online and even on my settings on my computer and I am definitely logged in. It's just very frustrating and I am hoping there is something
 that I missed or am not doing that can help resolve this issue. Thanks in advance!</p>
