</p><p>Hi Hans --</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same issue and it just surfaced after the update from Win10 1703 to 1709.&nbsp; Been using SFB for some time (Win7 and Win10), and it has always started running minimized without fail.&nbsp; Now, since the 1709 update, SFB will always start in the
 foreground despite *not* having that option checked.&nbsp; I have the Tracing folder (full details), zipped and ready to send, just need to have access to your PM or FTP.</p>

</p><p><span>Hi RGCurtis,</span></p>

</p><p><span>After further investigation, we found out this symptom is related to&nbsp;<span><span>"Let the Skype for Business automatically start while the Windows starts" option. Skype for Business will be run at foreground if this option i</span></span><span>s</span><span>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in the previous PM, I originally did not have SFB in shell:startup, but instead removed the option to start with windows.&nbsp; That removed the reg HKCU run command and I added the shortcut in shell:startup.&nbsp; This yielded no change -- SFB still
 started in the foreground (although that option was not checked).<br />
</p>
<p>I therefore reverted back to 'status quo' and removed the shortcut in shell:startup and re-checked the 'start with windows' option in SFB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, I have nothing in my shell:startup.&nbsp; SFB starts via HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run with a string value of "Lync" and Value data of ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\lync.exe" /fromrunkey".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not add this manually, selecting the SFB option to 'Automatically start the app when I log into Windows" creates this Run reg entry.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Product ID number has expired. What does this mean&#63;</h2>
                    When I started the form for getting email help from Microsoft I was asked for my OS and then the Product ID.&nbsp; I got a message saying that it had expired. What are the reasons and implication of this. Do all PIDs expire after a certain time so that free
 support is no longer available. Does it mean my copy of Windows is not genuine? Thanks for any help and enlightenment!

Retail Product IDs are good for 90 days of free support.They expire after 90 days, this does not mean your Windows is non-genuine.<br />

<div>Hey. In a few days I can say that I think I can find a solution. it's just insane, but it works). So, let's begin:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Download the latest drivers (25.20.100.6519) from Intel here https://downloadcenter.intel.com/en/download/28514/Intel-Graphics-Windows-10-DCH-Drivers:</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Go to Device Manager, select Display Adapter, then Intel Graphics 620, then "Remove Device", then select "delite the driver software" and click "Delete."</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. disconnect from the Internet (this is necessary, because after restarting Windows, trys downloading and installing the native driver from Microsoft) and restarting the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. After rebooting, you should see the “primary driver” in the device manager, everything is fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Go to the downloaded driver 25.20.100.6519.exe and install the new drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. reboot</div>
<div><br />
<div>7. Go to the Microsoft store and install the "Intel controle panale" - it does not work, everything is in order. On my surface of Pro 6, when I try to launch the Intel Control Control Panale, it does not start, just nothing happens, there are no errors,
 there are no alarming words.</div>
<div><br />
<div>8. Go to the settings-update-Windows update, check the update. Windows will find drivers for our video adapter. (these are Microsoft's old 24.xxx drivers). Let Windows download and install this old driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>9. Do not reboot, go back to the Device Manager-Display Adapter. Right-click on the Intel 620, then go to Driver Properties and click Roll Back Driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>10. After the “driver rollback” the driver version should be 25.20.100.6519, which we installed earlier.</div>
<div><br />
<div>11. Try to launch the Intell control panel - it will start and will work well!</div>

<div>Hey. In a few days I can say that I think I can find a solution. it's just insane, but it works). So, let's begin:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Download the latest drivers (25.20.100.6519) from Intel here https://downloadcenter.intel.com/en/download/28514/Intel-Graphics-Windows-10-DCH-Drivers:</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Go to Device Manager, select Display Adapter, then Intel Graphics 620, then "Remove Device", then select "delite the driver software" and click "Delete."</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. disconnect from the Internet (this is necessary, because after restarting Windows, trys downloading and installing the native driver from Microsoft) and restarting the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. After rebooting, you should see the “primary driver” in the device manager, everything is fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Go to the downloaded driver 25.20.100.6519.exe and install the new drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. reboot</div>
<div><br />
<div>7. Go to the Microsoft store and install the "Intel controle panale" - it does not work, everything is in order. On my surface of Pro 6, when I try to launch the Intel Control Control Panale, it does not start, just nothing happens, there are no errors,
 there are no alarming words.</div>
<div><br />
<div>8. Go to the settings-update-Windows update, check the update. Windows will find drivers for our video adapter. (these are Microsoft's old 24.xxx drivers). Let Windows download and install this old driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>9. Do not reboot, go back to the Device Manager-Display Adapter. Right-click on the Intel 620, then go to Driver Properties and click Roll Back Driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>10. After the “driver rollback” the driver version should be 25.20.100.6519, which we installed earlier.</div>
<div><br />
<div>11. Try to launch the Intell control panel - it will start and will work well!</div>
</blockquote>
I got as far as device manager after running the intel driver, it just gave me operating system is not supported. File Version 2.11.15.0 ( dch 25.20.100.65.19_)<br />

</blockquote>
<p>I'm on 1809 oddly I now see the HD control panel in the start bar/nav bar however the version is still .24 not .25 meaning that it isn't currently using&nbsp; DCH variant drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games and any graphics based apps are crashing within 4-10 minutes average such as Warcraft 3, Starcraft Remastered and Diablo 2 including Hearthstone and Yu Gi Oh duel links.</p>
<p>
</p><p>no change across any I tried rolling back the driver check for updates did not work, I then tried again using device manager but it didn't update to .25 so currently stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the surface repair tool as per agents advice didn't help either, and when it said your surface may have an issue and it did not fix it haven't heard back since.</p>

            i think something wrong with your system if you cant install intel drivers in device manager. first of all you should install 25.xx driver and then solve the problem of Controle panel as i wrote. Try to reinstall windows, i think there is no another way.

<p>Which update is this? Could you provide the KB number?</p>
<p>If its Windows 7 SP1, please read the following:</p>
<p>If possible, boot into Safe Mode, and do a System Restore before you installed the Service Pack and reference the information I have provided below with instructions about how to install Windows 7 SP1.</p>
<p>Microsoft released the first beta back in June 2010 followed by a Release Candidate late October 2010 and the final RTM availability (February 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2011 MSDN/TechNet subscribers) and public Availability (February 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; 2011). Unlike
 previous Service Packs, Windows 7 SP1 does not contain any major improvements; it’s basically a rollup of updates that have been released for the operating system since it went to manufacturing July 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; 2009. If you have been diligently updating
 your computer through Windows Update since then, you basically have all that SP1 has to offer.</p>
<p>Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy to<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backup
 your computer</a> . The built in system imaging and backup and restore center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method
 carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. </li><li>Accept User Account Control permission </li><li>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, proceed with the installation. </li></ul>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD </li><li>Click ‘Run as Administrator’ </li><li>At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f </li></ul>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

    <title>Permanently available in latest Skype for Android - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelgrovesdyce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permanently available in latest Skype for Android</h2>
                    <p>No matter how I go about it, my Android Skype shows I am permanently available. I put my status as
<strong>invisible</strong>, <strong>sign out</strong> of my account, <strong>close the Skype app</strong>, and
<strong>turn off the machine</strong>. Guess what? I still show as available to other people, even after giving the servers a few hours to update themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype was taken over by Microsoft <strong>on-line/available status</strong> indication seems to be something they cannot get right. It makes contacting someone a hit or miss process - downright irritating, though not the end of the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been ok for a while, but in the last few days it's back to its old tricks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seeing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike.</p>

    <title>System Restore Deleted My Personal Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrkime  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Restore Deleted My Personal Files</h2>
                    
Today is 12/26/09 and I added a new folder and pictures onto a secondary harddrive (D:) on my PC and set one of the pictures as my desktop wallpaper. 

I then changed the date of my computer to 3/11/08  and then noticed I needed to do a system restore to an earlier date (12/23/09) of this year. 

Once the computer rebooted, my PC was still set in 2008, which cleared all my recent 2009 restore points. I also noticed that the folder and pictures originally placed on the additional harddrive were completely missing (i've tried to search every way I could - I remember one of the pictures had the words "eyes" in the title). However, the photo that I set as my desktop wallpaper is still currently being displayed. When I look at the display properties, it does not show what the file name is though....it just highlights a different picture. 

This leads me to think the folder and pictures may still be on my computer, but I don't know if they are hidden or something? Is there a way to research where the desktop display properties is actually linking to the file currently being displayed as my background wallpaper (the "eyes" pictures)? <br /><br />Oh, and I've changed the date of my computer back to 2009.

            the same thing happened to me, i downloaded a free recovery program, got the files back and tried to copy them back to my desktop, a window then asked if i wanted to replace the same files in the folder, which meant that they were just hidden, for windows
 7 if you go into your computer, click the organize button then folder and search options, close to the bottom it says "show all folders" with a check box, click it then go to where you had the files/folders and they will be somewhat transparent, right click
 on the file/folder and select properties, at the bottom it will have two check boxes, one with "read only' and the other with "hidden" uncheck both and click apply, a window will appear, select "apply changes to this folder, subfolders and files" hit OK and
 OK, then do the same to the next till you have your files back<br />

    <title>Recover Microsoft Account using Gamertag&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lwfreedom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recover Microsoft Account using Gamertag&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I apologize if this isn't the right area for this topic, the Xbox forums have changed drastically since i last used them and i'm finding navigation a little more difficult than i remember.</p>

<p>A few days ago i decided it was time to change my Gamertag to a name i use to identify myself across all other platforms, only to remember that i created a 'throw away gamertag' with that name approximately 6 years ago. Simple solution right? Delete the
 account, or change the gamertag on that account so i can use it on my current one. The only problem is that the last time i logged in to that account was in the same year i created it.</p>

<p>The profile has long since been removed from my Xbox's, and due to lack of foresight i never attached the account's email to any of the email addresses i use on a daily basis. I know the gamertag, chances are i could remember the password, but i don't know
 the email address attached to the account. I have searched the internet for a solution and checked microsoft/xbox support (this
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-CA/my-account/microsoft-account/forgot-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/en-CA/my-account/microsoft-account/forgot-microsoft-account</a> does not apply to me as i do not have the profile on any of my consoles and i never sent any emails using the account's address,) to no avail.</p>

<p>I recall there was a support email address some time ago that i have used to address account issues in the past, however i can't seem to find that information in the contact us area of the support page any longer, so i turn to the forums.</p>

<p>Down to the question at hand. With the information provided, is there a way i can find out the email address i used to create that old profile so that i may login and free up that gamertag for use on my current profile?</p>

<p>I know i could get an answer quicker via phone or chat support, but i much prefer email (or forum) if possible as my experiences via email support in the past have been far superior to the phone support.</p>

<p><strong>Down to the question at hand. With the information provided, is there a way i can find out the email address i used to create that old profile so that i may login and free up that gamertag for use on my current profile?</strong></p>
<p>Hey there&nbsp;<strong>LWFreedom,</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately if you don't know the e-mail to the account, there's no way to access it without&nbsp;<strong>calling Microsoft support</strong>&nbsp;and having them try to validate the information you give to them. They will then ask you a few questions, and if you
 answer them correctly they will give you your e-mail.</p>
<p>So give Xbox a&nbsp;<strong>call at 1-8004MYXBOX</strong>, and tell them this: Hey my gamer-tag is (<strong>Your Gamer-Tag</strong>) and I don't remember which email&nbsp;I used. You can also Contact Them by
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clicking Here</a>.</p>

<p>Surely there has to be another way to sort this out through support? I don't really have all that much time for phone calls, and short of having Telephobia i am not at all comfortable speaking to people on the phone. As i mentioned in my original post, there
 was once an email address one could contact support through, and i have used said address to sort out account related issues in the past, but i cannot seem to find that address any longer. Perhaps they no longer use it?</p>
<p>I do appreciate you taking the time to respond to my post, Pr1nce Darkness, and welcome a solution from any others that think they may be able to help.</p>

<h2>            Error with internet</h2>
                    <p>I was getting the error DLG_FLAGS_CERT_CN_INVALID. I tried clearing everything and it didnt fix it. I got so frustrated with it i just did a reinstall of windows. After that it was taking me to the xfinity website and telling me to activate my internet.
 That didnt work either. I called the internet provider and they said everthing is working. There is another Computer in the house That is connected to a router and it works fine. I tried getting a wireless receiver to connect to the router of the computer
 that works but it still didnt fix it. I gave up and got a new computer. The new computer is doing the exact same thing as soon as i turned it on. So it cant be a problem with the computer. I have no idea how to fix this but it cant be the computer. I tried
 a different ethernet cable and a different modem. &nbsp;Can anyone give me any idea what to do?</p>

            &nbsp;Since i just built a new computer because i couldnt get the old one fixed. The computer says i have an internet connection. The problem is as soon as i open the browser it takes me to the xfinity website and tells me to activate my account. But the account
 is active. I am on my phone right now connected with the wireless. I even bought a wireless receiver and tried that but it still takes me straight to the xfinity website. &nbsp;I tried chaning the modem and ethernet cable. The only thing I havent changed is the
 coaxial cable. But since it does the same thing with the wireless I dont think that can be the problem. Unless once the problem was in the computer trying with wireless didnt matter. It is a brand new computer i just built myself. I called xfinity and they
 had no idea how to fix it. And the old error message i was getting with the other computer it didnt matter what website i went to it gave me the error no matter which site i went to.&nbsp;

<p>Hey guys, I bought $10 dollars worth(the 35,000 VC and the 15,000 VC) of VC since they were having the sale for Gold Members, but now that I've bought it, it isn't showing that I have anymore VC than I had before? I've already restarted my xbox and restarted
 NBA about 5 times now, but the VC still isn't showing up. Any fixes to this problem??</p>

<p>I'm looking for a similar solution, you better check your bank statement. I meant to buy $40 worth. 20$ on each account.. &nbsp;I tried it twice in my xbox gold account, then I have another one account I use for MyTeam, and tried it twice, after all tries a box
 popped up saying. "Purchase Canceled"</p>
<p>Annoyed of the issue and wanting to flip a few cards before I went to bed, I tried one last time. I had just turned on netflix, and then realized I needed to post a certain card worth a lot of money for 24 hours to ensure it sells. As I go back on the screen
 and what do ya know theres like 125000 VC coins. I didn't want that many, after checking my bank account via da interweb, I saw I was charged for every attempted purchase even thought it said it was canceled.. Any ideas you hear please share, whack spending
 a $100+ dollars, when I wanted to spend $20.</p>

<h2>            xBox One Blu Ray Software Does not Up Convert DVDs</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a thread or discussion about if or when they are going to upgrade the Blu Ray player software to up-convert DVDs? &nbsp;I have seen 480i at best come out of Xbox one when playing my DVDs. I had a PS3 and the movies looked great. Depending on how well
 the original DVD was encoded I could get as good as I feel like I have been transported back to VHS days.</p>

<p>Since 480i over HDMI is not supported by any device I would say you have other issues with your setup. The Xbox One only outputs 720P and 1080P over HDMI so it is either one or the other.

<p>Mine plays fine too. In fact from my eyes the pucture quality is better than playing it on my 360 slim. I use a sony kdl40ex720 fullHD led 3d tv. I have sea patrol and terra nova on dvd. Im sure ur hdtv does some up converting too. And xb1 has bwtter hardware
 than 360.</p>

<p>Check the inputs on your TV, my Hannspree TV required me to plug my HDMI into input 3 to get the best picture. My Xbox 360 and Ps3 work best on the first input, it's weird but some TVs have different settings per input and you just need to find the input
 that displays 1080p whenever you hit the "info" button on your remote.</p>

            <p>seriously? is that an official answer to the "windows 10 upgrade will not work"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>during the process, in my case repeated at least 10 times over the past few days, my system was checked and rechecked for compatibility, for readiness, for "good to go-ness", it was sickening. but every time, it failed and trying to find out WHY has been
 a torture that i cannot bear to endure another time. and THIS sounds like 10 steps harsher torture than all those other fails. my nerves and patience have run out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>why is microsoft not releasing FIXES THAT WORK to address all these fails and instead making amateurs like myself attempt to mess with the guts of the system just to get this wonderful windows 10 system to work? some people thought the ACA rollout was a
 disaster! but if microsoft, the very last word in computer programming, can't do better than this, then there is no hope at all for anything better than the mess so many of us are in with this "update". we are just stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked at ibm the very day the first personal computers were put in use for a business, and worked on countless systems there for decades after that, not to mention countless types of hardware. but I have never been in a mess like this over what should
 be either a relatively painless upgrade, or else a whole new operating system where you start from scratch. it seems microsoft invested a huge amount of resources in the hype aspect prior to the actual rollout, stressing the wonderful ease of it, and how microsoft
 had it all figured out so it would be just another windows update that we are all familiar with - instead of delving deep enough to actually anticipate these fails and address them ahead of time - at least HAVE A CLUE when they happened. but what i have seen
 so far as to how to work around these error codes, has been just string and duct tape. some things seem to work for some folks. but i am probably a bit more computer literate than most people, and so far i havent seen anything i consider actual solutions coming
 from microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have a brand new laptop and i do not think it wise to mess with bios or other innards, not without what i consider better authority than i have seen anywhere, so far. where is microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>it disgusts and disappoints me to say it but i am ready to just give it up and stick with 8.1 until this whole thing clears up, if it ever does.</p>

But they're all driver related.<br />
<br />
Some PC's using intel CPU's can't boot into the winpe (safe.os) install enviroment because of mcupdate_GenuineIntell.dll that was released in June,<br />
<br />
Some PC's using Broadcom wifi adapters can't update with the adapter installed do to a similar issue with the included wifi device drivers in both the boot.wim and install.wim/esd<br />
<br />
My I3H-4010 based PC fails because of the former, if i remove the microcode update from the boot.wim, i can then boot into the install environment, confirming the reason in this case, but as install.wim/esd is encryped i can't revert that file to an older version
 taken from technical preview 10130 or earlier (prior to intel rolling out the new microcode) so after reboot the device fails to boot and reverts to the initial operating system,<br />
<br />
<br />
Upgrading from within windows bypasses the microcode file within boot.wim, but then after&nbsp;<br />
the restart the boot fails and reverts to the initial OS.<br />
<br />
There is nothing that automatic repair can help with precisely because it contains the files that are causing the installation failures to begin with.<br />
<br />
<br />
either an ISO needs to be released with&nbsp;<br />
reverted 'safe' drivers/microcode<br />
new drivers/microcode<br />
or hardware providers need to supply bios updates to get around this issue.<br />

            I have had this problem on my wife Acer laptop from the start of windows preview, once the iso was released &nbsp;for the next new version I could do a clean install and it worked OK. I am not really sure why we cannot use our licence key of our win 7/8 to
 do a clean install &nbsp;Microsoft have been no help with this so not sure where this leaves us. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>My problem is slightly different. The Windows to upgrade to Windows 10 is Windows 7 (32) Professional (italian version). The phases up to preparation of the installation following the download is fine, but when lancing the windows 10 installation it proceed
 up to 60-70 % and then suddenly the PC shut down. When reopening Windows Update the following appears (last attempt):</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dd7995f-3309-4df5-a211-e768b84501ba" /></p>
<p>In the first attempt, the rebout after the PC shut down was followed by the lance of the diagnostic tools before launching of windows (still 7) that was not concluded because of another sudden shut down. In fact the concerned PC is an old one characterized
 to be the only one I still have at 32 bit that has the main purpose to keep running Money &nbsp;2000 with al family accounting of the last 16 years I hesitate to convert in the format of a new 64-bit accounting program. An alternative could be to create a 32-bit
 partition on the new PC Lenovo Thinkpad T540p (in parallel to the main 64-bit partition) (and abandoning the al PC) but I have no idea how to proceed in this direction.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure UEFI boot is selected in the BIOS (not legacy nor both).</p>
<p>It did the trick on my Lenovo Thinkpad X121e</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, because of dual boot (Kubuntu) on my laptop, I had to use Boot-Repair bootable usb key to write a new MBR booting on windows partition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After complete windows10 update, I changed boot setting back to "both" and restored initial Grub bootloader with Boot-Repair. I know UEFI boot is possible with Grub but this way seemed easier and more secure to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this will help.</p>

    <title>How to Search after Hiding Search Bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davewave_  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Search after Hiding Search Bar</h2>
                    After installing Windows 10, I hid the search bar because I wanted to save space on my taskbar. However, I do not know how to search my computer&nbsp;after hiding the search bar. I want to find another way to search my computer without having to show the search
 icon or search bar on the taskbar. Shouldn't the search bar&nbsp;be found IN the&nbsp;Start menu itself? I found out that when I opened my Start menu and started typing a word, the search function would automatically pop up. However, if I opened my Start menu and accidentally
 clicked anywhere in the Start menu just once and starting typing the word, the search function would not pop up. Therefore, I had to close the Start menu and reopen it again, making sure not to click anywhere in the Start menu, to let the Search function pop
 up by itself again when I started typing. Is there a way to allow the search function to automatically pop up even after I pressed anywhere on the Start menu without having the search icon or search bar

            <p>Hi Bruce, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Blue Screen errors (also sometimes called black screen errors or STOP code errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says, "Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your
 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These errors can be caused by both hardware and software problems. If you added new hardware to your PC&nbsp; before the Blue Screen error, shut down your PC, remove the hardware, and try restarting. If you're having trouble restarting, you can start (boot) your
 PC in safe mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disconnect any external devices connected to the PC. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do get back to us for any issues pertaining to Windows in the future. We will be happy to help.</span></p>

<h2>            Previous frame button skips 20-30 frames intead of one</h2>
                    I finally figured out how to move from frame to frame in Windows Media Player (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-playback-speed-in-Windows-Media-Player); however, when I use the "Previous frame" button, it doesn't seem to be working properly.
 It skips back 20-30 frames instead of one. Going forward works fine.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete a file  Error code 0x80070570</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 on my laptop. &nbsp;Recently when I tried to run Google Chrome I got a message telling me Internet Security Prevented one or more files being opened. &nbsp;I tried several things to solve this problem without any luck so I tried uninstalling
 and reinstalling Chrome. &nbsp;The reinstallation failed. &nbsp;I found that the old Chrome executable was still on the system and when I tried to delete it I got Error 0x80070570.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the check disc on the C drive and it found a problem. &nbsp;I ran the repair and restart option and the computer restarted OK. &nbsp;However, check disc tells me there is still a problem and I get the same error message when I try and delete the Chrome executable.
 &nbsp;I ran the disc repair function again with the same results. &nbsp;</p>

            See if you can delete the folder containing the problem file. If that doesn't work, check Device Manager for the make of your hard drive. Every drive manufacturer provides their own utility to thoroughly test their products for errors.

            I had already tried deleting the folder and I got the same error message.&nbsp; I'll try the manufacturer as you suggest.&nbsp; I also found a third party freebie called Recuva that claims to be able to recover corrupted files.&nbsp; Do you know if that is worth a try?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Recuva is meant for data recovery, such as when you delete files by mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since chkdsk keeps indicating that there are corrupt file records, it's best to run the HDD manufacturer's utility to mark any underlying bad sectors, then if required a quick chkdsk (without bad sector detection) can be run to fix any NTFS/file system errors.
 Finally either the corrupt file will have already been removed, or else it should be possible to get rid of it normally.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all your help. I think I have solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hard drive is a Samsung/Seagate so I was going to download the Seagate Seatools utility to scan it. &nbsp;I was a bit concerned about the warnings about what would happed if the drive failed the test. &nbsp;It seemed to suggest that the drive would then be unusable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, for some reason, I tried changing the name of the Google Chrome folder that contains the corrupt file. &nbsp;I just changed it to Dummy and it let me do it. &nbsp;I was now able to reinstall Google Chrome and I am back in business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I really ought to still download and run Seatools to check the rest of the drive but not being too confident maybe I'll see how things go first. &nbsp;If it works don't fix it!</p>

<p>No, the drive won't become unusable, but a failed test would definitely indicate major problems and the results can be used to open an RMA case with Seagate if the drive's still under warranty.</p>

    <title>BSOD Playing Maplestory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darksteel88  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD Playing Maplestory</h2>
                    <p>So I started playing Maplestory for the first time in years recently, and I've gotten a slew of BSODs while playing it. Here's some precursor information on the system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboard: ASUS Z87-A</p>
<p>CPU: i5-4670k</p>
<p>GPU: AMD Radeon R9 270X</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB</p>
<p>HD: 120GB SSD, 3TB External&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monitors: 2@1680x1050</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maplestory is installed on my external drive through Steam. All drivers on the system have been updated (most definitely the display driver) and all Windows recommended updates applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maplestory only runs at a maximum resolution of 1366x768, so it forces my resolution to change while running. Additionally, the loading screen resolution is lower than the game resolution, so it must change at least twice while loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on to the issue, I've gotten about a dozen or so BSODs while running. There doesn't seem to be any correlation between what causes it and what doesn't cause it. It seemed to be most prevalent when I was tabbing out of the game, but it has happened on
 the loading screen and while playing the game as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I observe two different BSODs when playing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA - bugcheck code: 0x00000050</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION - bugcheck code: 0x0000003b</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the BSODs are with win32k.sys and all point to ntoskrnl as the faulting location. I had thought it might be a display driver issue, but as far as I can tell the crash never points to it. That's not to say it isn't causing it but it's not something I
 can easily determine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had better success not crashing while closing basically everything. When only Chrome + Skype + Maplestory were open, BSODs were less frequent (though still occurred). This involved me closing Razer Synapse, Razer Comms, VLC Streamer, Hamachi, LOLRecorder,
 and Rainmeter. I have also been setting the resolution to 1366x768 prior to playing the game so the resolution doesn't have to change when I alt+tab or load the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Maplestory is known to be plagued with BSOD's. I am not sure if the developers have ever had any comments to make regarding it, etc.

    <title>STOP&#58; 0x0000001A MEMORY MANAGEMENT on Windows XP Home 2002 SP3 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            STOP&#58; 0x0000001A MEMORY MANAGEMENT on Windows XP Home 2002 SP3</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to install new memory in my Dell Dimension 5150 (DM051) which currently has the OEM 256k chips in each of four slots.&nbsp; When I replace with 1GB chips in each of slots 1 and 2 (white tabs), I encounter stop errors on boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First attempt gives me the MEMORY MANAGEMENT STOP: 0x0000001A (with four more codes in the parens) and on a subequent attempt (after Windows tells me it recovered from a serious error), it will give STOP: 0x0000008E blue screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I put the old memory back in, it seems to work ok (I used system restore to revert back to stable point, then ran all system updates and updated to BIOS A07 before trying again).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to upgrade memory and keep a stable environment??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Try booting the computer in safe mode and check if the issue still persists, refer the below link to boot to safe mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> I would suggest you to perform clean boot from safe mode and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer the link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not persist you may continue with
<b>step 2 </b>from the above link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Make sure you reset the computer to normal mode after the troubleshooting completes. Refer the section “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state”</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>You may also refer the article mentioned below for more information:</p>

            <p>&gt; Safe mode worked fine</p>
<p>&gt; Clean Boot was working fine (didn't do too much, but ran Internet Explorer briefly)</p>
<p>&gt; Upon reseting to normal (via MSCONFIG), the system stopped (blue screen) with 0x0000008E error before&nbsp;logging into Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also mention, I thought an "OEM" McAfee installation might have been causing some trouble (I was getting an error message before I used system restore earlier), so I ran their removal tool (MCPR.exe).&nbsp; Not sure if that helped any, since I am still
 getting an error on Normal boot.&nbsp; I did not see the 0x0000001A error this time, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not pursue the last link as I am on SP3 not SP2.&nbsp; But perhaps I should?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What else can I do to debug?&nbsp; Do the other codes in the parenthesis help after the 0x0000008E help?</p>
<p>(0xc0000005, 0x8054B10D, 0xA7c44B50, 0x00000000)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this corrects the issue then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then get any updated drivers\software for the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> You may refer the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles which addresses similar issue.</p>

            <div>One one think this has to do with some driver since when I booted in Safe and also clean, the system seemed to work.<br />
<br />
I removed all four old memory boards, loaded 1 new 1.0 GB board into slot 1 and booted on the Memtest86+ CD and wham-o, red lines of errors all day.<br />
<br />
Now I am doing the same process on the second new 1.0 GB board in slot 1 and Memtest86+ is running. Just getting started, but no errors like the other one.<br />
<br />
Seemed too easy. so I tested the first one again (make sure it wasn't just seated poorly).&nbsp; Still failed.&nbsp; Crucial replaced the memory right away and now I am running fine.</div>

            You need to identify the new RAM. It might be incompatible with your motherboard.
<div><br />
<div>Also, 4 x 256MB = 1GB.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1GB of RAM is more than most XP users need (that is, it is plenty). Why do you think you need more? Do you run memory-intensive programs like photo and/or video editing programs?</div>

            I'd suggest that you first backup your stuff and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise. Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).
 &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Then, here's the procedure:<br />
- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
- Select everything [b]EXCEPT FOR[/b] "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
Then select all drivers [b]NOT[/b] provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Finish" on the next page.<br />
<br />
Reboot the system and [b][u]wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen[/u][/b]. Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing
 the drivers out.&nbsp; If it doesn't crash for you, then [u]let it run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation[/u] (an estimate on my part).<br />
<br />
If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to remove the cyclopes&#47;smiley on log in screen</h2>
                    I am getting <strong>highly disturb </strong>by this cyclopes/smiley or all see eyeing on my login screen. The sight of it makes me want to revert back to win 7. Please get ride of it or give me the option to create something else or use something else.
 I am feeling so strong about it because it is personally bearing to me that this OS is a general operating system for individuals of different belief or&nbsp;background. It may or may not have been your intention to make in a subtle way&nbsp;bring a little light&nbsp;on
 a&nbsp;meaning of specific&nbsp;symbol &amp; because<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I don't want to out right judge you</span> I will stick around until&nbsp;a certain time.
<strong>But if this is taken lightly </strong>then I will be among the number of people who I am sure are&nbsp;out their, who will no longer see&nbsp;windows 10 or so.
<strong>NEEED TO HAVE THIS REMOVE OR CHANGE!</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>It wont affect my data?I dont care about data, users keep most of data on servers, So your suggesting i do refresh on 10+ and God knows how many more computers, which deletes all installed software?Means i need to reinstall all the apps like office, banking
 apps, antivirus software and what not, which is full day job per PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see net is full of users reporting this problem since fall update</p>

<p>I found that launching the Store from a web page cleared the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try installing any app from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/windows?icid=CNavAppsWindowsApps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Windows apps</a> .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the Store launches correctly the app need not be installed.</p>

<h2>            windows 8.1 detecting speakers as headphone,and no equalizer option</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft, my windows 8.1 laptop detects my 4.1 speakers as headphone (even when plugged in by 3.5 mm jack and connected by bluetooth) . Also, there is no eqaulizer option in playback devices setting properties except bass boost, headphone virtualization
 and loudness equalization. Thanks.

                    <p><span>original title:&nbsp; Registry Access Denied</span></p>
<p><span>I reinstalled Vista home premium a few weeks ago and now whenever I try to open certain programs ie( iTunes, Autocad, MS Office) I get a&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Message Box stating : Registry Access Denied .&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also get the registry access denied whenever I right click on a file to copy it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The account that I am logged in as is definitely an admin account. I have changed the owner of the C: and all files to my admin account. When vista was reinstalled the installer had originally assigned the owner as Trusted Installer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have also tried setting up another admin account and I get the same error under that account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Could someone please tell me what else I need to change to get stop getting that error message. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;<br />

            Thanks for the response Rami<br />
<br />
I had already done step A.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
All of my documents, etc had my admin account as the owner of the file but when I went to the C: and went through the steps&nbsp; in A that was where the Trusted Installer was listed as the Owner.&nbsp; I had changed that but it didn't fix the message boxes from coming
 up every time I loaded a program or tried copying a file (the program would load and&nbsp; files would copy if I clicked ok on the Message Box).<br />
<br />
I couldn't do step C since there was no restore point to go as I wiped the drive and then reinstalled Vista.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Step B - &nbsp;I ran it and it got a message to check the log file in C:windows/logs/cbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't have access to read the file even with admin access.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
To fix it, I finally just reinstalled vista&nbsp;again and this time I am not getting the Message Box registry errors when opening programs.&nbsp; The&nbsp;C: once again has the&nbsp;Trusted Installer as the owner but the rest of the files are under my account.&nbsp; I dont' know
<br />
what it is different but it is working again without those annoying message box errors.<br />
