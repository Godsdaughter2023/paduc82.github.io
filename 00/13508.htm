<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you purchase an<strong> Office 365 Home with Premium OneDrive Features</strong>, you're entitled for a 5 TB of total storage or 1000 GB each for 5 users. For the other users to gain access of this feature, they need to log in on their individual Microsoft
 accounts. You also need to manage your subscription in order to share it to the other users. To do that, you can click

<h2>            Updated Sections in Class Notebook through Teams</h2>
                    As the school year continues, I add a section for each unit when we start that unit. I'm trying to use Teams &gt; Assignments to have students work on and turn in an assignment from their Class Notebook. However, when I go to add the Notebook page I created,
 the only options for destinations are the original sections I created at the beginning of the school year. Is there a way that Teams can recognize the new sections I've created in Class Notebook for my students?

<p>Hi Willy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can easily change an existing Theme to Black &amp; White and then apply that to a single slide in your PowerPoint presentation. The default is the White theme. You can choose a theme when you start a new presentation, or apply a theme to all slides or a
 group of slides as you go. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are links to a step-by-step instructions on how to customize a theme and how to apply it to a specific slide:</p>
<ul>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>To apply your own theme to a specific slide, just right-click on your design and then choose

<p>Hi, Joanna,</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it does not solve my problem.</p>
<p>My problem is to have THE PICTURES in the slides black-and white and not the theme, while I have a beautiful title slide in color. If I select BW look from View menu, it affects all slides, including the title and I cannot select a single slide there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you once more,</p>

<p>I suspect you are misunderstanding what VIEW &gt; B&amp;W actually does. It only really shows you how a presentation would print in Black and White. It doesn't change how the presentation shows or even saves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe explain <strong>exactly </strong>what you need to show.</p>

<h2>            How to see all uread or flagged mails regardless of the Folders&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
I have just started using Office 365, and I am finding something really frustrating - how to see all unread or flagged mails regardless of the Folders?<br />
I have more that 30 folders in my mailbox, and working from my phone is a nightmare:<br />
- the Metro style icon doesn't show me that I have a new mail because the rules I have created are moving the messages to folders different than Inbox<br />
- even in "Show all folders", you have to set "Sync this folder" first in order to get the content of this folder.. (again I have more than 30 folders!)<br />
- the sections All, Flagged and Unread works only in the folder you have selected<br />
<br />
In Outlook you can create so called "Search folders" in which you can have all the combination you need - All Unread (regardless of the folder); All Flagged (regardless of the folder) etc. It would be nice to have such a future here as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will be really happy if there is some workaround this "problem" or an upcoming update that is promising to fix this issue, but I didn't find one and that why I decided to post this question.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi GenaNastev,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Unread and Flagged filter option on Windows Phone only works per folder.&nbsp; Slide sideways while in each folder to switch between : All, Unread, Flagged.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Outlook on the desktop is indeed much more powerful. I'm not sure if this ever will be an added function on the Windows Phone.</p>

            <p>Are you creating a Section Break at the beginning of the document? If so, that's what's causing the problem :-) The first page by definition
<em>is</em> a recto page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you've done is to create a first page that is too short to have a footer plus an undisplayed page two. As a result, the document 'thinks' the first page (which probably displays as blank) is pages 1 &amp; 2. I can't be absolutely certain because I don't
 have any idea what else has been done to control the flow of the document, but if you remove the Section Break I believe your page numbering will adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Odd/Even Section Breaks need only be used where the natural pagination falls contrary to the wanted layout. I.e, a 'chapter' ends on an odd page but you want the next chapter to start on an odd page rather than immediately on the next [even] page.</p>

<p>Hi Focal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the thread you found is not the latest as the current released product version is 16.10. I checked Excel for Mac 16.10 version from my side and was able to see the Picture button under Header &amp; Footer tab.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could let those Mac users confirm this with that Office for Mac suite. Just make sure that their Office suites are up do date (in 16.10 version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<h3> bruce calvert  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I upload my contacts to Outlook 365 using a CSV file exported from Outlook, most of the entries get duplicated.</h2>
                    <p>When I did this, I got an error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried deleting all the uploaded contacts and re-importing the list and the same result happens.&nbsp; The exported CSV file looks fine.&nbsp; It opens in Excel without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some investigation I think I know why this is happening.&nbsp; When I export the contacts from Outlook to the CSV file, they have imbedded &lt;Carriage Return&gt;&lt;Line Feed&gt; characters in the "Notes" column - see below example.&nbsp; I think that this is causing the
 duplication when the file is uploaded to Outlook 365.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to eliminate these characters?&nbsp; What character should I replace them with?&nbsp; Would a plain &lt;Line Feed&gt; work?&nbsp; I want to keep the arrangement of lines if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Text blahblahblah More text&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;Next line of text blahblahblah&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;end of text."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the CSV file in Excel, this looks fine.&nbsp;All three lines of text are in the same column/row:</p>

end of text.<span><br />
</span></td>
</tr>

<p>

<p>Where are you trying to import it?&nbsp; -&nbsp; See below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK Background:&nbsp; I am trying to separate information about my personal contacts (i.e. friends, family, etc.) from my Outlook at work.&nbsp; (NOTE:&nbsp; I do have another account on Outlook.com that is linked to my work Outlook, but that is an entirely separate account
 with a different login.)&nbsp; In this case I am exporting contact information&nbsp;from my Outlook application at work (part of Office Suite) to a CSV file.&nbsp; Then I am trying to import that file of contacts into my personal Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted above, the use of &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; characters in the Notes field of my Outlook application at work seems to result in multiple miss formed lines of&nbsp;data in the CSV file once exported.&nbsp; This in turn is causing failures when uploaded to my personal&nbsp;Outlook.com
 account.&nbsp; These failures seem to include "duplication" of the records that have these &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have determined that those contacts in the exported CSV file that are entirely contained on one record&nbsp;(i.e. that do not have the&nbsp;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; issue) do import
 successfully.</p>

            The same result every time and I retried it three times with various settings.&nbsp; It all comes down to the &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; in the Notes: field within Outlook.&nbsp; This always results in extra lines in the CSV file, which results in duplicate records (or other errors)
 in&nbsp;Outlook 365 when I upload the CSV file.&nbsp;

<h2>            The requested account name is already in use or was used in the past and has not been through the required waiting period to re-use.</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I'm trying to set up a custom domain using domains.live.com.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The domain is jasonrobson.com.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've set up an account for myself ((removed email 1)) - but when trying to set up my wife (removed email 2), I am receiving the error message :</div>
<div><span>The requested account name is already in use or was used in the past and has not been through the required waiting period to re-use.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>I have checked previous threads and it appears that some people are having this issue when the account has been used as an alias elsewhere. I don't believe this is the case for me however. There isn't a primary Microsoft account using this name, and I
 don't believe it is being used as an alias in a different account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please could someone look into this for me ?</div>
<div>Many thanks,</div>
<div>Jason Robson</div>
                </div>

            Hi,
<div>Thanks for the reply - but I'm not sure this is actually anything to do with the problem.</div>
<div>I can't move my MX record over to Microsoft (currently with Google Apps) until I've set up all my accounts correctly at domains.live.com. I've managed to set all the others up correctly with the exception of my wife's, which is when I got his message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Are you saying that if I switch my MX record over I will be able to add her as well ? If so, why did the other's work ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>What does the message actually mean, what is "the required waiting period" ? Is it documented anywhere ? How can I find out what other references you must be holding for this e-mail address (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). There is no Microsoft account in this
 name, and to my knowledge it isn't being used as an alias on any others.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope you can help,</div>
<div>Jason.</div>

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I investigation your issue and just like what the previous moderators has found out, it shows that your domain's MX record is not properly configured. Please properly configure your domain's MX record by following the steps given in the article provided
 by moderator Andreo Paulo_D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to the issue you're having with your wife's account, here are the possible reasons for that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The account has been used and was removed.</p>
<p>- The account is an alias of a primary account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div><br />
<div>I am still trying to find out details as to how long I have to wait if this account was previously added and removed from the domain ? It's been over a month since I first started playing around with this ? surely it can't be any longer ?!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the account that you provided and it shows that it is currently registered as a Microsoft account. This is why you are unable to create the account on Windows Live Admin Center. All Microsoft accounts need to undergo inactivity to be deactivated
 before it can be reused. The total waiting period is 365 days of inactivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Access question. Multiple switchboards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joemama025  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access question. Multiple switchboards</h2>
                    I have multiple switchboards, which I created using the switchboard manager.
<br />
<br />
When I open the switchboard under forms, only the first (default) switchboard appears on the screen. There are no options to navigate to and from the other switchboards.
<br />
<br />
How do I fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Can not copying FLAC files into my lumia 1520 the normal way</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>When I try to copy some flac (not all) files to my lumia 1520 it asks that if I want to convert them and if I chose to just copy, it start but stick to the end of the first file and not going any farther.</p>
<p>I've found that if I end the mfpmp.exe from details tab of task manager it will continue to next file and I have to do that for every single file.</p>
<p>I have installed KMPlayer and MPC and VLC with all of their codecs if it helpes and I disabled any plug-ins in WMP.</p>
<p>And I must say that each time I terminate the mfpmp.exe and it relaunchs, an icon will appear in the taskbar that says it is LAV Splitter.</p>
<p>Hope these information are enough.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help ....</p>

<h2>            PDF to Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking for ways to convert PDF to word documents for some time now. I have tested many VBA codes that I have found online. The simplest that I found with the most positive feedback is below. Unfortunately, I can't get it to run past the first
 line because I keep getting&nbsp;"Compile error: Sub or Function not defined" at the bolded line. I was wondering how I could fix this or if anyone knows a better way of converting PDFs to Word docs through VBA. If possible, I would like to preserve all the formatting
 in the Word Doc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p><br />

<p>An update to my previous post...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the code that Gord Dibben shared the link to, and it works fine, so you should be able to use it directly by just altering the file paths.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked out Adobe's new offering and I have to say that it does a much better job on conversion of PDF to Word versus what's built into Word... particularly if the PDF document contains tables or graphics. These elements come out a bit wonky when Word
 is used for the conversion. The downside of the Adobe method is that it appears to be singular, one document at time, so if you have many files to convert it will become a laborious effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I added a PDF conversion option to our free <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://www.greatcirclelearning.com/authortec-file-doctor-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AuthorTec File Doctor</a></span></strong>
 add-in to Word, so if you want to check that out, it has a number of other file conversion features, you can download it by clicking the link. The PDF conversion will only work in the Windows version of the product and then only with Word 2013 and later. PDF
 conversion does not work in Word 2016 for the Mac.</p>

<h2>            Macros</h2>
                    <p>I am a transcriber.&nbsp; I set up a number of macros that I use constantly.&nbsp; They are not huge ones, each one saves me about a dozen keystrokes.&nbsp; Re-inputting them over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
 is fun but I have work to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not trying to become a programmer.&nbsp; I understand the concept of templates.&nbsp; I created a macro-enabled template with my name, and saved all my macros while in it.&nbsp; That does bring me up something without that goofy Calibri 11 with 8 points after that
 jars my eyes and makes my teeth hurt every time it crops back up.&nbsp; I keep saving my modifications to the Normal style, then saving the normal template.&nbsp; That doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I'm not trying to become a programmer.&nbsp; Please tell me how I can make a template that comes up with a standard font, no wacky line spacing, and preferably my own macros each and every time.&nbsp; Keep in mind that I have in the past been able to set them
 and they stay just fine for months.&nbsp; So this is some shenanigans by Microsoft that I don't have time for.&nbsp; Please Keep It Super Simple and tell me how to stop wasting my time, effort, and patience.</p>

            It sounds like you have a pretty good idea of what needs to be done, and you are using some "advanced" features, like macros. Good for you.
<br />
<br />Sorry, I'm going to have to go into a few geek level points to help figure out your problem. But hopefully not too deep, or confusing.
<br />
<br />Documents can only have one template linked to them at a time.
<br />Documents can have access to some features stored in other templates if they are defined as "global" templates.
<br />
<br />Where do you have this custom template saved.  If it is in the same folder as Normal.dotm, it is just that a template separate from normal.dotm.  If you start a document using that template, then the settings in it like fonts and styles are used and you have access to the macros.  If you start a new document using normal.dotm it will use the settings in normal.
<br />
<br />But if you have it in the "Startup" folder, then it becomes a "global template" which means those macros are shared with all documents you open. 
<br />
<br />***************
<br />
<br />First thing to setup.
<br />Go to File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Advanced option &gt; Save section.
<br />Make sure "Prompt before saving Normal Template" is turned ON.  With this setting turned on, when you (or anyone else, ie installed addins, malware etc) make any changes to the normal.dotm you wlll be prompted before they are saved. 
<br />
<br />************* optional reading ****************
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130110185047/http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/Pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.archive.org/web/20130110185047/http...</a> 
<br />this article describes where word looks for settings and in what order.
<br />Note: in a specific location it searches files alphabetically (that's not in the article).
<br />
<br />*****************
<br />
<br />Check this
<br />While you are in Options and Advanced, scroll down to bottom and click on "File Locations..." button
<br />
<br />make note of the "Startup" folder location (ie copy it and paste in a temporary work document). If you aren't already using it you may want to your macro template here.
<br />
<br />Also make note of the "user templates" location.
<br />
<br />******************
<br />*******************
<br />
<br />Problems saving changes in normal.dotm
<br />
<br />******************
<br />
<br />You appear to be doing the right thing to save changes. But sometimes word justs gets "cranky" and doesn't do what is expected.
<br />
<br />Are you working in a corporate environment? Is there any chance you could be downloading a new normal.dotm every time you sign back in to the corporate network? (I had that problem once).
<br />
<br />First thing to try for this problem is restart your computer and start only 1 Word session. Make your changes and save them to normal.dotm using "make default" buttons. 
<br />
<br />Shut down word. You should get prompt asking if you want to save changes in normal.dotm.  Say yes.
<br />
<br />Start word again. Are the changes there? 
<br />
<br />If not you will have to go "old school" .  With word started, close an blank document.  Then go to File menu &gt; Open command (or use &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;O&gt; shortcut).  
<br />- click on the "all word documents" drop down, select "word templates".
<br />- navigate to the location normal.dotm is saved
<br />- double click on normal.dotm
<br />You are now in normal.dotm, in edit mode. Make your changes. Close the document, saving changes, close word.
<br />
<br />Start word again, check to see if your changes are stil there

            Your first answer has a lot of good info about word macros and templates. A couple of things to add. First there are two kinds of templates. The template you are talking about contains setting (styles, macros, etc.) There is also a type of template that is more like a form. Where you have specific elements like tables, form elements etc. In a template like that, the user just fill in some blanks. Just wanted to make that part clear.
<br />
<br />But you should also learn how to use Styles. If you want to a specific font, no wacky spacing, etc. Then learn to use Styles. Set the Normal and/or Bodytext styles to the formatting you want. A style consists of a font, font size, spacing, margins, etc. You can modify existing named styles or add your own. Styles can be used to create reference tables as well.

            Step 1: A simple template with a macro:
<br />
<br />Make a new Word file
<br />Open the VBA editor
<br />Add a regular module
<br />Paste in this code
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Sub HelloWorld()
  MsgBox "Hello World"
End Sub</code></pre>
<br />
<br />Save the file as DOTM e.g. in your documents folder
<br />
<br />Step 2: Install as AddIn
<br />
<br />Make a new Word file
<br />Add this macro
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Sub OpenStartupPath()
  Shell "explorer " &amp; Application.StartupPath
End Sub</code></pre>
<br />
<br />Open the Windows explorer
<br />Right-click your template and copy
<br />Go back into the Word file
<br />Execute the macro (this opens another Explorer window and shows the startup folder)
<br />Right-click in the new Explorer window
<br />Choose "Paste shortcut"
<br />Close Word
<br />
<br />Step 3: Test
<br />
<br />Open Word
<br />Make a new file
<br />Press Alt-F8
<br />Execute HelloWorld
<br />
<br />I can't describe it more simple. :-)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this answer.&nbsp; I have reviewed it.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it's what I need to know or not.&nbsp; Basically you're telling me there's another enormous learning curve on my day-to-day, bread-and-butter use of this program. &nbsp; It seems like they redo everything
 at random intervals, always making it more complicated, always making me start all the way over on the learning curve.&nbsp; I don't get paid for any of that time, FYI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your tagline.&nbsp; My options here are to continue grinding my teeth and mustering through as best I can, laugh it off, or smash my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand.&nbsp; The later answers assume maybe I am a first-day user, very rudimentary with Word.&nbsp; This is not the case.&nbsp; I'm a top-shelf legal proofreader who has been using Word since it first came out, literally switched over from Wang. &nbsp; When I was
 full-time, I was the person people brought their Word mysteries to. That goofy-looking Normal style with the Calibri is simply unique.&nbsp; It's the programming version of "author intrusion," which is a deadly sin in fiction.&nbsp; I have redefined the Normal style
 more times than I have redefined the Normal template.&nbsp; I've never been able to figure out the right combination of redefining, resetting, saving, closing, opening back up, eye of newt. It shouldn't be this kind of a clusterbomb, sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be less of a chain yank for me to just continue resetting all my macros every time the gods of Microsoft choose to rain on my parade.&nbsp; That will probably come down to less of my time and effort than drilling all the way down on these answers.&nbsp; That's
 what I meant by not wanting to become a programmer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your efforts.&nbsp; I really hate Microsoft.</p>

<p>Maybe I should ask differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of small macros that I use thousands of times per day.&nbsp; I find that I never can tell when they will continue to exist or not. &nbsp;<span>I've already transferred everything possible to autocorrect, which almost always stays intact, though
 items do sometimes disappear from that too.&nbsp; But usually not a complete wipeout at random intervals like with the macros.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my own "templates," which are my forms saved as Word documents, which I re-save under a new name every time I need a new one. &nbsp; I'm determined to keep my workload simple and manageable, without knowing about all the things my software could potentially
 do.&nbsp; This software started out doing everything I needed it to do decades ago.&nbsp; I'm not going to clap for the cleverness if they really force me to understand everything they've done. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't ever need anything but that line-numbered form or a blank document to choose from.&nbsp; That's really all I need to do any advanced legal documentation in Word.&nbsp; I'd love it if it could be that simple, where a blank document has all my settings and macros
 every time, and I have the option of my other document with the line numbers, also in my font etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Actually, while I'm thinking back on my history with Word, I have a suggestion.&nbsp; If Microsoft would like to keep programmers busy in a way that will not only not antagonize end-users (who are often low-income women like myself) but make our lives easier,
 they could do a Word Legal. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was full-time, I worked at large, international law firms.&nbsp; I was the overnight document specialist.&nbsp; Aside from typing, proofing, and otherwise crunching huge, complex documents on deadlines, I spent at least 30 percent of my time troubleshooting
 Word for other highly experienced users.&nbsp; There are many odd little quirks of Word that stop someone dead in their tracks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the kind of documents we did, there are many things that can go wrong, and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>all</strong></span> of them need to be corrected by the deadline.&nbsp; So if they came out with a new version of Word this morning, and you need three or four hours to work the learning curve, you have to work three hours faster.
<span>&nbsp; My attorneys could get me on speakerphone from a remote location to troubleshoot Word mysteries the other high-end support staff couldn't solve.&nbsp; There are always those, no matter how good you are.&nbsp; That's shame on Microsoft.&nbsp; Again, these
 are huge, international law firms.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>A big part of the problem is overcomplexity.&nbsp; A streamlined, simplified version of Word for the legal milieu would be an easy sell to attorneys.&nbsp; The arbitrary change-ups from Microsoft throw legal workplaces into a sort of chaos they apparently can't imagine.&nbsp;
 For example, I honestly don't know the difference between tabs, toolbars, and ribbons.&nbsp; I do know for sure I only need one of them.&nbsp; Not only just one sort of thing -- and I don't care which, could be called any of the above -- but just one of them.&nbsp; One each
 of the tabs in Word, there is maybe one thing I need to use.&nbsp; The rest of it is clutter.&nbsp; Having to find each different element and figure out whether it's on a tab now, if so which one, how to get it so you can find it again later, is frankly offensive.&nbsp;
 Working women just have to build that into their day, and have since literally Day 1 of Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's my idea.&nbsp; Make a very simple, user-friendly version of Word that can be customized one time and forgotten about.&nbsp; At least 80 percent of the bells and whistles currently in Word are annoying clutter in my milieu.</p>

            By default, macros are stored in the Normal template. If anything happens to wipe it out, the macros are lost. If you need the macros for all documents, you could store them in another global template (any template saved in Word's Startup folder will be
 global, with macros available to all documents). Macros that are useful only in specific templates can be stored in those templates (which must be .dotm rather than .dotx files in order to be macro-enabled).

<p>I suspect you may come from a Wordperfect background where macros are&nbsp; routinely used to input standard text. They are not needed for that in Word and may be counterproductive. If my guess is right, I would suggest you peruse
<a href="http://addbalance.com/word/wordperfect.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Word for Wordperfect Users</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look into AutoText. Like macros, AutoText can be stored in templates.</p>
<p>If the template is a <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm#Global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Global Template</a> the AutoText is available in any document.</p>
<p>You can store your macros in a custom global template as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to learn about styles as well as templates. Styles are Word's tool for handling text formatting efficiently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Word is your tool for getting your work done, you need to invest some time in learning how it works. It is not intuitive and knowing other programs is not necessarily a help.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Edit]</p>
<p>I apologize for not reading your other responses earlier.</p>
<p>My first computer WP program was MultiMate, a Wang emulator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, what you've written here tells me that you are not familiar enough with styles and other basic Word tools. You need to be or you'll feel like Sisyphus on a very steep mountain. The first ten hours you invest in this
 will be recovered within the first month if not week and you will forever be ahead of the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Edit 2]</p>
<p>The place to be storing your macros and AutoText is in a global template, not the normal template. That is a much less fragile location. While I keep a passel of macros in the normal template, they are for my use in writing macros
 to go in other templates, sample code.&nbsp; Very few of them are actually run from the normal template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you understand styles, you can change the styles in the normal template, they would be there in any new documents not based on a custom template. Even better is your own custom document templates that have the styles and layout
 you want.</p>

    <title>IE9 doesn&#39;t save cookies for allowed sites - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IE9 doesn&#39;t save cookies for allowed sites</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of recently, I noticed that IE9 stopped recording cookies for the sites I allow to set a cookie.
</p>
<p>The security level is set to medium-high, the privacy to medium, and I checked to manually allow for cookies.</p>
<p>Yet despite those I authorize, they don't record.</p>
<p>I tried reinitializing IE9, to no avail.</p>
<p>My antivirus is Microsoft Security Exchange, and I don't have this problem with any other browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd be very obliged if someone could point to what I'm missing.</p>
<p>The only alternative I see now is stopping to use IE and move to another browser altogether, as this is quite frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, but:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am quite aware on how to do so (I am a computer scientist and computer programmer, and have been using browsers since the first version of NCSA Mosaic).&nbsp; I started noticing this behavior relatively recently. The
<em>only</em> major change I can think of was getting rid of Norton Security and replacing it with Microsoft Security Essentials (but I can't tell if that behavior started then, and besides it doesn't happen with my other installed browsers).</p>
<p>One&nbsp;puzzling thing: when I look at the stored cookies, only 6 are displayed. None for (many of) the sites I have explicitely authorized to store cookies. Yet some of those (whose cookies are not visible) obviously store something somewhere (else) because
 when I return&nbsp;I don't have to login again. Others (which I have also authorized) don't remember me from one access to another (and again: this is not the case with the other browsers).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had done it (I wrote above about resetting IE, this is what I meant), to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had done&nbsp;most of those to no avail. Regarding cleaning, I did it again now: it cleared the history, but didn't delete those 6 cookies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn't. I am back to IE8 now that I have uninstalled IE9 and didn't touch IE8's parameters, and the same behavior occurs. No cookie shows in the usual place where I can see a few&nbsp;temp&nbsp;files from the couple of sites I went to after rebooting.</p>
<p>As a further step, I set IE8 to ask me for cookies. I went to a site and was prompted to authorize or not its cookies. I allowed them. Yet no cookie shows.</p>
<p>Another thing which comes to mind: I had to use cccleaner because IE9 stopped saving sites I visited in its history. It fixed the problem, but could it have broken something in the registry for the IEx family? If so, is there a way to reinstall IE9 from
 scratch rather than from IE8 (which is back now because of my having uninstalled IE9)?</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, I totally uninstalled IE8 and installed IE9 from scratch. No change: only one cookie registered visibly, the one for the Microsoft site. None other.</p>
<p>As to the script you suggest:&nbsp;it does NOT work correctly on my computer. The reason is that it launches the command "ver" (for version) and looks for a string of the form "Version ..." with a capital "v". However when I type "ver" on my computer, it echos
 "Microsoft Windows [version 6.1.7601]" with a lower case initial "v" in "version".</p>
<p>Hence all the tests fail, and it's the first alternative which is chosen, the one indicated (with a typo) as "REM Winows XP". As I said, I'm running Windows 7, so the alternative is wrong.</p>

            <p>It seems obvious to me now that the cookies (or most of them?) are indeed recorded, but that IE9 doesn't show them to me (through Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Parameters...), both upon return to sites I have allowed and because CCleaner shows them.</p>
<p>How do I make IE9 display them again?</p>

            <p>OK, I solved it: it's due to IE9 protected mode being on. I turned it off, and the cookies reappeared. I first found the
<strong>index.dat Analyzer</strong> free program, quite a trove. It shows that there are several index.dat files on my PC. Among them:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies\index.dat</strong> which holds this single cookie which is visible through IE9.</li><li><strong>%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies\Low\index.dat</strong> which holds all the other, "invisible" cookies.</li></ol>
<p>The "Low" subdirectories are used only when Protected Mode is enabled. </p>

<p>Hi </p>
<p>Thanks for your reply about the Junk/Scam email info etc.</p>
<p>I am aware about these and have been for years.</p>
<p>Only last month did I get info about where? to send these.</p>
<p>I have been doing the "Phishing Scam" reporting for years. </p>
<p>I have hundreds of "Blocked Senders" on my "Blocked Senders List".</p>
<p>I just checked my "Blocked Senders List". Guess what?</p>
<p>Email address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. com </p>
<p>is on the "Blocked Senders List". I have been looking at this list several times over the last few days.</p>
<p>Strange, One wonders if that email address is on the "Blocked Senders List".</p>
<p>Why I getting about 20 emails a day from that email address?</p>
<p>I have been sending these emails to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for over a moth now.</p>
<p>From reading this email from you, it seems as Microsoft is unable to do anything about someone or something using an email from a Microsoft email address.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;I wrote in the last email to you. When I changed my password 12-28-14, I received a reply from Microsoft Account Team, email address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>I have changed my password twice since then and received emails from Microsoft Account Team
</p>
<p>Email address: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed up with webmd.com to receive information from them, which I do.</p>
<p>Since then I get about 15-20 emails a day from there domain webmd.com, with many different email addresses.</p>
<p>The other day I was over an hour sending typing on there contact form and giving them a list of several emails from fake emails addresses with @messages.webmd.com. There only "Suggestion" was do not "click" on the
</p>
<p>infomation inside the email. Gee, shakes my head about that "information"? If you get my drift?
</p>
<p>In other words, "worthless information". Tonite I sent 4 of the fake emails I recived to with a fake email address to abuse @ outlook.com</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;Would appreciate a reply from you what I can do to stop or slow down all the "Junk" emails I get everyday.</p>
<p>This has been going on since June 2015 with the "New Outlook.com".</p>
<p>I now get more "Junk" emails in one day than I did in a week, with Hotmail account before the "change over"</p>
<p>to Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Set your junk mail filter to "Exclusive" and then messages from only those specific people you allow will be delivered to your Inbox. Everything else will be filtered to Junk Email. You can review the subject lines and senders in the Junk Email folder
 periodically for messages that you decide you want to reach you. Add those senders or their domains to your Safe Sender list or add the sender to your People to ensure future messages from them arrive in your Inbox.

            <p>Brian,</p>
<p>Thank you for your informative reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue how to do anything you are writing about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would guess "specific people" list must be set up before in a "Safe Sender" list"</p>
<p>I have some there now. </p>
<p>Also, a "Safe Mail Subsriber" list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Big Problem is I get mail from WebMD and I am getting 10-30 emails a day in regular mail and junk mail. All with different address. I wrote to them 3 times and have 2 more replies to do.</p>
<p>All they say is "Tuff berries". Do not click on the messages etc inside the email.DA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also, blocked many Domains in the Source Mail. That does no good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the Garbage emails I get have a Microsoft email address like the ones I have written about before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft MOS says the same as WebMD. "Tuff Berries". We have no control over who or what uses are email addresses or Logo, or anything else we have to send out emails etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just sent 6 more emails I received to&nbsp; abuse out look com about emails I received with Microsoft email address: account @ Microsoft com.</p>
<p>The email address you get mail from when you change your password.</p>
<p>I am sure you know that email address. I did not put the full email address here because someone would probaly delete the message as they have before. my posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In January I did a survery about the "New Outlook. and wrote about unwanted emails and domains etc. I received email back from a Support Engineer. Told me about : "create a inbox rule". I know about that. Instructions another matter?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;wantand get &nbsp;real emails from WebMD. Not 20 or more a day with email addressess from: &nbsp;**** @ web md. If you get my drift.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps if you would explain more about how the "Exclusive" junk filter works an how to set it up?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several lists I subscribe and get other regular emails etc.</p>
<p>I do not like getting 10 or more emails a day with a Microsoft email address etc.</p>
<p>20 plus emails a day with many different email address with WebMD domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>There is no "Safe Mail Subscriber" list. That list is called "Safe mailing lists".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you log into&nbsp;<a href="http://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mail.live.com/</a>, the view you see will have a menu bar along the top. At the left end you'll see either "Outlook Mail" or "Outlook.com". For either platform, at the
 right end of the menu bar will be a gear icon. Click it and choose Options from the drop-down menu that appears. For Outlook Mail you'll see the options choices down the left hand side. For Outlook.com you'll see a page with the options choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To locate the "Exclusive" setting, click "Filters and reporting" in the Outlook Mail list on the left or in the right-hand column of the page for Outlook.com. At the top of the page that appears, you'll see two radio buttons. One says "Standard" and the
 other "Exclusive". Standard means that the junk filter will be able to catch some of the junk, but some will get through as well. What does get caught will, of course, appear in your Junk Email (for Outlook Mail) or Junk (for Outlook.com) folder. Exclusive
 means that all mail you receive that isn't from a safe sender or safe mailing list will be delivered to the Junk Email or Junk folder. Safe senders are defined to be your contacts and entries on the Safe Senders and Safe Mailing Lists lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this means that any messages from addresses that are not in your Contacts or on of of those two lists will be delivered to the Junk or Junk Email folder and not your Inbox. Once consequence of this is that periodically (at least once every ten days)
 you'll need to scan the senders and subject lines of the messages in the Junk or Junk Email folder looking for entries that you don't consider just and either add the sender to your contacts or the sender or sender's domain to your Safe Senders list in order
 to have future messages from that sender delivered to Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that if you have messages arriving in the Junk folder, and they really are junk, that's the correct behavior. Junk messages are supposed to arrive in the Junk folder. You can't keep junk messages from arriving. You can control where they get
 delivered and the Junk folder is the place for them.</p>

<h2>            PV 808 camera app</h2>
                    
<p>hi evryone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>since a couple of days i own an updated 808 and was going to use it mainly for videos and photos. quiet often when i open the camera app, the program opens but i cannot do anything wile there are no applications to manipulate on the screen exept for the
 picture what the camera sees. closing the app causes an instant reboot. after reboot the app is still opened. any possibility to download the entire OS Belle or swap to MSW8 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ilona</p>

<p>A couple of suggestions for you:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, if you go to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Application settings &gt; scroll down to Camera - is "<em>Capture when phone locked</em>"
<em><strong>enabled</strong></em> and does this have any bearing upon issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly whilst not advocating purchase of third party applications such as&nbsp;<a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/101266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/content/101266</a> it resolved this issue upon my 808PV until device software completely was re-installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried using option within Nokia Suite to <font color="#00FF00"><em><strong>re-install</strong></em></font> exisiting device software?</p>
