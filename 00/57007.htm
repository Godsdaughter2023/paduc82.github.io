<h2>            clock_watchdog_timeout error&#33;</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently did some updates and now my computer keeps getting a clock_watchdog_timeout blue screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It usually happens when I play any video game, or sometimes just randomly freezing my computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did some research on the error, and it mentions something about the processor. I recently updated the chipset as well with a driver. I'm running a P8P67 ASUS motherboard with an intel i5-2500k processor (not overclocked) on Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've attached a dmp file:&nbsp;http://sdrv.ms/18AzoGU</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appretiated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            Thanks for the DMP!<br />
<br />
It is of course of the <b>WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR (124)</b> bugcheck. <br />
<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that a fatal hardware error has occurred. This bug check uses the error data that is provided by the Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA).</i><br />
<br />
Note that this is a hardware only bugcheck, most of the time. The only software that can generally cause this bugcheck are OS to BIOS utilities or software such as Asus' AI Suite that provide a direct bridge from the OS to BIOS to perform on the fly adjustments,
 monitor voltages and BIOS settings, etc.<br />
<br />
<i><b>If we run an !errrec on the 2nd parameter which is the address of the WER structure, we get the following:</b></i><br />
<br />

&nbsp; Misc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 0x0000000000000000<br />
<br />
It seems an internal CPU timer failed on Processor 0 (first and primary CPU core) and Cache Bank 3. As we of course have only seen ONE *124 dumps, it's hard to make any calls in regards to the CPU possibly being the issue.<br />
<br />
There is only so much you can do with a bugcheck like this until it comes down to a faulty processor that will need to be replaced. Start from 1 and work downward:<br />
<br />
<b>1. </b>Ensure your temperatures are within standard and nothing's overheating. You can use a program such as Speccy if you'd like to monitor temps -
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/speccy</a><br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Clear your CMOS (or load optimized BIOS defaults) to ensure there's no improper BIOS setting or to clear overclock settings -

http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm</a><br />
<br />
<b>3. </b>Ensure your BIOS is up to date.<br />
<br />
<b>4. </b>As I said above, the <i><b>only</b></i> usual software conflict that can usually cause *124 bugchecks are OS to BIOS utilities from manufacturer's like Asus' AI Suite. If you have something like this software-wise, remove it ASAP.<br />
<br />
<b>5. </b>If all of the above fail, the only left to do is replace your processor as it is faulty.<br />

    <title>CPU utilization &#62;100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivanma72  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU utilization &#62;100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10, and discovered a weird problem when opening task manager where CPU utilization was always at 100%. I did a clean install of Windows 10 to make sure it wasn't application specific, but still the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is very strange because utilization doesn't seem to be tied to a specific process- it just always seems to add up to 100%. Resource monitor actually shows CPU Usage to be in the million%, which is definitely wrong. No performance degradation,
 CPU temps are very normal, and even third-party programs such as Speedfan and CoreTemp are reporting negligible CPU usage (1%-2% idle).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling all startup applications, doing sfc /scannow, viewing reliability history, and restarting multiple times. No luck</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The issue could be due to some Software/update causing the issue. I would suggest you to press the
<strong><span>Shift key and hold the power button</span></strong> so that it will go to the
<strong><span>recovery options</span></strong>, Select safe mode and boot to the desktop. Once you are able to boot to the desktop, check for the CPU utilization.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            Issue resolved. Apparently it had to do with my AsRock motherboard. After updating the BIOS to the latest version, the issue has gone away.

</p><p>There's no available option to change a Skype name or Skype ID. You can only change your display name as this is what the public see without having to view your profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change your display name, simply click on your display picture and from your profile window, click the pencil icon beside your name.</p>

<p>Have you tried a factory restore of your Xbox One console? Don't worry, there is a new option that allows you to keep all the games and apps installed while you perform the restore. Go to Settings &gt; All Settings &gt; System &gt; Console Info and Updates. You will
 find it there. Then proceed to setup your console again after restore and it should work. Let me know how that turns out.

            <p>Try one of these.&nbsp;I looked everywhere and finally solved mine.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Fix 1:<br />Put your Xbox in the DMZ on your router. If you don't know how to do this. Google is your best friend. There are plenty of good walk-throughs out there.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Fix 2:&nbsp;<br /><strong><u>This was what worked for me. </u></strong>I had my Xbox One in the DMZ already so I removed it from the DMZ and boom! Downloaded my profile when I launched the game. Afterwards you can just throw your box right back in the DMZ and you are golden.</p>

<p>Hi kevinbagwell:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention that if you want to confirm that you have the latest available service pack for Vista, go to Control Panel | System and Maintenance | System.&nbsp; The
<em>Windows Edition</em> section should say <strong>Service Pack 2</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/612e605c-9524-4102-a115-b7521e55ba63" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/612e605c-9524-4102-a115-b7521e55ba63" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Vista Service Pack 2 was released in <strong>May 2009</strong> so it should already be installed unless you've recently performed a clean reinstall of your entire operating system or restored your computer back to it's factory settings.</p>

            Hi Ayla.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager is NEVER enough.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I'll answer the questions in order.</p>
<p>First, HP install disk was for Windows 2000.</p>
<p>Second and third, HP doesn't support this printer with Windows 7 drivers. They say the in-OS automatic download will work for this printer.</p>
<p>Fourth, the computer is a newer computer, it's just that the peripheral equipment is not supported by the manufacturers for Windows 7. They worked fine when I had Windows XP on the computer, but after the upgrade to Vista, then 7, the lack of manufacturer
 support is killing me.&nbsp; I was hoping to&nbsp;be able to use what I had a little longer before buying new stuff.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, I&nbsp;do appreciate the response.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Error 0x80070057 with decimal point in user name</h2>
                    <p>I cannot say when this appeared but I have discovered a username in the users directory with a punctuation '.' in two&nbsp; parts of this.&nbsp; As a result I can neither delete or rename this unwanted user.&nbsp; The two parts of the user comprise of my username, followed
 by a '.' and then the 'name' of my computer given almost as an extension.&nbsp; I KNOW this will be one of my many faults but I do not what on earth to do about it.&nbsp; All of the files mirror the files in my legitimate account.&nbsp; I have tried 'moving' the files into
 my own account but this gives me 'error code 0x80070057'&nbsp; I have been into the 'Customise Formats' window to check the Decimal Symbol is correct (which it is) but I do not understand how I ever got a '.' in a user filename in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have explained this clearly.</p>

<p>Hi Haz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Corruption within your system files could be a possible reason why you are experiencing an issue with having a user folder that replicates the files on your original user profile. To address this concern, we suggest that you follow the steps provided by&nbsp;Rahul_compfreak
 on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/user-profile-folders-get-created-as/5fd1849f-e401-4825-9ded-f3acddf4eca2">thread</a></strong>. The steps should also work with Windows 10 devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: We highly recommend backing up all of your files before you start troubleshooting your machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if further assistance is needed. </p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to us with that information. For further troubleshooting, we suggest that you delete or edit the unwanted profile via registration keys. However, doing this method might cause some issue if you modify the registry incorrectly. We
 require you to back up the registry before you modify it by following the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type "regedt32" on Search/Cortana.</li><li>Right-click on regedt32, then choose Run as administrator.</li><li>Locate key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</li><li>Manually edit the duplicate profile location in the ProfileImagePath key to that of the original, e.g.:<br />
Original: %SystemDrive%\Documents and Settings\jsmith<br />
Duplicate: %SystemDrive%\Documents and Settings\jsmith.domain</li><li>Change the duplicate name to point to the original profile, then save changes.</li><li>Restart your PC, and see if issue will persist.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated with the result so we can assist you.</p>

<p>I followed the above instructions up until point 5 where I did change the duplicate name to point to the original profile, but then was unsure how to save changes.&nbsp; I came out of ProfileImagePath leaving the Duplicate name corrected to the Original name
 but without 'saving' it.&nbsp; After Restarting I have found repeatedly that the Lock screen allows me only sign in and then it automatically signs out again.&nbsp; My account is completely in a circular limbo.&nbsp; I have only accessed my computer by logging on as another
 user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I did back up the registry as suggested but I am not a very confident user, coupled with the problem that I am disabled and can only intermittently work on my machine because of spinal pain.&nbsp; I do hope you will reply and I will work on your suggestions
 as soon as am able.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have now tried to use my backup of the registry but an error message is telling me that insufficient data has copied to my flash drive copy and so it cannot be imported to the registry.&nbsp; My computer is working&nbsp; very slowly now.</p>

<p>This error message may occur if the back up did not complete successfully. In order for us to identify solution, we'd like to verify if you performed the back up and restore procedure from the link provided above. If so, it is possible that the UAC (User
 Account Control) is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable UAC using the Control Panel options, you need to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Control Panel.</li><li>Go to the following path: Control Panel\User Accounts and Family Safety\User Accounts.</li><li>In the User Account Control settings dialog, move the slider to the bottom (Never Notify).</li><li>Click OK.</li></ol>

            You may be confused that my reply is given by 'SidTB' - I had to use another user's account to give a reply.&nbsp; I have decided that it is safer to remain with duplicate 'ghost' user because I cannot cope with the repercussions of experimenting with possible
 answers to the problem.&nbsp; Thank you to Donna Men for trying to solve my problem.

                    <p>Just update to the newest updates version 1809, Laptop Asus GL553VD, Windows 10 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before update whenever i plugged my headset, the system would automatically switch the audio from my speaker to my headset and vice versa</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the updates, all the drivers went silent so i had to reinstall everything but the new problem is: I have to manually switch the audio from my audio manager if i want to hear audio from headset and vice versa</p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio driver used: Realtek HD Audio Manager (SST)<br />
</p>
<p>Methods searched:</p>
<p>- No headphone icon on my sound playback -&gt; cannot set default audio</p>
<p>- reinstalled the driver already</p>

            Hi RIco.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />

<h2>            C&#58;&#92;WINDOWS&#92;system32&#92;SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe The stub received bad data</h2>
                    My computer was unable to switch languages even though the languages showed up in the toolbar. This just happened today. Prior to today they worked fine. I kept trying them and then saw that it said computer is looking for update. I tried to update but
 they would hang and give me this error, so I deleted them from my computer and then tried to install them fresh, but not I get the same error and I can't get the language packs to download. I really need to use the language packs because I live in an Asian
 country and use my computer for work.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please remember that you'll need a keyboard or mouse connected to your Surface for you to calibrate your touchscreen. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 1:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows logo </strong>key&nbsp;. (If you're using a mouse, select
<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>.)</li><li>
<p>Enter&nbsp;<span><strong>calibrate</strong></span>, use the arrow keys to highlight&nbsp;<span><strong>Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input</strong></span>, and then press Enter. (With a mouse, select&nbsp;<span><strong>Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input</strong></span>.)</p>
</li><li>Press the Tab key until the&nbsp;<span><strong>Reset</strong></span>&nbsp;button is selected, and then press Enter. (With a mouse, select&nbsp;<span><strong>Reset</strong></span>.)&nbsp;<br />
</li><li>Press the Tab key until the&nbsp;<span><strong>Yes</strong></span>&nbsp;button is selected, press Enter, and then follow the on-screen instructions.&nbsp;If the Reset button is dimmed, your Surface touch calibration is still at factory settings. If this is the case, then
 you need to<strong> check for electromagnetic interference. </strong>(See solution 2.)<br />
(With a mouse, select&nbsp;<span><strong>Yes</strong></span>, and then follow the on-screen instructions.)</li><li>After your Surface removes the recalibration data, test the touchscreen to see if it responds appropriately.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p><strong><br />
Solution 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Other electronic devices nearby can sometimes interfere with the touchscreen or make the cursor on your Surface move around unexpectedly. A nearby power strip or a lamp on your desk could be causing this, or it could be something
 like large equipment or banks of computers. Here's how to address this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>To find out if this is the problem, take your Surface to another room, another building, or outdoors. If the touchscreen problem occurs only in certain locations, you’re probably getting electronic interference.</li><li>Turn off all the other devices in the area, and then turn them on one by one to figure out which device is causing the problem.</li><li>If you don’t find the source of the problem, check nearby rooms for more powerful equipment that may be producing electronic interference.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions or concerns.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />
<br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

                    So after i installed the lastest Windows 10 update, I started to have a problem accessing my files. I was trying to delete a file in my USB flashdrive, and it told me i need a permission to delete. I tried all possible answers i got in google but none

 everything. Please help :((

            Hi Maria.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the antivirus? I'd uninstall it and use built-in Defender to troubleshoot this.
<br />
<br />If you type Defender Security Center in Start Search, open it, then choose Virus and Threat Protection Settings, is Controlled Folder Access turned On?  Turn it off.
<br />
<br />Also in Security Center under App and Browser Control, is Check Apps and Files set to Block?  Change to Warn.  
<br />
<br />Is Device Guard enabled?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enable-disable-device-guard-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary try taking ownership of any folders that won't allow access:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

This may have been caused by Windows Updates. Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />
You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began: <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> <br />
<br />
Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:

<br />
If necessary try taking ownership of any folders that won't allow access: <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>XBOX Rip Off - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XBOX Rip Off</h2>
                    <p>So my son's console got banned.&nbsp; I'm not here to argue that.&nbsp; His account was hacked repeatedly, but the enforcement team upheld their verdict and it is what it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>However, my daughter also has an Xbox One.&nbsp; Because he had had used her xbox one before we got him the newer one, her console is also banned.&nbsp; So that's TWO&nbsp;wasted systems in our house, we've lost all purchased content between the two devices.&nbsp; I&nbsp;asked if we could reset the system so it doesn't have any ties to his account, and the answer was no.&nbsp;&nbsp;And their solution is we can just buy two new consoles!&nbsp; Forget it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will never waste another penny on anything Xbox related.&nbsp; This is the most ridiculous thing I've encountered.&nbsp; The amount of money wasted on your products is obscene, and it was all for nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

particular Xbox console or Xbox on Windows device is used to violate the
 Code of Conduct in an egregious or repeated manner. Once a device ban 
occurs, no account can connect to the Xbox Live service from the 
affected device. Given the severity of this action we take each device 
ban extremely seriously, and only take action after a lengthy 
investigation.</p>
<p>Devices can be banned from Xbox Live for a number of reasons, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>Xbox console tampering, such as physically opening an Xbox console 
and modifying it to play illegitimate or unauthorized software</li><li>Online fraud, such as phishing, account theft, or other attempts to defraud Microsoft or other players</li><li>Repeated egregious violations of the Microsoft Services Agreement that establish a clear pattern of nefarious activity</li></ul><p>A device ban will occur if the console itself has been modified as stated above. The most likely scenario is that after your son's first console was banned, he tried to do the same thing on the next console. You're welcome to blame MS or Xbox but someone there had to use an account there on your consoles for this to occur. This doesn't just happen to anyone.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p>

<p>Hey buddy,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your troubles, am hoping I might be able to help you out.</p>
<p>Firstly, I'd try and do a power cycle on your console. You can do this by first turning the console on, once it is on and at the home screen, hold the xbox button on the console down until it switches off (don't just push the button, make sure you hold it),
 then unplug the power brick from the console, and then the power point. Leave it for a minute or two, and then plug it back in and turn it on.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, it could be the HDMI cable that you are using, do you have another one that you might be able to use?</p>
<p>Give those two things a go, and let us know how you go :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Denaz</p>

<h2>            I have an unused Windows 8 Key, but I bought a computer with Windows 8.1 installed. How do I use the Key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When Windows 8 was first being released, Microsoft had a promotion for downloading a full version of Windows 8 for ~$50. I bought it and the Key in preparation of buying a new computer soon, since Windows 7 was still on most machines. I have never used that
 key, have the software, but I just recently bought a machine that I thought was going to have Windows 8 on it, but instead it came pre-installed with Windows 8.1. I tried using the key I have on the machine, but I did get the error code that it was not a valid
 key for the version I was using. So therein lies my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to use this key to unlock all the features that I was going to get with Windows 8, or am I out of luck and should give or sell my key to a friend for them to use?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The edition of Windows 8 you bought from Microsoft, is it Windows 8 Pro or regular Windows 8? If its just regular Windows 8, then the license (product key) can't be used on the new preinstalled Windows 8.1, since it would be equivalent in feature set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its Windows 8 Pro and its a retail upgrade license, then you should be able to use it to upgrade the preinstalled Windows 8.1 to Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
