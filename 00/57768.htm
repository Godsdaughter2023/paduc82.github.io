<br />
&nbsp;You say that, but what you posted in your OP isn't going to do that.&nbsp; If you're copying over a network, as I gather from what you've said about student's machines, you need to change from %systemroot%, which is on YOUR computer to the student's computer network
 addresses.&nbsp; If that's not what you're trying to do, you need to clarify what it is that you're attempting.&nbsp; Obviously if you copy to YOUR font's folder, that's not going to put it in the STUDENT's folder.

    <title>Using SmartGlass on Windows Phone to Interact with XBOX 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> not925  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using SmartGlass on Windows Phone to Interact with XBOX 360</h2>
                    
<p>We have three Windows Phones in our house and from a brief reading we made on the SmartGlass App, we think SmartGlass is a killer application if it does what we expect it to do. However, we have no detailed information on this new App and hence this forum
 question. Here goes the question.</p>
<p><br />
We have an Xbox account which we just set up after getting "Xbox 360 250GB Console with Kinect Sensor". It looks our family will have a busy festive time with the kids but we're still in the learning mode - downloading free bundle games, installing games (some
 of them in gift pack), etc.</p>
<p><br />
We found it straightforward to install the SmartGlass App on Windows Phones - no problem. However what is not clear is how the Windows Phones interact with the Xbox console.</p>
<p>We have this sense of trepidation that SmartGlass may not support multiple windows Phone devices&nbsp;to interact with a single xbox console. If this is the case, then SmartGlass will be a flop rather than a killer application we expect it to be. The question
 is therefore:</p>
<p><br />
1)&nbsp;Does SmartGlass support multiple family members to interact with a single XBOX 360? It is not a problem if only one Windows Phone device is allowed to logon for controlling the playback but what is important is allowing multiple Windows Phone at different
 times. Easy to guess the flexibility of this – any one family member will be able to use his/her Windows Phone to interact with Xbox. We appreciate the confusion that arises if two or more devices attempt the playback at the same time, hence even enforcing
 the logon of only one SmartGlass device is a sensible thing.</p>
<p><br />
2)&nbsp;If multiple Windows Phone as SmartGlass device&nbsp;is not supported, is there any plan to make multi-device playback a reality, or is it another&nbsp;potentially killer application, turning into a big disappointment for Microsoft?</p>
<p><br />
Could someone from Microsoft please respond to this with definitive/authoritative answer?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Couldn't find one definitive location for all of the Smart Glass information, but this is the
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/smartglass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><strong>link</strong></em></a> on How To/Getting Started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here is the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/smartglass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Smart Glass Support</em></strong></a> page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't find the answers to your questions on these pages, you can always contact Xbox Support at the link at the bottom of the
<strong>Smart Glass Support</strong> page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, since Smart Glass is supposed to be an interface between the Xbox &amp; a Smart Phone, my thinking is that is a one-on-one interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of it as a substitute for a TV remote control:&nbsp; If you use multiple controls, the TV will not be able to tell the difference unless you vary the signal frequencies between the controllers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this technology just came out a few months ago, the multiple interface might be in a future update,</p>

<p>It's possible, only if you have multiple xbox live gamertags. Since your new let me explain everything about it.
</p>
<p>1. Your Gamertag.</p>
<p>You currently have 1 xbox live account according to your post. Most likely it's the one your using to ask this question. So your xbox live gamertag is "OperaticEarth0" . This is your one gamertag, which you use to play games on your xbox, earn achievements,
 purchase content on the xbox live marketplace, and a bunch of other fun stuff.</p>
<p>2. Using Smartglass.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the app, you may connect the smartphone to your gamertag. Now to do this, you gotta download the app on your smartphone/tablet, sign in to your xbox live gamertag, which in this situation you got to enter your email address and password
 you used for "OperaticEarth0" in to the Smartglass app. Once you have completed it, all you have to do is turn on your xbox. sign in to your xbox live gamertag (OperaticEarth0). and once your signed in turn on your smartglass app on your smartphone/tablet
 and hold it near your xbox. the app will then connect to the internet and check if your gamertag is online, once it is it will connect to any xbox it is on. Then a message on the TV will appear, &nbsp;OperaticEarth0 &nbsp;has been connected to smart glass or something.
 Now that it's connected just browse through the app to see what you can do.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Oh and to connect with multiple account. you need another smartphone/tablet and the smartglass app. so if you want to connect to an additional account you need to sign in another profile to the other smartphone/tablet. so lets say i used my only phone to
 sign in with my gamertag with smartglass. now i can use my phone on my gamertag. but now my sister wants to use her smartglass app on her gamertag. so now my sister needs to get her own smartphone/tablet, and sign in to her gamertag and use her own phone.
 so yes you can use smartglass to support multiple family members. all you need is more phones that can use smartglass and more xbox live gamertags. or you can just use one phone for the whole family and you just sign out of your account and sign in to someones
 else. but its no fun to take turns.</p>
<p>Hope this helps :D</p>

<p>Thank you Bastion116 for taking the time to responding to my question. Sorry I couldn't reply sooner as I was away on more important matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I should make the question as explicit as possible what&nbsp;we intend to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three family members have Windows Phone, including me. We have a single XBOX 360 account and we do not intend to have more than one XBOX account. We use XBOX more for family recreation and we do not (so far) consider ourselves gamers, so the use may be categorized
 mainly for Movies, family games, and TV. Whoever happens to turn on the XBOX, it would be ideal for that person to use Windows Phone as a remote control with SmartGlass App. There is no need for more than one person to use Windows Phone as a&nbsp;remote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, we want any one of the Windows Phone to control the XBOX 360 which has a single Microsoft account for family use. So, is this possible?<br />
We have no intention to have multiple Xbox accounts as we see no point and no doubt this would increase subscription cost?</p>
<p><br />
My understanding of a GamerTag is that it's a unique user ID associated with Xbox account. I do not suppose multiple GamerTag is allowed for a given XBOX account, or is it?</p>
<p>Any further input to shed more light on this query is therefore very much appreciated.</p>

<p>On a related point, I highly recommend having multiple gamertags, even if only one is a gold member. Many games (such as Kinectimals) have a single-save configuration such that if you want more than one user playing their own save you need to have additional
 gamertags. </p>
<p>As to your original question, if you configure the phones with the smartglass app then all of the phones will be able to control it at the same time, UNLESS... you set up separate accounts. The Xbox has no way to differentiate between smartphones using the
 same account.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning as well, that you don't have to have all accounts be gold, although with the family plan you get 4 gold accounts for $99 and that is less than the price of 2 gold accounts normally. At my house, we have 1 gold account (mine) and 3 silver
 accounts so that my kids each have their own saves and whatnot.</p>

<h2>            resetting sound codecs on Windows 7</h2>
                    Don't get it!!!! Last night (or this morning) I was listening to music just fine, watching videos too, no problem, today when I went to watch or listen to it, I started getting a lot of a popping sound, otherwise everything played fine, so I tried adjusting
 a couple of things in the volume, if I turned down the IDT, I believe it is, it would quit, however, the sound was like the sound of echo, like in a big black hole or something....not sure what this is all about....<br />

I have a Dell Inspiron Laptop with Windows 7<br />

            <p>Hello Corey,</p>
<p>Losing (decent) sound in windows is not an uncommon problem. Try the steps in this tutorial for no sound&nbsp;from Microsoft:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And try this for breaking-up sound:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/how-do-i-stop-my-music-from-skipping-or-breaking-up-when-i-play-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/how-do-i-stop-my-music-from-skipping-or-breaking-up-when-i-play-it</font></a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the drivers, go to Control Panel, Device Manager, look up the tab, Sound, video, and game controllers, what specific drivers are loaded, and do any of them have a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark in it? If so, right-click on the driver and
 select either driver status or properties - what does it say?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have no (decent) sound and&nbsp;can answer these questions, I'll try to provide additional assistance to you. Keep me posted and let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Corey,</p>
<p>As far as I know, build 700 is the latest build so I don't know why it was blinking. Was there any error message? Did you left- or right-click on it? With what results? Was that the only driver listed there? If not, what were the other drivers and their
 status? Please be as thorough and as specific as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can answer these questions, I'll try to provide additional assistance to you.</p>

            <p>Hello Corey,</p>
<p>Did the 'breaking up' and 'no sound' links not work out? And there is no other information than what you provided in your last post? Because I find no match for an IDT driver, and those are only as "recent" as 2008, and work only though Windows XP! There
 are much more recent Realtek drivers, but I've not heard you mention Realtek anywhere in your posts. So I honestly don't know what to tell you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep me posted and let me know how you fare.</p>

            I haven't seen anything on Realtek, my problem is a lot on being limited on what I've been able to do with most of my Windows programs not working, (quit doing updates, won't do troubleshooting, nothing listed when I go to turn features on or off, &amp; I
 usually end up getting an error code of some kind) I guess I'm just gonna have to take everything off here and reinstall it all over again...this thing has been constantly getting on my nerves anyway, so I may as well just start over....endless problems on
 this thing....

<p>It sounds like a lot more is going on than just a loss of sound quality. Care to tell me more?&nbsp;Has this behavior come on suddenly or has it built up over time? Is it restricted to this device or are other devices 'acting up'? Have you done a computer scan
 with antimalware scanners and / or antivirus scanners? If not, I recommend you download, install, and run the following three freeware programs:</p>

<h2>            Don&#39;t Ask Me Again</h2>
                    Using Excel in Vista...Excel originally asked me whether I wanted to open or save the document.&nbsp; Foolishly I checked the the "Don't Ask Me Again" box and selected "Open".&nbsp; Now I wish I had the option back because saving is much faster than opening.&nbsp; How
 do I restore that default so Excel will ask me to open or save again?

            Hi Namke77,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
What were you doing when Excell ask you to Open or Save? <br />
Did you download a file? or Did you try to double click and open a file?<br />
If you trying to download the file, please take a look at this article.<br />

<h2>            MX vs ATV UNTAMED online game play RACE TOURNAMENTS</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Microsoft worker who reads this, please email me back if this interest you in anyway. MX vs ATV UNTAMED is the third latest American motocross/supercross game out. The other two newer ones are called MX vs ATV REFLEX and MX VS ATV ALIVE. I am in
 love with racing online on MX cs ATV UNTAMED. The other two newer games, not so much at all due to how you are able to control the bike. They do not have the natural control of a feel of a dirt bike like the game MX vs ATV UNTAMED. At the same time, on the
 other hand, there is a site where online races are hosted/posted by people who race MX vs ATV REFLEX and, MX vs ATV ALIVE. Notice anything? There is not online real life $ races for the best game (my opinion and many others)- MX vs ATV UNTAMED, like there
 are for these other two newer games! 'They say' the reason they do not have online real life $ prizes-$ races for MX vs ATV UNTAMED is because there is not enough support for the game! HA, those people have no idea how many new gamer tags I run into every
 day when playing MX vs ATV UNTAMED. If you are a Microsoft worker reading this, and you think you could help either help put MX vs ATV UNTAMED on the one site mentioned, or think you could help teach me how to make my own 'online race tournament' legit webpage
 for MX vs ATV UNTAMED, let me know! I will work the site daily if I would have to. There needs to be that guy who gets things going for this game, and I think I am that guy. I do not have that good of a money flow as of now, and I would love to make any $
 from my favorite video game in the world, in any way! Anybody agree or want to chat with me, reply to this post, make your own,<strong> [Mod Removed]</strong></p>

</p><p>Hello All ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I need your help in telling me what is wrong with my Dell laptop running windows 8 ( i havent updated yet ) ..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem / Symptoms :</p>
<p>1. Sometimes during running the windows narrator automatically turns on . I have disabled the narrator through ease of access but it still does that.</p>
<p>2. sometimes during normal functioning my laptop goes haywire and when i press keys like "r" it open "run command box" similarly &nbsp;and every laptop key becomes a direct command and starts to open differnt things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temporary Cure :</p>
<p>in order to fix the above two errors i usually close what is opened through touch pad then i press widows key and "l" to lock &nbsp;my computer ( doing this repeatedly &nbsp;5-6 times ) and the problems solves. ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can u tell me what is wrong ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I understand that your computer has issues with

</p><p><span>I'd suspect that narrator is present at Startup items either in the Start menu's Startup folder, or your registry.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disable narrator from Startup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a) Type MSCONFIG into your Start menu and press enter to start the Microsoft Configuration Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b) On the Startup tab, search for Narrator.exe.&nbsp; If it exists, uncheck it to disable it from startup.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;If issue persists, refer step 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Change the values in registry.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a) Open regedit.exe and navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options</span></span></p>

            <p>The error code you received suggests a profile issue, and I misunderstood your first post when you said there is no problem with the internet or router. Just so we can narrow down the issue further, Go back and test your Xbox Live connection. When it fails, press 'A' for more info and reply to us what that error message is. The message displays at the top of the screen, just above where the instructions are, and the error message should be something like "IP Address error" or "MTU Error".</p>
<p>Post back with the info so we can help you get this issue sorted! :D</p>

<p>Hi. I have the same problem as Jivvers. Two days ago everything was go ok, but today I has problem to log in. I tried to restart console, router etc. and nothing worked. I also revert factory defaults on my router and the same - not working. In addition
 all other devices &nbsp;in the network are working properly. Iv'e conntaced to the chat supports, but "Ellen" said that I have to contact with my ISP. Nothing what I can you to solve my problem... I seems that it is not only my problem, because I saw so many post
 over the Internet for last two weeks (november 2014).</p>

            <p>Hey there Jivvers!</p>
<p>I'm very sorry to hear that. Will you be able to get a hold of the router password so we change some settings? We will also need to know what the model and brand of your router and modem are so that we can get set on the right path. If you can, please post back and let us know.</p>
<p>arturgemini,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the connection issues, I recommend posting a fresh new thread with all of the details about the issue and any troubleshooting steps you have tried along with your router and modem information. That way you can get support tailored specifically for you! :)</p>

<h2>            Registry Cleaner that works well with Windows 7 Pro 64 bit OS</h2>
                    Do you or can you recommend a Registry Cleaner that works well with Windows 7?&nbsp; In my searches I found RegAce to be the best recommend but on commencing to run the application Windows 7 gave a warning that it had not been tested on this OS.<br />
<br />
What solution should I follow?<br />
Thanks, DAVID.

<h3> ain doe  say:</h3>
<h2>            What should I do with the vhdx file after formatting my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    I just got my laptop formatted from windows 10 to windows 7. In my D: drive, there's a vhdx file that took up the space as much as 120gb. I don't know what to do with the file and is it necessary to still be in my D: drive? What do I do if I delete it?
 and how am I supposed to delete it? Please note that for now, I don't have any plans to revert back to windows 10. Are my files that were there before being formatted inside the vhdx file? and will they be gone if i delete the vhdx file?

<p>A VHDX file is a "virtual hard drive" file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that it's a system image of your computer as it existed before you changed from Windows 10 to Windows 7.<br />

<p>Although you have no present plans to go back to Windows 10, I suggest that you keep a copy of this VHDX file on an external drive somewhere as part of your general backup strategy.</p>

<p>Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
Just wanted to give everyone a heads up. <strong>Rockstar has warned Xbox 360 users to NOT install the "play" disc onto your HDD</strong>.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Only install the mandatory "install" disc.<br />
<br />

<p>Thank you for posting this. &nbsp;I was also bout to post the same information after reading that installing the 2nd disc at this point will cause a "bottleneck" in visual performance. &nbsp;I'm certain an Update will be released at some point but for now, everyone
 avoid installing the 2nd disc. &nbsp;It may seem convenient (and it will eventually be so) but for now this is about performance and hearing the disc and fans run is a small price to pay for the full performance capabilities the game has to offer at launch.</p>

            The <em>My Documents</em> shortcut (the one with an arrow on its icon) is a junction point: a hidden, protected operating system file not meant to be accessed by users.&nbsp; It points to the real, user-accessible
<em>My Documents</em> folder.&nbsp; Don't delete it.&nbsp; For a technical explanation, see the

How do you know that some of the files are locked?&nbsp; What happens if you try to open them?

    <title>Surface Laptop 1 trackpad popped out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> momo_maro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Laptop 1 trackpad popped out</h2>
                    <p>So I bought my Surface Laptop 1 in August, and it is still under warranty. However, the bottom of my track pad popped out and now won't right click or recognize hard clicks. I do not mistreat my computer and always carry it in a padded case. I tried popping
 it back in but couldn't. I didn't want to force it and make it physical damage that was my fault. The track pad mostly works but still is glitchy enough to be frustrating / not practical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I perused the forums, used the online support, got hung up on (before I could even talk) when I tried to call support, THEN went to the Microsoft store to address this issue as discussed. However, at the Microsoft store, I was informed that they didn't
 even have the tools to fix it even if they knew how to. They also told me there was nothing I could do but go to a third party to fix it (located in MD), but to be careful because the third party can't take apart the computer or it ruins my warranty. I call
 the third party fixer recommended to me by the store associates only to be told, it's impossible for them to determine or even attempt to fix without taking the computer apart. So basically, this was a giant waste of time and money to even get to the store
 that is not in my city (DC/VA).<br />
<br />
I tried issuing a service request, but this would technically be physical damage and will thus cost $450. This is particularly ridiculous since this seems to be a recurring problem often caused by the battery in the computer. I figured I would go ahead and
 make a service request but then the website wouldn't even process it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a grad student and my laptop is my life and not having it for a long time is a SERIOUS issue. Also, my parents also just got this computer but the inability to fix it is making them (and me) reconsider Microsoft products all together.
<em>[Edit: Fun fact for anyone reading this, my father who just got his Surface Laptop II happened to get a lemon. (bought it one week before my post, this is a 2-week later Edit) While returning it, he saw two other people at Best Buy having their Surface
 Laptops fixed, one of whom had a similar track pad problem. Instead of getting a replacement, due to Microsoft's poor service with me, he decided to take the option to return it entirely. Well done Microsoft, ya lost at least one customer to this poor service.]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this track pad problem be resolved?</p>

<p>Since the only way to get help from Microsoft is to unfortunately put responses in public.... I will note that at first, Loyd was very helpful, but I am struggling to get responses. I still don't know what's wrong with my computer but also can't use it normally.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Feb 25</strong>: We go back and forth. Set up logistics so that someone can call me. Tells me someone higher support team will call me at the time and number I provided.<br />
</p>
<p>(Full disclosure, I didn't respond after that because I didn't think I needed to, and I wouldn't have to if someone actually contacted me.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>[crickets, I buy a wireless mouse that I need to have at all times to be able to use my computer]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>March 3</strong>: Because I haven't responded, I am put on notice that the thread will close in 24 hours. "All" I need to do to keep it open and have someone address it is to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>March 3</strong>: I send back my sincere apology for not being constantly in touch. Give more precise information in case they were struggling with planning. Tell them the issue is ongoing &amp; that I have not received a single call. Ask for update.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>March 7</strong>: Here we are. Microsoft, will you please have someone call me at the time you said you will? I have yet to have any serious feedback.&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Over 2 weeks of trying to work with Microsoft.</strong>.. I have called support myself. Used the online chat services. Gone to the store. Wrote them in public forum. Have I received a call yet? ... As you can guess by my tone of previous messages
 as well as this message, still not one call from Microsoft since Feb. 25 (or even May 7 -- five days ago). (I'm not counting the times where I called the troubleshooting number or used the chat to set up a call, to get a call that would be silent for a while
 before hanging up on me...)<br />
</p>
<p><strong>So here's a new question. If I go to a third-party fixer who documents that this was in fact not my fault and due to a faulty battery, how do I get reimbursed by Microsoft?</strong>&nbsp;Will you send me a new laptop to replace it? Will you reimburse
 me for my out-of-pocket costs?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have to use my laptop every single day for work and school which is why I have been waiting to hear from Microsoft how to write up the damage report (otherwise, they send it back to me without fixing it, I will lose my laptop for a few days to be in the same
 position I was previously, OR I will be forced to pay $450 upfront for something I did not do).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I presume from their message on Feb 25 that "<span>We totally understand what exactly happen to your Surface device" that they'd be able to help me... IF they had anyone talk to me, this could've been resolved a long time ago.
 PLEASE HELP ME!&nbsp;</span></p>

            Well, that was exactly what I did the first day this happened (and is responsible for my upset tone on my first post). I went to the store already on Feb. 25. They told me that they
<em>absolutely </em>could not help me <em>even though </em>it's under warranty. My only option is to ship it in, which is why I need help figuring out which form to fill out. I really don't want my time to be wasted again by going to the store and them telling
 me to call Microsoft and get it shipped.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But I finally got a call-back! Only took a bit less than a month! Unfortunately, it was during the middle of the night (11 pm) while I was asleep, but baby steps to talking to someone...&nbsp;

<p>Hey did anyone figure out how to fix this problem? The exact same thing happened to me. My cat pushed my laptop off my bed onto the carpet and it was fine except the trackpad popped out a little. I took it to the microsoft store and they told me the same
 thing. That they don't have the tools to fix it and couldn't even if they wanted to. I checked out the laptop break apart videos and this laptop is impossible to take apart without destroying it. Microsoft told me I could either get a wireless mouse, take
 it to a third party, or get it replaced with the warranty. Im still under warranty but because it is physical damage it will cost 450. This is ****. Honestly, I really like this laptop but its quite problematic. I would not recommend it to anyone. When
 I first got it the Microsoft store replaced it twice for free because the laptops internal software shutdown within days of me getting it. Ive been handling the popped out trackpad for some months now because there is seemingly no solution but its really getting
 on my nerves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP</p>

I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. I've only dealt with one helpful person so far (Mervina) but she is not in the US and only available from 12 am - 8 am ET. This is not compatible with my schedule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, despite my computer breaking in late February... It took one month to get in contact with Microsoft (the stores are a JOKE). But due to their delay, I was now in my busiest period (grad school finals that require a laptop to take) and asked
 to wait a month to send it in. I have to lug around a wireless mouse and mousepad everywhere I go. I even paid upfront for expedited shipping.... Told it would be no problem (to wait until after finals... until 2-3 weeks ago), but a new shipping label would
 have to be printed. At that point, I reached out to Mervina asking for a new label. NOPE. The ticket was closed, and I have to wait for someone to reach me. Back to being called or asked to schedule calls at 5 am because NO one from the North American Support
 team has reached out to me EVER. Still dealing with this. Waiting for them to call me to restart the whole bloody process over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty sure they're trying to wait out the Warranty period. Broken in late Feb.... Warranty expires in August. Should be fine..... right?<br />
<br />
Sorry you have to deal with this awful customer service (except you Mervina!) as well! Honestly if you value your time, it might be worth breaking the warranty and getting it fixed at a third party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also, publicly posting is the only way I've gotten responses from Microsoft...)</p>

            Well, my Crystal Ball can't help you.<br />
<br />
What devices ? <br />
What brand/make/model ?<br />
Have you tried installing and using proprietary software from the makers' website ?<br />
If you've got i-devices (Phone, Pad, Touch etc) do you have iTunes installed ?<br />
Have you read the appropriate manuals ?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Giving a little more info would certainly help ......... <br />
<br />

            I did not use a vacuum cleaner, I knew that it could fry the motherboard. I used a dry cloth and took out each individual part while taking care not to touch any contacts or other places where static electricity could be discharged. I know that the CPU
 is working because it is on, I can hear it, and all other parts of the PC are running outside graphics. The HDD is working because the drive is spinning, and the HDD indicator light is on.

            <p>Have you tried moving the monitor in question to another computer to see if you experience the same issue? Also, navigate to device manager to see if there is any indication of a malfunctioning driver?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating or reinstalling the latest&nbsp; drivers could help resolve this issue. To do this, visit your computer manufacturers website to see if you have all the lates drivers installed.</p>

<h2>            Why do Skype updates reset my preferences settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why is it that every time I do an update with Skype it takes over my computer and resets all my preferences? &nbsp;I am tired of having to find my speakers again or Looking for loved programs...Why does Skype think they know best.? &nbsp;I am about to delete it all
 together...the only thing stopping that is a couple friends who use it. &nbsp;And I may convince them to use something else.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you give me an example of the programs and settings that are resetting when you update the Skype application?&nbsp;If you update the app, only the Skype settings should reset to&nbsp;the default settings used by your device which Skype will adapt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are extensions that change or get deleted based from&nbsp;the compatibility with the&nbsp;Skype application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back so we can check this further. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>

    <title>Make Windows more touch-friendly when using your device as a tablet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Make Windows more touch-friendly when using your device as a tablet option is gone</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a 360 HP laptop, windows 10, and it just stopped rotating and turning into tablet mode when i change it's position.</p>
<p>When I go to the action center, the rotation lock is all of the sudden greyed out, and when I checked tablet mode's settings, the "Make Windows more touch-friendly when using your device as a tablet" is gone.</p>
<p>It's like windows stopped supporting 360 laptops.</p>
<p>I remember I used my driver updater tool though, and it did tell me I needed to update some of my drivers, so I did and I believe this is where the problem started.</p>
<p>Anyways, I restored all the updates back to how it was before, but it didn't help.</p>
<p>Suggestions?<br />
</p>

<p>okay nevermined, it's fixed.</p>
<p>The solution was to uninstall Intel's virtual buttons driver.</p>

<p>update: it only worked for a few minutes.</p>
<p>I found this&nbsp;https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=1383317</p>
<p>this guy's case is similar to mine, but I'm not really a tech savvy, so I would appreciate if someone could break it down for me...</p>
