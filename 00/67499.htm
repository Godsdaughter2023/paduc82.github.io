    <title>Disabling Win 10 Upgrade Function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edfelker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling Win 10 Upgrade Function</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 15Z-5523.&nbsp; When looking it up on the Dell Support site it is listed as incompatible and not tested for Win 10 versions above 1607.&nbsp; I'm perfectly happy running Win 10 Version 1607 -- BUT-- the Win 10 Upgrade function keeps automatically
 downloading upgrade versions above 1607.&nbsp; It then tries to install the upgrade only to go through the entire install procedure, get to the end, and then tell me (and perform) that it&nbsp;will restore the previous version of Win 10.&nbsp; Over the past year it has tried
 to make the upgrade, and waste the time it takes to finally restore the previous version, at least 40 or 50 times.&nbsp; I've looked all over the web for suggestions for disabling the upgrade function.&nbsp; I've set my wifi connection to metered.&nbsp; I've run Services.msc
 and set the Windows Upgrade Startup to Disabled.&nbsp; It still&nbsp;downloads and tries to install the upgrades that are physically incompatible with the operating system.&nbsp;

<div>Hi EdFelker,</div>
<div><br />
You can use the Local Group Policy Editor to prevent updates from installing automatically. This is an advanced troubleshooting so I suggest that you create a System Restore point so you can go back to this state in case that you will encounter any issues along
 the process. To create a system restore point, refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done creating a system restore point, you may then proceed to defer the updates in Local Group Policy. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows key</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>+<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>R</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on your keyboard.<br />
</li><li>On the run command box type,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>gpedit.msc</strong>, and then hit<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Double-click the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Configure Automatic Updates</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>policy.<br />
</li><li>On the left pane, check the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enabled</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>option.<br />
</li><li>Under<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Options</strong>, you may choose to the following choices on how to configure automatic updates:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •2 - Notify for download and notify for install.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •3 - Auto download and notify for install.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •4 - Auto download and schedule the install.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •5 - Allow local admin to choose the settings.</li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Apply</strong>, and then hit<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li><strong>Restart</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>your computer to apply the changes.</li></ol>
<p>

            <p>You probably *don't* have a URL.&nbsp; You have an IP, you might have an internal/private one and an external/public one you share with other devices on your private LAN.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; cmd /k ipconfig</p>
<p>... and click OK.&nbsp; A command prompt will open and there may be a part called "IPv4 Address" and after that will be your private IP address.</p>
<p>As far as your email address, you should know that because you get that from the Email Service Provider you choose (and usually your Internet Service Provider coughs up a few too.)&nbsp; If you don't know it...</p>

    <title>Where do I lodge a complaint about packaging from the Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morichalion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where do I lodge a complaint about packaging from the Microsoft Store&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Surface Pro 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was in UPS' system for a couple of weeks (my fault, maybe, should've bought the expedited shipping).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it arrived, it was in a big box that had been crushed a few times along the way. The packing material (a few air bags) only filled about half the space in the box, so, every time the box was picked up or jostled, the retail boxes of the tablet and the
 keyboard had to have felt the full force of the blow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that it wasn't damaged is either a testament to the quality of construction on the devices, or the result of pure, blind luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know where to go to send pictures of the box it came it. I've uploaded them to Imgur here:&nbsp;http://imgur.com/a/SgSOY</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a really nice device so far, I must say I'm pleased once I've gotten around a few pressure-sensitivity issues. But I'm horrified at the shoddy way it was shipped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I was hoping to find out where I should send these pictures.</p>

            I had the same issue recently when my surface arrived in a crushed box, photographed it too. The damaged box in the middle is the docking station, the outer box is the Surface. As for packing material just a piece of cardboard folded in half.

<p>For the record I did pass this information back through the driver but I guess that is where it will stop. I also raised it with support but as they didn't even take down my serial number I suggest this wont go any further either. The time and trouble it
 takes to get through discourages users for providing genuine feedback. The surface inside the damage box still worked so I left it at that. None the less thanks for your response.&nbsp; As for the Surface itself I enjoy using it.</p>

==================================<br />
Maybe the freeware VLC Media Player would be<br />
worth a try...it will play just about anything.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player<br />
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc/</a><br />
(runs on XP/Vista/7)<br />
(the filename to download is : vlc-2.0.2-win32.exe)<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

    <title>Xbox Live will not Accept my credit card number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khm darkness  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live will not Accept my credit card number</h2>
                    
<p>This is driving me crazy. I have been using a credit card for my payments for Xbox Live, but I needed a new card so I did not put any more money on the card. Yesterday, I received the notification that a payment on my previous card did not go through. But
 I had to wait until my new card came in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally have that card and I went online on my laptop to put it in. However, each time I try to put it in, right below the text bar where I typed in the credit card number, it said 'Please enter a valid Credit Card Number'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I figured I mistyped, so I check and saw nothing wrong. So I clicked 'save'. The same thing came up. So I erased it and retyped the number, to be sure, and triple checked the number. Again; "Please enter a Valid Credit Card Number".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the card is active, it accepts everything else, even the Security Code, but it won't accept the credit card number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netflix has also accepted the credit card number, so I know for a fact it's not the card. Can someone please help me with this problem?</p>

<p>There are no balances, and the next bill date is in July.</p>
<p>However, today I put the card in through my Xbox and I had no problems, and it's listed in my Payment options now. I suppose it could have been just an error on the website or through Live. But we will see if it really will work when I have to pay for renewal.</p>
<p>Thank you for trying to help, and sorry if I am going to 'show my @@@' as some people say right now, but this has not been the first time something like this has happened. The last time, Xbox Live would not take ANY credit card, one even belonging to my
 sister, just to see if even that would go in. I had to call and wait for over an hour to get anything.</p>
<p>And another time when we called, because my account was stuck on silver, the person said I had to make an entire new account just to have Gold again. One other time the person told me I could not use the same credit card if it was rejected even once, even
 if it has money on it now.</p>
<p>As much as I love Xbox Live, this is getting ridiculous and tiring. One or two problems I would expect, but it seems like almost every time I need to renew my account or buy Microsoft Points, there is something wrong. And it had to do with Xbox Live itself.
 I had no balances, no problems on my end with the money. It was always Xbox Live.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I seem like I'm ranting, but I should not have to go through with this over and over again.</p>
<p>Still, I will not quit Live because of all of that. I just love it too much... and Halo is always great to play on Live. I suppose the good outweighs the bad.</p>

<p>As a precaution, if you do end up submitting payment with a a new card there will be a forced automatic renewal option. Although some sources say you can remove this online - that feature is broken and the only current way to remove this is by calling their
 support at: Toll free: (800) 4MY-XBOX or (800) 469-9269</p>
<p>If you opt not to cancel the auto-renew, by the time you see the charge on your bank account it may be too late to request a refund. (For myself it wasn't charged until 30 days after the 'billing date')</p>
<p>If you do opt to call them to cancel the auto-renew be sure to have the information listed from this page handy:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/pages/call-us.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>This is an update with my account. Right now, I have been suspended from Gold!</p>
<p>And Xbox will STILL not accept my credit card, while even other companies, like Netflix, have. Over and over again, I have selected that payment option, and still they did not take money out. And now, they suspend me?</p>
<p>This is not acceptable. The card was brand new, money was on it. I've had enough.</p>
<p>Right now, I do not have any money on the card, because I had to pay other things today (Internet, for example), but I'm calling Xbox and... well, to put it as others would say it 'Showing my A*s'. Unless I get an answer between then and now to have this
 resolved...</p>
<p>Ugh.... I'm sorry, but it's been about a month, and there's no reason they could not take money off of the card.</p>

            I am currently having this problem, as well. There is no error message; when I click on an item in the store, in the box where the screenshot of the application would be, the box is greyed over and a message reads, "You must be old enough to view images
 or videos." It does not do this with all items in the store, and it does not give me the image later. I have not made any changes to my account, and I checked my settings. I also looked at the same item through my Windows phone, and it displays the images.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Upgrade removed the HP CM1312nfi printer and changed the boot drive order.</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 8.1 upgrade went fairly well with two exceptions: the HP CM1312nfi printer disappeared; and the boot drive got&nbsp;bumped for a non-boot drive in the CMOS. I re-ran the HP&nbsp;printer setup and selected the option to install another printer to the PC.
 To my surprise, it actually worked. &nbsp;The boot issue was resolved by changing the boot hard drive to first place in the boot order in the PC Setup program. I do not know how the Windows 8.1 Upgrade altered the hard drive order, but it did. I have had zero issues
 with booting since the Windows 8.0 install. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say I liked Windows 8. I am looking forward to discovering the new features added by the upgrade.

<p><br />
Yes, the HP Scan works which I originally &nbsp;installed under Windows 8.0 using CM1312_Full_Solution_Win7_5_1_AM-EMEA1 setup package&nbsp;.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After I ran the Windows 8.1 Upgrade, I tried to print via the networked&nbsp;HP CM1312nfi printer.&nbsp;The print job failed, so I looked at &nbsp;the Control Panel; Hardware and Sound (View devices and printers). The printer was displayed, but it was the Microsoft CM1312nfi
 driver not the HP driver from the setup package. I removed the Microsoft printer driver. I opened File Explorer; searched and opened the CM1312_Full_Solution_Win7_5_1_AM-EMEA1 folder. I ran the Autorun.exe which displayed the setup Menu. One of the items in
 the Menu is&nbsp;Setup another CM1312nfi printer. I selected that item, and the printer driver setup started. I selected my printer which the printer scan found on the network.&nbsp;After the driver installed completed: the fax, scan, and print functions were restored.
 I had to do this same procedure for my second PC which I upgraded to Windows 8.1. Also, the Microsoft New Scan (look in Apps)&nbsp;works.&nbsp;Check it out. The New Scan may work with the Microsoft Print driver. You might try it.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had one additional problem which is related to printing from Office 2013 and HPMSN093.dll.&nbsp; HPMSN093.dll was not completing. The solution is posted in another thread in this forum.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this helps you getting the HP Scan to work.</p>

            <p>I am running Windows 8.1 32-Bit to avoid compatibility problems with some of my older&nbsp;hardware which includes the CM1312nfi Printer. The HP Support website shows for Windows 8.1, 32 and 64-Bit,&nbsp;download "HP Color LaserJet CM1312 MFP Series Full Solution".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 had a lot of problems getting HP's setup package to install on Windows 8.0 on my two PCs. It took many tries before it succeeded. The setup would fail during the network setup portion. I am glad I did not have to run the printer setup after the 8.1 Upgrade.
 I just ran the add another printer to the PC selection. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows Fax and Scan, as well as, the New Scan Apps work with the HP Driver package. I do&nbsp;not know if they work with the Microsoft CM1312nfi driver.&nbsp;

            <p>I am running Windows 8.1 64 bit and after the upgrade over the weekend I found I could no longer Scan to the HP LaserJet 1312 MFP. I uninstalled the printer and attempted to re-install it using the Full Solution v.5.1 software downloaded from HP's website.
 However, about halfway through the process, I get a "Network Installation Failed" error and the installation stalls. I researched the issue and tried all of the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Disabling all antivirus and firewalls and re-running the installation.</p>
<p>2. Going into the print UI and deleting the 1312 ports and drivers, restarting the computer and re-running the installation.</p>
<p>3. Trying custom installation, instead of express.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>None of the above worked. I realize Win 8.1 is brand new, but there must be some solution to allow a simple printer installation. I would feel more confident if there was a Full Solution software installer that was newer than 2009 on HP's website. Help!</p>

            <p>Did you have the Full Solution v.5.1 installed on Windows 8.0 before the upgrade?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In any case, I had the same network error you mentioned in the HP CM1312nfi Full Solution v.5.1 Setup after installing Windows 8.0. I got around the network error by making the printer's IP address static in the router and disconnecting and removing&nbsp;the
 CM1312nfi memory card reader in File Explorer, Disk Management, and Device Manager. It appears the memory card reader was preventing the printer from connecting to&nbsp;the network during the&nbsp;printer network setup. I had this error on 3 PC's.

            Thanks Allen. You are amazing! Deleting the memory card reader in File Explorer did the trick. I was able to reinstall the software without getting the&nbsp;dreaded "Network&nbsp;Installation Failed." I am now back&nbsp;up and scanning again. You would think the software
 would be smart enough to realize there already&nbsp;is a memory card reader and to just use it, rather than freezing up. Oh well. I&nbsp;guess if I ran HP, I would run it into the&nbsp;ground. Thanks again.&nbsp;

<h2>            Media Creation Tool shutting off&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried to install windows 10 on my PC. I am using windows 7 ultimate on 64 bit right now. When i try to use Media Creation tool to install windows 10, it keeps automatically exiting out of the program a few minutes after it starts to "verify my download".
 i have deleted and redownloaded the program several times. I have also deleted the C:windows:&gt;software distribution&gt;download files, and the $windowsBT file. It always seems to exit the program when it starts to verify mr download. i an reach 100% download
 just fine but i cant get past the verification. do i need to delete something else? I have also checked the windows 10 app and it says my PC is compatible with windows 10. does anyone else have this problem??

    <title>Windows 7 for Students&#58; Microsoft Ultimate Steal Program&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> docmars  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 for Students&#58;  Microsoft Ultimate Steal Program&#63;</h2>
                    Hey Microsoft,<br />
<br />
Is there going to be an Ultimate Steal program for students for Windows 7 as well?<br />
I am currently trying to decide whether to wait for a program like this, or go ahead and buy the Windows 7 Professional Upgrade at discount price (50% off).<br />
<br />
If I can get Ultimate edition for much less under an Ultimate Steal program from you guys, I would much prefer that later on than pay extra now for the pre-order.<br />
<br />
Do you have any information on that yet?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Andy

            No word yet from Microsoft. My personal advice is to go and grab 7 Professional now at 50% off. If there is a discount later for students then it wouldn't be any better than 50% off of an upgrade disc. Currently there are no discounts planned for Windows
 &nbsp;7 Ultimate.
<div><br />
<div>So your options as you may have already figured out: jump now and get a great product at a known and guaranteed discount - or - wait for the "what if" factor and maybe you win or maybe you lose. So it's a gamble. Keep in mind that there are only 2 key
 differences between Professional and Ultimate as well.</div>

            Where did your video files come from?<br />
We often see weird problems like this when working with odd file types.<br />
I'm wondering if you converted the files from one file type to wmv the programme that did it didn't do a good job.<br />
Does it happen with all wmv files from all different sources?<br />
<br />
What about the windows supplied video file?<br />
<br />
Another suggestion might be to reinstall MM, as it may be corrupt.<br />
<br />
Can you give us the full release number of MM, so we can ensure it is the very latest version.<br />

 in it. I just tried with a random sampling of a few other files (WMV and M4A files) and it did not happen. (It may be a problem with just this file, but unfortunately I can't simply re-record it; I need to use
<i>this</i> file.)</b><br />
<br />
Can you give us the full release number of MM, so we can ensure it is the very latest version.
<b>Build 16.4.3505.0912.</b></div>

<div><b>Thanks for any help or suggestions you can provide, with the specific issue with this video and/or the repeated crashing.</b></div>

            If it appears to be just that file, it could be the codec used to create the wmv file by the webcam software.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest using some 3rd party software such as Freemake or Super to convert it to wmv again, but using a more standard wmv9 codec.<br />

            That's a good idea. I'll give it a try this afternoon. What about the repeated crashing? That is not only not exclusive to this video, it happens sometimes even when I have a completely empty project (as noted above).

            It might be a problem with the installation of Movie maker, so the only other thing I can think of is when you have finished work on this project, uninstall and reinstall MM.<br />
If that doesn't work, start a new thread, just for this problem and hopefully one of the mods will pick it up and request some log files from you to look at.<br />

            If the issue has occurred recently, then in that case, I would suggest you to preform a system restore to a recent point in time prior to the instant the issue created in order to retain the previous settings for your system. To do so, refer to the following steps:
<br />
<br />a) Press Windows key + R, type rstrui.exe and click OK.
<br />
<br />b) Follow the onscreen instructions and check for the issue.
<br />
<br />This is a system restore
