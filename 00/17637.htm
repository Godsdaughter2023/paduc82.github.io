            What type of email account do you use? If IMAP or Outlook.com (Exchange), the mail and folders will sync when you add the account. 
<br />
<br />If it's POP account or you use a PST file, you'll need to copy the PST to the new computer and open it.  To open it, go to File, open &amp; export, open Outlook data file. This will add it to your profile.

<br />
<br />From the description, sounds like what you're stating is that the email account is configured on both computers and the folder names have synchronized which, if the case, means that this is either an IMAP or Exchange account.
<br />
<br />If there is a lot of data in the email folders, it may take a while for the contents to sync down to the computer.

<h2>            Computer fraud</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 but this may be an unrelated question, I'm unsure. I keep a hard copy printout (paper) of my credit card information for back-up. I don't store it on my computer, I do store it on a spare USB storage drive that I don't use except for
 storage. One of my credit cards on that hard copy I haven't used for almost six months and it has a zero balance with no activity. On the 22nd I updated my hard copy paper and reprinted it. Today I learned that someone committed fraud charges with that credit
 card number and they did it on the 22nd. Credit card company says fraud is common, but my thoughts are that it's too coincidental to be chance, I'm guessing somehow my hard copy was accessed on my computer. Why would one of my dead cards sitting several months
 suddenly be accessed on the same day I randomly chose to update my hard copy? MY QUESTIONS: 1."Do you agree?" 2. "How is this possible?" 3. "How come my other credit cards were not also accessed?" 4. "I'm considering wiping my c

<p>Does the USB flash drive&nbsp;containing the hard copy information for that particular credit card contain:</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 16 digits of the credit card number</p>
<p>Your name as listed on the card</p>
<p>Expiration date for the card</p>
<p>Billing address for the Card</p>
<p>The Security Code from the back of the card</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all or at least the first&nbsp;3 of these necessary items aren't available, then it's unlikely the information was acquired from the USB or your computer.&nbsp; That's because all of these items are typically required in order to successfully use the card, so without
 any one except possibly the Security Code, no one should be able to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the card company indicated, most such fraud is due to other avenues such as a business where you'd used that card in the past having been breached recently by hackers.&nbsp; For example, the Chipotle restaurant chain recently confirmed that many of their customer's
 credit card information had been stolen between March 24 and April 18 of this year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you indicated your card hadn't been used for several months, this wasn't likely to have affected you, but there are literally dozens if not hundreds of such cases every year, some of which we'll never hear about because the businesses are too small
 and often technically incapable of detecting the fact that they've been breached.</p>

<p>Then that's what you should change, since there's no good reason to maintain any of that on your computer or another device you might use for any reason I can think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only information you need when calling to report a lost or stolen card is your personal information and any security information they use to identify you, along with the customer service phone number for the card company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, none of this information is ever needed except when actually using the card itself.&nbsp; And if the card is lost or stolen, it should always be immediately reported and&nbsp;disabled by the card company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again, I can think of no valid reason to ever duplicate any of this information, since all this does is add risk that this might be stolen by someone, either via the computer or simply someone who has access to your house reading it&nbsp;off the paper.</p>

            Yes, that seems right. It looks pretty stupid of me to do it now when I discuss it, and I'm not sure why I put all the info on the hard copy? Originally I just made the hard copy for the passwords and secret question answers and the phone numbers of the
 card and the cash advance limit, but I guess I just assumed I should be thorough or something and I listed all the card details, I guess it does seem pretty stupid and idiotic now when I realize what I've done. Also, discussing it now makes me realize that
 I should still keep a typewriter around so I could type a hard copy instead of using a computer. Your right, there is no reason to keep all that info on file, just some things. But if someone accessed it then why didn't they also access all the other cards
 on the hard copy? That makes me believe it wasn't my hard copy that they obtained, but then when you realize they committed the fraud on the same day I retyped and printed the hard copy then it seem much too coincidental, wouldn't you agree? Thank you.<br />

<p>As the card company customer support stated, it's likely just a coincidence.&nbsp; That's especially true since it's unlikely the information could have been misused that fast, since it still takes time for the thief to create a fake card and go to a store or
 even simply use it online, which is less likely since that would require a false delivery address and identity&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your online account for that card can still be accessed, you might be able to see when the fraudulent purchase occurred, so if there wasn't significant time of at least several hours&nbsp;between your printing out the information and the card use, it's not
 likely they were related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the information you're writing down, none of it should ever be stored anywhere.&nbsp; Always try to choose security questions with answers that never change, like your mother's middle/maiden name or name of your elementary school.&nbsp; This is important, since
 you may need these at inopportune times like while on a vacation when the paper copy and home computer may not be handy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also typically possible to change&nbsp;an account password by using the account name and answering a couple security questions, which is why these exist, so there's no need to write that down either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in the computer security field and have sometimes had literally dozens, if not hundreds of individual account names and passwords to remember.&nbsp; I used various sets of similar, but slightly different passwords for similar purposes, with major differences
 only for the handful of highly&nbsp;critical accounts like the bank, other financial institutions&nbsp;or social security.&nbsp; For example, using the same base password for multiple utility company accounts, with an additional letter or number added to the beginning or
 end for each, which makes them all different but&nbsp;easy to remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use other common tricks&nbsp;such as&nbsp;converting certain letters like&nbsp;A to 4,&nbsp;E to 3,&nbsp;o to 0 (Zero)&nbsp;or similar, but these depend on your ability to apply these in memory.&nbsp; If you search for "strong password" online you'll find lots of articles and
 tools, but typically simpler to remember is better, with password length more important than complexity.&nbsp; Using a phrase with either the trick above and/or replacing spaces with numbers or an easily remembered sequence like the following might work for important
 accounts you access rarely.&nbsp; Note the upper case letters and/or look-alike number&nbsp;substitutions in the second example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First1Second2Third3Fourth4Word#! &nbsp;- (Note: Special characters&nbsp;such as # or !&nbsp;are not allowed on all systems)</p>
<p>F1r5T 53c0nd Th1rd F0urth W0rd&nbsp; - (You could remove spaces here, I left them for clarity)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Th3 P455w0rd&nbsp;F0r My B4nk$$$&nbsp; - (This example should now be obvious, spaces again included&nbsp;for clarity)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can come up with many variations, but picking one or two and using them consistently is best, since that's easier to remember.&nbsp; The only difficulty are exceptions like those sites that limit passwords to short lengths like 10 or 12 characters, which
 only leaves complexity (e.g. numbers, upper/lower case letters&nbsp;and special characters, no dictionary words)&nbsp;to insure they aren't simple to crack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone either manages to capture your passwords using a keylogger or malware, it doesn't matter how complex they are, the computer will get every character exactly as it's typed.&nbsp; This is the fallacy behind complex passwords, they only make remembering
 the password difficult for the human using it and do nothing to protect from leaving them lying around on a piece of paper or in a spreadsheet on the computer.</p>

            I did all that right away, and changed my security questions too. Some of my credit cards are maxed out so with those I am just going to see if any attempted activity occurs, since no charges can be made on them, with others I will eventually call the
 credit card company and get new cards. Thank you.

<p>That's a great idea, to find out the exact time of day those charges were incurred, I will write to my credit card company and ask that. They already provided me the phone number associated with those fake charges, 18663054707. I called it and it is an automated
 service that repeats "enter your pass code" "enter your pass code". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like peace of mind knowing whether the access was out of my control (breach out in the commercial system) or whether I did it, so your idea of learning the exact time could be the difference I'm seeking. My neighbor left her smart phone at
 a large shopping mall then later in the day cancelled her phone and got a new one. About a week or two later we attended a grand opening for a new gas station chain in our city and she used her card their to pay. Then few days later she had fraud on that card
 committed in another state of the U.S. She believes it was from using her card at that gas station. I told her it was likely her phone she lost. Neither of us knows for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My passwords are good, and I use to use easy to remember ones (some I still do) but I have 3 to 4 pages printed out of passwords for accounts, college loans, and all the websites I use or visit. Currently it amounts to about 35-40 passwords and relevant
 info. It's too much to remember. I don't trust going to one of those "master password-for-all password" resources and now I see in the news they have been hacked too anyway. Do you feel those systems are a good idea? Safe?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm comfortable having my passwords on paper and stored safely but I will change the credit card info we talked about earlier, because you are right. For me I have to have the passwords written down somewhere because even though I have a great memory I get
 slips on a regular basis. I remember things and details most people don't but then again if I spend a day away from home doing intense work or projects or mechanics, I find sometimes at the end of that day I can't remember how to get home, becasue my mind
 stays locked in the tasks at hand. Or another example, I use screen locks on my phone &amp; computer and use it everyday all year but suddenly one day I can't remember it and it takes 24 hours for it to return to me. It's at times like that I need to reference
 my hard copy. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The internet &amp; computes give us such gigantic new possibilities and tools and resources, my smart phone has changed the way I live my life! It's terribly disheartening that their is so much sabotage and hacking and bad intent out there on the web and in
 the computer world. People are just regular people trying to live their lives and pay their bills and save some work earned money, and they get attacked. I'm poor! I have no money! And yet I get attacked. Thank you</p>

<p>I recently researched those password manager programs for someone else and saw that some had been compromised as well, though those were for Andriod phones and the issues had been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it's possible to crack the encryption these use if the malicious person gets a copy of the file containing them and takes the [potentially long]&nbsp;time to run a program made to crack them.&nbsp; So&nbsp;they're not a guarantee of safety, though they would
 be better than simply saving the passwords in clear text on the PC instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reality of the computer world is that the Internet can allow a malicious person anywhere in the world to try and attack your Internet attached devices, so there's no truly safe border unless you detach your device(s)&nbsp;completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other truth is that the US is generally richer than any of the 3rd-world countries many of these attacks come from, so though you may personally feel poor, to them you still appear rich.&nbsp; So don't expect that a truly poor person in a 3rd-world country
 will allow his own life to be threatened by&nbsp;a question of stealing&nbsp;money from a person he doesn't know elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>I've been following up with the problem and so far it looks like it originated elsewhere and not on my computer. Of the two separate fraud charges I've researched one and spoke with the company that was attempted with the fraud and they are a UK company
 and the charges were online using a VPN, they flagged it and it never went through. They believe based on their best guess (and experience) that the charge came from China.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other charge was made to a Pennsylvania cosmetics retailer and it went through, actually more than once, and the products were shipped to an address. I've spoken with the cosmetics retailer over the phone and they won't share any details for security
 purposes but I've contacted various authorities and I'm waiting to see what they learn based on the information I gave them. I find it interesting that the UK charges were flagged but the cosmetics ones were not. Hmm? Hopefully the authorities can give me
 some info regarding what name and address and card info was used for that purchase. If the purchase occurred without all the correct info then that says something right there about that cosmetics company anyway. So I'll wait and see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This next part is likely a long, long shot but almost the same time this fraud on my credit card occurred I also began receiving aggressive fraud spam, and also at this time I was dealing with a California business whom I purchased a product from online
 (not with the card that later was breached, in fact paid with PayPal) and later they refuse to honor their warranty claim when the part turned out to be bad. I researched the company and they use a fake name and have another business name with two people's
 names listed as the owners and at least one appears to be Chinese, the other I'm not sure about. I was pressing them to honor their warranty and tenaciously following up with them and they may be upset with that and possibly are retaliating with the fraud
 spam and card breach? As I said it may be a long shot but it seems peculiar that at that same time I'm dealing with this company (unsatisfactorily) I also start getting aggressive fraud spam and then one of my cards is breached. I'm guessing most or all of
 the auto parts this California company sells online are from China, and it wouldn't surprise me if the company is Chinese and is based in China with an office and retail outlet in California. They also appear to have the same office and retail outlet in Australia.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll see what the authorities get back to me with. Any thoughts from you Rob?</p>

<p>I have no real idea, since it could be any pathway where someone could get all of the necessary info to use the card number.&nbsp; Since you're in the UK, it's less likely to be skimming from the card locally, since as I understand it you've been using the chip
 cards there for years now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here in the US we've just begun to switch, so breaches due to card skimmers and other card based techniques are far more common.&nbsp; However, the largest breaches are still usually due to malware attacks on individual merchant's computer systems, where batches
 of card data are stolen for recent customer transactions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd only think that an organization you provided the necessary card data to could have used it or passed it on to someone else, so those where&nbsp;you used other payment methods would have to have accessed the files you stored on your PC by sending you something
 containing malware such as an email attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't recall your entire history, but if you felt a malware attack had occurred, then understanding how that was delivered to you initially&nbsp;might lead in a possible direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think it's more likely it was someone you gave this card info to yourself though, since most such breaches are relatively simple.</p>

<h2>            Mail not consistently sent from Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Dear MS community:<br />
<br />
I use Outlook 2013 to access several email accounts: a personal and business Gmail account, a Hotmail / Outlook.com and another business account at a different service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been getting this error message - sometimes - when trying to send an email: "The operation failed. The messaging interfaces have returned an unknown error. If the problem persists restart Outlook. Cannot resolve recipient."</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a different error message about incompatible interfaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got this message from archive log:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Error while archiving folder "Calendar" in store "G Suite -
patrickm@xxxx". Could not complete the operation because the service provider does not support it.</span></p>
<p><span>Error while archiving folder "Sent Items" in store "patrick.mclaughlin@xxx". The destination folder contains items of a different type than the source folder.
 Verify both the source and destination folders contain the same type of items.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not use to have these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help get me back on track?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very inconvenient to have to access a web client to send mail because Outlook can't fulfill its mission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Windows Insider Product Key and Eligibility to use as Retail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlz s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Insider Product Key and Eligibility to use as Retail</h2>
                    <p>Just a simple question, I am pretty sure I joined the Insider program in June 2015 and when I did like many other people I was given a product key, bear in mind I was on Windows 7 at the time (not sure if this ties in) and did a clean install using the key
 I was provided from the Insider group, after a few phone calls and online chats I have been told the key I was given was labeled as a "Windows 8 Pro" licence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my question is do I now own a digital licence for Windows 10 (after upgrading) which is tied to my account? because when I now do a clean install, Windows 10 is automatically activated with the insider preview option disabled and I can use it as if it
 was a full retail copy, and I can choose to enable preview builds if I wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is or was this key meant to be used for insider purposes only or was I given a Windows 8 key to allow me to upgrade and test only, what stopping me from never using insider builds and just having the latest consumer builds?</p>

            <p>The answer is in your Settings App under Activation:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab6f47f8-42ae-45d3-92b0-0f3f04defd49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab6f47f8-42ae-45d3-92b0-0f3f04defd49" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p>You might possibly have noticed that even&nbsp;if you do a clean install of the public build of Windows, without logging in with a Microsoft Account, it will still auto-activate. The section shown above would then read the same, except for the phrase "linked
 to your Microsoft account". This is because it is your device that has the Digital License for Windows. That license
<em>can be </em>linked to your Microsoft Account, but it does not depend on that link. If you were to sell your computer to someone else it would still auto-activate Windows 10 Pro if they were to clean install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is no dependence of your digital&nbsp;license on the Insiders Program at all. In fact Insider Builds would not activate if you did not already have a digital license for Windows 10 for that device. There is nothing stopping you from never using Insider
 Builds again if you so choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What linking to your Microsoft Account does provide is a means to look up your license and activate Windows if you were to make a major hardware change, such as changing the motherboard, which would prevent the auto-activation process&nbsp;from seeing it as the
 same device. In that case, the Activation Troubleshooter can help to find the Windows 10 Pro license and re-assign it to the new hardware.</p>

            <p>Sounds like you are asking 2 questions here.&nbsp; First, activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like you properly came over from a qualifying W7 or W8.1 license and your PC is permanently activated.&nbsp; Should not be an issue here.&nbsp; Product keys are no longer used for digital licenses.&nbsp; The PC gets the W10 activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insiders is an option to the public build.&nbsp; I wiped my hard drive recently on an activated W10, due to issues with recent Insider builds.&nbsp; I installed public build from BIOS and got the public build back up and running.&nbsp; When I saw a new and latest Insider
 release, I just went to Settings and signed up again to join Insiders on the fast lane.&nbsp; I got build 15014 within 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be good to go with facts given.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info guys and I totally understand the deal with the insider builds and hardware changes ect, but what I want to confirm is that I believe to have been given a Key for W8 Pro when I signed up for insider, as the computer I installed from fresh
 with the key did not have any previous OS's installed I actually entered the key during installation when I first downloaded and insider build in July 2015 not online activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically have I been given a Key for free? this is whats confusing me as the key was sent within an email when I first signed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if so has this now been attached to my account as a full W10 licence, additionally what would happen if I was to buy more licence keys for W10 for VMs, would these attached to my account also and be able to be viewed and set to machines of my choice?</p>

            <p>Your activation is not to the OS but to the computer.</p>
<p>Meaning that it is not retail and you do not have a key.</p>
<p>You can reinstall Windows 10 and when asked for a key all you have to do is to go to the bottom ob the page and click on the note that says Skip, Do this later, or I do not have one.</p>

            <p>Do you have this email still? Prior to July 2015, there were Insider Builds that used a generic Product Key to activate. But the final few builds prior to the public release ceased to use Product Keys for activation. They were instead activated by detecting
 that an <em>activated </em>qualifying OS (Windows 7, 8.1 or 10) was detected at the beginning of the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the first public release of Windows 10, upgrades that were activated for free,&nbsp;based on a detected, qualifying activated OS, have a generic Product Key (one for Pro and another for Home) but the Product Key is never used to activate Windows 10. The
 generic Windows 10&nbsp;Pro (Free Upgrade) Product Key is VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the November, 2015 (version 1511) of Windows 10, it became possible to activate a clean install of Windows 10 without first upgrading from Windows 7 or 8. In these cases, it became possible to enter the Windows 7 or 8 Product Key to activate a clean
 install of Windows 10. The Product Key would have been the Key previously in use on that same device (when it was running Windows 7 or 8).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC shipped with Windows 7, but I upgraded to Windows 8 for a nominal fee ($15) because of having purchased the PC&nbsp;just prior to the Windows 8 release. They did e-mail me a Windows 8 Product Key at that time.</p>

            <p>I do not have the exact email but I do have to code I was given saved from the email, I did not upgrade from W7 or 8 it was a fresh install on a new system with the code I used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have called MS support and had the key checked and came back each time as a Windows 8 Pro Key, or so they say, this is what makes me think there is more to it than that so right now I am lead to believe I have been given a full legit key at the time.</p>

It will tell you when it expires.

            <p>If you run slmgr /dlv from a command prompt, you get all information you need.</p>
<p>If your Partial product key shows 3V66T, it means your system&nbsp;had a free upgrade from W7, W8 or 8.1.</p>
<p>If your Partial product key shows a different value, your system&nbsp;came with W10 But whatever this value,
<strong>your </strong>system is now permanently activated with a digital license linked to your MSA</p>

            <p>Ok so it shows as 3V66T and I suppose I can accept that I am fully activated and can choose to use insider build if I wish and never have to worry about buying a licence for this machine ever again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im just confused seeing as though the key I was given was completely different to the generic upgrade key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>last questions though</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wanted to use this licence on another machine I would choose the changed hardware option right? but what if I had another machine I wanted to have Windows 10 on? I would obviously have to buy another key but when it came to activating does that mean
 I would have the ability to register two devices on my account when reinstalling them? and if I was to add a third would it ask for another licence?</p>

<h2>            URGENT&#58; Please help - Microsoft Outlook not opening &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to open Microsoft Outlook but am getting the below error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Outlook giving error message "We're sorry, but Outlook has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Outlook will need to be closed as a result. Would you like to repair now? "</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It gives me an option "Repair now" but doesn't seem to fix the issue. I have tried all options, checking if it runs in compatibility mode but it all seems fine. Please help.</p>

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am starting a new real estate brokerage and will be hiring real estate agents. I wish to pay the agents on a graduating commission split (the more the agent sells, the greater the % split). This plan is
 for any calendar year- then starts anew on January 1. For the purpose of this sheet, I only am concerned about the sales in 1 calendar year.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would like to have a spreadsheet table that show one transaction side per row. Then shows the agent what their exact commission is based on that transaction.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The splits would have two criteria: amount of total CUMULATIVE sales and whether the transaction was a BUY or LIST. It would be as follows:</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TIER MIN</td>
<td>TIER MAX</td>
<td>BUY</td>
<td>LIST</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$1</td>
<td>$4,999,999</td>
<td>80%</td>
<td>70%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$5,000,000</td>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The challenge for me is: what happens when a single transaction crosses the threshold of one tier to the next. How does the agent get accurately compensated at the percentage below the threshold and increased
 percentage ABOVE the threshold?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So for instance please see attached spreadsheet:</span></p>

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So of that $350,000 - the first $150,000 is credited to her at 80% (getting her to the top of that 80% bracket). Then the remaining $200,000 would be credited to Tammy at the next bracket level of 82%.

            <p>Hi, assuming your data are in column A,B.C and D, and you enter the commission to be paid, i.e 10% then I obtained a % based on the Buy % times the commission which give 0.08 0.083 0.087 0.09 0.095, then in F1 you enter the total sales</p>
<p>5200000 in another cell enter this formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT(--(F1&gt;{1,4999999,9999999,14999999,19999999}),(F1-{1,4999999,9999999,14999999,19999999}),{0.08,0.003,0.004,0.003,0.005})</p>
<p>
</p><p>the last part of the formula are the % incremental change it for yours and do the same for sales</p>
<p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;DanL158,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you already tried to uninstall and reinstall Skype? If not please do. Also, you may try to do the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force Quit Skype.</li><li>Press Command + Shift + G</li><li>Type ~/library/application support/Microsoft</li><li>Rename your Skypefordesktop folder to Skypefordesktop_old</li><li>Test your audio and video if the issue still persist.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If this will not work, try to turn off your Router for a couple of minutes to refresh your internet connection and turn it on and check if the issue will be the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and I look forward to your reply!</p>

<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />A good way to test if it is the application or the network connection is to try another version of Skype. Please try Skype for Web and see if it is any better:-

                    <p>I installed the preview on my Macbook using bootcamp. (fresh install)</p>
<p>Asked Cortana a question and it prompted me to change my account to a Microsoft account so I did.</p>
<p>I installed some messy software soon after and did a PC refresh to start over.</p>
<p>The refresh completed and now I cannot log on. (see screenshot)</p>
<p>This happened over the course of a few hours. My Microsoft account password was not changed today.</p>
<p>I tried using the password of the previous account. No go.</p>
<p>I think the the network card driver isn't installed.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can log onto my machine again?</p>

    <title>Windows Security Pop Up for Calendar Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nuric  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Security Pop Up for Calendar Live</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suddenly started getting this pop up window that says the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Window Security</p>
<p>Sign in</p>
<p>Enter user name and password to download https://sharing.clanedar.live.com/calendar/private/xxxxxxx/calendar.ics</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get it when I press the "send/receive all folders" from my Outlook 2016 or just whenever.&nbsp; When I press that button the "internet calendar subscriptions" never completes the progress task, when I close the Window Security window then the progress window
 closes too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that items that I enter in my calendar in my new iPhone 6s are not automatically updated to my Hotmail calendar as in the past. My calendar in my outlook 2016 is also not updated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can fix this?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Nuria</p>
<p />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>So I had to figure this out on my own because the MS support was not good.&nbsp; So&nbsp; I guess this has to do with issues between exchange accounts and pop accounts. Since all I want is to see my "Hotmail" calendar in Outlook 2016 and not my contacts and email
 (you would have to setup your Hotmail as exchange acct). I opted for importing my Hotmail calendar .ics file to my outlook 2016 program.
</p>
<p>This is what you do:</p>
<p>Go to Hotmail\calendar\settings\options</p>
<p>Under options go to Shared calendars\calendar publishing</p>
<p>Click on the .ics file under "show availability, titles and location" this will save the .ics file in your "downloads" folder.</p>
<p>Now you can open the folder and just click on the .ics file and it will show up in your Outlook 2016 calendar or you can go to File\Import&amp;export\Open calendar and select the .ics file and click on open.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This does not synch the calendars!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason I'm doing this is because I need to adjust my calendar margins in order to print all the appointments.&nbsp; The print option in Hotmail doesn't let me change the margins, so it prints in multiple pages and I just want 1.

<h2>            I cannot open Word or Excel files this has only just happened yesterday 26 Oct</h2>

I also tried opening an Excel document and I cannot open that either.<br />
I have automatic updates set up - I am NOT a technical person, just a very good user.<br />
I have no idea what to do - word will not let me open the program to set up a new document.<br />
I have tried to restore my system to 3 months ago but it will not allow me to do that either.<br />

            You're probably confusing the percent settings in the Manage Rules boxes with the actual number settings you should use.&nbsp; If the values in your cells are percentages they will actually have values like 0.95 for 95%, 0.93 for 93% and 0.89 for 89%.&nbsp; If you
 set the Type box in the Edit Rule window to Number and enter the values 0.95 and&nbsp;0.9&nbsp;for the green and amber arrows then you should find the rule works.&nbsp; The percent values are used for formatting the top x percent, Excel will work this out depending on the
 values.

<h2>            Backing up windows 10 build 10041</h2>
                    <p>I have just tried to do a local backup onto an external drive. Windows found the drive once I had selected "add a back up location on this pc". However, after that nothing happened when I clicked the drive. Nothing appears when I click "change local backup
 settings". Is anyone else experiencing this?</p>

<h2>            Best Practice - Deployment of O365 on Shared Computer</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>We have an environment where every user is licensed with O365 Business Premium. I was under the belief that O365 ProPlus was required for shared computer rights, however after speaking with the Volume Licensing team they have advised that "You mentioned
 that your shared computer does not involve RDS. In that case, Office 365 ProPlus is not a requirement." However the support document they supplied
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn782860.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn782860.aspx </a>refers back to an RDS environment and O365 ProPlus.</p>

<p>The question is about how best to deploy O365 Business Premium on shared computers? If we do it via the portal "Install Office on you PC" the activation will count against the signed in users activation count. What is the best method in this scenario?</p>

<p>Hi Gamchi,</p>
<p>Office 365 Business Premium doesn’t include Office 365 ProPlus and it instead includes the Office suite that is named 365 Business. Office 365 ProPlus in the Office 365 Enterprise E3 plan instead of Office 365 Business premium can be used by multiple users
 on a shared device or virtual machine. The feature is not available for Office 365 Business plan.</p>
<p>Shared computer activation gets enabled during the installation of Office 365 ProPlus using the Office Deployment Tool. Once enabled, Office installs without being activated. When a user signs in to a computer with Office installed via shared computer activation,
 Office will check to see if the user has been provisioned for Office 365 ProPlus and temporarily activates Office 365 ProPlus. If a second user signs in to the same computer, the activation does not persist from the first user and process is repeated. Deploying
 Office 365 ProPlus using shared computer activation does not count against a user’s five total installations of Office 365 ProPlus or Office for Mac</p>
<p>The most common shared computer activation scenario is to deploy Office 365 ProPlus to shared computers by using Remote Desktop Services (RDS).The following are two common RDS scenarios:
<br />
1. Install Office 365 ProPlus on an RDS server.<br />
2. Install Office 365 ProPlus on a shared virtual machine.</p>
<p>For specific guidance on how to deploy Office 365 ProPlus by using Remote Desktop Services (RDS) and shared computer activation, see
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn782858(v=office.15).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Deploy Office 365 ProPlus by using Remote Desktop Services</a>. More information on how to enable shared computer activation for Office 365 ProPlus can be found in
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn782860.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the article</a> you mentioned above.</p>

            <p>This is a long shot. Do you know where your NoteBooks are saved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If saved on OneDrive there is no chance what so ever. Sorry</p>
<p>If saved in a Folder locally, possibly you have a Chance, especially if you had OneDrive Desktop application installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is your chance assuming you have OneDrive Desktop installed and you use Time Machine Backup:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From Finder window (what you see when you first turn computer on) mouse to GO menu.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Click on GO menu.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Click on Home menu.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Look for One Drive Folder.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Look for file with name OneNote or NoteBook and whatever name you gave the notebook when you created it.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now locate and click on Time Machine.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Time machine window should appear.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now from scale on right side pick date and time about an hour before you attempted move these pages<span>, the window animates and appears to go back in time.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li>Click Restore. It will ask whether you want to keep both or replace?<br />
(for now I would choose keep both)<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now screen returns to normal control Click or right click on the old file and choose OneNote.</li></ol>
<p>If Miracles happen, You will see your notebook complete with all the last files. &nbsp;If you see no difference Then You just have recreate &nbsp;everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From now on should you want to move files from one note book&nbsp;to another. Would do as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Notebook with material you want to move. Go to that tab.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now do&nbsp;⌘ - A (Select All), followed by&nbsp;⌘ - C (Copy).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now open new Notebook &nbsp;create a new subfile or sub tab and give appropriate name.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now Do&nbsp;⌘ - V (Paste).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Repeat steps 1 - 4 as necessary to add each item you want to move to new note book.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Al though this will be slow and tedious , it will guarantee the You information won't dis appear. You can always go back to original note book you copy from and remove those pages once make sure they have been added properly&nbsp;and do show up in new location.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather though leave them be, and just no longer refer to them, in the original notebook. &nbsp;If you didn't have OneDrive Desktop installed, and you don't use Time Machine. Then your only recourse is to, kick and scream while laying in floor (throw a
 Tantrum), then pick yourself up and just recreate everything (from memory).&nbsp;</p>

            One saving grace is Microsoft is now allowing you to remove most of the unused apps from to Start Menu on RS-2&nbsp;and it will stay that way from upgrade to upgrade. I really don't have much use for many of them either. My software library is extensive too&nbsp;and
 I still use many of the older titles I still have in my possession. The only problem is that&nbsp;in Windows 10 you need to enable legacy components such as NTVDM or&nbsp;an older version of&nbsp;.Net Framework from the Control Panel to get them working. Sometimes,&nbsp;one needs
 to go a little further and use a workaround for things&nbsp;such as <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/winhlp32-do-we-have-to-go-through-this-again/ddcc2f40-e4f3-407b-9672-ee8a2b08a71e">
WinHlp32.exe</a>. Through&nbsp;a combination of using the above components, I've been able to make programs work in Windows 10 that have roots&nbsp;going all the way back to Windows 3.x. Anybody remember Chip's Challenge from&nbsp;Windows Entertainment Pack?&nbsp;It can&nbsp;actually
 be made to work in Windows 10! I admit, it does look a little out of place&nbsp;on&nbsp;the modern desktop, but the main&nbsp;point is that it still can be made to work in the&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;environment.

            <p>Microsoft aims to design a generally useful system that can be marketed. If some clever software was copied they'd likely get sued. The beauty of these modern 'apps' is that they can be used (and some of them synced) across many devices. Understandable and
 not unreasonable.</p>
<p>That said, I don't actually use any of them much. I'm happy with a stable platform that I can run programs on.</p>
<p>I kind of miss the entertainment of some of the earlier ranters forecasting the end. I pictured The Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons: "Worst Windows ever."</p>

</p><blockquote>&nbsp;Anybody remember Chip's Challenge from&nbsp;Windows Entertainment Pack?&nbsp;It can&nbsp;actually be made to work in Windows 10! I admit, it does look a little out of place&nbsp;on&nbsp;the modern desktop, but the main&nbsp;point is that it still can be
 made to work in the&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;environment. </blockquote>
<p>Gave me a laugh there Rick. Just dug out an old notebook of mine with the first 10 level codes of Chip's Challenge written in the back. It's still available on Steam I believe. Can you remember Planetarion? I found my old username and logon for that! Gordon
 Bennett, I'll be playing Jet Set Willie &amp; Manic Miner on a new Spectrum next..!</p>

            <p>I do not see the point of this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The quests are for what is new and part of Windows (albeit a couple like the DVD player are things developed for Windows 10 but are acquired separately). The fact is&nbsp;most of us spend most of our time in the apps/programs we add to be used in Windows, not
 those that came with Windows. We never have and never will spend it in just the bundled apps. Other than the browsers, the bundled apps are and always have been more likely to be utilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The corollary of your argument is that the quests should focus&nbsp;on the complex software we have bought separately from Windows (even if from Microsoft).&nbsp;Why would the quests for Windows Insiders be aimed at software that does not come with Windows? Why for
 example would the quests include, say configuring new features in Adobe CC products or new functionality&nbsp;in Visual Studio?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the quests are there because we test what we use - the complex programs we most likely used with older Windows. We jump up and down when these don't work&nbsp;but we ignore the bundled apps - so few are giving feedback on these.</p>

            <p>As far as I can see Ian you and JC are on the same side of the discussion. There are differences between the older PC users and the younger ones. This Community is one such example. By far the majority here are older. Posts are not confined to new builds
 per se; plenty of functional problems like anti-virus and hardware are discussed.</p>
<p>Like JC I do not own an Xbox so I cannot follow those quests. But Looking through the Feedback Hub I can see that a lot of younger folks do. Do I use the free apps in the Store? Well I have VLC &amp; Adblock plus and some other "older" free programs which may
 be apps.</p>
<p>I own a Windows mobile, but do not run Insider versions. Many younger Community members do. Conversely they use/test many Store free apps.</p>
<p>So I am with JC when he hints at too many Xbox quests. But that is part of our differences. Older members use our PC's, younger members use their PC's for/to run apps, programs, games&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Each to his/her own I guess.</p>

            <p>Hello IanRG</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point of this post is 'Discussion' which is why I posted it as such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At my last count, there were 74 views and 9 replies.&nbsp; IMHO this makes it a successful discussion - it even prompted you to make a comment!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to satisfy my own curiosity and discover what others think and feel.&nbsp; I wasn't asking Microsoft to see how I feel about 3rd party software - that would be pretty pointless - MS is fully aware that many&nbsp;companies successfully write software for this
 system (if they didn't, then MS would not be as useful as it is).</p>
