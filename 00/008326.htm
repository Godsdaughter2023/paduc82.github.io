<h2>            Outlook Junk E-Mail Folder</h2>
                    When I try to empty the Outlook Junk E-mail folder I get an error message: "The operation failed.&nbsp; The messaging interfaces have returned an unknown error.&nbsp; If the problem persists, restart Outlook."&nbsp; Of course restarting Outlook does nothing.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<h2>            Outlook not permitting Group cc emails</h2>
                    <p>I have Office Home &amp; Business to which has been added the latest Outlook App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For UK Data Privacy regulations I need to be able to group messages (up to 60 addresses) as bcc messages with attachments. . In practice I have spilt them to 2 groups of 30 and send these separately. In the to " To box" I use a valid e-mail address so that
 I can confirm that they have been sent out</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook continually for both groups gives the following message:</p>
<p>'my e-mail address' - Sending Reported error (0x800CCC78):&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannot send the message. Verify the e-mail address in your account properties</p>
<p>The server responded; 504 invalid mail command extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs for each of 5 of different e-mail addresses used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with any of the originating e-mail addresses as&nbsp; <span>
I am a still able to send e-mails from any or all e-mail accounts "apparently causing problems" even whilst the Bcc group message is still held blocked in the Outbox. No problem with ISP Server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is a great problem as UK Regs recommend using the Bcc route for outgoing messages for Security purposes.</span></p>

<p>If I have my own email as sender and my own e-mail as receiver plus group bcc,'s ( I get all addresses generated bcc as expected&nbsp; by outlook in the Outbox ) but I get the same rejection message.</p>
<p>This both applies whether I have attachments or just a simple message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A) For extra input,&nbsp; I have the deleted the "rejected message" to prevent noise, closed down Outlook and started again from fresh - same problem&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) I have also repeated the above&nbsp; deleting all unsent messages in outbox, closed down Outlook and rebooted the pc so that there is a clean start .and tried again. same problem occurs.</p>
<p>C) I have also previously tried different e-mails in From and different e-mails in To plus the bcc with no attachments . Same problem</p>
<p>D) Finally I have tried e-mails using a different ISP same problem, also one ISP to another different ISP - same problem</p>
<p>E) My main ISP&nbsp; has also been checked and they stated that there is no problem at their end in handling multiple Bcc with or without attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sending these bcc separately is very time consuming.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. While on any cell of the DCF Final sheet, go to Developer &gt; Insert &gt; Combo box (Form Control).&nbsp; Click on Combo box (Form Control) and draw the combo box in a blank area of the worksheet</p>
<p>2. Right click on the Combo box and click on Format Control</p>
<p>3. In the Input range, select W5:W7 and in the cell link box, select cell W1</p>
<p>4. Click on any cell and when you click on the Combo box drop down, you will see the three options</p>
<p>5. Click on cell H7 and enter this formula</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=CHOOSE($W$1,Base!H7,Aggressive!H7,Conservative!H7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Select H7:I7, copy it and paste in range J7:S7</p>
<p>7. Select H7:S7 and paste in H10:S10, H13:S13, H19:S19, H20:S20, H21:S21</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when you change the option in the Combo box drop down, all calculations in range H7:T23 will change.</p>

<h2>            How can I fix the &#40;numerous&#41; problems with WhatsApp on Windows Phone&#63;</h2>
                    <ol>
<li>I don't receive notifications (no number of messages in tile) anymore, even though I used to. Using the backwards button instead of the home screen button doesn't help.
</li><li>I don't get a push notification on my home screen (like with texts), so I have to unlock the screen and log in to WhatsApp before I can even see any messages I got.</li><li>Recently I had to delete another app because every message I received I clicked on just to have it redirected to another app and then crash.
<br />
</li><li>Sometimes, when I do get notifications (a number in the tile or the push message that pops up instantly when I get a message), I will open WhatsApp a few seconds later and not see the message at all - I have to restart WhatsApp four times before it shows
 up.</li><li>WhatsApp loads SLOW</li></ol>
<br />
So for all of this, are there solutions? I use WhatsApp a lot but I start missing out on conversations and important messages and I really don't like that.<br />

            <p>I don't use WhatsApp (I don't even know what it does), but it seems that when ever people have problems with apps, the general comments have been to uninstall the app then install it again to see if that solves any issues. You could also try and contact
 the WhatsApp developer to ask for their help (<a href="http://www.whatsapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.whatsapp.com</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that, maybe someone else will respond with some suggestions.</p>

            Thank you! I have contacted WhatsApp because Microsoft suggested I should. In their response, they told me to contact Microsoft as this was out of their hands (apparently). I contacted Microsoft again and they've sent me here. :) Just in response to your
 suggestion to contact WhatsApp, or if anyone reading your comment wants to contact them as well.
<div><br />
<div>I will try to uninstall the app though. I've tried it once, but that was a few updates ago. I'll be sure to drop a note if it works.</div>

            Thanks for answering. I think it's partly Microsoft's and partly WhatsApp's problem so that's why they keep sending me back and forth. I reported back to Nokia/Windows Phone today, I told Microsoft and WhatsApp about the issues I'm having, but nothing
 seems to happen. I'm really hoping to see some improvement in the near future as I'm thinking about buying another phone if it doesn't.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I did, however, followed Woodg's advise and I also read somewhere that it might help to use the back button instead of the home button. I also restarted the phone. These solutions combined seem to work for the first problem I was having.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let's just hope that the other issues will be attented to by both Microsoft and WhatsApp.</div>

            This link on whatsapp.com explains the issue in whole, the problem is with Microsoft due to its method of implementation.

I often get this problem, i uninstall and install the app again. it works but this leads to my older chat history getting erased.<br />

            I am really up to give up on WP due to this and other problems of software. For 2 years I believed that Microsoft would react with really good solutions, but I shame to my friends who use Waze, WhatsApp and many other softwares that do not properly work
 on WP or are even not available. I am giving up of WP and Nokia!

            Waze is available on Windows Phone 8.<br />
<br />
Whatsapp is just a really bad app. They're trying to push the blame onto Microsoft where in reality they just continued to mess up the Windows Phone app until their most recent WP8 version, where I think Nokia finally stepped in and helped them.<br />

<h2>            Camera is green</h2>
                    I've only had my Lumia 820 for a little over a week and it has been working fine. This morning the camera worked perfect but now when I turn on the camera it just shows a green screen and the pictures are green. The phone hasn't been dropped or even been
 sat down hard. I haven't changed any of the settings since I used it either. What could be wrong with it?

<p>Hi GeorgiaPeach,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try these steps and see if it will make any difference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Power cycle </li></ul>
<p>1. Turn off the phone then remove the back cover and the battery.</p>
<p>2. Reinsert the battery and the back cover then turn on your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset your camera settings </li></ul>
<p>1. Go to Settings.</p>
<p>2. Swipe to Application settings.</p>
<p>3. Choose Photos+camera.</p>
<p>4. Select Reset camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, you can try to perform the steps provided on this link&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2749480." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2749480.</a> If the steps on the link will not work, I suggest that you
 visit the nearest Nokia repair facility for it to be repaired. See this link:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/</a> to check the &nbsp;repair facility near your area.&nbsp;</p>

            I got mine last last week and it did this the next day. I did the power cycle and it went away. However, every single picture I take has a green line on the boarder on one side. This has to be know to Nokia and a fix needs to be issued soon. Otherwise
 sales representatives aren't going to push their products. I know I'm the one doing the demo for my company to determine whichever win8 mobile handset we go with. So I will have to point this out in my review if not corrected. So Nokia lets fix this asap please.
 This is the one I want to recommend, not the competition.

<p><span>We’ve seen quite a few complaints about that lately. The Command Line Interface (MpCmdRun.exe) was actually designed to mitigate just this type of issue by allowing users to schedule
 their signature updates in Task Scheduler: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/mseupdate/thread/35ce13dc-ed58-468f-a686-8f859d4c40c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Greetings&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have office 365 account which is associated with share point site i'm trying to use one drive to sync the documents with the site yet the only thing being synced is the folders while files are not downloaded and it shows an error that i have to enter my
 credentials i have tried the following troubleshooting methods but none of them was the solution for this problem&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - used the repair button in onedrive for business</p>
<p>2- removed my credentials from credential manager in windows and re-entered them &nbsp;in One drive</p>
<p>3- cleaned office cache&nbsp;</p>
<p>4- switched accounts in office account tab and removed and added the services</p>
<p>still the one drive &nbsp;is showing a warning sign in the notification panel and same error is always presented "credentials needed" &nbsp;and when i do sign in i make sure that user/password is remembered and i'm using Microsoft Internet explorer</p>

                    My email (Outlook 2007) stopped working last Thursday (8/9) i.e. my Inbox shows the message "There are no items to show in this view", despite the panel on the left showing 263 messages.&nbsp; I have tried Restoring to 6/9 but it hasn't helped.&nbsp; Now I can only

Thank you for your reply but I have been unable to implement your suggestions. I don't know which account is configured or how to find out.&nbsp; Tried to follow your directions but when I searched for programme Accessories the only thing including that word was
 HP Accessory Shop.&nbsp; Sorry to have taken so long to respond but I have been searching all the other queries regarding Outlook 2007 to see if I could find anything helpful - without success.&nbsp; Guess I'm just not technically minded enough!<br />

    <title>Windows 7 not displaying some web pages for IE9, Firefox and Google - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> conlan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 not displaying some web pages for IE9, Firefox and Google Chrome.</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please could you help?&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running 32 bit Win 7 Starter with SP 1 on a Sony Vaio Netbook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All three web browsers [IE9, Google Chrome, Firefox] I am using on this setup only display some web pages, with the ones not being able to display just never loading up and displaying.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example these pages work perfectly, along with many others:</div>
<div>www.google.com</div>
<div>www.google.co.uk</div>
<div>www.amazon.com</div>
<div>www.amazon.co.uk</div>
<div>www.intel.com</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then some other web pages will just not load such as the following [these are just some, there are others too]:</div>
<div>www.microsoft.com</div>
<div>www.cisco.com</div>
<div>www.intel.co.uk</div>
<div>All 3 web browsers just show a blank tab/page when I try open them, with the spinning circle in the tabs. No errors are shown on any of the browsers, the pages just never load.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I open a DOS box and ping these sites, the DNS resolves the URL to IP addresses, and I can ping them. For example, here is the output for the www.cisco.com site:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>C:\Documents and Settings\sony&gt;ping www.cisco.com</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Pinging e144.cd.akamaiedge.net [88.221.32.170] with 32 bytes of data:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Reply from 88.221.32.170: bytes=32 time=36ms TTL=49</div>
<div>Reply from 88.221.32.170: bytes=32 time=36ms TTL=49</div>
<div>Reply from 88.221.32.170: bytes=32 time=37ms TTL=49</div>
<div>Reply from 88.221.32.170: bytes=32 time=38ms TTL=49</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ping statistics for 88.221.32.170:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),</div>
<div>Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Minimum = 36ms, Maximum = 38ms, Average = 36ms</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div>I have tried the following to address this from some of the solutions suggested by various sources on the internet, but none have worked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Try compatibility mode</div>
<div>Reset cookies and clear the cache on all the browsers</div>
<div>Reset IE 9 settings to factory defaults</div>
<div>Restore advanced settings</div>
<div>Load IE9 with no addons</div>
<div>Windows Network Diagnostics [Troubleshooting reports it couldn't identify the problem]</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All my networking and applications work perfectly, it is just certain web pages that never seem to display on any web browser. I am thinking that as this is happening across all web browser applications, there is an underlying Win 7 problem that is causing
 this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have other PC's running Win XP on the same network as the Windows 7 netbook, and none of the Win XP systems have the same issues as the Win 7 netbook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My browser versions on the Win 7 netbook with the issues are:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>IE9 - 9.0.8112.16421</div>
<div>Firefox - 11.0</div>
<div>Google Chrome - 18.0.1025.151</div>

<div>Any help will be most welcome, as I REALLY need to get this fixed. I have been trying for 2 days now, and I feel that I am in need of an extra helping hand now. I have reached the limits of my abilities and understanding of Win 7 and this issue now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you need any additional info, I am very happy to supply it and post it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you made any recent software changes on your computer?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to go through the second<span>&nbsp;
</span>and third steps mentioned in the link and check.</p>
<p><b>Why are some webpages blank or incorrectly displayed in Internet Explorer?</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/webpages-look-incorrect-in-Internet-Explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/webpages-look-incorrect-in-Internet-Explorer</a></p>
<p>You may also type the IP address of the website in the address bar instead of the URL and check if you are able to open the page.</p>
<p>You can also try flushing the DNS.</p>
<p>To flush DNS cache using the
<b>ipconfig</b> command</p>
<p>a. Open Command Prompt.</p>
<p>b. Type:
</p>
<p><b>ipconfig /flushdns</b></p>
<p>You can contact any issues with Firefox and chorme at:</p>

            Hi Rohit.
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for responding. As requested, here is my feedback.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Most recent program installations according to Control Panel are [in date order]:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mozilla Firefox 11 update from 10.8 [2012/04/08]</div>
<div>VAIO update [This is SONY netbook drivers etc] [2012/03/06]</div>
<div>Bing Bar [2012/03/04]</div>
<div>Adobe Flash Player 11plugin [2012/03/02]</div>
<div>Java 6 update 31 [2012/03/23]</div>
<div>Notepad ++ [2011/11/29]</div>
<div>Blue Griffon version 1.3.1 [2011/11/26]</div>
<div>Google Chrome [2011/11/21]</div>
<div>Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile [2011/11/20]</div>
<div>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 redistributable [2011/11/18]</div>
<div>I can provide further back if needed/requested.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am happy to install/re-install any software if you feel it is needed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have read the link you provided, but unfortunately, step two and three have not solved my issue. I still do not get the web pages to display, and the spinning circle in the browser tab.</div>
<div>I tried with Tracking Protection both disabled, and enabled, as well as Active X Filtering enabled and disabled, and the the two combinations of the above.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The ipconfig /flushdns did not work either. It says it successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache, but no luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards.</div>
<div><br />

<div>
<div>If I open a DOS box and ping these sites, the DNS resolves the URL to IP addresses, and I can ping them. For example, here is the output for the www.cisco.com site:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>C:\Documents and Settings\sony&gt;ping www.cisco.com</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
A problem is that the host name you are trying to use is an alias of the one which you are being shown by the ping response.&nbsp;&nbsp; A consequence of this is that the IP address only comes from that second name.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact though nslookup shows that there are other
 aliases for this lookup:</p>
<p>&lt;nslookup&gt;</p>
<p>Non-authoritative answer:<br />
Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e144.cd.akamaiedge.net<br />
Address:&nbsp; 72.247.64.170<br />
Aliases:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cisco.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cisco.com</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cisco.com.akadns.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cisco.com.akadns.net</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geoprod.cisco.com.akadns.net<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cisco.com.edgekey.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cisco.com.edgekey.net</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cisco.com.edgekey.net.globalredir.akadns.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cisco.com.edgekey.net.globalredir.akadns.net</a><br />
<br />
&lt;/nslookup&gt;</p>
<p><br />
If you do an&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /displaydns&nbsp; either after your ping or after your troubleshooter reports it couldn't identify the problem&nbsp;you will probably see your target host name represented by a CNAME record chaining it to one of those other aliases or (if you're
 lucky) directly to the canonical host name and hence to its address records.&nbsp;&nbsp; But since there was no lookup done from the dnscache point of view there are no records in there which can help IE find an address to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that&nbsp;IE gives up looking for
 addresses really quickly, so if you put a lookup in there for that name and its addresses it might help IE find one.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp; do</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ping&nbsp; -n 1&nbsp; -w 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e144.cd.akamaiedge.net </p>
<p>before trying the IE request with the alias and see if your symptom changes.</p>
<p>FWIW I think the idea of the Network Diagnostics tool is a good one.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. in a normal non-alias case it would have prepped the dnscache ready for IE to find&nbsp;a complete lookup&nbsp;with even the shortest of TTL.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the case of an alias most of this benefit
 is lost because a lookup for the canonical host is never done.&nbsp;&nbsp; So try doing one of your own instead before letting IE retry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<div>
<div>Hi Robert.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks for your response. I believe you are onto something with regards to DNS. I have been able to get a few more pieces for the puzzle. I am not very familiar with DNS, but here is a brilliant opportunity for me to learn something :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>As suggested I did check the DNS as you described, and below are my results and feedback, with some interesting observations at the end of this mail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The issue is not solved, but it appears that substantial progress may have been made with your suggestions.</div>

            Part 2:&nbsp;
<div><br />
&nbsp;
<div>From the above exercise, note how e144.cd.akamai.net has 2 IP addresses:&nbsp;</div>
<div>88.221.32.170 [when PING is used, step 1 and step 5]&nbsp;</div>
<div>88.221.36.170 [When nslookup is used, step 2]&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This does not look or feel right to me. Am I correct in this?</div>
<div>I checked the hosts file in C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc to see if any host entries had been made, but the file was clean.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Noting the cisco.com nslookup IP address in step 2, I decided to enter it [198.133.219.25] into the IE9 address bar as a straight IP address. The Cisco page partially loaded but never completed. The swirl kept spinning. There were many parts of it that
 were not displayed or loaded [pictures and functionality], although it kept trying, but unsuccessfully.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The ipconfig /displaydns output after placing the cisco.com IP address into IE9 looks as follows:&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>C:\Windows\System32&gt; ipconfig /displaydns </div>

<div>I had not considered DNS before as many web pages did work, and PING always resolved the URL to an IP. If it is DNS, that would make sense to me, as all my browsers display the same behavior.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The question now, is am I correct in thinking this, and if so, how would I go resolving this issue?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have any more suggestions, information or &nbsp;"homework" for me, I am happy to oblige.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks.</div>

The key thing here is how much time did it take for you to go from the end of 5 to the execution of 6?&nbsp;&nbsp; The Time To Live values that you are getting probably don't give you enough time to type that command from scratch, so try having it ready to reuse.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g.
 you could use CursorUp or F7 to go back to it or perhaps have it in your ClipBoard for a quick Esc, right-click Paste, Enter procedure.</p>
<p>If necessary, you can create a cmd file script of the two commands.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, if necessary you could add as the last command:&nbsp; iexplore.exe&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.cisco.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cisco.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (given appropriate pathing).&nbsp;&nbsp; However, since the two processes are in separate windows, presumably you could get the Go button clicked in an IE window pretty quickly after the ping would have finished, e.g.
 the displaydns and the iexplore request could be done concurrently to maximize use of the TTL that you have.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually I just realized that there is also the possibility of having two command windows open with a command ready for an Enter in each. It would
 be nice if we had control over the TTL in the dnscache and were not limited to whatever the servers were suggesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't really researched that question but I haven't seen anything like that as available...&nbsp;&nbsp; ping has a -i TTL setting but I don't think
 that applies to&nbsp;its lookup...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course an alternative to all this is to put the one lookup into your HOSTS file and then not be at the mercy of the dnscache or small TTL for things you need quicker lookups for. &nbsp; Actually I suppose you should probably do that anyway just to test if
 we are on the right track or whether there is something else wrong besides this lookup.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>

It's probably right.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could use those addresses to find out.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could use NetMon or WireShark to do a packet trace to see the real lookups being done in each case.</p>

<div>
<div>Noting the cisco.com nslookup IP address in step 2, I decided to enter it [198.133.219.25] into the IE9 address bar as a straight IP address. The Cisco page partially loaded but never completed. The swirl kept spinning. There were many parts of it that

<p><br />
To understand both of these things you could use&nbsp; IE9's Developer Tools, Network Capture tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is only useful after the lookup for the HTML works.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, why are you starting with cisco.com?&nbsp;&nbsp; That is only likely to result in a redirect to&nbsp;

<div>
<div>
<div>I had not considered DNS before as many web pages did work, and PING always resolved the URL to an IP. If it is DNS, that would make sense to me, as all my browsers display the same behavior.</div>

<div>The question now, is am I correct in thinking this, and if so, how would I go resolving this issue?</div>

<p><br />
Most users of other browsers will claim that they do not see nearly the same kind of addressability problems that IE does.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have long suspected that buried in both the OS and IE there are remnants of a very bad idea which was called AutoScan which could
 be causing this.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to support that feature I suspect they would have had to hurry lookups so they could try some from the whole set in a reasonable amount of time.&nbsp; Ever since I was on dial-up I have been trying to find out if the Windows OS has any
 kind of tuning for this but I have never found it.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how does it work?&nbsp; Some hard-coded timeout that you would really like to change?&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</p>

The idea of having two Command Prompt windows is simply to let you have the&nbsp; ipconfig /displaydns&nbsp;&nbsp; command ready to be entererd ASAP without having to retype it and without having to find it again in a redo list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the&nbsp;switch name is&nbsp; /displaydns&nbsp;
 with no spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I assume that this was just a typo in your report.</p>
<p>So, if this is the window that you wanted to have ready to press Enter with for that command you wouldn't even had to have pressed Enter yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise of course the dnscache would be clear because you just emptied it (with the ipconfig /flushdns) and
 (presumably) don't have any other processes making lookup requests.</p>

Looks like I may have confused you by musing about the&nbsp; ping&nbsp; -i&nbsp; TTL&nbsp; specification?&nbsp;&nbsp; You had the right command before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use&nbsp; ping -?&nbsp;&nbsp; to see the help.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only reason we are using&nbsp; ping&nbsp; and hence the&nbsp; -n 1&nbsp; and&nbsp; -w 1&nbsp;&nbsp; specifications is because that
 is a convenient way of getting a DNS lookup done and loaded into the dnscache.&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't care about the&nbsp; ping's&nbsp; ICMP&nbsp; request because it has nothing to do with the ultimate protocol we want to use:&nbsp; HTTP.&nbsp;&nbsp; A better simulation of doing that&nbsp;would be to use&nbsp;
 telnet&nbsp; 80.&nbsp; That would also load some lookup into the dnscache&nbsp; but then we would lose&nbsp; ping's&nbsp; display of the reverse lookup which shows us what happened to the lookup that we requested.<br />
</p>
<p>As soon as you get the ping's reverse lookup line that is when you should be pressing Enter on the&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /displaydns&nbsp; command that you have ready to go in the other Command Prompt window.</p>

<p><br />
That's fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; That proves that&nbsp; IE&nbsp; did a lookup for that host name and made an&nbsp; HTTP&nbsp; GET&nbsp; request for its root page.&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing to do then, again, ASAP that you see any sign that IE has achieved a lookup and is making that request, go back to your Command
 Prompt and get that&nbsp; DISPLAYDNS&nbsp; done.&nbsp;&nbsp; The point is that the&nbsp; Time To Live&nbsp; of these entries is just a few seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; That should be loads of time for the things that&nbsp; IE&nbsp; would need to do but very little for us to try to use the dnscache as a diagnostic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 All that we are trying to do is find out if we can get a complete lookup cached so that (presumably) IE can use it without having to go to a real DNS and get it done that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;That way we can claim that whatever the cause of&nbsp; IE's&nbsp; problem with your desired
 host name is it should not be the DNS lookup for it.</p>
<p>A problem with having IE make the request for the canonical host name is that as soon as it gets a lookup done it holds on to it internally for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you would never see signs of another lookup being done for this host by that instance of the
 browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. you would have to close it, verify that all instances of&nbsp; iexplore.exe&nbsp; were gone (using Task Manger's Processes tab) and then start another IE.</p>
<p>However, this has just given me another idea for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;This one would involve having two IE windows with URL ready to be entered in their Address bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. one which would cause the canonical host name to be looked up and cached and another for the alias
 host name which would ASAP try to use it once the first one's lookup&nbsp;(and its addresses) had been cached.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the reason for using two windows would be simply for the speed of making the requests.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose another option would be creating two Favorites
 to be used instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you might be able to use only one window to do both requests, stopping the first if necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; My experience is that the Stop command is rather unreliable but that might only be because most often scripts are involved and in this
 case you would be making a single request which you would be assuming would fail anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you also tried putting an entry for&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cisco.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cisco.com</a>&nbsp; into your&nbsp; HOSTS&nbsp; file?&nbsp;&nbsp; That would avoid all this uncertainty about its lookup and the dnscache.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way of removing the dnscache from the picture would be
 to stop its service.&nbsp;&nbsp; That would remove it as a source of diagnostics.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how it would affect the quality of the lookups you would be able to do without it but perhaps the lookup routine would have to change its timeout parameters accordingly
 and thus give you a possible workaround.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't black box troubleshooting fun?&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why Open Source is so successful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then (potentially) we could know what is really going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            battery life HTIC Touch Pro</h2>
                    I tried syncing my HTC touch pro phone and it worked great for my contacts, and calendar but it was trying to sync my large song folder, and then the HTC Touch Pro phone quit because the battery was low. But the problem is, this phone was plugged into
 an outlet, so the battery should have been charging up and not dissipating...there is a problem with the HTC Touch Pro phone in that it does not charge up the battery(at least this is what some websites have been saying) while it is plugged in and using the
 internet via the phone line...there is no way then i will be able to use this great service of myphone, because, i am not able to sync up everything&nbsp; before my battery is dead...i had a full battery when i started syncing and then i plugged into the AC outlet
 just in case, and this was taking about 48minutes to upload and then the battery was going bad and the phone just shut off...any help in what is going on with the HTC phone

            Hi Jmurphy99,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using Microsoft My Phone!&nbsp; It sounds like you have a couple of things going on here.<br />
<br />
1. You have your phone tethered to your computer and are using your computer's data connection to synchronize the data from your device to the My Phone service.&nbsp; You're saying while this is happening, your device loses so much battery power that it turns off
 and fails to finish synchronizing, even from a full battery charge.<br />
<br />
2. You plugged your device into the AC outlet, started the synchronization process for My Phone, but your phone still went dead (shutoff).<br />
<br />
I experience the first item with a different type of phone quite often.&nbsp; In fact, I tend not to leave my phone tethered to my computer for very long.&nbsp; I synchronize the data between the computer and the phone that I need to transfer then untether at the first
 possible chance.&nbsp; If I don't, my phone's battery also tends to get drained to the point where it just turns off.<br />
<br />
Having your device connected to an AC outlet should be OK provided there is some charge left in the battery.&nbsp; Are you positive the AC adapter was plugged into the wall when you tried this?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You might also want to attempt using a wifi connection for transferring the data as this will go much quicker than using the cellular data network.&nbsp; Wifi connections do drain the battery, so keep that in mind.&nbsp; You might want to start the synchronization when
 you have a full battery charge for the first sync attempt (since you need to transfer a lot of data).&nbsp; Subsequent syncs should go much quicker as only the incremental changes between your phone and what is shown on the My Phone portal need to be transferred.

                    <p>Ok, when i log onto my online Office 365 portal and go into outlook, I get nothing in the reading pane or when I open a message except for the subject.&nbsp; No to or from or body.&nbsp; I have logged on from 2 different computers and still same issue so I assume

<p>Hi JL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I confirm does the issue occurs suddenly? To identify if it's a server side issue, you let the admin go to the
<strong><a href="https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx#@/ServiceStatus/ServiceStatusHistory.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Service Health Dashboard</a></strong> and check if there is any incident information which matches the scenario. If not,
 please help us confirm the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. May I know which browser do you use to login&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA</a></strong>? What if you use IE with the latest version and check it again?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<span>Enter OWA light version. To do it, please l</span><span>ogin to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA</a><span>&nbsp;(Outlook Web App) &gt; Settings &gt; Options &gt; General
 &gt; Light version.</span></p>
<p>3. Does the issue only exist in reading pane? What if you double-click the message to open and view it?</p>
<p>4. Are you the only one who have the issue in your organization?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lance</p>

<p>Lance,&nbsp; It seems to be fine this morning.&nbsp; It did happen suddenly yesterday afternoon and none of my colleagues were affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried it on my PC as well as my kids using Internet Explorer and Firefox with same problem on all.&nbsp; Then tried it on my wife's Mac and same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue was both on reading pane and if i clicked the message.&nbsp; All i could ever see was subject and nothing else.</p>

    <title>Excel 2010 - Double writing in a single cell - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel 2010 - Double writing in a single cell</h2>
                    Excel 2010 - I have several cells showing results of a formula.&nbsp; If I change one of the cells that the formula references - thereby changing the result that should be shown, the original cell ends up looking as if it is trying to display the original result
 and the new result - one on top of the other.&nbsp; This renders the cell unreadable.&nbsp; If I scroll past the point where this cell is no longer visable on my screen - and then back to it, the new result is clearly shown.&nbsp; But this is a huge pain to have to do everytime
 I change some data.&nbsp; I thought it was a problem with my hardware, but I have opened the same spreadsheet on a different computer and get the same over-writing (even though the 2nd computer can display other spreadsheets without this issue).&nbsp; Any help would
 be greatly appreciated.

    <title>Using named array constants in a formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annvoss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using named array constants in a formula</h2>
                    <p>I have several sets of numbers that I have entered into single cells as an array (e.g. Cell A1 contains {1,2,3,4,5} - with the braces). I've named that cell MyList.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then want to use that array, referencing it by name, in further formulas, such as: =SUM(COUNTIF('OtherPage'!B:B,MyList)), where in column B I'm looking to count the total number of occurrences of any of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I write out this formula with {1,2,3,4,5} instead of MyList, I get the correct answer. When I use the name, I get 0.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I step through the evaluate formula option, the first step is replacing the name with the list, HOWEVER, it does so with double quotes around the array, making the COUNTIF look for that entire string rather than the individual strings within the array.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So --- is it possible to do what I'm seeking? Does my syntax just need a tweak?&nbsp; I'd prefer to keep these number arrays in a name, as they're used in over a dozen formulas, and the contents of those arrays may change over time - if I just had to change the
 one named cell, there's far less room to introduce errors into this workbook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ann</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete that named range you have in A1 and ensure A1 contains this {1,2,3,4,5}</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the formulas tab click 'Define Name' and&nbsp;enter the name&nbsp;MyList</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put this formula into the 'Refers to' box</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Evaluate($A$1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>this will now work when entered as an ARRAY formula, see below for how</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(COUNTIF(OtherPage!B:B,MyList))</p>
<p>
</p><p>or for a non-array formula that does the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT(--(ISNUMBER(MATCH(B1:B1000,MyList,0))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT...You have used full columns in your formula and I left them there but really you should avoid this as it slows things down a lot. Use a large range instead.</p>

            <p>Hi MichelleJH,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a pleasure to assist you with your issue. To be able to identify the rootcause why you were prompted to change your password, we need to know the exact error that appears on your screen when you tried to sign in to your account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason why&nbsp;you need to change your password is to ensure the security of your&nbsp; account. If your password were not changed on a regular basis, your familiarity with your password would eventually lead to it's compromise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Need admin access to Yammer Private Group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melodie jacquinod  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need admin access to Yammer Private Group</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm in charge of a private Yammer group but the person that was in charge beforehand left the company and forgot to give me admin access. She doesn't have access to her work email anymore and therefore can't do it now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any way I could gain admin access to the group to add new people to it and run it properly?</p>
<p>I don't want to create a new group with the same name. It will be confusing and we'll lose everything we have in the current group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help :)</p>
