    <title>Mailbox size limit - Does deleting .OST emails reduce size of Exchange - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mailbox size limit - Does deleting .OST emails reduce size of Exchange Data File&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; A co-worker is receiving a daily email saying she is approaching the 2GB Outlook size limit.&nbsp; We are using the Cached Exchange Mode.&nbsp; Initially, I checked the Local file size and it was 1,331,728.&nbsp; The Server file size, however, was 2,082,455.&nbsp; The
 thing is no matter how much is deleted from the Local .OST file, the Server data file size does not decrease, at least not by much.&nbsp; So 2 questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; When permanently deleting sizable emails from the local .OST file, should the exchange data file size decrease?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; If not, if we went to the Outlook Web App and permanently deleted sizable emails, would that reduce the exchange data file size?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Outlook 2013, Exchange Server 2013, and Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have since discovered that the Mail to Keep Offline setting under Use Cached Exchange Mode was set to 12 months.&nbsp; I changed that value to "All" and it started downloading files from the server to Outlook.&nbsp; Once finished, both the Local and Server file
 sizes are roughly the same at about 2.09 GB.&nbsp; So my question still remains...if we permanently delete sizable messages from the Outlook client .OST file, will the server file size also decrease?&nbsp; If not, if we permanently delete from the web app, will that
 reduce both the server and .OST file size?</p>

<h3> tkhiry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Hybrid Deployment Certificate</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>i have Exchange 2013 environment, we will deploy Office 365 hybrid with the new HCW, we deployed one server with multi roles for the hybrid deployment, we have an SSL certificate with the names
</p>
<p>mail.domain,.com and autodiscover.domain.com </p>
<p>we created a&nbsp;new&nbsp;&nbsp;SSL certificate to be used with the hybrid server with the names
</p>
<p>cloud.domain.com and autodiscover.domain.com </p>
<p>my question can i use the&nbsp;2 certificates at the same time, the old one for old servers and new one for hybrid, i will keep mail.domain on old servers and cloud and autodiscover on the hybrid server.</p>
<p>do i need to change anything or any configuration.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi tkhiry,<br />
<br />
You can use the two third-party certificates. Exchange Hybrid requires the certificate(s) to be configured for secure mail flow and client sign-in. You can install the certificates on the Hybrid server, prepare the DNS records, and run Hybrid Configuration
 Wizard to complete the deployment. Here are some references for you: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj659051%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            How to change the font color of the Today screen&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Need to change your font color on your Today screen?&nbsp; Here is a tip that Linley posted on his blog,
<a href="http://http://pocketpcmauritius.blogspot.com/2007/07/tips-how-to-change-color-font-of-today.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Pocket PC Mauritus</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of devices uses white as the default font color on the Today screen. It's not a problem as long as the background utilizes a "heavy" color. It does become problematic when using a picture as background because Windows Mobile will reduce the color to
 something that looks like gray. Thus, reading the Today becomes a strain for the eye.<br />
There is a registry key that can be modified to change the font color to something else than white. This must be done after having modified the background.<br />
In the registry go to HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Color\4. Change the value to "00 00 00 00" for black or "00 00 FF 00" for blue.

            Probably the easiest way for you to accomplish that Mark so it will be permanent is to use a Theme Creator. That way you can customize it the way you want.&nbsp; There are sevaral great ones out there.&nbsp; I like the tools provided at Netwasp.&nbsp; You can find it

            <p>Hi Janet,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry you got sidetracked by that person who has since been removed from these forums and we're trying our best to catch everywhere he posted his shall we say "questionable" advice.&nbsp; I just noticed this thread as you replied.&nbsp; Don't worry about those instructions
 - let's start over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is no, you should not delete that file as it seems to be a legitimate file for MSE.&nbsp; I have a similar one myself though it is MpScanCache-0.bin.&nbsp; Do you have this as well or only the one .bin file in that folder?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a rootkit is just a type of infection that's buried deeper into the system and harder (sometimes MUCH harder) to remove (and in some cases the only option is to format the drive and do a clean install if you ever want to trust the computer again - but
 let's not get ahead of ourselves and hit the panic button yet - experts can deal with many of them without such drastic action).&nbsp; I've never heard of a "legitimate" rootkit.&nbsp; That would be like a "legitimate" termite&nbsp;infection in your house.&nbsp; What you can
 get are "false positive" results from scanning software where it isn't a problem but the software can't tell the difference.&nbsp; Those can be hard to figure out (and I'm wondering if that's the case here - but we'll see).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, since Spybot did react to it, we should make sure we're not dealing with something that's very sneaky and may have actually infected MSE (or Spybot may be detecting the fact that MSE detected and removed the threat but it's still in cache and
 while no longer a threat was still picked up).&nbsp; In any case, the proper response is to get expert FREE help from Microsoft Support.&nbsp; It's simple and they almost certainly can help you resolve this.&nbsp; They're not only experts in MSE but also in malware-removal,
 so you're covered however it goes.&nbsp; I've even seen them use remote desktop so all you need to do is sit back and watch them work and push a button now and then that they can't do remotely - but there's no guarantee they'll do that here and may just provide
 guidance over the phone or whatever method you use for contact.</p>

<h2>            Formula Help, create formula that gives a total score out of 100&#37;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am attempting to create formula that gives a total score out of 100%, based on the information below.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are 4 quality measures each worth 25% out of a total possible score of 100%. If each measure goal (for example the goal for measure 1 is 43%) is met then 25% is added to the total score. Here's the part I'm having trouble with, if any of the measures
 have no sample then the 25% possible pool is distributed to the other measures because no goal could be reached. So if 1 measure had no sample then then other 3 measures would now be worth 33.3% out of the total available.
<br />
<br />
Below is the layout of the sheet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help,<br />
<br />
Lauren<br />

<h2>            Stop second line indent</h2>
                    
<p>How do you stop the second line indenting in Word 2007? I thought I had fixed it by setting the indentson a new document and saving as default but upon inserting a table I'm getting the second line indent in each cell. Whilst I'm asking, does anyone from
 Microsoft want to explain why you put this anti-feature in. It's not a standard way of typing a document and is yet another issue in Word 2007 that hits productivity.</p>

            From your steps, it appears to me that this issue has nothing to do with indent settings, as the problem occurs after you hit "enter". This certainly would suggest to me that the issue is more likely due to the "style for following paragraph" selection
 for whatever style your new document opens with (presumably normal). If the "Style for following paragraph" is a style that has a 0.5" indent, than that would certainly make the most sense to me, and be easily corrected by either changing the selection to
 a different style, or changing the indent setting for the "following" style, not the one you open the document with.

<p>Hi sosacub,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!!!</p>
<p>From the error code mentioned I assume that you are referring to Internet Explorer and not Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>For now I would suggest you to uninstall the "MTWB Toolbar" from the Programs and Features</p>
<p>There is a small possibility that you don’t find the name or toolbar in the Programs and features. Make sure you also check for any futile toolbars in the path below and uninstall the same.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer</strong>&gt;<strong>View</strong>&gt;<strong>Toolbars</strong>&gt;<strong>MTWB</strong> or
<strong>similar toolbar</strong></p>
<p>Let us know if the information helped or for any further assistance.</p>
<p>Regards<br />

<p>
</p><p>The email renewal message I was sent from MS recently does not explain any of this, but wants me to renew my subscription anyway for Hotmail or is it WLM use with Hotmail now Outlook???&nbsp; Why does anyone need to pay or keep paying&nbsp;the $19.95, if they continue
 to use WLM or Outlook.com or Outlook Mail (Preview) if different,&nbsp;as&nbsp;they will be forced into the new Outlook.com or Outlook Mail (Preview) anyway??&nbsp; What are the Benefits, if any (you need to put in your reply and not use a Link!)?&nbsp; I added them below for
 you! The rather high&nbsp;$19.95 charge&nbsp;gets you what extra&nbsp;that is worth the extra annual charge that others don't charge (including forced changes)??&nbsp; More Space on MS' Server or in the Cloud, Use of WLM after its modified, or Outlook Mail (Preview) if different,
 No Ads as WLM has no Adds already??&nbsp; Why keep charging Users&nbsp;this Fee when other Services are Free from Google, etc??? Give us a break MS!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS explain yourself clearly when you ask for money for Hotmail Plus or now Ad Free Outlook??!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reports are that Outlook Mail or Outlook Mail (Preview) (if they are different?)&nbsp;is much slower than WLM, probably because email is stored on your own Computer with WLM and not in a Cloud or Server?!&nbsp; How true is this and will the speed Issue be fixed, if
 true, or partly true??&nbsp; Do we or will we still have the Option to store our Email on our own Computers and on MS Servers, like we can with WLM, when you switch us over to Outlook Mail (Preview)?&nbsp; I prefer to have a copy on my own Computer for better speed
 or faster access and Searches!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why the Protocol switch or forced switch on Users, that is causing a lot of problems with your WLMl? What improvement does&nbsp;EAS protocol&nbsp;provide, if any, from DeltaSync??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will everyone be able to keep their current Hotmail email address, if desired?&nbsp; Why is this not prominently promoted if we can or have this vital Option??</p>
<p>
</p><p>When will MS release a new or corrected or properly tested Update Patch to WLM that works?&nbsp; Please put it under Windows Update where it belongs as an optional update, if needed!! It should apply to all Win OS versions used with WLM 2012!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone or any Insiders answer these Questions??</p>
<p>
</p><p>MitchMM</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; The only Plus or Premium Benefits as listed at the Link you provided are:&nbsp; For only $19.95 USD a year, you'll see no graphical ads in your inbox with Ad-free Outlook.com &amp;&nbsp;No account expiration or&nbsp;You don't need to log in to keep your account active
 as long as your Ad-free Outlook.com subscription is current.&nbsp; This is it for an Extra $19.95??&nbsp; MS must be Crazy!!!&nbsp; No Deal!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>You identified yourself as an Insider, which I take to mean a MS employee Insider of some type, but if not what do you mean by Insider??</p>
<p>
</p><p>My attitude is well deserved and earned or&nbsp;created by MS and&nbsp;frankly needed,&nbsp;due to the crazy and unscrupulous things MS is doing with its own email services and the defective Patches they have put out&nbsp;for the WLM App, that just cause more or worse problems
 with peoples heavily used email Apps and Services, not to mention their attempts to force Win 7 Users to Upgrade to Win 10!&nbsp; This or what you call my arrogant attitude&nbsp;is really&nbsp;not directed at you or anyone who posts&nbsp;here that are trying to help, but at Microsoft
 itself or its Executives&nbsp;( which is really the Arrogant party that needs to wise up and treat its valued Users with respect!)!&nbsp; I considered this question more of a discussion vs a question, so maybe it should be converted to a discussion to get more input?&nbsp;
 Sorry you took it a little personally, but I am fed up with all of MS' deceitful attempts to trick or force Users to upgrade to Win 10 and now&nbsp; a No Choice push into Outlook.com and Outlook Mail (Preview), etc!!&nbsp; What ever happened to User Choice using Persuasion,
 based on hopefully great new features or improvements vs no choices, trickery and deceit now being used or deployed&nbsp;by MS more aggressively every day?? &nbsp;If you don't agree, that means you work there or love to be forced or tricked&nbsp;into&nbsp;Upgrading to Win 10
 &amp; pushed into Outlook Mail?!&nbsp; I hope you do work there or somewhere at MS, as I would love to be able to discuss this with a real MS Insider/Employee who has some insider info or even clout within MS!&nbsp;LoL, like that is possible or will ever happen at MS!&nbsp;The
 Link comment was a little rough maybe, but I hate to see people or anyone&nbsp;seemingly trying to hide what little MS is supposedly giving Users for the $19.95 Upcharge, which is not&nbsp;much at all to be frank!&nbsp; I do use&nbsp;Links myself, but normally when I want to
 add or refer to&nbsp;a large article or graphics or avoid re-typing (pasting is easy however:)!&nbsp; I'll take that one back, as you didn't deserve it, LoL!&nbsp; It was more to expose or emphasize what little MS is giving&nbsp;Users for the $19.95, and not that it was wrong
 in any way to use Links!&nbsp; You are right that MS is not forcing anyone to pay the $19.95, but in the past you could not even use Hotmail with WLM if you didn't pay and could only store a limited amount of emails on their server without paying, which is a little
 coercion in my opinion! LoL&nbsp; It looks like they dropped some of the coercion now, so why pay?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply anyway as I don't take it personally, and any MS&nbsp;insider info that could help Users is appreciated!&nbsp; MS Hotmail and WLM&nbsp;is one of the most used and personal Apps and features on their OSs, so it is quiet disturbing that they are tinkering
 with something that was not broken and even worse that they are creating problems with their emails and Brands and putting out defective patches for WLM that were not properly tested and that didn't work for a lot of Users!!&nbsp; It all looks like part of their
 Plan to force Users into going to WIn 10, by degrading or not supporting Apps used on Win 7!&nbsp; Now, MS would never do that would they? LoL</p>

</p><p>I received a message also to pay for next year, but&nbsp;the message is&nbsp;referring to a Windows Live Hotmail Plus subscription? Does this mean WLM or just the Hotmail/Outlook.com Web Email Service??&nbsp; The included 10 GB of email storage refers to storage on Microsoft'
 Servers or the Cloud, not on your Computer which is limited to your Hard Drive size.&nbsp; It does not say how much Server or Cloud&nbsp;storage you will&nbsp;receive without a Hotmail Plus or Outlook Ad-Free Account??!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a copy of&nbsp;my 1 Jan 16 email message sent
 to me from Microsoft: (<strong>Bold and Underlining added by me!)</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Suggest you check or review what&nbsp;MS or Outlook &nbsp;may take away, if you do not pay for&nbsp;your Hotmail Plus or Ad Free Outlook&nbsp;accounts for next year, as their email above may not include everything&nbsp;as it is pretty vague or unclear!&nbsp; I did and Posted it below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Should you upgrade to Ad-free Outlook.com? (Hotmail Plus)?&nbsp;</strong> <strong>
Here are great Tips from LoginTips.com </strong>that offer much more detailed and valuable information than Microsoft does or ever did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like Yahoo offering Yahoo Mail Plus, Microsoft has a premium version of its free webmail service: it is called "", and used to be known as "". The new name doesn't quite do justice to the offering, as you'll learn in this tutorial - even less so because
 the new ad format is as unobtrusive as it gets <em>(ads in the old Hotmail interface were hard to miss!)</em> The pricing -for nearly a decade- has been $19.95 per year (US dollars). Billed annually, it averages out to about $1.66 per month,
<abbr>USD</abbr>. Since Microsoft has legal representation in most -if not all- states, you'll be charged sales taxes on top of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With increasing competition between Webmail providers (AOL Mail, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and the others), the original benefits have become somewhat obsolete.
<strong>Current advantages of Ad-Free Outlook (Hotmail Plus):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Since Microsoft's integration of <em>OneDrive</em> (formerly "<em>SkyDrive</em>"),
<strong>file attachment sizes</strong> are no longer an issue: above a certain size, files are automatically uploaded to the cloud, not embedded into the message as attachment. (Besides, storing your documents in OneDrive lets you edit them from anywhere, which
 can't be done email attachments.)</li><li><strong>Inbox storage limits</strong> have also become sort of a non-issue, since Hotmail adopted the same approach as Google (Gmail) and Yahoo Mail with what they call "" (within limits, you get as much space as you need.)&nbsp;
</li><li><strong>Hide the ads from your inbox</strong>: while this may sway some users, the new ad format is discrete and well integrated. This leads us to the main advantage, in our opinion, in the next section.</li></ul>
<p>In our opinion, the true advantage of paying for ad-free Outlook is actually not the ads, but
<em>the fact that your account will never expire</em>. A regular Hotmail.com / Outlook.com account will automatically be deactivated if you don't login for three months (after that, you get a 30-day grace period before the username becomes available for anyone
 else to sign up). The motivation is four-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;You want to keep your old email address active, especially if many friends have it as contact information for you. Otherwise, they'll send you an email, and it will either bounce back because the account is inactive, or reach the new user who signed up
 for that username. (And let's not even go into the topics of identity theft and expired email accounts!)</li><li>If you have used an email account for years, it's likely used with all kinds of online accounts, including financial institutions, backup email address for on- and off-line companies, etc. No longer access to that account means, often, impossible or very
 difficult to restore access to other accounts that use your old email address as password-recovery contact info!</li><li>In our case, we use our Hotmail account for all software licenses and registration codes; this means that, although backed up elsewhere, a quick search in our Outlook.com account gives us easy access to all those serial numbers in a safe place when switching
 computer! </li><li>You need an email account that you know you'll have for years to come: you should avoid using a free email address for anything important. You should never use your internet service provider's email for anything financial, since your email address will
 expire when you switch to a different provider; for the same reasons, never use your work or school email address!</li><li>&nbsp;In this age of identity theft, it's worth noting that it will be a lot easier to regain access to a hacked premium email account, because Microsoft has all your billing information - it knows, therefore, who you are, unlike a free email address. Should
 the <a href="http://logintips.com/hotmail-sign-in/reset-forgotten-hotmail-outlook-com-password.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>The bottom line answer, in our opinion, is a resounding "". Even if you operate your own website (we do :), with control over hosting and email accounts (we do!), you never know when you'll need to switch provider. At that time, you'll need to download all
 your mail, and re-upload it to the new mail server (harder and more tedious than it sounds).&nbsp;
<strong>Note:</strong> neither AOL Mail nor Gmail currently offer a premium service that locks your email address (Google offers something similar, but its history of regularly killing services makes us hesitant). Yahoo Mail does offer the "Plus" version of
 its webmail service, but things seem in constant motion since Marissa Mayer took over as CEO, including a crazy hike in Yahoo Mail Plus yearly fees for new users - which makes us
<em>think</em> (only an opinion, without supporting evidence) that Yahoo may want to slowly move away from the offering - the price jumped

</p><p><strong>How to Upgrade Your Outlook.com Email Account to Ad-Free Outlook.com:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once logged into your account, click on <strong>Settings</strong> (gear icon in the top right corner of the page), and select "<strong>Options</strong>". On the next screen, click on the "<strong>Upgrade to Ad-free Outlook.com</strong>" link (last link under
 the first section on the left). This link will open in a new window (in Internet Explorer, you can hold down the and keys on your keyboard while clicking a link, to temporarily override your popup blocker!)&nbsp; Then, follow the rest of the instructions: it's
 a simple check-out and online payment form, currently hosted on <code><span style="color: rgba(238, 85, 0, 1)">signup.msn.com</span></code>. Your subscription renews yearly, on the same date. You can cancel at any point before the next renewal date, and your credit card
 won't be billed for that next year.&nbsp; <strong>Tip:</strong> this link disappears once you've become a member / subscriber. At that time, you can manage your subscription by clicking on the first link in that same section, labeled "". This is also how you cancel
 your membership - from the new Account window that opens.<br />

</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What is the difference between MSN, Hotmail, Outlook, Windows Live Mail?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you're in tech (and even then!), Microsoft's branding department makes things difficult to follow. It uses the same core product name across offerings, heavily uses , and when it comes to email -be it webmail or desktop email programs- things get
 even worse. In this tutorial, we'll clarify the differences between Clients <strong>
MSN, Hotmail, Outlook Express, Outlook and Outlook.com, Outlook Web Access&nbsp;and</strong> Apps
<strong>Windows Live Hotmail</strong>, <strong>Windows Live Mail, and Windows </strong>
<strong>Mail.</strong> There are basically two possibilities, but four combinations: a web-based email service, from desktop / laptop computers or from mobile devices, or a native application, either on Windows / Mac OS X desktop or on a mobile device. Let's
 get started:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two ways to check your emails: if you do it inside a web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.), you are using a
<strong>webmail client</strong>, which is a particular type of web app. (The word "" is just short for "" - just another way of saying ""). The screenshot on the left shows Microsoft's current webmail offering, called Outlook.com, loaded in the company's web
 browser, Internet Explorer. It may look a bit different from your version, because we're paying yearly to get the upgraded version, called "<a href="http://logintips.com/hotmail-sign-in/upgrade-to-ad-free-outlook-com-hotmail-plus.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Ad-Free
 Outlook.com</span></a>", which used to be called "").</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you launch a program to check your emails, whether it's from a desktop / laptop computer, or from a mobile device, you are using an email program: these are called
<strong>desktop email clients</strong> when they run on a . When that program is designed for a tablet, , or cell phone / smartphone, it's often called a
<strong>mobile mail app</strong>. (<strong>Note:</strong> you use <a href="http://logintips.com/hotmail-sign-in/hotmail-server-settings-outlook-com.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 desktops - more on that later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite the multiple names, Microsoft only has two webmail offerings: the one for consumer is called
<strong>Outlook.com</strong>, but is still best known as <strong>Hotmail</strong>. If you check your Hotmail account using a mobile device's web browser, things will look different because you are using the mobile version of Hotmail. The screenshot on the left
 shows the mobile version of Outlook.com, as viewed on an iPhone. Not to be confused with the free Microsoft Outlook app available in the App Store! The second offering is Outlook Web Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 1997, Microsoft acquired one of the first online email services, which was called "": that's a play on words for geeks, because the capitalized letters "" are the name of the markup language used to design web pages ("<code><span style="color: rgba(238, 85, 0, 1)">HTML</span></code>"
 stands for ""). Microsoft changed its name to simply "", and offered it for free;
<code><span style="color: rgba(238, 85, 0, 1)">MSN</span></code>, the name of the company's online offerings when the web was becoming mainstream, stands for "". On the left is a screenshot of one of the very earliest version of MSN Hotmail (image source:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hotmail_old_screenshot.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Link opens in a new window / browser tab">
<p>
</p><p>Back when Microsoft was battling legal issues for alleged antitrust practices, the company started the "" division to create software and services for Windows users - a way of adding value to the operating system, without appearing to remove choice from
 users. Initially, Microsoft planned on renaming Hotmail "", but ultimately kept the well-known brand in the name. At the same period, it was launching a free email program to-be-called "", which ultimately became known as "". On the left is a screenshot of
 the webmail offering, when it was called "" - one of the most beautiful executions of a web-based email system, which we were sad to see retired in 2012
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Mail:</strong>&nbsp; Microsoft actually gave the same name of "<strong>Windows Mail</strong>" to different email programs: the first is the Outlook Express successor that shipped bundled with Windows Vista. It does include adaptive spam filters
 and defense mechanisms against phishing attempts, but doesn't add much to the already mature offering that was Outlook Express. It is possible, but complicated, to run Windows Mail on Windows 7 - so it's, really, only usable on Windows Vista. Check out our
<a href="http://www.freeemailtutorials.com/vistaWindowsMail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Link opens in a new window / browser tab">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Outlook:</strong>&nbsp; Microsoft Outlook has been part of the Microsoft Office productivity suite since Office 95. It is more a personal information manager (PIM) than just an email program. It includes a calendar, advanced contact manager,
 tasks management, and more. It is available for both Windows and Mac OS X. <a href="http://www.freeemailtutorials.com/microsoftOutlook2003/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Link opens in a new window / browser tab">

<p>
</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>&nbsp; If you plan on using a Microsoft email account from a web browser,
<strong>Outlook.com</strong> is the current offering; if your employer uses an Exchange Server, or if you subscribe to Office 365, you can use
<strong>Outlook Web App</strong> ("").&nbsp; On the Windows desktop, a good choice for a free email program is
<strong>Windows Live Mail</strong>, especially if you are using Windows Vista or later (so that you can run the latest version).&nbsp; A great, paid email program, for Windows or Mac OS X, is
<strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong>, the email client and <abbr>PIM</abbr> that can be purchased separately, and is bundled

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">For your Info,, here&nbsp;are the &nbsp;benefits of the Original Version of Hotmail Plus:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>Hotmail Plus</strong>" is the name Microsoft gives to the top version of Hotmail ("Windows Live Hotmail") - which costs $19.95 per year, and comes with several perks this tutorial will go over.&nbsp; Before delving into the details of the Hotmail Plus
 offering, let us just say to clear any confusion: Hotmail is, and remains, a free webmail service ("webmail" = emails you check from the web, without needing to use an email program). Windows Live Hotmail, as it is officially known, gets its revenues from
 the ads displayed alongside your emails; you are under no obligation to pay for Hotmail, and Hotmail Plus is an optional service that makes your email experience much more enjoyable. The probably most noteworthy, and perhaps best selling point, of Hotmail
 Plus, is that it disables the ads: you get all the functionality of the original Hotmail, with more features (described below), but absolutely no ads anywhere. That alone, we think, is well worth paying $20 per year for Hotmail Plus!&nbsp; The rules of the game
 have somewhat changed since Hotmail became "Outlook.com", so check out our tutorial on "<a href="http://logintips.com/hotmail-sign-in/upgrade-to-ad-free-outlook-com-hotmail-plus.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 153, 1)">Ad Free Outlook.com</span></a>",
 the successor to Hotmail Plus. Webmail providers offer so much for free accounts nowadays, that it becomes hard to justify paying extra for a premium account. Or does it? (Hint, read the linked tutorial :)</p>
<p><strong>Hotmail Plus features</strong> </p>
<p>As mentioned above, Hotmail Plus comes <strong>without any ads</strong> displayed alongside your emails: this makes the Hotmail experience a lot more enjoyable: the screens are less cluttered, and pages load faster since Hotmail Plus does not have to download
 the graphical banner ads the regular Hotmail has to. This also makes reading your emails quite a bit less stressful, since many of these banner ads are animated, and the movement is very distracting when you are trying to concentrate on reading your emails
 - no such problem with Hotmail Plus.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.freeemailtutorials.com%2fwindowsLiveHotmail%2fconfigureHotmailSettingsOptions%2fi%2fHotmail-Plus-vs-standard-Hotmail-no-ads.png" height="127" width="339" /></p>
<p>All the following are free upgrades you get with your Hotmail Plus account, in addition to removing the ads. The last section of this tutorial will show you how to sign up with Hotmail Plus if you are convinced. Note that Hotmail Plus does not offer you
 free tech support from Hotmail or anything like that - it is the same email service, minus the ads, and with the following free upgrades after the yearly fee is paid.</p>
Hotmail Plus storage The regular Hotmail allows you for 5 gigabytes of storage for your emails, which grows as needed; Hotmail Plus doubles that and starts with 10Gb storage (still grows as your needs evolve). This is not much of a case for Hotmail Plus, since
 very few people will even get close to 1Gb of emails stored online. Hotmail Plus attachments The regular Hotmail allows for up to 10 megabytes file attachments, which corresponds to about 4 high resolution pictures. Hotmail Plus allows you to send email attachments
 of up to 20 Mb, or the double of regular Hotmail. For an in-depth overview of limitations with attachments in Hotmail, how to overcome them, etc. - please see our
<a href="http://www.freeemailtutorials.com/windowsLiveHotmail/theNewHotmail/sendingAttachments.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="http://www.freeemailtutorials.com/windowsLiveHotmail/theNewHotmail/fileAttachmentsSizeLimits.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 is nice to have, but probably a non-issue for anyone who uses Hotmail regularly. Any business owner who uses Hotmail as their professional email should without a doubt pay for Hotmail Plus to avoid any problem. Hotmail Plus enhanced junk mail filtering: more
 safe senders Hotmail Plus doubles the number of "safe senders" you can have configured - the regular Hotmail currently allows you to mark up to 250 email addresses as "safe" - Hotmail Plus doubles that to up to 500 registered safe senders. Hotmail Plus and
 email forwarding Unlike Hotmail Plus, the regular Hotmail does not let you forward emails to email accounts . To clarify: you can

<a href="http://www.freeemailtutorials.com/windowsLiveHotmail/configureHotmailSettingsOptions/forwardEmailsToOtherAccount.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 and custom filters.&nbsp; Without more details available, Hotmail Plus also advertises the ability to include more recipients in your email distribution lists, and the ability to create more custom filters ("email rules") to automatically sort through and organize
 your emails.
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail Plus cannot be downloaded, since it is a webmail service, but <strong>
you can get Windows Live Mail as a free download to connect with the Hotmail Plus servers
</strong>(more detailed information is upcoming on Hotmail Plus IMAP and Hotmail Plus POP3 server information).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, I wanted to add, in reference to the 2nd suggestion, that this problem occured after updating Offfice 2003, and I was using IE8 at that time and upgraded to IE9 hoping it would resolve the issue, which it didn't.</p>

            Unfortunately this fix it applied to IE7 not 8 or 9. &nbsp;To be honest I have given up and am no longer going to use IE, I have switched to Chrome and everything is working fine. &nbsp;Thank you all for your suggestions and assistance with this issue. &nbsp;I have used
 IE fro many years and it is a shame that MS caused this problem and in the end had no interest in fixing it, but yet Chrome works just fine, &nbsp;tells me I have had too much faith in MS for too long...

<p>I Have the exact same problem, with word and excel.&nbsp; I can open and save locally to my documents, the problem only occurs when I open an office document from onedrive, and only on one particular machine.&nbsp; Also, if I click 'this app only' on the password
 screen, and uncheck 'allow my organization to manage my device' it actually will sort of work, but as soon as I open another file the problem occurs again.&nbsp; I have tried all of the credential fixes, and even signed out of both office and onedrive (though I
 haven't tried uninstalling both of them yet), and the problem persists.&nbsp; Actually, everything worked fine if I unlinked onedrive and worked locally, but it came back after I signed back into onedrive.</p>

<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the Error message screenshot and your description, I have 2 different suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I couldn't find the information about OS. If it is Windows 2008 server, please refer to the following article: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/977754/keyset-does-not-exist-error-message-when-you-try-to-change-the-identit<br />
</li><li>Create a new Windows profile and test whether the issue appears.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For the further troubleshooting, I'll need a few more information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you use OneDrive or OneDrive for Business?&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-onedrive-for-business-187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2</li><li>Office 365 version - Open Outlook&gt; File&gt; Office account&gt; About Outlook. The information is in format Outlook for Office 365 MSO (16.0.10730.20264) 32-bit.</li><li>OS and version.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please send me all requested information and test results for the further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to respond. You may have missed the "VBA" part of my question. I am able to download and have been using Analysis Toolpak. I am now trying to use one or more of the functions in my Visual Basic programs which requires that you
 have Analysis Toolpak <strong><em>- VBE</em></strong>. </p>
<p>The VBE version seems to have been taken off the market because of problems.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your advice.</p>

            <p>Hi Qing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, am still experiencing the problem. Here are the specifics:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an iMac with OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6 with Excel for Mac Version 15.29 (came as part of Office 365 for Home)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded and have been using Analysis Toolpak, specifically Fourier Analysis but as a spreadsheet function i.e. to manually transform columns of numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am trying to use the same functions in my Visual Basic program to automate usage and am informed that I need to add-in the "Analysis Toolpak - VBE" in order for the VB program to call the functions from Analysis Toolpak. However, my Excel version does
 not show Analysis Toolpak - VBE as an available option and I cannot find any link to download it. I have seen some posts from 2016 that suggest that ATP-VBE caused problems and may have been removed as an option by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you can help by answering if Analysis Toolpak - VBE&nbsp;is<strong> </strong>available and if so, how I can get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the offer to help.</p>

            I believe that there are some other threads on this so it might be worth running a search. I seem to remember the consensus was there's nothing you can do about it, but it could be somebody had found some utility or workaround that would solve your problem.

            Why don't you download some themes, there are loads out there just Google it. Still a poor show as far as font size is concerned, I use my N80 outdoors a lot and would like to be able to see my standby screen at a glance.

            you mention I could get some themes on Google. Can you tell me how to do that do I just put in a search themes is that enough? Does anyone know where I might get some extra software to change fonts?

            As far as anyone can tell there is currently no way to change font sizes on the handset itself (more's the pity) but maybe in some future update? However, there are many different themes on the net and some are nuch easier to read than others, themes being
 the colours, patterns and icons on your phones display, enter into a google search: Series 60 3rd edition themes, and you will get a lot of sites offering downloads. Personally I think the standard Nokia theme is easiest to read though. Btw, you can add different
 fonts to the N80 but sadly they are pretty much the same size as regular Nokia ones - Nokia, we don't all have 20/20 vision you know!

            Just to update this issue, I got a reply from Nokia yesterday re: font size on N80, this is the reply I got:<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Nokia Helpline.<br />
<br />
With regard to your email concerning the Nokia N80, unfortunately the font size<br />
on the screen of this handset is not changeable.<br />
<br />
That's the end of that issue then!

            Hi BigGuy,<br />
<br />
LOL. At minimum, think you can reply to get them to raise this to the product team. Personnally, I wonder if this is really a Symbian problem rather than Nokia. In any case, if the correct party can get the message, hopefully later gens of mobiles will have
 this feature.<br />
<br />
Cheers. ^_^;

            ahem, themes can change the way fonts appear on a S60 phone. a theme can make them larger or smaller.<br />
<br />
so, if you were able to find a theme with larger/smaller fonts - then this would help you.<br />
<br />
you just need to bear in mind one thing - the screen is only so big. so larger fonts may have undesirable affects...

                    Added my Microsoft account, ran the trouble shooter as per another question in the forums. Trouble shooter noted the windows has not activated, attempted to do so..... no luck. Pasted the product key from the download page and it was rejected as well.
 My account seems to be working even though it says it needs to verify me, and I did the second party verification when I set the account up after upgrading.

<p>I'm not sure why&nbsp;youu get duplicates but sometimes it just&nbsp;happens, my guess is that some character is recognized differently and so it records it as a seperate entry. There are a few programs out there for removal of duplicates that work.&nbsp; I have used ODR
 (Outllok Duplicate Remover) and have been very satisfied with it.&nbsp; It is free so check it out.</p>
<p><span>Here are some&nbsp;tools available to get rid of duplicates here:

<span>http://www.slipstick.com/addins/mail_duplicates.asp</span></a>
</span></p>
<p>The last one in the list, Outlook Duplicates Remover is pretty good.&nbsp; Just set it up using small values so it will work fast.&nbsp; If the checking parameters are set high, it takes forever.<br />
<br />
There is another called <strong>Outlook Cleaner 0.99</strong>&nbsp;that seems to be pretty good (although I have not tried it).&nbsp; Folks have said they like it a lot so I would probably check this out first.<br />

    <title>Office 365 Home Premium programs restart after closing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james leigh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Home Premium programs restart after closing</h2>
                    Hi there.
<div>I recently bought a&nbsp;subscription&nbsp;to Office 365 Home Premium. When I open the programs, use them, then close&nbsp;them, an error message appears, but&nbsp;disappears&nbsp;before I can read what it says. Then, about 50% of the time, whatever Office program I just closed
 will restart and open itself.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have done some research, and as far as I can tell, from looking at the event viewer, the offending file seems to be called&nbsp;<b>mso.dll</b>. I have tried starting the programs in safe mode, and the error message still shows up, but, again&nbsp;disappears&nbsp;before
 I can read it. It does not, however, seem to restart itself. I have also tried doing a quick repair and an online repair, as well as disabling all COM add ins, all to no avail.</div>
<div>I have also, from today, started noticing that&nbsp;occasionally, even if I have not started any of the Office programs, a message appears saying that the document cache is&nbsp;restarting, but it does not restart any of the Office programs.</div>
<div>Any help would be very much appreciated, as this can become very&nbsp;frustrating.</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>James</div>

            <p>After the annual renewal all my 365 programmes (English spelling!) reopen themselves after being shut down. Have been through your advice above - much not relevant as they relate to crashes or software I don't have etc.</p>
<p>It didn't happen until I renewed my subscription. I have done a repair and re-installation. I am running Win 7 Pro.</p>

<p>Hi Siddh,<br />
<br />
<br />
To assist you better, kindly provide us more details by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you start encountering the issue?<br />
</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to the issue?<br />
</li><li>Are you experiencing this issue only with Groove Music application?</li></ul>
<p>If you're having trouble using the Groove player in Windows 10, the problem may be due to an application error or an incorrect setting. Meanwhile, we suggest that you run the Windows app troubleshooter by clicking this
<strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
You may also refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3078110/troubleshoot-groove-player-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to troubleshoot Groove Player in Windows 10.<br />

<p>Alright, I've figured out that the root cause of this problem after several experiments. Whenever I change the default system font using either an external application or registry editor, this problem begins. If I change the default font back to the original
 one, that is, Segoe UI, using registry editor, everything becomes normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is now solved now.</p>
<p>
