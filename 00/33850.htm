<p>Hey there Guto!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing problems with REsident Evil. </p>

<h2>            I keep losing the sound on my Toshiba laptop</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop and I am running Windows 7. Every time my computer reboots, I loose my sound.&nbsp; To solve it, I have to go to Device Manager and "Scan for hardware changes". The sound comes back right away; but it is annoying to say the
 least.&nbsp; I was running Vista but hoped that by upgrading to Windows 7 the problem would be fixed; no such luck. Does anyone know of a fix?<br />

    <title>&#39;unknown device&#39; code 28 - web cam was working fine, now - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sema 4  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;unknown device&#39; code 28 - web cam was working fine, now doesn&#39;t, bought a new one, different make, same error&#33;</h2>
                    I hope someone can help so I don't have to reinstall this thing, I have only been running Win7 for about 5 weeks and for the last 2 of those weeks I have been trying to solve this driver problem.<br />
<br />
I have a Philips SPC900N webcam which is Win7 qualified, got the drivers, installed them, no problems, everything worked great for about 2 weeks or so.<br />
<br />
As I unplug my webcam when I travel with my laptop, it was connected and removed a few times, but it worked great.<br />
<br />
One day when I plugged my camera in I got an 'Unknown Device' message rather than the normal 'Philips SPC900' one, it said searching for drivers, stayed like that for a few mins, then said drivers could not be found.<br />
<br />
Device manager shows the camera as an 'Unknown Device' and reports error code 28 when I view the properties of it.<br />
<br />
The camera still works perfectly well on my desktop which is running XP so I know the camera is not faulty.<br />
<br />
The VID &amp; PID numbers are recognised correctly in Win7 but it insists that it can't find a driver when it was working perfectly well for around 3 weeks.<br />
<br />
I spent the last couple of weeks trying to find a fix for this, but so far, no luck.<br />
<br />
I have been all through the registry looking for references to the VID &amp; PID, the Base Container Id, the Bus type guid, to see if there is anything I can find that appears out of the ordinary, but everything looks ok, no corrupt data relative to this device
 that I can find.<br />
<br />
I also uninstalled all the USB root hubs and host controllers in dev manager, restarted, but it's the same.<br />
<br />
I then did the set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 thing and uninstalled everything that was USB related but it's still the same.<br />
<br />
Eventually, in frustration and really not wanting to have to format and reinstall win7 again after only 5 weeks, I decided to buy a new web cam, because my Philips one is rather old now, so I bought the latest Logitech 905c laptop webcam, which arrived today.<br />
<br />
Imagine my horror when I plugged it in to the laptop and got EXACTLY the same message, 'Unknown Device' then 'searching for drivers' then 'can't be found' and now I have another 'unknown device' in the device manager with code 28, it worked first time when
 I plugged it in to my XP desktop...<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the direction to look for a fix for this thing please ? I'm going mad here...<br />
<br />
~TIA

<p><span>Hi Sema 4,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I would suggest you to manually update the device driver from device manager to the latest driver provided by the manufacturer. This would apply for both devices.</span></p>

            Thanks for the reply, I thought I had explained this well enough in my first post, perhaps I didn't....<br />
<br />
I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers for my original philips camera 4 or 5 times, in safe mode and in normal mode, I tried it all ways. The driver appeared to install correctly and without error, but when I plug the camera in the little balloon that pops
 up says 'Unknown Device' and it searches for drivers, and eventually it says it can't find any drivers and thats as far as it goes.<br />
<br />
If I go to the device manager it shows an 'Unknown device'. If I select it and click on update driver, it searches my computer and on line then tells me it can't find a driver for my hardware. When I open the properties for it, it tells me it has a code 28
 error. If I look at the VID &amp; PID numbers for this device, I can see it's the philips camera, but for some bizarre reason, Win7 just refuses to find the drivers for it... even though I know they are installed.<br />
<br />
When my new Logitech camera arrived the first thing I did was to run the installer CD before attempting to connect the camera, during the install it told me to plug the camera in and wait for the device to be recognised at which point it would automatically
 install the drivers for it, but when I plugged the brand new logitech camera in, the little pop up balloon said 'Unknown Device' and windows started searching for drivers, which it eventually said it couldn't find. Meanwhile the logitech installer is still
 waiting for the camera to be detected, and it never is so it just sits like that until you click cancel, I waited for half an hour to be sure it was stuck 'waiting' for a camera that never appeared because it was detected as an 'unknown device' rather than
 a 'logitech camera' or what ever it's supposed to report it's self as being...<br />
<br />
It seems to me, given the fact I get the identical error with 2 different video cameras made by 2 different companies, that something has become corrupt in the registry that deals with the 'hardware' and the 'drivers' and the 'class' of 'webcam usb devices'
 or 'av usb devices' or something like that, I don't know enough about how the hardware tree manages devices, classes, drivers, etc, to be able to give a better example.<br />
<br />
So, in response to your suggestion of manually updating the drivers, that link you posted tells me I should either
<br />
<br />
1. use <span>windows</span> update to find a driver - but that doesn't work because both devices always appear as an 'Unknown device' and windows update appears not to find drivers for hardware that identifies it's self as 'unknown device'<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2. install software from the device manufacturer - which also doesn't work because even after the driver installed finishes, the device still appears as 'unknown device' when you plug it in and Win7 can't find a driver for 'unknown device'<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
3. download and update the driver yourself - not sure how this is different from step 2, there are no direct driver files that I can find any where on the internet for these devices, they are only installers that have the driver and utility software all rolled
 together within them, if I could find the raw inf and sys files that were the actual driver files, I may be able to force win7 to use them, but I can find no such inf files for either of my web cams.<br />
<br />
So I'm still stuck with a 6 week old install of Win7 that refuses to see any webcam device as anything other than an 'unknown device' and so far it's taken about 3 weeks of my time (on and off) to try and fix it. I no longer have any time to spend on this and
 I shall be formatting the thing tonight because my work is now suffering as a result of the downtime.<br />
<br />
If this should happen again in a couple of weeks time then I will have to seriously consider going back to XP and asking MS for my money back because Win7 was not cheap and it clearly has some bugs in it that are not easy to find and fix once they occur.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes - free<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; MRT&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You should be getting this tool and its updates via Windows Updates - if needed you can<br />
download it here.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(Then run MRT as above.)<br />

            No this is not a legitimate Microsoft site and it can cause you damage.
<br />
<br />These are old methods to exploit the unsuspecting customers and sensitive information might be leaked including your computer and mail ID and other information being used for bad purposes. 
<br />
<br />You should report this Scam to Microsoft @

<br />
Minimum you need is <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Processor:</span> 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster with support for PAE, NX, and SSE2&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>RAM:</span> 1 gigabyte (GB) (32-bit) or 2 GB (64-bit)</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Hard disk space:</span> 16 GB (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Theoretically it is possible . But practically if your hard disk is damaged or very old there may be issues... slowness in boot process etc...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can install windows 8 if the processor is minimum 1 gigahertz (GHz) but If the processor is somewhat old some features are disabled like hyper-v. (hyper-v needs SLAT technology which is supported by modern core i3 processors ).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But if you are a regular home user you can ignore hyper-v and install windows 8 in the above pc u have described<br />

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Lockscreen info doesn&#39;t match the picture</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp;The initial Lock/Splash screen has an info link that doesn't match the picture. &nbsp;This has been going on for some time, and I don't see any articles concerning this problem. &nbsp;As you see in the below screenshot,
 the info is for a completely different picture:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0101029b-8f39-4699-b9bd-97b4ada028d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0101029b-8f39-4699-b9bd-97b4ada028d2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted, of course; I turned off the lockscreen and turned it back on. &nbsp;In the Settings-&gt;Personalization-&gt;Lock Screen menu, I changed the setting for "Get fun facts..." off, rebooted, turned it back on, rebooted, and the info on the lock screen is
 still incorrect. &nbsp;Is Microsoft working on this defect or have any knowledge of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your attention. &nbsp;It's greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<blockquote><br />
Guys, I just got a Win 10 computer, and I am in the process of starting to prep it for moving all my old files over from my XP computer (using PCmover).
<br />
<br />
One of the things PCmover told me to do was go into Win 10's Task Scheduler and disable the tasks under the Active Tasks tab, which I did.
<br />
<br />
But now I can't find those disabled tasks to enable them after I complete the PC-to-PC file move. They've disappeared completely.

<h2>            Phone number comes up as Restricted or Unknown for all calls.</h2>
                    I have a subscription for Skype for incoming and outgoing calls. For the past 4 or so months my number has been coming up on the receiving end as restricted and sometimes unknown. This is highly annoying because a lot of people automatically decline restricted
 or unknown numbers. There doesn't seem to be online tech support and the customer support page sends me in circles with faqs. Does anyone know a remedy or way to get direct email or phone support?

<h2>            Headset won&#39;t work if Plugged in After Computer is Already On</h2>
                    <p>If I plug in my headset after my laptop is already on, my headset doesn't work.&nbsp; If I plug it in before I turn it on, it works.&nbsp; What's up?&nbsp; It never did this before and this headset works great on all other devices, so I know it is not the headset.&nbsp; There
 is definitely something going on with a Windows update.&nbsp; This has been happening for months and I've about had it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all troubleshooting and nothing is wrong.&nbsp; I always do updates so I have current drivers and no virus issues...everything is clean.</p>

            1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback tab
<br />Right click your headphone
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already

            Hey. Since you've said you tried everything, what exactly are the things you have tried? 
<br />
<br />After you plug the headset in  go to control panel &gt; sound &gt; playback &gt; right click any empty white space and make sure show disabled and show disconnected devices is on.  After that you should see your headset. 
<br />
<br />If it still doesn't work right click your speakers and disable them when your headset is on.

<p>You have two options:</p>

<li>Tell your application to use the "AppData" folder instead of the legacy "Application Data" folder (which goes back to Windows 2000).</li><li>Recreate the symbolic link to "Application Data".</li></ul>

    <title>Unknown Skype Message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewcolburn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown Skype Message</h2>
                    <p>I have not logged into my Skype account for a few weeks, but when I tried Skype gave me a message saying someone else was using my account. My Skype account has sent out a message to all my Skype contacts that is a website including their Skype name in the
 address. It was sent to all my contacts on Friday at 10:30 AM. Each link that was sent out is a little different, but it is all scam junk. Here is one of the links:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is all junk. I followed the Skype directions to change my password. Is there anything else that I can or should do to keep my account safe? Should I worry, now that my Skype has been used by someone else to send out junk to all my contacts? Is there anything
 I can do to make my account more secure? What is Microsoft doing to solve this problem? How was my account accessed and my information obtained as I do not give it out? Please let me know what follow up I should do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try this second test.&nbsp; See if the resulting video file plays fine in Media Player or if it has blurry text also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you could run <strong>dxdiag</strong> and look at the <strong>Display
</strong>tab.&nbsp; Note the make/model of graphics card and the driver date and version.&nbsp; That will help determine if it is an issue with your graphics card or its driver version.</p>

            I make all my movies with still pictures, put captains, music on them. I have been doing this for at least 3 years and never had a problem before. I thought maybe Microsoft was changing things and not informing me of the changes. I'm not to good on the
 computer but I have been doing good with this and been putting my life on DVD'S in stead of in a photo album, takes less storage space and can see my life as I live it.

<h3> ivan mayers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change date of birth </h2>
                    
<p>I have just been speaking to a support agent, very friendly folk however he could not resolve my issue.</p>
<p>I have been eagerly waiting for pay day to go purchase battlefield 3. I go to access multiplayer and get told to enter the 25 digit code. After this was filled in I proceeded and was stopped by a message "cannot receive information at this time" I have been
 talking to a support agent, Ken. Who after a while of troubleshooting found out that the problem occured because my xbox live account is under age. I ask surely there must be a way that you can make my D.O.B correct? Apparently not. Then he gives me the option
 to wait until my age on XBL says im 18, or make a new account just for battlefield 3. Im incredibly outraged and sense and manners is stopping me from saying every swearword in the book. I just bought Battlefield 3 and really badly want to play it but because
 my account is under age im not allowed to download absolutely anything from the marketplace regardless off its restrictions. Xbox really needs to step up its game I am an Xbox fan boy but I would easily move to PS3 as they can change your D.O.B with valid
 information which I am willing to give. And I am certainly not going to make a whole new account just for one game. I am definetly going to call xbox as soon as there customer support is open. For now I can only glare at my game and think about playing it
 online.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Apologies but the EA servers will only allow players over the age of 13 to play online. This is their age restriction not Xbox's.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In the matter of trying to change your DOB, that is something you cannot do. Once you put in your DOB when creating the account there is no changing it. If you know your birthday and enter it correctly you shouldn't need to change it as entering false information on your account is not allowed. When you create an account the process calls for you to confirm the DOB information twice to ensure you have the correct info.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you feel that PS3 will offer you a better experience, by all means. </p>

<p>I am aware that the EA servers will only allow players of the age of 13 to play online. This is not the case, I have rung them and asked for my details and my age is 18 on there books. I am well aware of the problem. After chatting to a support agent yesterday
 the status code presented meant that my account was a child account and that is why I am infringed from playing Battlefield 3 online. The thing is Even though my date of birth is incorrect on my XBL account it still says that I am 14 years of age, and even
 if I want to download a G rated movie that is FREE I am still not allowed to download because I have a "child account" xbox stuffed me up big time</p>

<p>But the fact that XBOX cant rectify the problem is the issue. I am a parent and I'm annoyed that my son can't play his game. His account is set to adult settings so I assumed he would be able to play his game. This is not the case since XBOX apparently wants
 to play my role as the parent. If I, the adult of the house, decide that it's acceptable for my child to play this game, why is XBOX interfering? It seems to me that this could have been avoided is to have had my son lie about his age from the start, and THAT,
 I don't condone.</p>

            Since this is a EA service in question Actually EA sets the rules for the service which is origin which is how you create your account for EA
<p>Not Xbox live</p>
<p>you don't decide how they govern their service if they require a person to be 18 to use their service that is their right</p>
<p>If you let your child lie about his age then you accept the consequences </p>
<p>If you don't like their rules then don't use their service </p>
<p>There are other games then ea or battlefield in Xbox </p>

<p>Ok if you confirmed your account is Irish then </p>
<p>Then contact your ISP and get them to help reset your gateway settings It would be a geoip issue which you need to have your ISP handle or simply goto a friends house with a different ISP</p>
<p>And deletion of the file or another storage device doesnt work</p>
<p>If it is uk rather then Ireland then you need to create a new account </p>
<p>Not all dlc is region locked</p>
<p>Only cod content by treyarch and ms and well too many to list</p>
<p>Just saying you can download others doesn't mean it's not a region issue</p>
<p>Not all content falls under region locks</p>
