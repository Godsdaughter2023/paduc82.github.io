            <p>I have had both of my emails for years so I can't just change.&nbsp; And my primary email is ATT.net which is still a Yahoo server (I don't know if ATT owns Yahoo or Yahoo owns ATT).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's not the phone operating system (our's is Windows) because I have seen several other complaints with all different phones and OS's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yahoo did some kind of update that affected their syncing on mobile devices.&nbsp; It has been over 3 weeks since our emails on our phones will synce (Yahoo and ATT).&nbsp; It is getting VERY FRUSTRATING!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to contact Yahoo (all I could find was their stupid Q &amp; A Troubleshooting section which doesn't address it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            Same exact situation as you. Been searching for hours. No luck. Saw many with the same code 800C0000, and it all happened to them at the same time, about a month ago. Have been using a desktop version or something of yahoo to get and send emails, but it's
 a pain to use. I was going to try a hard reset of the phone, but unable to save all valuable info to desktop. It would all probably be gone after a hard re-set. Technology! Best wishes.

            It's infuriating because it is a Yahoo/ATT server issue and they won't even acknowledge that they did anything, much less offer any solutions.&nbsp; I think I am going to file a complaint with the FCC.&nbsp; Last time I had an issue they wouldn't resolve, I filed
 a complaint and I received a call from the ATT President's office.&nbsp; Maybe if enough people file complaints ATT will do something.<br />

<h2>            Repeat a Series of Animations</h2>
                    <p>I'm new to PowerPoint and I'm trying to figure out how to loop a series of animations on a slide.&nbsp; I have a slide that shows a client PC and a server with an elbow connector between them.&nbsp; I want to represent communications back and forth between the client
 and server.&nbsp; I created a small blue dot and added a custom motion path to make the dot&nbsp;follow the line.&nbsp; I then copied that 4 times, which each successive but dot delayed by .1 seconds.&nbsp; I then did the same thing with gold dots coming back from the server
 side.&nbsp; The animation for the gold dots is set to start after the animation for the blue dots ends.&nbsp; The effect is that you see 5 blue dots travelling from the PC to the server, and after the last blue dot arrives as the server, you see 5 gold dots travelling
 from the server back to the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I just want to repeat that entire sequence until the end of the slide.&nbsp; I can repeat each individual animation, but I do not see a way to make the entire sequence repeat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I create repeat the sequence of animations?</p>

            <p>It's not really possible to do this using normal animation. There are two solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A The easy one (but not always appropriate)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no other animations on the slide. Make the slide a one slide custom show and repeat the whole slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>B The real answer but more difficult</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Create your own animation that<strong> can</strong> be repeated in a sequence. Not as hard as it sounds and there is an example
<a href="http://www.pptalchemy.co.uk/Create_Custom_Animations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
on our site here</a>. Still not for beginners but not that tricky. Basically add a delay into the animation that makes it repeat at the correct time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the animation is made PowerPoint will play it just like any other.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.pptalchemy.co.uk/Downloads/repeat.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Demo here </a>and you might be able to use the animation painter to copy the animation. NOTE this is specific to the times you mention.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007&#47;2010 Rules&#58; Exchange limit is 256KB. Does a POP mail PST Rules file have a limit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A sales manager has a very large set of Outlook rules to deal with incoming email from hundreds of customers worldwide. Her email is currently using Hosted Exchange where the 256KB limit is not allowing her to create more rules. I am thinking of changing&nbsp;her
 email from Hosted Exchange to POP, and having a local PST file instead&nbsp;of a synchronized OST file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does POP email, using a local PST file, have any size limit for the Rules file in Outlook?</p>

            <p>No, it doesn't. And you can probably use POP with your existing Exchange server if you really want to.</p>
<p>That said...I would spend some time trying to get her rules down under the limit and stay on Exchange if you can. MAPI/Exchange is a MUCH better e-mail protocol than POP and it would be a shame to be forced back to POP just to process rules.</p>
<p>Few things you can try:</p>
<p>1. Shorten the names of the rules as much as possible. ("A", "B", "A1", etc)</p>
<p>2. Consolidate rules whenever possible.&nbsp; If mail from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** all go to the same folder, make that one rule instead of two.</p>
<p>3. Shorten the folder names as much as possible - including the path to the folders.</p>
<p>4. Look into using a 3rd party utility or script to process that mail into subfolders instead of rules.</p>
<p>POP is a big step back from MAPI...I'd resist going to it to the bitter end if I could.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Nadeem,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is an expected behavior that you will receive the error message if you try to install a Windows Installer Based Office when you have other Click-to-Run installer based Office programs installed
 on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click-to-Run is the technology used to install Office 365 subscription and most other Office 2013 and Office 2016 products. Windows Installer technology (MSI) is used to install the volume
 license editions of Office, like Microsoft Office Professional Plus and Microsoft Office Standard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can't have Office products of the same version (like 2013 or 2016) that use two different installation technologies installed on the same computer. This also applies to standalone applications
 like Access, Visio, Project, Skype for Business, or OneDrive for Business.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you can refer to the following article.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-installed-with-Click-to-Run-and-Windows-Installer-on-same-computer-isn-t-supported-30775ef4-fa77-4f47-98fb-c5826a6926cd?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office
 installed with Click-to-Run and Windows Installer on same computer isn't supported</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a workaround, you can install different version of these two products, for example, Project 2013 (MSI) and Office 2016 (CtR).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,<br />

    <title>Probs with Asha 300 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ozsickboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Probs with Asha 300 Update</h2>
                    
<p>HAve recently updated phone software to V 07 .57 and wondering why some of my personal&nbsp; settings have changed and or gone. U<strong>sed</strong> to have a good flashing indicators when I missed a call, now all I have is an insiped useless indicator that
 you can only see if it is pitch black. The other thing that bugs me is that when charging I like to have the main panel lights stay on. I don`t want or need power saving.! Can anyone please help with any ideas and failing that how can I get rid of this latest
 update? Thanks from Pedro</p>

            Youy cannot downgrade the firmware or rollback to previous one.<br />
For your problems regarding lights staying on while charging, check under settings - accessory - charger - lights - on.<br />
For missed call light - check under settings - profile - light or settings - light.

<p>Hi and thanks for the reply..Have already tried these solutions before but followed the advice and as I suspected, nothing has changed. Still the same. Sad hardly see-able missed call/message light and no light on when charging. And this problem has only
 occured since updating the phone software. So any other ideas would be appreciated. Thanks Pedro</p>

            If its not available from there then its quite possible that it has been changed in the firmware. And if thats the case, unfortunately nothing else can be done except requesting it to be enabled in the next update.

<p>Oh goodie....so these snoozers take it upon themselves to screw up somebody`s phone settings without basically telling the customer that you may lose the couple of things that make this phone viable for the price. Typical..had a **bleep**fight with Nokia
 concerning the Maps.&nbsp; Always falls on deaf ears..Why do we even bother with complaining? Screw Nokia..Be the last one.</p>

<p>So far apart from the reply which I received {thanks} no-one has any idea how to fix this screwup. Blatantly obvious that Nokia service personel don`t give a toss as I have complained through&nbsp; Nokia .com and Ovi suite and still no response. Ok..if it is
 my fault, I would be the first to apologize but this lame insipid poxy update they said would make my phone better is absolute **bleep**. And since I have missed calls, messages all because these trained monkeys at Nokia think that they know what will make
 my phone better. God I hate multinationals. Screw Nokia. Never again sez Pete</p>

 phone. In pc it says version 7.44 which is installed is latest.<br />

    <title>Saving Outlook Messages to a File with Date Sent in the Filename - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wiseng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving Outlook Messages to a File with Date Sent in the Filename</h2>
                    <p>I've been searching for a method to take a string (conversation)&nbsp;of Outlook messages all with the same subject and save them into a Windows folder.&nbsp; Simply dragging and&nbsp;dropping the messages into a folder will save them, but the group of messages in the
 conversation all get the same filename {Subject (1), Subject (2), etc.} and you loose the ability to see what order in which the messages occurred.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that whenever somebody asks how to do this, the responder says "why do you want to do this?".&nbsp; The reason is that I need to keep messages relevant to a project in the Windows folder for that project.&nbsp; That way, if somebody else needs to work on
 the project or I archive the project and come back to it later the messages are easy to follow and you access them in the order they occurred and you can follow the conversation.&nbsp; Simply having them appear in some random order created when I drag and drop
 them looses all order related to the time the messages were sent.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the date and time info is in the file (the email) it seems to make total sense that there should be a way to get this date and time info placed in the filename when putting them in a folder.&nbsp; Or, have this info transferred along with the message to
 the file as some other attribute on which you can sort.&nbsp; That way you can sort by this and read the messages from the folder in the order they occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently,&nbsp;if I take three messages from Outlook and drag and drop them into a folder&nbsp;they look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subject.msg</p>
<p>RE Subject .msg</p>
<p>RE Subject (1).msg</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like these to look like where the date (11/13/15) and time the message was sent are in the filename:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subject 20151113 0745.msg</p>
<p>RE Subject 20151113 1030.msg</p>
<p>RE Subject 201513 1530.msg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know of a good way to do this?&nbsp; If not, this would be a great feature for Microsoft to consider adding the Outlook as an enhancement.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Outlook Web Mail errors</h2>
                    Problem has been fixed - after going into Internet Tools, Advanced and clicking Reset several times the problem was fixed.&nbsp; Not sure what items were changed but it corrected the problem.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone for all their helpful suggestions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Until yesterday I was able to open and access my email from home.&nbsp; When I tried yesterday this is the error message I received.&nbsp; I tried resetting the DEP but that did not have any effect on the problem.&nbsp; I sent this error to my IT department and they haven't
 got a clue.&nbsp; Hopefully someone can give me some suggestions on how to fix this issue.&nbsp; Thanks Shirley<br />

<p><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>

<p><span>Are you currently connecting via VPN connection to a machine or server at your place of business? Are you on a domain or a business network where global
 policies are in place?</span></p>
<p><span>From looking at your error it seems as though you are connecting to an Outlook Web Access mail server. If this is the case you will need to refer all questions
 to your business support team through your place of business and your network administrator.</span></p>

            Thanks Judd,<br />
<br />
I am connecting to an Outlook Web Access mail server.&nbsp; I did send the error message to my IT department and they did not have a clue as to what the problem was.&nbsp; I just downloaded a Java update to see if that might help and I also reset my Jave to include Mozilla
 since it was part of the error message.&nbsp; I'll see what happens.&nbsp; Again, thank you for your response and I'll check with my IT dept again on Monday.<br />

            Hi Hal,<br />
<br />
I did try that but it did not work.&nbsp; I have since updated Java and checked the Mozilla security setting since Mozilla was in the error message.&nbsp; Hopefully this will work.&nbsp; Thank you for the input, I really appreciate it.<br />

            <p>Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this is an old thread but I re-encountered the problem today after having solved it once before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is caused by the divx web plugin installed with Divx Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disable the plugin and the problem goes away.&nbsp; No need to uninstall Divx.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps those still looking for a solution.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 - inbox not syncing, but send works</h2>
                    
<p>On my main PC I have Office 365 and use Outlook for my mail. I have two email accounts set up: one Hotmail, one to my own .co.uk domain with IMAP.</p>
<p><br />
Yesterday my inbox stopped syncing to my domain's mail server, but I can still send as normal. Hotmail is unaffected. My laptop has the same setup and Outlook is working fine, as is the one on my Windows phone. I can access my email server via web interface,
 which all suggests to me that it is an issue within Outlook. </p>
<p>I did have the same issue on my laptop several weeks' ago and I deleted/reinstalled the mail account to get it working, but this seems a bit crazy.</p>
<p>Other than deleting everything (and losing rules etc), does anyone have a suggestion to get it working properly again?</p>

<p>hi rogerandrew,</p>
<p>to narrow down the root cause, i’d like to collect the information below:<br />
1. about “my inbox stopped syncing to my domain's mail server”, do you mean new emails don’t go into your inbox folder in the outlook client when you configure your office 365 account in outlook via imap?<br />
2. do you get any error message when the issue occurs?<br />
3. what is the connection status in the bottom of your outlook?<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=254013e1-498a-4502-8ff7-354f4af7539a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d254013e1-498a-4502-8ff7-354f4af7539a" /></a><br />
4. have you tried <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
repairing profile</a>?<br />
5. what is the detailed version of your operating system and outlook?<br />

<p>Hi Poppy</p>
<p>Microsoft triumphs again! As suggested, I tried "repairing profile", which simply deleted all Office applications from my PC. Luckily I guessed something might go wrong so I exported copies of all my mail, contacts etc as pst files before starting...</p>
<p>OK, so I guess Office has eaten itself. Next step? Go to my account, see my subscription for Office 365; cancel the install licence showing for my pc and try to reinstall. Result? Now I keep getting an error message "Access denied to installation source"
 error code 30174-4 (5).</p>
<p>When I search for that error code online, I get sent back to the Install page. And round and round we go......</p>
<p>At the moment this is severely messing up my working time as I am REALLY busy. I can't even use Word now! Why is it that I simply can't get a straightforward resolution to this problem? Will Microsoft give me some money back for the time I'm wasting????
 Thought not.....</p>

            There is no recovery for an account that hasn't been logged into in that long. Typically after 1 year of inactivity they are deactivated and purged.

    <title>Using a Master Project with Resource Pool the Dropdown is empty - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using a Master Project with Resource Pool the Dropdown is empty</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp; I am having an issue with the Resource Pool in a Master Project Plan.&nbsp; I started with a large single project and then broke it down into multiple projects that roll up into a Master plan.&nbsp; I created a Resource Pool and deleted the resources from
 the individual plans.&nbsp; Then I hooked up the Resource Pool using Resource Pool ==&gt; Share Resources and made sure the Resource Pool takes precedence even though I deleted the resources from each individual plan.&nbsp; I opened the Master project and said yes to&nbsp;
 open resource pool:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Resource Sheet shows all my resources</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However when I go to assign them to the task the dropdown is empty:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also opened a new Master using the resource pool and selecting option 3 and same result.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, I tried it in a test project starting fresh to see if it had anything to do with originally having the resources in each individual project&nbsp;and the dropdown was still blank.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can someone please assist me with this?&nbsp; Much appreciated!&nbsp; Heidi</p>

            <p>When you created the resource pool, you should not have deleted the resources from the sub projects. Attaching the sub-projects to teh pool automatically copies the resources across and keeps all your assignments.</p>
<p>It is not usually a good idea to link the master project to the resource pool. The master project should only have links to sub-projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WARNING: linked files are VERY susceptible to file corruption. If you ever rename, move, overwrite or save teh files on a WAN you roll the file corruption dice. It's a matter of when not if one or more files corrupt. If you do need to rename or move files
 first break the links to teh mater and resource pool, save all files, do what you need then re-link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explore using unlinked master files that consolidate resource workloads for reporting purposes instead.</p>

            <p>Rod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; When I left the resources in each project and tried to level all the projects within the master, it did not recognize that the resources for Phase I are the same as the resources in Phase II and so my phases all start at the same time.&nbsp;
 From what I can tell it does not recognize the Shared Resource pool and when I deleted the resources from each project and the dropdown is blank, to me that proves that it's not recognizing it even though the resources show up in the Resource Sheet.&nbsp; BTW I
 am on Project 2013.</p>

<p><span>Julie: When you say you "hooked up" the Resource Pool - you attached it to each sharer file, correct - not just to the Master Project?&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;Heidi: </span>This is the problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>What I did was create the Master and
<em>through </em>the Master go into each project and assign the Shared Resource Pool.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Instead, you have to open each one <em>outside </em>the Master and assign the resource pool, so this solved it – THANK YOU!!!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now I am leveling my resources and getting some unexpected results.&nbsp; Do you have a tutorial on leveling resources within a Master Project?&nbsp; This project is huge - 11 Phases with over 8,000 tasks
 so far, so being able to level accurately is important.</span></p>

            <p>Great, I'm glad you have sorted it out.&nbsp; I don't have a tutorial per se - but what issues are you seeing and what do you expect?&nbsp; A couple of things to bear in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resource leveling will not change the assignment or peak units for a resource so they are "optimized".</li><li>Resource leveling will only delay tasks to resolve resource overallocation.</li><li>Suggestion: level only one resource at a time and use a view like the Resource Usage over the Leveling Gantt so you can first understand why the resource is overallocation and then, be better able to understand what the leveling command has done.</li></ol>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

                    <p>Is this seriously supposed to be better?</p>
<p>After I unpinned all the "Metro Apps" and disabled search in the taskbar this is what I ended up with.</p>

            He means that the start menu cannot be resized as it could in the previous build. In the previous build if a user chooses to unpin all the metro apps from the start menu they can resize the width of the menu so it resembles the classic start menu. In the
 current build the menu width cannot be modified thus leaving a unnecessarily large menu background consuming the desktop

            I suspect he thinks that the items listed on the left of the Start Screen (or what you people jokingly try to CONVINCE us is a Start Screen) are live tiles that can be resized.&nbsp; I, of course, realize they are not tiles.&nbsp; HOWEVER, I want to TURN THAT GARBAGE
 OFF.&nbsp; How can we turn off the "Places" and "Recently Added"?&nbsp; I want my FULL Start Screen back.&nbsp; This is horrible.&nbsp; And the "All Apps"?&nbsp; What the heck is THAT?&nbsp; That's not the "All Apps" like we have in Windows 8.&nbsp; We have to scroll forever up and down now?&nbsp;
 How is that any different from the old Start Menu in Windows 7?&nbsp; Where's our jumplist?&nbsp; What drugs are you people on...or, rather, the fools who actually suggest you turn the Start Screen into this?

<p>ITS HIDEOUS, i mean really look at that start menu and tell me its not, seriously,<strong> this is bad</strong>
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d09eb1cc2-1747-4142-800e-aad137c3f8a5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is it so wide?</strong></p>
<p>in build 9879 if you removed the "tiles" it would shrink the start menu, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
in 9926 it stays big for no reason taking up space and looking ugly</span></p>
<p><strong>Why Cant i resize it?</strong></p>
<p>in build 9879 you could drag the edges, and resize it to be short and wide or tall and skinny,
<p><strong>where is My Music, My Documents, My Pictures?</strong></p>
<p>in 9879 you had the <em>OPTION</em> to have them on the start menu on the left side
<p><strong>Why cant i customize it</strong>?</p>
<p>in build 9879 you could add and remove items from the left row, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
in 9926 you cant</span></p>
<p>in build 9879 you could disable web results appearing when searching from the start menu,
in build 9879 (and all previous windows versions since 95) you could customize the settings of the start menu (see pic below),
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d597f9fce-dc54-445e-88de-5d169e8ef186" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>IM VERY seriously considering going back to 9879 until this is fixed, or a build without these problems is released, i REALLY hope this is just a BUG and not intentional, if it is intentional..</p>

            Halo Paul Moyer,<br />
<br />
I have modified my tags so that the tag list becomes:<br />
<br />
"ToDo P1 (Ctrl+1)"&nbsp; the icon: Yellow Check Box 1<br />
"ToDo P2 (Ctrl+2)"&nbsp; the icon: Blue Check Box 2<br />
"ToDo P3 (Ctrl+3)"&nbsp; the icon: Green Check Box 3<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
After I have attached the tags (using Ctrl+number) to various items in a table and I do not move to another page; I open Tag Summary pane; menu Home &gt; Find Tags.<br />
For the "Group tags by:" , I select "Tag name"<br />
For the&nbsp; "Search:"&nbsp; , I select "This page group"<br />
<br />
In the Tag Summary pane (NOT in the table on the page), the items are now grouped based on the 'priority' and only from this current page.<br />
You could try the other selections (options).<br />
<br />
In the Tag Summary pane:<br />
- if you click the item, OneNote will direct you to the item on the page.<br />
- if you click the check box, check box in the pane and the original one on the page will be toggled.<br />
<br />
Also, try check the option "Show only unchecked items" to see different result to the list in Tag Summary.<br />
<br />
<br />
NB:<br />
- I do not know whether or not there is an add-in for sorting items in a table based on the tags. However, I do not need such feature right now since my tags can be on different pages or even different notebooks.<br />
- I think, a more complex ToDo list would require a specific application; not OneNote.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oops, a secret mission :)&nbsp; I hope someday you think the number of icons are limited and make a request saying: "Let me add my customized icons to the tag icon-list"<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
.<br />

<h2>            Windows Insider Build 16299.309 Version 1709 - PROXY SERVER ISSUE - Get me Stable or Get me Out Please</h2>
                    <p>How do I get to a stable Windows 10 build and stay there or get out of the Windows 10 Insider Program without losing my files and data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to roll back to this build since I was not getting help with the proxy issue from the Insider Program. Many people have posted about this issue that was created a few months ago with a Windows build that would turn PROXY SERVER on and even with CAT5
 I cannot connect to the Internet. It will slow down the Internet connection and then freeze.
<strong>Updates cannot load</strong> because updates require rebooting. When I reboot the Proxy address populates automatically. I have removed it in REGEDIT. I have had Microsoft Windows Support help me remove it the same way. It comes back. I rolled my windows
 back to a previous build and was okay until today. It is now repopulating the proxy address again. I need help please. I want to STAY WITH A STABLE WINDOWS 10 OR GET OUT OF THE WINDOWS 10 INSIDER PROGRAM. I have no other option at this point since I cannot
 effectively get updates and work on my laptop without this interruption continuing to happen. I have to remove the proxy setting several times while working on the Internet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I must say this is very poor of Microsoft to do this. I have been a supporter of Microsoft products since the beginning of using computers. To not have support or even the kindness of a reply is horrible. I am quite disappointed with this type of treatment
 from any Microsoft product or service. I know we signed on to try the product and give feedback but this is horrible that when we get an issue there is no reply or help with the issue. We are just stuck complaining. Look at the feedback. It is horrible that
 there are no replies to problems people are having using Microsoft Windows.</p>

            The current release version of Windows is 16299.334. If you are on 16299.309 you are not even current to the RTM version of Win 10, much less an insider version. You seem to have an update issue, as well as the proxy issue. Maybe someone in the regular
 Windows 10 forum can help.

            I've been trying every Forum that I can reach. Like I said I had contacted Windows support and the Support Tech tried to help me get the proxy server out of there but it keeps repopulating. And then when I let him know it was from a Windows Insider build
 he said that Windows support could not help me and I needed to take it to a computer store and have it wiped and have Windows reinstalled. When you join Windows Insider they take your key and turn it to a digital key. So the only thing I could do was roll
 it back to a previous version of Windows and that's as far back as it could take me or where it took me. But it was stable at the time and so I was happy. But then I started getting updates and the proxy server populated again so I need someone from Windows
 Tech Support to help me get stable or someone from Windows Insider to hear this issue and help me to get stable because they're the ones that can do that.

<p>Ok, your current build was never an Insider build.&nbsp; On the last fall upgrade, Insiders ended at about 16299.1 and this became Public build.&nbsp; This public build has taken some Accumulative updates to about 16299.334.&nbsp; Like already stated, you are not even
 current with public build.&nbsp; In a few days, the spring update&nbsp; will be released to the public.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you tell Microsoft Support that you are running an Insider Build, then they are correct that they can offer no support.&nbsp; Your best bet is to go back to Microsoft Support and tell then what build you are running and let them decide what build it is.&nbsp;
 For sure, your build was never an Insider build.</p>

            Thank you for your reply. In 3 days my Insider updates will resume and I will be back in the problem again. I am still in need of help from Microsoft Windows 10 Insider Program. Once those updates resume and try to load the latest updates it will keep
 cycling back and forth telling me it had a problem installing the update. I caught a glimpse of the error message at one point but I am not absolutely sure if I got it right (SYSTEM EXIT OWNED MUTEX). I have not idea what that means. That is when I just did
 a recovery to roll back to a previous version and tried to stop the Insider updates. It only stalled it. I want to go to a stable Windows and stay there. So it may not seem that I am in the Windows 10 Insider Program but I did enroll and was getting updates
 of preview builds.&nbsp;

<p>I had a regular Windows update and it is now populating again the proxy address. I really need help with this issue. It has to stop. I am CAT5 connected. I do not have a proxy. This opens automatically and diverts to this proxy address. This can also be
 checked on the Windows 10 Insider Feedback page from many users complaining about this. It has been at least 6 months fighting this with no support.</p>

<p>Strange for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the build you are on,&nbsp; that is not an Insider build.&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, an Insider build is a beta buuild and more prone to bugs and issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say it is attempting a download, what is trying to download?&nbsp; If you indeed registered as an Insider, it should be trying to download 17133.1.&nbsp; If it still a public build, then it might be trying to 16299.334 (or close).. I have moved all of my
 public builds to 17133.1 using the latest Insider ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hard to say whether you have an issue contained with W10 itself or a setting within W10 that does not like your proxy settings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have a "working" PC, you might go to Microsoft and download the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; This should give you an ISO for the latest public build. and should be a later build than what you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you wait till Apr 10th (or close) the Media Creation Tool will be supplying 17133.xxx which is based on the latest&nbsp; Insider build that has been under test since last fall and is the continuation of what you are running right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said the above, you are still running a public build and not an Insider build.&nbsp; This little fact should entitle you to Microsoft support.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your issue can hardly be blamed on an Insider build if you are not running an Insider. build.&nbsp; It could be
 trying to download an Insider build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try disconnecting from the internet once the download has been completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and try to bug Microsoft on this one.&nbsp; Just quote your build #.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get this by running winver or under Settings, Update and the O/S Build.</p>

<p><span>MUTEX is a third party app that could be causing all your problems. To fix this type of problem you might need to do a clean Install so it will remove any Registry related problems by giving you no third party apps and no reference to them

<p>

<p>Thank you Sofspra &amp; Cal54. Great advice. I will try to wait until 10 April for the public build. That third party was from the Microsoft beta. I wish now I did not register with my new laptop. I did register with an old laptop that I was using but the charging
 port went out and I had to buy a new laptop. It was not a Windows 10 and had some crazy bugs in it but the Windows 10 totally fixed it. That is how long ago I have been a beta tester for Microsoft Windows. This was the pre-release of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this new laptop things were going fine until the Proxy Issue about 6 months ago. I think I was up to the build you mentioned that I could not get it to finish the update of the build due to the Internet disconnect. There reason I am on this crazy build
 is due to the recovery I did to get Windows stable on my own. But its loading the proxy again. The Microsoft tech support told me I had to do a clean reset of Windows and they could not do it. That will cost me money that I do not have. The Windows Insider
 has placed a digital key for Windows on my laptop so I am not sure if I can fix this without their help. I do have a recovery drive with Windows on it that came with this laptop.&nbsp; I can attempt to do that once I get my back up drive to save my files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather get the most updated Windows 10 possible and just remain there stable at this point. That is what I am hoping I can accomplish. I just did not know how. Because it seemed like I keep getting&nbsp; updates that load this proxy again and again.</p>

<p>I'd also appreciate knowing how to do this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Shunts is meaning files downloaded actually on the phone, not via a PC then to the phone... The download application must save them to some sort of temporary location prior to installing them...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone discovered this location?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing the web cache holds the sis files downloaded via the Web Browser, but navigating through that could take some time - unless you clear it before the download, and look straight away...</p>

            I too am in search of a method.I wanna save sis files downloaded from ovi.but i ve found a method will not be applicable to secure web pages such as ovi.but any how the way is,<br />
1.Save the page with download link.<br />
2.open y browser or x plore.<br />
3.go to c:/cache and there'll be a dozen of files.you have to find the correct html file of the page saved.<br />
4.copy it to memory card or an easy accessible folder and open it with text viewer.<br />
5.you'll find the download link ending with .sis or .sisx.Copy and paste the link to opera mobile or uc web and proceed download.<br />
This method is for download links with no security and that are shown only by the default browser.

            I found out this: my facebook application was corrupt,wanted to reinstall it from ovi store but the download button of store in my phone was not working for facebook. Tried accessing store via opera mobile/mini:result:not available.<br />
But with uc browser it is available. So i downloaded via uc and installed. I've got the .sis file as well.. Check it out, if you're in dearth need of .sis file.

<p>I am trying to find out the requirements specifically for 1080P video which aren’t listed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the simple answer is that it is no longer possibly to get 1080p with Skype. (I really hope someone can prove me wrong :)&nbsp; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>But at least Skype don't&nbsp;say it any&nbsp;more:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.skype.com/en/features/</span></a></p>
<p>Notis how it say HD=720P and not&nbsp;Full HD=1080P as&nbsp;they&nbsp;used&nbsp;to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a bit more in depth "explanation"&nbsp;se this threads:</p>

            Hello and thanks for your reply.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I know there is a recycling period and this is the reason I asked for your assistance. Besides, we are&nbsp;not talking&nbsp;about a Hotmail account. We are talking about a domain I never managed to fully&nbsp;set up.
<br />
<br />
Honestly, can't wait 30 or&nbsp;90 days. This task, like all tasks in our company,&nbsp;has a deadline which is the end of the week. All users have their&nbsp;Outlooks or WLMs&nbsp;ready and waiting for my signal to migrate.<br />
<br />
Please help. I'd appreciated it.<br />
Costas<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>PS: Please not that the user account I mentioned in the initial post exists two times (with two different passwords)&nbsp;and when I'm trying to log in it asks me to change the Live ID to something else.&nbsp;But&nbsp;this&nbsp;procedure doesn't work. It ends up to a continuous
 loop.&nbsp;<br />
</i><br />
<br />
<b>Update:</b> The domain has been freed and I managed to become an owner again. Please do something with the user account.

It's good to hear that you've managed to become the owner again. I have checked the domain and found out that the MX Record is invalid. Please correct it to complete your registration. For assistance, kindly check the solution article below:<br />

            Hi Marra and thanks for having the kindness to answer.<br />
<br />
I really I don't want to be rude, but I sometimes wonder how people can give such irrelevant answers.&nbsp;If you read the initial post, all I want from you is to see what is wrong with the user *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and fix it, in order for me to be able to import
 it or create it in my domain. I never asked for assistance regarding MX records and definitely I'm not going to change the MX record (ruining the current working situation) before my domain is fully set up and all my problems are solved. Common sense!<br />
<br />
I would really appreciated your to-the-point assistance.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I regret to inform you but you really have to wait for 30 days until you were able to reuse the said account. I suggests you create a new user account nearly same to the said account. You can add numbers or other characters for you to use it.

            What can I say? Who am I to argue with a Microsoft employee? You follow your own inflexible rules, repeating the same thing again again. I'm sure you didn't even bother to check the status of the user account mentioned at the first post.
<br />
<br />
But I'm telling you... I'll come back in 30 days and the account will still be blocked. Because
<b>IT IS NOT DELETED</b>. <b>It exists twice with two different passwords conflicting with itself.
</b>And if you don't delete both of them manually, they will be there forever.<br />
<br />
As for your suggestion, I'd propose you to dare and go to Steve Balmer and tell him that you accidentally blocked his email address and from now on he has to live with a slightly different one. If you are not fired, then I will do what you suggest.<br />
<br />
I'm really sorry for becoming rude, but as far as I can see you don't really care assisting me.

<h2>            Linking&#47;sharing calendar in Sharepoint Workspace 2010 with calendar in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone know of any mechanism where I can pass calendar information, either by individual meeting or by complete tool, between the Calendar tool in Sharepoint Workspaces (MSW) 2010 and Outlook 2010 without having to use a Sharepoint server?</p>
<p>I find it amazing that for an 'integrated office capability' such a simple thing isn't possible.</p>
<p>The reason for needing this is that MSW contains joint project/team calendars whilst outlook contains my personal calendar that I then link to my PDA. What I want is where a project/team calendar entry involve me that I can simply transfer it to my personal
 calendar without having to re-enter all the details (and vice versa).</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open my PDF files in Lumia 535</h2>
                    <p>I'm new in Windows Phone</p>
<p>I just bought a Lumia 535. Uploaded my PDF files on OneDrive to view it on my phone. Adobe reader says invalid PDF, PDF Reader says can't open file. I tried to open my files in onedrive on pc and it works. How can I make this to work? This feature is really
 helpful.</p>
