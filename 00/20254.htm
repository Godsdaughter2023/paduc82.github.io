<h2>            Outlook 2007 PST - Cannot expand the folder. The set of folders cannot be opened.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, a user is having difficulty opening a PST file when working remotely over VPN. This is on a Windows 7 x86 workstation using Outlook 2007. The PST file is located on a network share, but this is automatically mapped (and is accessible) before Outlook
 is opened on both the corporate network and VPN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When physically connected to our corporate network, Outlook opens fine and displays/expands the PST file as normal. Repeating the same excercise over VPN, the PST is listed but gives an error when we try to expand -
</p>
<p>'Cannot expand the folder. The set of folders cannot be opened. The file ***PST file path*** cannot be opened.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we try to open the data file (File &gt; Open &gt; Outlook Data File), we can see the PST in the network share, but receive the following error -
</p>
<p>"***PST filename***&nbsp;This file is currently not available for use on this computer.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>The rise of Occult symbols - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amylainhart  say:</h3>
<h2>            The rise of Occult symbols</h2>
                    I was viewing my Hotmail inbox and since I downloaded SkyDrive, I guess Outlook would be the next logical step. However, I believe that I am discerning and in their photo advertising Outlook there appears to be a family of sorts, to the right of these
 humans is most definitely Not a human, more like a monster with a birds beak. It was quite disturbing not only because that image to me is totally inappropriate for the product. Nottmention these occult images are becoming more and more prevalent. The only
 reason I am bringing this up is because it scared me. Why would Outlook use something like that??? I am bothered not enthralled.

    <title>Annual Reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> herb catania  say:</h3>
<h2>            Annual Reset</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to create a spreadsheet that will track an annual reset date (or month). &nbsp;In our office people pay a certain percentage per transaction until they reach a cap, after the cap they don't pay anything until the reset date. &nbsp;So far I've created
 the spreadsheet to include several columns, three of which are: Month (E), Amount Paid This Transaction (K), Remaining to Pay After This Transaction (L), with each row being a new transaction. &nbsp;Column K is dependent on Column L because the sum of Column K
 cannot be more than the cap amount until they have reset. &nbsp;Column L is dependent on what they've paid in previously, and also their reset date. &nbsp;The formula I have for Column K is&nbsp;=IF(L18&gt;0,IF(SUM((I19-J19)*0.3)&gt;L18,L18,SUM((I19-J19)*0.3)),0). &nbsp;Where I get
 into trouble is with the formula for Column L. &nbsp;Currently the formula I have is&nbsp;=IF(SUM(L18-K19)&gt;0,SUM(L18-K19),IF(SUM(L18-K19)&lt;0,0,SUM(L18-K19))); &nbsp;I'm having trouble associating it with the reset date since it only resets once a year. &nbsp;All of the solutions
 I've come up with tend to screw up the previous or subsequent rows. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Herb</div>

            Sure, thank you! &nbsp;I'm not sure if I can explain it well enough, but I'll try!
<div><br />
<div>So let's say A2 contains the reset date (2/1/10), A4 is the cap amount (1,000), column B contains the transaction dates of all subsequent transactions, column C contains the transaction price for all transactions, column D contains the commission paid,
 and column E contains the remaining commission to pay (based off the cap): &nbsp;
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97ddff70-1542-4a77-ae3d-673c212e1749" /></div>
<div>I'm hoping to find formulas for both column D &amp; column E. &nbsp;The formula for column D needs to calculate the commission paid based off 30% of the transaction price (column C), the remaining commission (column E), &amp; the reset date (A2); the formula for column
 E needs to calculate the remaining commission to be paid before reaching the cap, and is based on the cap amount (A4), previously paid commission amounts (column D) &amp; the reset date (A2).</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the above picture, the commission paid for the 1st transaction is 300 (D2=.3*C2). &nbsp;However, in the 2nd transaction, 30% of the transaction price would yield a higher amount than the remaining commission, so the commission paid ends up being 700 (D3=E2).
 &nbsp;Finally, in the 3rd transaction, the Transaction Date matches the Reset Date. &nbsp;The commission paid amount ends up being 450 (D4=.3*C4), since 30% is now less than the remaining commission as a result of the cap reset.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that clarifies my question a little bit better! &nbsp;I'm hoping to find formulas that I can copy throughout the entire column since the typical amount of transactions ranges in the hundreds.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your help!</div>

            <p>This solution is based on the following important assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the month and day of the reset date are important (not the year), and are the same for every year</li><li>The cap amount is the same every year</li><li>Transactions for each person are in a separate list</li><li>Transactions are in order by date, from oldest to newest</li></ul>
<p>If any of these assumptions is incorrect, we'll have to tweak the formulas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to add a "helper column" to check if the reset date has passed since the previous transaction.&nbsp; (the formula is sort of long and the result is used in the formulas for commission amount and remaining commission.)&nbsp; You could hide the column if you
 want, or roll the formula into the other two formulas.&nbsp; Here's what I ended up with:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69210e32-e9e8-4cfb-b2fa-d40bacb48d3e" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the formulas:</p>
<p>D2:&nbsp; =MIN(0.3*C2, IF(F2, $A$4, E1))</p>
<p>E2:&nbsp; =IF(OR(F2, NOT(ISNUMBER(E1))), $A$4, E1) - D2</p>
<p>F2:&nbsp; =AND(B1 &lt; DATE(YEAR(B2), MONTH($A$2), DAY($A$2)), B2 &gt;= DATE(YEAR(B2), MONTH($A$2), DAY($A$2)))</p>
<p>These formulas can be copied down for each transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is what you need.</p>

<p>This is a good question - Nokia Maps would not indeed seem to be available for the device. I'm guessing it's because it's non-touch Asha device and the screen orientation is different compared to e.g. Asha 303 (which supports Maps). On the other hand Maps
 is not mentioned on the device page either (<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/asha302/specifications/)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/asha302/specifications/).</a> Nokia Nearby however seems to be supported -
 it also provides some useful location based functionalities and there might be some other 3rd party map apps in e.g. Nokia Store, but I have not tried those, so can't comment if they are useful or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although my Asha 311 has Maps installed it is pretty useless as totally dependent upon network cell tower triangulation so widely inaccurate in rural areas; whereas older S40 devices such as my 3720 Classic allowed you to use additional Bluetooth GPS receiver
 this is no longer the case with latest S40 devices. There was a policy of removing Nokia Maps from firmware of devices without ability to use "Assisted GPS" and at some point this decision now seems to have been reversed perhaps led by marketing.</p>

    <title>upgrade office 2010 starter to office professional does change start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruw1  say:</h3>
<h2>            upgrade office 2010 starter to office professional does change start page</h2>
                    <p>I am working with a Dell Machine that originally had Windows 7 and Office 2010 Starter installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I paid for and installed the Windows 8 RTM upgrade. Prior to applying the upgrade, I applied KB2553141 (<font><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2553141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2553141</a>).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This gave me a working Windows 8 solution that was happy to run Excel and Word Starter. It was also happy to upgrade to a full edition of Office 2010 Professional (using the key that I have paid for).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So then I installed the Windows8.1 preview from the Windows Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have outlined in a separate thread, Word 2010 Starter is working perfectly, but Excel 2010 Starter is broken. (This needs to be fixed by the way)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So then I thought I'd try upgrading to the full version of Office 2010 professional. I did a custom install with Word and Excel both defined as install on first use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The install appeared to run succesfully to completion. However, I found the following problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Excel 2010 Starter and Word Excel Starter were still on the Apps List</p>
<p>(2) Excel 2010 Starter and Word Excel Starter were still on the start screen</p>
<p>(3) the Doc, DocX, XLS, and XLSx file extentions were still associated with the appropriate starter versions - not the full ones</p>
<p>(4) Excel 2010 (full) and Word 2010 (full) did not appear anywhere on the apps list or the Start Screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selecting the old starter icons, not surprisingly, tried to start the Starter version of the program and then failed with a Virtualisation error</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I navigated my way to winword.exe in the installation directory and manually kicked it off. It runs perfectly, after doing the "first use"install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I tried to pin it to the start screen and was given an error that nothing is associated with the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So then I went into control panel and manually associated *.doc with Winword.exe. To get this to work, I had to manually browse back to where I new it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally the apps list was updated, and I could pin things to the start screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are too many manual steps here. Even if we select "install on first use" all of the Office programs should appear on the apps list and start screen. The file association should also be updated. And when it uninstalls Starter, it should remove the icons
 (sorry TILES) from the apps list and start screen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, I should have been clearer in my write up. I didn't try to install two versions of Office side by side. I used the standard Microsoft Office function that comes with Office 2010 Starter that replaces starter with a full version. And I waited for
 it to run the uninstall of Click-to-run. So there shouldn't have been two versions there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, I have just reverted my test VM to the Windows 7 image. The behaviour exhibited with 8.1 preview is not the same. With my test I set everything to "Install on first use". The Start Menu had a new "Microsoft Office" "Folder" with each product as
 an option. Selecting Word cicked off the full install of word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, behaviour has changed. And its not for the better!</p>

            Although MS is advertising 2010 Starter to full 2010 as an "Upgrade", it is not an upgrade in the "traditional" sense.&nbsp; Up to Office 2010, an "upgrade" version of Office required you uninstall the "upgrade from" package.&nbsp; Starting with 2010, all copies
 of Office are full licenses, independent of previous installations.<br />
<br />
Plus, Office 2010 Starter is a "click to run" installation, similar to Office 365/2013, which means it is isolated from software installed directly in the Windows session.&nbsp; Therefore, when you are installing Office 2010 Pro, the installer does not recognize
 Starter as a copy of Office. It simply does not see it, so the installer does not try to uninstall nor does it suggest you uninstall it. The result will be a conflict between Office Pro and Starter for which is defined as the Windows Default File Association.&nbsp;
 When I was playing with Starter and a local install of Office 2010, I found that Starter would constantly "grab" the default, even after I manually assigned it to the local install.&nbsp; I found it very annoying.<br />
<br />
You will have to manually uninstall Starter if you no longer want it.&nbsp; You may want to keep it simply because you can create "Portable" copies of it on USB drives for use on other computers.<br />
<br />
If you keep both versions, you'll find you have to keep doing Office repairs or using "Regserver.exe" to reassign default to Office Pro (Word and Excel).<br />

Palcouk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please don't get hung up on the word 'upgrade'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Office 2010 Starter activated on the Machine, there is an Office function that allows you to continue using starter or 'replace' it with a full version. Replacing offers two alternatives - using an existing product key, or go online and buy a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows 7, when you use an existing key to 'replace' (or whatever word you choose) Starter with the full version, it does two things. The first is to install the full version. The second is to uninstall Office Starter (Word, Excel, and the Office maintenance
 function).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the full version install, even if you select "Run on first use", it adds each program in the suite to the start menu, and updates the file associations. I expect this behaviour to be implemented in 8.1. Each program in the suite should, at a minimum
 appear on the "All apps" page. And preferrably on the start page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the chained uninstall, the virtual Q drive is removed, the file associations are removed, and the short cuts are removed from the Start Menu. In 8.1 only the first step happens. There is no reason why the other two steps should be blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is behaviour that works like a thing of beauty and wonder in Windows 7 straight out of the box, not carried through?</p>

<p>Please read my more detailed rant to Palcouk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please don't get hung up on words like "upgrade", "replace", or "promote".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go into Office 2010 Starter in Windows 7 and tell it to replace Office Starter with a full version using an existing key, it does two things - install the full version (adding the relevant short cuts to the start menu and updating file associations);
 and chaining an uninstall of Office Starter (including removing short-cuts from the start menu and file associations). It behaves like a thing of wonder and beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try and do the same thing in Windows 8.1 it only does half the job, and leaves a complete mess. This is not useful behaviour. It should have worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that if you grab some office install media and try and do a side-by-side install, you deserve any mess that you are left with. Similarly if you cancelled the chained unintsall, you deserve what you get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, that isn't what I did. I did what anyone that had pulled their brand spanking new Windows 7 machine out of the box would do. I went into Starter and told it to replace itself with the full paid version that I had a key for.</p>

<h2>            Onenote on Android - not possible to create pages offline</h2>
                    <p>I use Onenote for several years on different devices and it was really helpful to me. I often use it to make a fast note with the badge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a few weeks/months I am not able to create a page when the device is in airplane mode or during a bad connection. It seems that an empty page has to be created and synced to onedrive before I am able to write some notes.</p>
<p>The same happens if I create a new note with the badge, it seems that the page is created in the background but the note is not saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it not possible to create and edit a page offline, the sync process could be done in the background or later if the device is connected again? This would be much more reliable and faster because you don't have to wait until the page is synchronized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making fast notes is a really essential function of Onenote on a smart phone and it should work reliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can reproduce this issue on a Sony Z1c, Sony Z3 and a Nexus 7, if you need additional information, please contact me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I need some data from my emails which are older than 2 years .&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to outlook, and it normally had saved offline only the data from the last 12 months -- after that i clicked to search on the exchange server, which only shows data from an additional 12 months. other than that, there are no other mails to be found.</p>
<p>Where is my mail !?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't aware that emails are deleted - and what is very worrying, is the fact it is done without any notice.</p>
<p>Please let me know how to find my older emails, as i <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">must

<p>Hi Petrit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you, we need to validate if those old emails are still in your account because Outlook didn't delete emails automatically. Do you access your account online through Outlook.com or do you use the Outlook app on your computer? Also,
 have you tried archiving those old emails in your account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using an Outlook app, we suggest that you change the<strong> Mail to keep offline
</strong>setting to show all emails in your account offline. To do that, kindly perform the following steps:</p>

            Hi PGregory_166,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />One way to get rid of the blue bar is going to the View Tab &gt; Change View &gt; Select Single.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<p>Sorry, this answer is incorrect as that little blue bar/vertical icon displays on the far left of each line in EVERY view, compact, preview, AND single, and there seems to be no selection&nbsp; anywhere to disable it or turn it off.&nbsp; It only goes away if the

One way to get rid of the blue bar is going to the View Tab &gt; Change View &gt; Select Single.

<p>The only options under Change View are Manage Views...,</p>
<p>Save Current View..., and Apply Current View to Other...</p>

<p>Sorry, this answer is incorrect as that little blue bar/vertical icon displays on the far left of each line in EVERY view, compact, preview, AND single, and there seems to be no selection&nbsp; anywhere to disable it or turn it off.&nbsp; It only goes away if the
 blue icon is clicked or the message is opened, then it will change to a grey box that appears if you hover over the message line.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly - Microsoft keeps changing the playing field and leaves us to fend for ourselves as far as "features" like this. This time around it looks like the Microsoft lemmings decided that a blue bar was absolutely necessary to remind the to
 read their damn email. It's pathetic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The least they could do would be to have someone respond in "answers.microsoft.com" that actually knew what they were talking about. Surely they could devote some staff time to this .&nbsp;</p>

    <title>File name upon opening a file from Onedrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phillippledger  say:</h3>
<h2>            File name upon opening a file from Onedrive</h2>
                    Why does Word re-name a previously saved file? A file such as "Delivery Schedule" changes to something like "Wd0000003". This means I also have to find the original directory every time I modify and save a previously saved file.

            <p>Good morning, John,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using OneDrive with Microsoft 365 Home Premium on the host computer. When I open an existing document for edit in Word, the filename changes from what I named it to a computer-generated name such as wd000003 (or the like). It happens to every file I
 open in Word. So, when I go to save the now edited document, I have to rename the file and re-locate the directory I previously used. I doesn't seem to happen in Excel (and I haven't tried other programs yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for your help.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Clark,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the computer before this issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try running Internet Explorer from its original location: C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\Iexplore.exe? If yes, do you still receive the same message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 anti-virus software is currently running on your computer? Is it up-to-date with its latest updates and virus definitions?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The "Temporary Internet Files" folder is moved to a location outside the User folder hierarchy. For example, the "Temporary Internet Files" folder
 is moved to another volume. </span></li><li><span>The Phishing Filter is enabled.</span></li><li><span>Protected mode is enabled.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this case, the "Temporary Internet Files" folder has insufficient permissions in its new location. Therefore, the Phishing Filter cannot start.
 When this problem occurs, Internet Explorer cannot start, and the <span>
File Download – Security Warning</span> dialog box opens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Test the issue in Safe mode with networking</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform a clean startup and then check the issue</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn’t appear in Safe mode, then try performing clean boot. A clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Visit the link
 below to know how to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Once the troubleshooting is over, reset
 the computer to start as usual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3<span>: Move the "Temporary Internet Files" folder back to its original location</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, type Internet Options in the Start Search box, and then click Internet Options in the Programs list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the General tab, click Settings in the Browsing History area.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Move Folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the ‘[Please select a folder to which you can add items’ navigation pane, locate the following folder:</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Users\User_Account_Name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 OK two times.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you receive the following message, click ‘Yes’:</span></p>
<p><span>Windows will now log you off to finish moving Temporary Internet Files. Do you want to continue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Log
 on to Windows again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4: Grant permissions to the "Temporary Internet Files" folder</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, type Internet Options in the Start Search box, and then click Internet Options in the Programs list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the General tab, click Settings in the Browsing History area.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 View Files. The "Temporary Internet Files" folder opens.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Windows Explorer address box, click the folder name that comes before Temporary Internet Files.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Organize, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the Security tab, click Edit.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Group or user names box, click the name of the affected user. If the name of the affected user is not listed, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Add.</span></p>
<p><span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Enter the object names to select box, type the name of the affected user, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>j.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Group or user names box, click the name of the affected user.</span></p>
<p><span><span>k.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Permissions for User_Name box, click to select the Full Control check box under the Allow column.</span></p>
<p><span><span>l.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Apply, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>m.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Close
 Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>n.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 OK two times.</span></p>
<p><span><span>o.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Start
 Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 5: Perform an online virus scan from Safe mode with Networking</span></strong></p>

                    <p>Outlook Calendar List view does not display all of the appintments on my calendar. They are there in Calendar view, but are missing in List view. Usually these are appointments I have accepted from others outside of my organization. But some are reoccuring
 appointments I have created for myself. All are recurring appointments. List View settings does not have a filter applied. I can't see any&nbsp;setting or&nbsp;properties&nbsp;in the appointments that I would consider unusual.

    <title>Microsoft failed to create Timer or Stopwatch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wildfactor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft failed to create Timer or Stopwatch</h2>
                    <p>For those interested in any Windows 8 phone, you are going to love the operating system overall.<br />
However, Microsoft failed to create a very important app that is in all other operating systems including</p>
<p>Android and Apple products. THERE IS NO TIMER OR COUNTDOWN CLOCK. You must download a third&nbsp;party app and most fail to work properly. There is currently only one app that will work when it's not in&nbsp;the background and it even fails to create a vibration or
 loud enough sound. Not sure if they're afraid of getting sued or something but this is probably the stupidest thing I've seen from software developers in a while. A timer is used by everyone I know, daily and the fact that they didn't bother to include it
 in their "Alarm" or "Clock"&nbsp;app is just silly. Extremely frustrating. Good job Microsoft on letting down another community and&nbsp;for this reason alone I'm considering switching to an Android product.</p>
<p><br />
Oh, and not to mention, if you have a local playlist on your computer and you wish to sync to your phone you can easily do this. But if you wish to change or re sync that playlist later, good luck. You will have to delete the playlist and re sync it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
NICE JOB SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS... Not</p>

<p>There is an article here, it is for older versions, but it might work for you.</p>

<h2>            One Note Issues on 2018 Ipad Pro</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issues below relate to functionality of OneNote on the Ipad this is affecting my experience as a user of One Note. In scanning the forums some the issues have been asked by other users and no resolution has been
 reached. Please escalate these issues to help get these features into requested.</span></p>
<p>Issue #1:</p>
<p><span>Insuffient Apple pencil 2 compatiblity: The second generation of Apple pencil 2 enables user to double tap the pencil to switch between the eraser and the current tool. The feature works very well in other notes app,
 but it doesn't work in Onenote for ipad.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Problems to the user of software: User has to select the menu item eraser back to switch back&nbsp;</span>Issue #2:</p>
<p>No capability to change color and subscript of fonts in One Note for the Ipad</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue #3:</p>
<p>Insufficient Apple pencil 2 compatiblity: After region selecting area I copy in order to paste I need to select the text tool rather than being able to directly paste with a tap of the Pencil 2 on the Ipad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue #4: No ink to text feature available on Ipad one note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise how these issues can be prioritized so OneNote on the Ipad can provide the user with same benefits as found on the PC and Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Dear Madhur,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />There is a big gap between functionality for OneNote on different platforms. So you will find more options and functionality in Windows than in IOS.
<br />
<br />If you want to provide your feedback about this, it is better to do it here <a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327180-onenote-for-ipad-iphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327180-one...</a> as developers are not attending this forum.

<p>Thank you! I did try something. The AMD driver was 1 that update from Windows update&nbsp; (I believe that is the driver for build 10122). None of these device get wrong, I somehow fixed that, but not sure how:</p>
<p>- Try lastest driver (for win 8.1 ofcourse) from AMD site.</p>
<p>- Install the all in one environment (with lot of C ++ version).</p>
<p>- Add more memory to pagefile.sys.</p>
<p>And it did work. It should be marked as solved now. </p>

                    <p>I keep getting this popup at the bottom of my browser (IE11 on Windows 10). Unfortunately, there are only two options: Allow and Allow for all websites. There should be a 3rd option that says&nbsp;Never allow. Is there a way to prevent this annoying popup? And
 generally all such popups from Microsoft as well as script error messages?</p>

            Microsoft is expecting all of their users to be technicians. I will be 70 years old in November and should not have to go through all then steps that have been identified for this issue.&nbsp; I have just ordered my MacBook Air and have gone over to the dark

<p>I used to click on don't allow. I now click on allow. I've seen no difference. I suspect that the dialog is caused by some minor JavaScript or other scripting&nbsp;error on the website.</p>

            Thanks, Don. There are many posts on the thread (and many threads), and some provide steps to resolve this scenario that I feel a user should never have to go through. And this is not the only issue that users have brought up over the past few years. Unfortunately,
 some of the Windows updates cause other programs that were previously working correctly&nbsp;to start malfunctioning. It is just tiresome.

    <title>Word won&#39;t open on mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word won&#39;t open on mac</h2>
                    Please help!&nbsp; Suddenly Microsoft word will not open on my Macbook Pro. All over Microsoft apps will open without problems, but when I click to open word it just bounces as if its trying to open for a few minutes then stops bouncing. If I right click it
 says "Application not responding" and will only allow me to force quit. I have updated my Mac, my Microsoft apps are all up to date and I have restarted my computer. If I force quit and attempt to restart the same thing happens. Thanks.&nbsp;

            Hi All,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the inconvenience it caused. Recently we got some user reports saying that Word 16.11 bounces in Dock and cannot launch.&nbsp;<br />
The issue has already been reported to relevant team and you can subscribe to the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_mac-mso_mac2016/unable-to-open-word-version-1611-el-capitan-10116/91d27504-72fe-45d0-8c13-16dc56834ea7">
<strong>primary thread</strong> </a>to receive the latest information.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<p>Meanwhile, some users post back that the issue can be fixed on their side by:</p>
<p>a. Switch on/off Wifi</p>
<p>1. Quit Word (File &gt; Quit), or Force Quit, or go to activity monitor, shut down Word process.</p>
<p>&nbsp; *You can even restart Mac to make sure Word is not running in the backend.<br />
2. Turn off Wifi<br />
3. Open Word<br />
4. Turn Wifi back on</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Completely uninstalling and reinstalling Office programs. You may give it a shot by referring to the articles below:</p>
