<h2>            PC crashes and changes BIOS boot options.</h2>
                    <p>I have had my PC for about 5 years, and it just started some of its first reoccurring erratic behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems now that, at random, the PC will freeze and flash the blue screen then shut down. It does it so fast that I can never see the error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to boot it backup, it loads to a random boot drive, and prints the "No configuration file found." message across the top of the screen and sits with "boot:"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked the bios it somehow changed all my boot settings, so it was booting to my dvd rom. I changed it all back it worked perfectly fine. Until today, when it happened again, and refused to select the hard drive till I got rid of the other boot options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My motherboard is a Gigabyte, not sure what model it is, since this thing is a hand-me-down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if it could be a hard drive problem either, it is old, but so far the hard drive hasn't had any data loss or other issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it might be some kind of fast boot issue. I turned it off back on Windows 7 because my pc would experience freezes and crashes before. I went a head and re disabled it, but I want to know your thoughts though because it could be a while before I
 see it happen again.</p>

<p>Hi Helenkeller,</p>
<p>1) Did you make any recent changes on the computer?<br />
2) Since when are you afcing this issue?<br />
3) Who is the manufacturer of your computer?</p>
<p>It's a program installed from HP. It shouldn't affect your computer so I would suggest you to ignore it by closing the program.</p>
<p>Perform clean boot and check if you have the issue.</p>
<p>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>Reset the computer to start as usual</p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
1.Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2.On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3.When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7 :
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it continues to pop up, open up the programs list and uninstall/reinstall the&nbsp;software and check if issue persists</p>

    <title>Backup to Homegroup Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim wolfe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup to Homegroup Drive</h2>
                    I have a home desktop and a laptop.&nbsp; The desktop is using Win 10 pro and has a couple external drives. The laptop is using Win10 home. I'm trying to setup backup of the laptop to one of the drives attached to the desktop.&nbsp; I've setup the homegroup network
 and verified that both computers can see the shared libraries of each other.&nbsp; I've also verified that the attached drive I'm trying to use is set up for sharing.&nbsp; When I try to setup a backup from my laptop, I can see the desktop and the attached drive I want.&nbsp;
 My confusion is that I'm being asked for a login ID and password.&nbsp; Which login and password am I supposed to provide?&nbsp; That of the laptop? the desktop?&nbsp; Since I'm using my Microsoft account for verification of my laptop, should I use that?&nbsp; So far, I haven't
 gotten any combination of the above to work.

            I don't think RaviDixit's answer applied.&nbsp; When I'm on the desktop, I have no problem seeing the attached drives.&nbsp; I can also set them up for sharing.&nbsp; When I'm on the laptop, I can see my desktop in the workgroup, and can see the libraries, but not any
 of the drives (including the C: drive).&nbsp; Further, I can't see the attached drives when I try to set up backups and indicate that I want to use the desktop, I'm asked for a&nbsp; userid and password (see screenshot).<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/959a2b95-28c9-43e1-9da1-c40a8f7f7919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/959a2b95-28c9-43e1-9da1-c40a8f7f7919" /></a>

            I told you I would talk to you soon while you <span style="font-style: italic">
try</span> these things.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
How did that Safe Mode and Clean boot work for you?&nbsp; Not at all helpful?<br />
<br />
You reported this issue 2 weeks ago?!<br />
<br />
Again, I am cracked up by this place and the time and effort wasted because the MS Answers forums prompts for no system information when a new question is asked - but, I digress.<br />
<br />
Security Update 908513 is included in the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Service Pack 3 update</a>.<br />
<br />
Since the MS Answers forums prompts for no system information when a new question is asked, we don't even know what Service Pack you have.&nbsp; If you have SP3, you already have the update.&nbsp; Two weeks in and we don't know what your Service Pack is, what your antivirus/antimalware
 environment is...&nbsp; We know you have XP Pro 32 bit though.<br />
<br />
What you are likely to have is a malfunctioning Explorer Shell extension, and you can usually figure it out as follows:<br />
<br />
When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.&nbsp; If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and
 then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can really make it happen almost every time you right click and choose something like Delete or Copy, you are well on your way to figuring it out.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView, under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move the Microsoft column closer
 to the top so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header for <span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft</span> to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.<br />
<br />
The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding errors with the extension and what other people have done about it...&nbsp; maybe just get an update for the program that added the suspicious extension.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(you have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on)<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again.&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the condition.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the error and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you find the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be sure the
 problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to get it to work by setting the Compatibility Mode of "SETUP" on the installation CD to Win 7 or possibly XP SP2 or 3 depending on how new the model is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It probably has more features than anything you will download...mine turned out that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>To find setup on the CD, select Open or Explore instead of just running it.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Then right click on SETUP and select Properties...Compatibility Tab is at the top.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Part way down is a Compatibility Mode check box and a drop down option list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I used XP SP3 with a X5340 and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>IMPORTANT...</p>
<p>If you have previously tried to install the printer, REMOVE it from your system in Devices and Printers before uninstalling and reinstalling the software.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding: helping&nbsp;your&nbsp;Lexmark printer work&nbsp;with Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;-</p>
<p>and &nbsp;with&nbsp;your recommendation to:</p>
<p><em><strong>To find setup on the&nbsp;&nbsp;CD, select Open or Explore instead of just running it.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Then right click on SETUP and select Properties...Compatibility Tab is at the top.</em><em>　</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Part way down is a Compatibility Mode check box and a drop down option list.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Lexmark Platinum Pro 905.</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>Set the 'compatibility mode to Windows7' and 'BINGO!'</p>
<p>Works like a charm now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is after contacting Lexmark customer support&nbsp;(1/2 a dozen times),</p>
<p>and Lexmark "offering support" to the tune of $119.!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sites and Forums like this are a God send and a money saver.</p>

 I tried clicking and dragging the file to the trash bin, but it says it's only dragging a copy to the trash bin.&nbsp; Why isn't this a simple task??

<h2>            Silverlight is not working for LEGO Program</h2>
                    I installed the program for LEGO Mindstorms, but I can't get it to open. The Tech support guy over at LEGO has been working with me, and we have determined that the issue is a Silverlight issue. I have removed and reinstalled Silverlight multiple times
 with no better result. I have used this https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2608523/how-to-clean-a-corrupted-silverlight-installation-and-then-reinstall-s multiple times and each time it says that Silverlight is corrupt, removes it and is unable to reinstall
 it. Then I reinstall it from the Microsoft website with the same result. I have also tried this without any success too:

    <title>Windows 10 Failed Installation - reboot cycle &#40;Upgrade from Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Failed Installation - reboot cycle &#40;Upgrade from Win7 x64&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Forums and hopefully a MS Tech. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Saturday 8/8/15 my perfectly functioning Windows 7 Ultimate (x64) desktop received the notification to upgrade to Windows 10! &nbsp;Excitedly, I started the download and began installing the new OS. &nbsp;Everything was running smoothly, and I went to a movie while
 the system was updating. &nbsp;When I returned (expecting a windows 10 installation prompt), the OS was Win7, and the installation said failure. &nbsp;Blaming my absence, I tried to upgrade once again, and waited for the files to download and the installation to continue.
 &nbsp;Everything appeared to be on track (as before) with installation % to complete counting up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point the PC restarted when it went through the standard boot, then picture the Win10 splash screen, before a window frame popped up, followed by a black screen informing me that the installation failed, and that my prior operating system was being
 restored... after a few minutes, the system would reset and begin again... ENDLESSLY. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wiped the drive and started with a fresh Windows 7 install. &nbsp;After going through some updates to make the PC functional (only necessary windows updates and what not). &nbsp;I've decided to try a clean install using downloadable MediaCreationTool(x64).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to "upgrade this pc", it fails to install. &nbsp;When I created the bootable USB drive, the tool reported success, but the computer fails to boot from the drive (no idea why). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm using the tool for the 3rd time, attempting to DL the ISO file (which has already failed once with no explanation). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice, or should I just work to update my windows 7 device again? &nbsp;MS employees, do you have a suggestion how I can upgrade to win10 the easiest? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a form I've seen before, so I'm providing answers in advance (with the hopes that this will expedite an answer).</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>I would like to know few more details on the below questions to understand the issue better.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Did you try to upgrade to Windows 10 via Windows Update or an Installation Media? - Via Windows Update (which lead to the boot loop), then by Installation Media as described above (which didn't really result in a successful win10
 installation process.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Do you see any message during the entire up gradation process if it has failed any where?</span></p>
<p><span>The first attempt (which reverted to win 7) - I only saw a message that it had failed (I didn't note an reason code, but it may have been present).</span></p>
<p><span>The second attempt (which was stuck in the boot loop) had no errors, and I had to reinstall win7 from my disc.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Are you able to access the desktop by any chance?</span></p>
<p><span>No.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently installing windows 10 pro, from an ISO, but I've been prompted for a Windows activation Key which I don't have since I was really just trying to upgrade from Windows 7, and was never asked. &nbsp;Neither my Win7 key nor one I found online
 works.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know where I can get a key, or have any other suggestions should this fail?<br />

            <p>Hello Parth,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this last night, but I don't see it this morning. &nbsp;I apologize if it appears in duplicate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to successfully install Windows10 thanks to the ISO I created and burned onto a DVD! &nbsp;I found success after wiping &amp; reformatting the drive and starting with a clean install. &nbsp;Success! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now windows will not let me customize some options, and is regularly asking me to "Activate Windows" with a product key. &nbsp;Unfortunately, my win7 ultimate key doesn't work, and it appears that I need a new one, despite being a part of the free update
 program.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since I had to wipe my drive, no remnant of that key exists on my PC. &nbsp;I'm hoping that it's attached to my Microsoft Account somewhere. &nbsp;Is there any way that you could help me find it so I can Activate Windows? &nbsp;I can provide my Win7 key (privately) if necessary.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>deck rob,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the late reply to your post and can i confirm that you still require assistance with the problems that you are having with:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>0x807a1007</strong> -&nbsp;<span>This may mean that the Internet connection between your Xbox console and the other party members is failing. This is usually caused by a connectivity issue between you and the host. Occasionally, it indicates a
 conflict in the NAT type used by you and the host.</span></span> </li><li><strong>0x807a1011</strong> - There is not topic in relation to this error code, sorry about that. (Can you confirm
<strong>0x807a1011</strong> is the correct error code you are receiving from your Xbox One console?)
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;For error code <strong>0x807a1007&nbsp;</strong>there are two solutions that you can try.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1: Try to join the part again&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />
This error can be caused by temporary network issues, so just trying to join party again will often work.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2: Try the network troubleshooting wizard<br />
</strong>To troubleshoot, you and the others trying to join the party should try the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Multiplayer Game Solution.</a></p>
<p>Please try this solutions and see if they help you getting back to normal, if not please do post back here.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I also wanted to mention that this sometimes happens. &nbsp;What you can try is to press the Guide button when the Party App is Snapped to the side. &nbsp;When you are at the Home screen highlight the Party App and press the Start button then choose Quit.</p>
<p>If that doesn't solve the issue so you can join the party easily you will need to power cycle your console by holding the power button on it for 10 seconds until it shuts down.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these methods:  
<br />Method  1: Update the driver through Device Manager
<br />
<br />Follow these steps：
<br />
<br />1) In Device Manager, right-click on the Qualcomm Atheros Wireless Network Adapter and select Update Driver Software….(The specific device name will vary according to the device model.)
<br />
<br />2) In the pop-up window, you will see two options. Click the first option Search automatically for updated driver software.  Then Windows will find and install drivers for the wireless adapters automatically.
<br />If you can’t update the driver successfully using Method 1, move on and try other methods.
<br />
<br />
<br />Way 2: Download and install the driver from manufacturer
<br />
<br />Since Atheros doesn’t produce drivers themselves,  you can go to your PC manufacturer’s website to check for and download the latest driver. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system that you are using (Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 10 64-bit). Usually, the downloaded driver will be in executable format (.exe). You can install the driver by just double-clicking on the executable file and follow the on-screen instructions.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Cables and their connectors can go bad.<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver&nbsp;:<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of&nbsp;NIC - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on&nbsp;NIC<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device<br />
maker (such a RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

    <title>New UI is inexcusably terrible. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterchase1  say:</h3>
<h2>            New UI is inexcusably terrible.</h2>
                    <p>This update is such hot trash.&nbsp; I used to have all the info and functionality I needed on the left side bar, now it's basically a useless waste of space as I have to sift through a bunch of poorly designed pop up menus that prevent me from doing anything
 else while they're open.&nbsp; Doing this same thing I used to takes more time, more clicks, all while eating more system resources.&nbsp; And for what?&nbsp; What did I gain from this update?&nbsp; What was so awful about the "old" skype that this steaming garbage needed to
 be rolled out?&nbsp; And why are more resources being used?&nbsp; The app does the same thing it's done for the past 13 years, but now significantly worse, so why is it slower?&nbsp; That's a rhetorical question, it's because of terrible programming, just as terrible as
 the UI design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I'm abroad right now and Skype is my only way to make international calls.&nbsp; I cannot wait until I use my credit up and never have to look at this trash again.</p>

<p>Agree.&nbsp; This is still a VERY POOR PRODUCT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone at MS PLEASE GET THEIR HEAD OUT OF THEIR BEHIND and listen to your users.&nbsp; No one wants this steaming pile of **** on their computer.&nbsp; It makes existing things harder to do, and removes useful functionality while adding NOTHING NEW.</p>

            It would be interesting if an insider would write an article or book about how Microsoft bungled Skype. Case study on how to acquire a successful company &amp; product, and kill it.

<p>Edge is always updated. That site you visited said your browser is outdated. That means that Edge is not recognized because is too advanced for the out of date site. Use another browser--Chrome or even IE--at that site. You can have several browsers installed.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Snuck in a Windows 10 Upgrade By Placing An Optional Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lg_mda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Snuck in a Windows 10 Upgrade By Placing An Optional Update With The Box Checked</h2>
                    <p>Normally Important update boxes are pre-checked and Optional update boxes are not. So I do not look at the optional updates until I have completed the available Important updates. But this time as soon as I started the updates, Windows 10 started updating.
 It did not even have to download as I have since found out that Microsoft did that by sneaking it in as Win 7 update KB3035583. As soon as I realized it was updating I canceled the update. My contact tracking database software is not yet compatible with Win
 10 or Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to stop the update, but now every time I install new updates I get the Windows 10 updating messages, until the updates are completed. I just have to cross my fingers and hope this time is not the time Windows 10 actually updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since uninstalled KG3035583, but have been unable to restore Windows Updates to show the actual updates being download and installed, I still get the Windows 10 update messages until done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Googled until my fingers are blistered and have called Microsoft until my ear is now cauliflowered. If anyone knows how to help me with this issue, please do. Thanks in advance...</p>
<p>

                    <p>Original Title: Unsigned Wacom drivers or Other problem.</p>
<p>I Finally replaced the HDD in my SOny Vaio FW-490J to the Seagate Momentus 750gb HDD but bran into many issues along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, after getting thing into a decent run manner I proceeded to instal my bamboo fun tablet. the problem though is that when I go to install the official software windows says the driver is unsigned and I kow that is not the case. This also hapened
 with my Oyen Digital USB 3.0 expresscard, in one of my earlier failed attempts at cloning my HDD, though this time I instaled it first on my origanall HDD before cloning and swapping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What have I missed, how can this be rectfied? Any help would be greatly appreciated. oof</p>

<p>Hi Jairo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about this issue with receiving V-Bucks bought from the Fortnite store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought V-Bucks from the in game store on your Xbox, then more than likely you purchased it from the Microsoft Store using your account credit, although it is Epic Games responsibility to distribute your V-Bucks into your in-game wallet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked your order history to see if the transaction was completed? <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders">
