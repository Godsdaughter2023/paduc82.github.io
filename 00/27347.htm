<h2>            When replying to an e-mail I can&#39;t change font or color of type or use any of those controls.</h2>
                    When I am replying to an e-mail and I want to change the font or change the color of the type or use bold face, etc. none of those controls works.

<h2>            Start Menu Customization</h2>
                    <p>The freeware Classic Shell program allows multiple choices so far as start menu configuration and appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Up until build 9879 the Classic Shell program and seemed to function perfectly.&nbsp; With build 9879 Classic Shell will not longer install and, beyond
 that, it seems that Microsoft has even further reduced the ability of the user to customize the start menu as he/she sees fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I don't use Apps and do not care for the Metro-style interface at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use my computer purely as a desktop machine and am perturbed by Microsoft trying to force-feed Apps and Metro to folks like me that will never use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Classic Shell was able to allow
 me to run the latest windows and also have a satisfactory start menu.&nbsp; Can not Microsoft at least do as well in coming builds of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did not the near total rejection of Windows 8 teach Microsoft a valuable lesson about desktop users?</p>

<h2>            Chat app on nokia asha 300</h2>
                    
<p>The chat app on my nokia 300 only allows me to use ovi chat. I'm pretty sure it should be able to use other services such as google talk (the one I want to use) It even mentions them in 'help' but there doesn't seem to be an option to 'select services' as
 suggested in the help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything to be done about this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, I'm not sure if this helps with a solution but the phone is running software V 07.57.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem seems to be that the first screen shown when I open the app doesn't give options to register accounts for any services other than Ovi chat. This can't be right since there is even a picture on the box the phone came in showing options for various
 srevices. Also, the in-app help says to go Options &gt; More &gt; Select services, but when I go Options &gt; More, the only choice is 'Settings' ...</p>

<h2>            How do I recover an Office 2010 product key after virus removal was botched by Tiger Direct&#63;</h2>
                    I took my computer to a local retailer after I got a virus and a continual loop restart. Anyway, I did not have a back up of the most recent events, but I did have "back-up discs" created about 2 months earlier.&nbsp; When I picked up my computer 2 days later,
 I found that it had been restored to its factory setting with NONE of my files recovered. When questioned, they simply apologized and refunded the fee. I cried for days. A friend of my husbands found that my files were in the hard drive somewhere and said
 that he thought they had just restored it by creating a new account profile. He was able to recover some picture files and email, but now for the last few weeks, I have been getting a message that the product activation has failed. I believe they installed
 the trial version and I cannot find the product activation code from the discs. I purchased a 3 user Microsoft Office 2010 Professional and I have a copy installed on my son's laptop which he describes as "on life support" and

            You are in good shape. You can use any of the following tools to extract the product key from your son's computer<br />
<br />
You can re-install on the same computer using the same product key. The activation system is supposed to recognize that you are simply re-installing Office on the same hardware.<br />
<br />
If you want to "transfer" an installation, it is a license requirement that office no longer be usable on the "from" computer. Either uninstall it from the old computer, or permanently retire (trash) the old computer.<br />

<span>Tools to Extract Product Key</span>
<p><a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/how-recover-your-lost-windows-7-or-windows-8-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.7tutorials.com/how-recover-your-lost-windows-7-or-windows-8-product-key</span></a>
</p>
<p><span>You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from you computer. These tools report on many installed programs on your computer, not just Office.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>PS</span></b><span>: you should keep a copy (printed and/or file copies on external storage devices) of the report(s) generated by these tools so you have
 all of your product keys / registration numbers available for future re-installs</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>FYI</span></b><span>: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem.
 The underlying mechanics of Windows 8 are essentially the same as Windows 7 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>Your original package or purchase confirmation e-mail</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>Online download account</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>You can extract the Product Key from the machine itself</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>Image copy backups of system with Office installed</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>Activation backup utilities</span></p>
<p>From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called
<b>TOKENS.DAT</b> to store encrypted product activation keys:</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\Tokens.DAT
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareLicensing\Tokens.data<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>C:\Windows.Old\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\Tokens.DAT (if you did an in-place Windows Upgrade)<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: OEM (factory install and activated) licenses use a different key than the one reported.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only the factory can use the PK from the original factory activation. You would have been provided with a separate piece of paper with a Product key for reactivation.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p>ProduKey may be able to extract product key information from a registry file saved externally. This is useful if you’re trying to get the key details from the backup of a now defunct machine. Try the /Regfile
 option.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>After installing on my system, I ran the program --&gt; AS ADMINISTRATOR &lt;-- and then clicked on File --&gt; Select Source. Once in this menu it may appear a little overwhelming, don't worry it's not that complicated
 and your not going to break anything else. Select the circle next to "Load the product keys from external Software Registry hive". Now from here you may have to browse to a slightly different location depending on where your windows.old folder is located,
 but you want to basically browse to the following and open this file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Windows.old\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\SOFTWARE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After opening this file select ok; you may have to wait a few minutes for it to load the hive and give you your keys, but if they're there you should see them and be able to fresh install your MS Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that this did work for my Office 2007, it also gave me my Vista Home &amp; Personal Key, and Internet Explorer... lol! I hope this helps someone else too! And remember backup before you do any upgrading/downgrading/or
 destruction to you PC.</p>

<h2>            Unlink OneDrive Personal from Connected Services in Office 365</h2>
                    I have installed Office 365 on another PC, and logged in. However, this automatically also links to my OneDrive in Connected Services (without button/option to remove or unlink). I do not want my personal OneDrive to be accessible on this other PC, as
 other people have access to it. So, my question is simple: how can I stay logged in to Office 365, yet logged out of my OneDrive?

<h2>            Integration Skype with SuccessFactors Learning</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to asking about integration between SuccessFactors learning and Skype for Business.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(56, 56, 56, 1)">One of SuccessFactors Learning feature is capability to adopt virtual learning system from third party vendor such as Skype for Business.</span></p>
<p>On SuccessFactors Learning, the Instructor is the meeting host on Virtual Meeting Side (using Skype for Business).&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When an Instructor is created in the LMS, the VLS API communicates with the Virtual Meeting
 Server (Webex or Adobe Connect or Skype/Lync) and creates an account there.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In order to synchronize (or create) an LMS instructor account with a VLS Server account we require that the first name,
 last name, and email address fields need to be populated on the instructor record in the LMS.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can also relate the Instructor to a user and when you login as the user, you can launch the course once its time and Join as the Meeting Host from the My Classes tab at the top of the SuccessFacrtors Learning
 User Side home page.&nbsp; My Classes will only appear for users related to an Instructor.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(56, 56, 56, 1)">Before we plan to configure SuccessFactors Learning and Skype for Bunessess, we need
<strong>XML configuration file</strong> (provided by you) and I need to input XML API, URl API, Site Name, Username, and Password.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(56, 56, 56, 1)">Could you please give brief explanation how can I get this XML Configuration File?</span></p>

<p>Hi Tatyana Putri,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the XML configuration file, you can refer to following article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/configuration-options-for-the-office-2016-deployment-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/configuration-options-for-the-office-2016-deployment-tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can start by copying and pasting the example (the standard XML configuration file) into a text file and add some elements based on your requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<p>Hi Tatyana Putri,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the XML configuration file I provided, it's used to configure your Office applications. Except that one, based on my knowledge, we don't have other XML Configuration file as you post which is used to integrate Skype for Business with SuccessFactors Learning.
 Regarding your concern, you can try to post it to <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=SfB&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN forum</a> to check the&nbsp;possibility. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>

    <title>Outlook 2003 not displaying items in html. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2003 not displaying items in html.</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden, all my emails are not in HTML format.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is not just for new emails, but old emails that when they came into my outlook originally displayed the graphics.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>No setting were changed, both Outlook and word have settings set for emails to be read in HTML format.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>It cannot be my antivirus software, because same version runs on my other desktop with windows 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am not having any problems on that system, and I have compared all my outlook and office configurations settings, they are identical to each other.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The only thing I can think of that did happen is I was trying to sync my outlook a new Cell phone with a windows op/sys.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They required me to create a hotmail email address so it can be brought into outlook.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once I realized was a horrible way this was to try to sync contact and calendar to their phone, I sent the phones back and removed hotmail account as well as they add-in in outlook 2003.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am not 100% positive this happened at exact same time, but it was within a day of each other and maybe possible the same day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since removed outlook, office and reinstalled both as well as installing service patches for office 2003.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is very annoying not see emails with graphics.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Can’t stand it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have had it set up this way for more than 10 years.<span>&nbsp;
</span>None of the solutions I have read posted have worked for me.</p>

<h3> ruifcastro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use my Mac&#39;s Internet on my Nokia 5800</h2>
                    
<p>I've been strugly to do this, I have a Macbook os x 10.5.6 and a Nokia 5800. The Wifi at my school is Eduroam, but its certificates doesn't work very well on Nokia devices (on the iphone its automatic, but on nokia i have to do it manualy but i have only
 got it to work one time). So what I want to do is use my Macbook ethernet connection (which works all the time) and through bluetooth or Wifi on my laptop connect to my Nokia 5800 to surf (less problems this way), also update my podcasts, etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found in the preferences the "sharing" option and in here there is share a internet connection from ethernet to: airport or bluetooth. I have tried both but I don't know what do do on the 5800. I have paired both devices in the bluetooth settings
 on the 5800. I also have tried finding the network i created if i pick airport on the mac. Both without success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also found a feature on the mac, in preferences&gt;bluetooth, on the bottom is a advance options and in here is a option to share internet through bluetooth, but one again on the 5800 nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help, thx in advance.</p>

<p>I think i got it woking on the Mac, the sharing thing I've found another way, if you press the wifi icon (network icon) on top menu, and press make network, here you can make a wifi network, give it a name like "mywifi", put a 5 caracter pasword (if you
 pick 40 bit). A light grey with a arrow pointing up should appear on the wifi icon on the menu bar. And now if you search on your 5800 for a wifi, settings&gt;connecticity&gt;wireless, you will see your new network (may have to refresh, options&gt;refresh).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you try no surf and nothinh happens, it may be you have to set a proxy (mostly if you do it at your work or school), settings&gt;connectivity&gt;Destinations&gt;Internet, now select the wifi connection you created, "mywifi" and options&gt;edit&gt;options&gt;advanced settings
 (damn advance settings are always hidden), here you will see the proxy server and proxy port settings. Remember to check if it get saved. First time i tried it, settings wouldn't be saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some apps still does work, maybe they are not checking that i have a proxy. Worked well with podcast app, web browser, gravity (twitter client). Didn't work with opera mini, messaging app (mail), nokias new messaging email app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Deleting email on new Outlook.com- must select one email at a time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Looks like my Outlook.com has been "upgraded." I used to be able to delete 35 messages at a time&nbsp;but now I have to select emails individually and it won't let me select more than 2 or 3 before it unchecks the others. At best, it seems I can select two emails
 at a time by checking the checkbox next to the folder name. Is this seriously the new Outlook.com? I was going to try to clean out nearly 10,000 emails today. I can and do use sweep, but to require a user to select each email individually and have to delete
 them in batches of 2 or 3 is RIDICULOUS! I hope I am missing something. Please, please help.</p>

            <p>Yes, perform your Search and choose:<br />
View-&gt; View Settings-&gt; Conditional Formatting...-&gt; Add</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then configure your desired Font settings and press Condition...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Select the Advanced tab and add the following condition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field: In Folder</li><li>Condition: is (exactly)</li><li>Value: Deleted Items</li></ul>
<p>This shouldn't affect your Deleted Items folder, but if it does, you can define a view specifically for the Deleted Items folder via Change View-&gt;&nbsp;Manage Views...</p>

<h2>            iCloud email account problem in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Please help - I receive a message with error 0x800CCC0E - Outlook cannot synchronise established folders for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; Error cannot connect to server.</p>
<p>The email account was set up correctly -&nbsp; it has worked on this computer for nearly 8 months now.&nbsp; I have used an app-specific password&nbsp;<br />
I was away on holiday with no having any access to my laptop.</p>
<p>I started it again on 2 November on returning home and suddenly could not access my icloud emails</p>
<p>I can access the emails on the internet on www.icloud.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the steps for correcting synchronising problems in outlook -&nbsp; opened icloud app and deselected :emails and after a time selected again - no changes</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made no changes to my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you assist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 5x different email addresses in Outlook - the rest are all working perfectly</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello Laura,<br />
<br />
It is possible that an email security setting is preventing the email folder synchronization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your other email accounts are working fine in Outlook, it is best to remove the iCloud email account and set up again. Make sure that you're using the correct email server settings. Contact your email service provider if necessary.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, try to temporarily switch off email protection settings on the active anti-virus software running on your computer. Although we don't recommend turning off security software, temporarily turning off the software will let you determine
 if it is preventing you from syncing your emails.<br />
<br />
In addition, we recommend <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">installing Office updates</a></strong> for Outlook application
 to isolate any possible bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If your device is connected to a network, your network policy settings might prevent you from completing these steps. For more information, contact your administrator.<br />
<br />
Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.<br />

<h2>            Data in my calender have disappeared from my phone. How to get them back&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Data in my calender have disappeared from my phone.They are still in my calender in my Hotmail. It seems I can't synchronise this.</p>
<p>Birthdays are still there, but only back till end of June this year. Also, I can't go back to&nbsp;the&nbsp;months before June.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happened a few months ago that all the information in my calender had disappeared from my phone. I went to Nokia Care and they did something in 'settings' (unfortunately I forgot what..) and all the data were back. I went there today and they didn't know
 how to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows what to do? Your help would be much much appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

I think many of us felt the same same until all of a sudden you realize that it not the case and what you have been seeing is reoccurring all-day appointments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I absolutely agree and like many feel that we need the ability to have the option to save back as far as a year if we want.

            <p>As to the lack of games on Windows Phones, I have also seen this.&nbsp; In addition to my Windows Phone, I also have an iPad and an Android tablet.&nbsp; I did a count on my devices, and here is how many games I have downloaded, and kept, since I liked the games (all
 free game downloads):</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Phone: 11 games downloaded and kept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My iPad tablet: 31 games downloaded and kept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Android tablet: 38 games downloaded and kept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Phones do not have very many games, as compared to iPad/iPhone and Android, which have tons of games.&nbsp; My idea is, if you want to play a lot of games, get an iPad/iPhone, or an Android device (phone or tablet).&nbsp; As for me, I am lucky enough to own
 an iPad and Android device, to supplement where my Windows phone lacks games.&nbsp; I picked the Windows platform for my phone, since I like the way it works/looks.&nbsp; I am happy with my phone, even thought it lacks in games, as I can do most of my gameplay on my
 iPad and Android tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the popular games on iPad/iPhone and Android going to Windows phones, I think this is limited by the state of the present mobile device game market.&nbsp; I would think most developers would want to put their games in the most popular platforms (such as
 iPad/iPhone and Android).&nbsp; Likewise, I can understand why most developers would not want to put their games on Windows Phones (since the game market is so small for Windows Phones).</p>

<p>Presumably you're trying to group the records by address. You can use Word's Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge facility for this (the terminology depends on the Word version). To see how to do so with any mailmerge data source supported by Word, check out my
<strong>Microsoft Word Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge Tutorial </strong>at:<br />
<a href="http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/154370-Microsoft-Word-Catalogue-Directory-Mailmerge-Tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/154370-Microsoft-Word-Catalogue-Directory-Mailmerge-Tutorial</a><br />
or:<br />
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Zips/Catalogue%20Mailmerge.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/Zips/Catalogue%20Mailmerge.zip</a><br />
The tutorial covers everything from list creation to the insertion &amp; calculation of values in multi-record tables in letters. Do read the tutorial before trying to use the mailmerge document included with it.<br />
<br />
The field coding for this is complex. However, since the tutorial document includes working field codes for all of its examples, most of the hard work has already been done for you - you should be able to do little more than copy/paste the relevant field codes
 into your own mailmerge main document, substitute/insert&nbsp; your own field names and adjust the formatting to get the results you desire. For some worked examples, see the attachments to the posts at:<br />

<br />
Another option would be to use a DATABASE field in a normal ‘letter’ mailmerge main document and a macro to drive the process. An example of this approach can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/many-to-one-email-merge-using-tables/8bce1798-fbe8-41f9-a121-1996c14dca5d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/many-to-one-email-merge-using-tables/8bce1798-fbe8-41f9-a121-1996c14dca5d</a><br />
The DATABASE field can even be used without recourse to a mailmerge. An example of such usage can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/21847-mail-merge-into-different-coloumns.html#post67097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/21847-mail-merge-into-different-coloumns.html#post67097</a></p>

<h2>            My concerns about Windows 10 builds, engineering and availability</h2>
                    <p>I am not one to complain and realize the focus of this release which is to develop a product people can love. Engineering Windows; a product used by 1.5 billion Windows users is no easy undertaking. With the promise of making it a free upgrade for existing
 Windows 7 and 8/8.1 users, its certainly a major commitment to make this a product that everybody will look forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally have tried to be understanding to this products ambitions, but what concerns me is the progress of development or the approach to engineering and lack of clarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, Gabe Aul who works in the Operating System Group at Microsoft further confirmed there will be no new build of Windows today or whether there will be a release this week in the coming weeks. I am a relatively patient guy, but I have to admit, the vision
 and clarity of Windows 10 development is kind of getting lost on me. </p>

</p><p>Honestly, what could really be causing such a long gap between delivery of desktop builds of Windows 10? I am starting to wonder, did someone make a recent compile hit the floor?

<p>
</p><p>Yeah, I'm in impatient on this front, I am still running 9841 on my desktop because its so darn stable! I skipped 9860, 9879 and 9926 so far on my desktop because it seems to be rather unstable based on the feedback I reading in the forums. Also, I have
 invested a lot in terms of accumulated data and I just don't want to disturb the work flow.&nbsp;Looking back at Windows 7 and even Windows 8, both operating systems at beta 1 and Consumer Previews, released in January 2009 and February 2012 respectively&nbsp;were relatively

 skipping this one for the desktop which is where I mostly work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern with Windows 10 is the feeling it is using the Vista methodology for engineering. Meaning, its engineering features as we go along. Its not a set feature set that is committed to. We all know how that turned out back in 2006.

<p>&nbsp; Andre, I read your post with great interest.&nbsp; I will say that nobody should accuse you of being overly pessimistic.&nbsp; If anything you've bent over backwards to be as positive about Windows 10 as anybody could be.&nbsp; My take is that they're trying to do something
 unrealistic with the idea of having one OS for everything from desktops to smart phones.&nbsp; Among the computer knowledgeable folks I know, no one&nbsp;thinks that makes a whole lot of sense technically.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Yeah, it would be great from a marketing point of view, but programming a dumb machine to do all that Windows does is challenging enough when you have compatible hardware.&nbsp; I marvel at how they've managed to do it with previous versions of Windows.&nbsp; Smart
 phones and tablets have come a very long way in the last decade, but they use incompatible hardware.&nbsp; Further, you simply can't do the same things with a 3" touch screen that you can do with a laptop and desktop.&nbsp; I love my Android tablet, but I sure as h*ll
 wouldn't try writing something like this note or especially something longer with it.&nbsp; I've said this before, but I continue to believe this approach is analogous to making a kitchen sink, clothes washer, and toilet have a common user interface.&nbsp; It simply
 doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I wish MS the best, I still own&nbsp;a little&nbsp;of their stock, but I sure hope they get their act together before they drive themselves into bankruptcy, or at best have to lay off thousands more people.&nbsp; Apple, Linux, and&nbsp;Android keep gaining market share while
 MS doesn't appear to be going anywhere with their current approach.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Andre, I read your post with great interest.&nbsp; I will say that nobody should accuse you of being overly pessimistic.&nbsp; If anything you've bent over backwards to be as positive about Windows 10 as anybody could be.&nbsp; My take is that they're trying to do something
 unrealistic with the idea of having one OS for everything from desktops to smart phones.&nbsp; Among the computer knowledgeable folks I know, no one&nbsp;thinks that makes a whole lot of sense technically.</p>
<p><strong>I suspect some engineering resources might have reallocated from the desktop client to the mobile/tablet focused revisions of Windows 10. Its a reality in every major engineering company. Personally, I am seeing Windows 10 on mobile as a lost cause.
 Its not about the OS to be honest with you since I think Windows Phone 8.1 with Update 1 is a great mobile OS. Its just apps are not there and its more an unwillingness on the part of third party devs not be interested in the platform or have limited human
 resources so they prefer to focus on where the scale is, which is iOS and Android.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Yeah, it would be great from a marketing point of view, but programming a dumb machine to do all that Windows does is challenging enough when you have compatible hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I don't agree with this, todays machines are anything but dumb. When you think about the array of technology built into todays chips its mind boggling! Sensors, System on a Chip (SoC), high speed wireless, fast storage, security. Its an obligation
 to make Windows make it all work and function in a cohesive way. That's just device/PC, you have to think about all the devices that need to connect back to that PC in return to deliver an experience a user expects. Again, this is authority of the OS being
 the executive software of the system. It is responsible for managing the resources of your computer.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So, its not a matter of Windows taking on too much, it is simply the reality of todays machines, especially with the success of two in one form factors that are expected to work seamlessly in different scenarios, desktop, tablet modes for instance
 based on the user needs and environments.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I marvel at how they've managed to do it with previous versions of Windows.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When Windows Vista came out in 2006, it was obvious that software had finally caught up with the hardware. Today, its a case of hardware being one step ahead in some instances.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Smart phones and tablets have come a very long way in the last decade, but they use incompatible hardware.&nbsp; Further, you simply can't do the same things with a 3" touch screen that you can do with a laptop and desktop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft is a large company with a heavy engineering culture. The company thinks about everything they do with regard for efficiency. The design choices is also to make it enticing to developers. For instance, the Universal app model in Windows
 10 is an example of this. The opportunity for a third party developer to reuse code from desktop and mobile is a heaven sent. It guarantees reliability, stability, fast delivery of solutions to market. Windows 10 obviously is not an exact replica on desktop
 and mobile, in fact I say Microsoft has gotten the features and functionality right according to form factor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I love my Android tablet, but I sure as h*ll wouldn't try writing something like this note or especially something longer with it.&nbsp; I've said this before, but I continue to believe this approach is analogous to making a kitchen sink, clothes washer, and
 toilet have a common user interface.&nbsp; It simply doesn't make sense.</p>
<p><strong>As I previously said, it is about features and relevancy. Microsoft is deprecating the philosophy of Windows 8 of bring mobile to desktop and delivering features unique to the form factor. Its just that there is obvious a focus on having one core
 and engineering in way that benefits a key part the platforms success which is developers.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I wish MS the best, I still own&nbsp;a little&nbsp;of their stock, but I sure hope they get their act together before they drive themselves into bankruptcy, or at best have to lay off thousands more people.</p>
<p><strong>Unlikely to happen, a company with 80 billion dollars in cash and assets and a very established Enterprise business is not going to do that.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Apple, Linux, and&nbsp;Android keep gaining market share while MS doesn't appear to be going anywhere with their current approach.</p>
<p><strong>They are gaining share in mobile which is significantly relevant, the desktop still belongs to Microsoft and with the resurgence of laptops again and the decline in the fad that was the Tablet craze, it shows that this market is healthy and dynamic.
 The success of the Surface Pro 3 is also a reflection that Microsoft can adapt.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I personally think though, it is important that users who care deeply about their investment in the desktop get information about this platforms direction. Let us know the feature set, let us know whats happen, what are the priorities.

            <p>I was referring to iOS and Android gaining share in Mobile, its certainly not case for Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome OS which is Googles desktop answer to Windows hardly registers, OS X remains flat or in decline, Linux has been stuck at 1.2% for more than a decade now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iOS and Android own mobile, no debating that.</p>
<p>Microsoft owns desktop where a significant amount of user engagement is spent, no debating that.</p>

            <p>Sorry I misread your earlier post - I thought you meant that Windows Phone/Mobile was gaining significant market share, which it isn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes Microsoft totally owns the desktop, and the desktop is where real work is done. &nbsp;Instead of "mobile first cloud first" Microsoft's mantra should be "get things done". &nbsp;The "productivity" mantra is just out of touch with what Microsoft is doing. &nbsp;They
 are pushing the gaming side of the PC, and want to make sure that gaming remains the strongest part of the Windows app store. &nbsp;Seriously, where is the productivity priority? &nbsp;The only moves in that direction are to put Office on Android and iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I truly think that the problem is leadership, not a lack of people, despite massive layoffs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Android is not the enemy of Windows - it's a natural partner. &nbsp;Apple is the natural enemy, with its massive profits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows and Android - together not the same!</p>

            <p>Huh? Productivity does mean getting things done. Microsoft owns productivity. The most apparent being Microsoft Office, which is the standard for getting things done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets not forget, Microsoft creates a significant wealth of enterprise applications and integrates with third party systems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Azure, SQL, SharePoint, Skype for Business, Windows Server, Exchange Server, Office 365, Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets not forget the wealth of third party applications that run on Windows: AutoDesk, Intuit, Adobe to name a few.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Windows 10 has gotten the message in regards to making keyboard/mouse usage first class citizens again. I operate in the Windows 10 desktop daily&nbsp;just like I did in Windows 7 and I don't encounter any of the significantly Windows 8 centric functionality.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Productivity is a loaded word in itself, you could say Cortana is productivity, you could say the security itself built into Windows 10 as being productive, you could say the user interface adaptability according form factor, cloud integration and especially
 the forthcoming Spartan browser web apps focus being a productivity play. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at how an app like OneNote and how it&nbsp;integrates with Spartan or maps integration, or Cortana integration,&nbsp;I think Spartan is actually the major feature of Windows 10. Also, why would it not be and why would that even strange. I spend most of
 my time in a web browser everyday. I email, reply to messages, browse web sites, store files in OneDrive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, we must put things into perspective. Windows 10 is an operating system, is it doing what an operating system suppose to do?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My answer to that would be yes.</p>

            <p>The issue I have with the Edge logo, is that it is too reminiscent of Explorer. If, as a company, you're trying to put behind the reputation of Explorer, then why not create something totally new or that may not be mistaken for Explorer. I have the feeling
 that this might be someone in corporate trying to push the idea of there being some sort of "equity" in Explorer and the "e" which represents it. There is none - outside of perhaps my in-laws or grandparents knowing where to click to get on the Web. I can't
 imagine that being a very large part of their demographic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I hope it evolves to move beyond the "e".</p>
