<h2>            Any risks of losing data on the HDD by importing dynamic &#34;Foreign Disks&#34;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>After a sector-by-sector system disk recovery of Windows 10, both of my user HDDs, configured as mirrored disks, recognized as dynamic "foreign disks". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Found some information about importing the "foreign disk" so the system can recognize them again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771775(v=ws.11).aspx#BKMK_4<br />
<br />
Like to make sure there is no risk of losing data on importing these "Foreign Disks" before I do it. Can't find any useful information on Microsoft websites to give me a definitively answer to address my concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone had such experiences please provide any pointing of directions or answers? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, have to figure out a way to backup the huge volume of data before I do it.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks a great deal.</p>
<p />

    <title>Video playback in RDP freezes when switching to direct playback. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Video playback in RDP freezes when switching to direct playback.</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">By "direct playback", I mean something that happens in RDP when playing video that I have no idea what to call it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">When using RDP, when video content is being played on the screen, after a few seconds there is a moment where, instead of the whole screen being treated as one big "video" that is being sent to you, the actual video itself becomes perfect
 quality, like the actual video file is being streamed directly to the client computer and then overlayed over the RDP session where the video should be. And the audio becomes perfectly synced with the video, and no frames are skipped. You'll even see that
 if you scroll (like in a web page with an embedded video that is playing), the entire page will scroll, but the video overlay will stay in place for a second before scrolling with the page.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">So, this feature is what I'm talking about when I say "direct playback", because that's what seems to happen. The client computer being directly sent the endcoded video information and decoding it locally and overlaying it instead of
 treating it like any other thing on the host computer's screen.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Now, my issue is that sometimes, when this "switch" occurs, the overlaid video stays stuck on the first frame it showed. So I'll be viewing a video, and it's playing back in a non-direct way (good quality, but not perfect like directly
 playing it), and then when it makes the switch to direct play, the video seems to freeze. If I scroll, this frozen frame stays in place for a second, but I can see the actual, non-direct video still playing under it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">If you haven't done normal web browsing over RDP you probably have no idea what I'm talking about, but hopefully someone does, and can help me fix this problem, because googling solutions turns up so much unrelated stuff because "video"
 and "RDP" being involved in the search.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The host computer is running Windows 10 Professional, the client computer is running Windows 8.1 Enterprise, but this issue was still occurring before upgrading the host computer to Windows 10 (and the Windows 10 install is a complete
 clean install)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 updates- my computer cannot load the windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have a Dell Laptop 7000 series. I bought it in April 2014 with Windows 8s on it. Soon I got a message that I can upgrade it for free to windows 10, which I did!</p>
<p>This morning I got a message that windows need to be updated and it takes a while. I clicked ok. It kept updating until iy became almost 80% complete. Then all of sudden I got a blue screen which says: Choose your keyboard, I did choose US keyboard. Next
 thing was another blue screen giving me 6 options:<br />
1) Continue:&nbsp; Exit and Continue to Windows Roll back<br />
2) Use a device: USB drive, Network connection, or windows recovery dvd</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; use another operating system : continue with another installed version of winmdows</p>
<p>4) troubleshoot : reset your pc or see advanced options</p>
<p>5) turn-off your pc<br />
</p>
<p>I do not know what is Windows Roll Back.</p>
<p>I have chosen options 1 and 3: on option 3 I went to option windows 10&nbsp; grade 5!!!! but like option 1 i keep getting same issue:&nbsp; &nbsp;black background and an error message:&nbsp; C: windows\System32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is unavailable. If the is on this
 PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disk is inserted, and then try again. If the location is on a network, make sure you are connected to network or internet, and then tryagain. If the location still can't be found, it might have been moved
 or deleted. click OK.</p>
<p>As soon I click Ok, an empty black desktop shows with only a trash basket icon.</p>
<p>at the bottom corner it shows:</p>
<p>1) audio is disconnected ( which by trouble shooting works).</p>
<p>2) no internet connection. i even used cable and thought the issue is wireless, but dont work. When I click trouble shooting it gives an error&nbsp; while trouble shooting:
<br />
&nbsp;Package ID: Unknown, ;Path: Unknown; error code: 0x80070426; Source: Engine User: My computer name\my name ; Context:&nbsp; Restrickted.<br />
<br />
on Option 1 sometimes i see for few minutes this pops up on my screen:&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; Start&nbsp; PXE over IPv4.<br />
<br />
When I chose Statrt Up repair, it says it could not&nbsp; repair my pc., press advanced option, which i did but no help.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I appreciate your help. I have no backup of windows nor of my files and I need them. Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Reza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft already identified the cause of the upgrade being stuck on the <em><strong>Choose your keyboard layout</strong></em> screen and released two methods that can help you resolve the issue. The procedure requires you to rollback your computer to the
 previous version of Windows 10 in order to preserve your personal files. You can find the steps on how to perform this operation from
<em>Herbert Amo</em>'s response from this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-april-2018-update-may-boot-to-a-choose/8ff0d933-8819-4945-9f0c-17ac854400e2?tm=1527132940304" title="Windows 10 April 2018 Update may boot to a “Choose your keyboard layout” screen or to a blank screen with a Recycle Bin">
<strong>thread</strong></a>. I suggest performing <em>Method 1</em> for your convenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Hi. Thanks. However, by trial and error somehow i chose the option of running in windows 10 rather than roll back</p>
<p>&nbsp;Still getting a black screen with only thrash box. Any suggestion how to get back to roll back screen? Thanks</p>

<h2>            Digital camera doesn&#39;t pop up the autoplay box anymore- Windows XP</h2>
                    When I plugged my USB cord from my digital camera into the port an autoplay box would pop up and ask me what I wanted to do with the pictures. I accidentally clicked the "Do not show me this agan" box and now when I plug my camera into the port the box
 won't pop up and I can't access my digital camera. Is there a way to make the box pop up again?&nbsp; How can I change the Autoplay settings in Windows XP?

<p>===============================<br />
Personally...I prefer to use a media reader. This<br />
eliminates the problem of connecting the camera...<br />
<br />
Anyway...if the camera is turned on...and is not <br />
recognized as a drive...you may have a bad USB <br />
cable.</p>

<h2>            Windows explorer &#40;Win7 Ultimate 64bit&#41; Keeps locking up or freezing</h2>
                    Windows explorer (Win7 Ultimate 64bit) keeps locking up or freezing if I try to move, delete, or rename a file. It only happens to a few files (not a virus) but whenever it does happen, it seems to change the image of every file in my folder until I close
 it or it 'open new window'. For example, when I try to delete a stubborn file, it just sits at a 'recycling' loading screen/bar forever and nothing happens. This has also happened to me when I try to transfer files onto and off my cellphone. Sorry if this
 is unclear, basically the computer is refusing to touch certain files and changes/looks odd once I touch said files. The files that I am trying to move are pictures that I took and videos.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It would be nice to get these files out of my downloaded folder and moved into their assigned folders. I have downloaded something called 'Unlocker' yet I am really unsure how to use it or if it is the correct thing to use. I can try to explain this more
 or answer any questions you have!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Video files are .avi and .mkv</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;any help, thank you.</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Use the Clean Boot and other methods to try to determine the cause of and/or eliminate the issues.<br />
You may have something running which has a file lock on the problematic files. Unlocker can indeed<br />
help remove files that are hard to delete however be sure they are files that you should delete and not<br />
systemic files - refer to Unlocker's website and documentation for help on using it.<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Problems with activating DLC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with activating DLC</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo</p>
<p>Few days ago I got Batman: Arkham City game for PC through steam (don't have xbox), then i failed trying to redeem code through xbox site to get an access to download it through "games for windows marketplace" client because it says that</p>
<p>"...As part of the upcoming Xbox 360 system update, Microsoft Points will be retired, and the Xbox.com PC marketplace will be closed as of August 25, 2013..."</p>
<p>so actually all helpfull videos that i watched "how to activate and download DLC for batman arkham city" are no longer helpfull because it's simply not gonna work that way. (Games for windows marketplace client -&gt; then go to
<a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/PC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/PC</a>. -&gt; then My account -&gt; then Redeem code) no way.</p>
<p>So I actually wanna ask about how do I activate it to make DLC available (make it appear) on my "games for windows marketplace" client in download section?</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<p>I don't think you can. It is my understanding that the Games for Windows LIVE Marketplace has been closed. Only those items you have already purchased will be available for download.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi MS staff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surprise you guys seem to surprised by this issue. I have been having this issue since I updated the May update specifically this:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/install-update-activate/pro-3-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Display Audio driver update (v6.16.00.3172) improves audio experience and supports compatibility with the updated graphics driver.</a></li></ul>
<p>The static sound (I am hoping its coming from the speakers and not REAL sparks flying inside) seem to come at random intervals usually in 2 times. Most of the time I am at school with my SP3 muted and running OneNote and it still makes the 2 clicking noise.
 This happens probably 3-4 /day. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Really this piece of hardware is great, but c<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">an you guys do a better job of software updates</span>? I am studying aboard right now and I get SUPER nervous when I see window update notification because things like
 this happens. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just today I notice my speakers fails to switch from speaker to headphones. and sometimes when my SP3 wakes up from sleep it would have the volume all the way up 100. This sort of thing didn't happen until I updated. And its not like i can FLY back to Canada
 to take my SP3 into a windows store constantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours Truly</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

            Hi Simeon
<br />
<br />That laptop would support Windows 10 up to about version 1703, but not the newer versions (1709, 1803 and 1809), That laptop is 5 years old and it is increasingly hard to find chipset, audio and video drivers for that which would work on the later versions of Windows 10. Dell only supports that laptop up to Windows 8.1 . ..

<p>so what should I do? buy windows 8.1 or is it possible to fix the camera and sound still on windows10? and is my low battery due to it running on windows 10?</p>

            Hi Simeon
<br />
<br />Boot up your Alienware, on the Alienware logo screen, repeatedly press F12 to go to the Temporary boot menu
<br />
<br />Choose Diagnostics from that menu
<br />
<br />Run the diagnostics and when asked to perform an extended memory test, choose No
<br />
<br />Does your battery pass that hardware test?

            Hi Simeon
<br />
<br />Yes, that green tick means your battery is fine. Honestly, for you to get a stable system, installing Windows 8.1 or 7 would be best, contact Dell and see if they will provide you with a Windows 8.1 OEM disc free of charge
<br />
<br />First, go to this link and enter your laptop's serial number and see that operating system recovery Media they offer . . .

<div>Also, when i tried to delete/change some files in Windows Explorer, it said that i need permission from the administrator and to "try again," which does nothing. I am the admin and I am only profile on my laptop. I tried "run as administrator," I tried
 lowering the UAC settings and restarting my computer. Im at a loss here. Please help, I thank you for your support.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Rickyw17,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d recommend you to access the following link and refer to RogueCypher’s response posted on March 2 2010 to
 fix the issue: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 folder iTunes is on a locked disk or you do not have write permission for this folder".</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With respect to the file deletion issue, I’d suggest you to take ownership of the files and try deleting the same.
</span></p>

            <p>Have you tested with another user, you may have to create one to do so?&nbsp; That test would eliminate the possibility of a corrupt user profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try running ChkDsk to check your drive for errors. Right-click your Drive icon/ Properties/ Tools/ Error Checking.&nbsp; Try it first by not checking either box (this will run it in a Read-only mode) to see if it flags any hard drive or file problems.&nbsp; If it
 does, restart&nbsp; it by ticking both boxes, and rerun it to allow it to attempt to fix any found problems.
<br />
</p>
<p>This example might or might not work for you with your program it uses the built-in Administrator account to perform the install?</p>
<p>"It seems that the "Run as administrator" command only gives you some administrative privileges, and they're not enough to install Java (and OpenOffice, by association). In order to get around this, you need to actually log into the built-in administrator.
 Open a command prompt with admin rights by clicking start, typing cmd into the search/run box, and hitting CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER. At the prompt, type:</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:yes</p>
<p>Then log out of your regular account and back in as the built-in administrator, where you might be able to install the program. When you're done, log back into your regular account and, for security purposes, disable the built-in administrator account using:</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:no "</p>

<h2>            Older verison of Skype for windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Alright , the windows 10 version of skype is unusable for me , due to the fact that i never tells me when people are calling me. i have my phone skype ringing but when i look at my pc skype , nothing. it does not show anything , i do not like windows 10
 skype , the windows 8 and 7 version is still being updated and maintained anyway , so its still secure , so please tell me how to install the older version , i find it downright evil that Microsoft has disabled even installing another version of skype , as
 grabbing an exe installer from an older system refuses to run.

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0eae59be-1239-48f3-b4f4-79dc31bdfde7" title="KennethOgden">
<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that we have removed the download link of the classic version of Skype on our website. At Skype, we take security very seriously. There was an issue with an older version of the Skype for Windows desktop installer – version 7.40 and lower.
 The issue was in the program that installs the Skype software – the issue was not in the Skype software itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow the steps below for resetting Skype for Windows 10.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Start menu and click Settings.</li><li>Click Apps.</li><li>Locate and click Skype from the Applications list.</li><li>Click Advanced option.</li><li>Select Reset.​</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the above information does not work, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.<br />
Thank you!</p>

    <title>Missing files &#40;NOT deleted&#41; from NTFS file system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hellswesties  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing files &#40;NOT deleted&#41; from NTFS file system disk&#47;directory</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I have a WinXP SP3 system with an extra internal 2TB SATA disk as a data drive. This drive has only data files (.mp3, video) in one directory, and has never been used for anything other than data files. There is only one directory for the files, and although
 it is four sub-directory levels down, the directory tree is only those four sub-dirs.</p>
<p>About a week ago, I noticed that the free disk space on that drive jumped from 350GB to 1.2TB, leaving about 600GB of data still on the disk (approx. 2,500 files). After checking the obvious (recycler, etc), I noticed that the missing files were all files
 from a*.* to n*.* and [0-9]*.*. All files beginning with o*.* to z*.* are still there. So, essentially I am missing about 9,000 files.</p>
<p>I checked to see if the missing files could be undeleted and/or recovered, and downloaded several "undelete" or data recovery utilies. Every one of the utilities showed that there was no data to recover, i.e., the files simply disappeared or evaporated.</p>
Where did they go? I am totally clueless on this.
<p>The files are not hidden because the disk space decreased; hidden files still occupy space.</p>
<p>I haven't done anything else to the drive in the hopes of recovering the data. I thought maybe an index got corrupted or deleted since the deleted files were missing in an orderly fashion from the directory index. I ran a chkdsk on the volume, it came back
 clean, and the files were still missing. If the files had been deleted alphabetically, they would still be "deleted" files and recoverable, right?</p>
<p>I also tried to see if I could do a system restore from the point in time before the files went missing, but my System Restore says there is nothing to restore, no action to be taken.</p>
<p>Any ideas appreciated.</p>

<p>R-Studio found the missing files, but only about 75% of them were truly recoverable. The ones that were not recovered were of a zero-byte length. The upside is that the names of the files were still intact, so at least I know which ones to re-create. The
 downside is that is still a couple thousand files that need to be redone. That will take some time, but far less time that I would have had to spend re-creating all of the missing files.</p>
<p>R-Studio also found entries for previously deleted files, and I recovered these, too. However, the recovered files were corrupted and unusable. Since I didn't really need those, it wasn't a problem. I mention it simply as something that R-Studio accomplished
 (and the other tools did not).</p>
<p>The recovery is complete in terms of finding the missing files and restoring them to alternate drives.&nbsp; It took a great deal of time, about three days as I had to do it piecemeal in 500GB bursts to relocate the recovered files to alternate drives. I will
 move the files I had not lost before off the problem drive, as well, and then replace it; drives are cheap these days.&nbsp;&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>Thanks for the assistance!!! Also, thanks for the R-Studio recommendation; that's a very handy tool, and well worth the expense!</p>

<h2>            Restore files from backup on new computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro 3 started dying a few weeks ago. In preperation of a new machine, I peformed a backup to my OneDrive and then wipted the machine. I tried to get it working but failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have a new machine, in this case a Dell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm missing some Outlook files and know I backed them up. where do I find these backup files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking on Backup and Restore (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files) I don't see my files from the Surface.</p>

            <p>The way to backup Office Outlook is to export your data. You can export your entire data store (.pst) or individual components of your data store, such as your Address Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want, you can store the exported archive(s) to OneDrive (and that's a good idea.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, in the new computer, you download the archive(s) from OneDrive to the desktop, and import them into Office Outlook on the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the way to transfer Office Outlook data to a new computer. If that's not what you did I don't know how you're going to bring your data back into Outlook.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been using .pst files since the '90s. In fact I still have some of those .pst files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I backed up, I expected the files - including several .pst files - to be placed on OneDrive. I just can't find where.</p>

            <p>If you have a OneDrive folder on your hard drive, and you sent the information to that OneDrive folder, I think it should have synced with OneDrive online pretty much instantly. In that case, the information should be in the OneDrive folder on your hard
 drive and in OneDrive in the cloud, although where it ends up in OneDrive in the cloud I do not know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, the other way to send the information to OneDrive in the cloud is for you to manually upload it. In that case it should be where you put it. Who knows what Microsoft does with it afterward, but it should definitely be in OneDrive somewhere.</p>

            I believe that the Kindle Fire HD is based on the Android operating system.&nbsp; Bluetooth access is limited when using the Microsoft Bluetooth protocol.&nbsp; Microsoft has limited this protocol to modem, serial port and personal access network (PAN??)&nbsp;

            <p>The only option available for Kindle fire connections to Bluetooth using Windows 7 is for synchronizing files with products such as Windows Media Player or Documents to Go.&nbsp; You might find better luck finding a diver that gets around this when using Windows
 7 by going to Android forums and checking out the threads that apply to Kindle Fire HD.&nbsp; There may be a driver contained in the Android SDK that fixes the problem.&nbsp; I haven't found it yet.</p>

It is NOT a kindle problem.&nbsp; i have a similar problem with pairing kindle fire hd with win 7.&nbsp; each device recognizes the other, but while kindle is saying "pairing" and shows a passkey, pc is saying "connecting."&nbsp; after what seems to me to be in inordinate
 amount of time, the kindle stops trying to pair (since there was no passkey showing up on pc) and then&nbsp;pc goes from "connecting" to "disconnected."&nbsp; every other Bluetooth device works w/ both kindle and pc--they just don't work w/ each&nbsp; other.&nbsp; what can I
 do?

<h2>            Can&#39;t purchase backward compatible games with Xbox Gift Card</h2>
                    <p>Is there any particular reason you can't use an Xbox Gift Card for the purchase of backward compatible&nbsp;games?<br /><br />I noticed a status issue dealing with redeeming codes, and buying items. &nbsp;The gift card I received is an Xbox Gift Card, and on the back it says it can&nbsp;be used for Xbox One and Xbox 360. &nbsp;I had no trouble redeeming it, however when i go to the store, via the computer, I find Skate 3 and it doesn't give me the option to use the credit on my account.<br /><br />Does anyone else find this absolutely absurd? &nbsp;If I had known, or if my girlfriend had known, we could have gone to GS and purchased a disc version of the game and completely cut&nbsp;xbox out of the equation.</p>

</p><p>This is so annoying. The child accounts are not allowed to buy backward compatible games through the web! The only way is through the 360 console, but not the new xbox one! My child has got credit to spend&nbsp;and gold subscription, but how can he make use of it and get the discounts he is entitled to for xbox 360 games? Buying xbox 360 is not an option.</p>

<p /><p>This is so annoying. The child accounts are not allowed to buy backward compatible games through the web! The only way is through the 360 console, but not the new xbox one! My child has got credit to spend&nbsp;and gold subscription, but how can he make use of it and get the discounts he is entitled to for xbox 360 games? Buying xbox 360 is not an option.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You cant&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parental settings don't apply on the website</p>
<p>That why a child account can't make the purchase on the website&nbsp;as it would be a serious security issue</p>
<p>So your best option is to make your own account and make the purchase for him on your own gold membership and credit card since it applies to the whole console as home</p>
