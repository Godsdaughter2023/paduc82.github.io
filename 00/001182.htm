<p>Hi Hayley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try re-starting your PC (Outlook client) to see if it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, if you are using the Office 365 account (affected account), I suggest you make sure you are configuring the account in Outlook via:</p>
<p>1) From your PC: Start | Control Panel | Mail.<br />
<br />
2) Click [Show Profiles….].<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Click [Add…].<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Enter a name for the profile.<br />
<br />
<br />
5) When prompted, enter your mailbox display name (Your Name); Email Address, and Email Password.<br />
<br />
<br />
6) Click [Next&gt;].<br />
<br />
<br />
7) Click [Finish].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p>hi nur,</p>
<p>if you just want to get an email notification of the notebook in sharepoint online, we recommend you use
<strong>alert</strong> function. to do this, navigate to the location of team site notebook (e.g.
<a href="https://contoso.sharepoint.com/siteassets/forms/allitems.aspx)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contoso.sharepoint.com/.../allitems.aspx)</a> &gt; select the notebook &gt; click alert me in file tab on the ribbon &gt; set alert on this document &gt; modify alert settings &gt; ok.</p>

<h2>            Data structures to use for A-star pathfinding algorithm in VBA</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm disabled and can't work so in order to keep my brain active I'm trying to learn a little about AI programming.&nbsp; Initially, I was trying to bring myself up to date with VB.NET but the available documentation is insufficient for anything other than very
 basic exercises and long time VB.NET programmers are very intolerant of new people asking questions, they are too attached to their
<strong>Wizards</strong>.&nbsp; So I'm stepping back and just using VBA in Excel 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set up a grid on an worksheet:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68778b69-d29b-4a7f-b3b9-85709f0a580e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68778b69-d29b-4a7f-b3b9-85709f0a580e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The A-star algorithm is used to find the shortest path from one spot to another.&nbsp; Rather than explain the entire process I'll just describe the part of looking for some advice with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part of this algorithm you maintain what is called an "Open" list which are tiles that are possibly part of the path and have not been eliminated yet.&nbsp; Associated with each open tile are that tiles X, Y coordinates, pointers to track to the previous tile
 (again an X, Y), the number of steps to have reached this tile, and this tiles "score" which is an estimate of which tile to check first in the open list.&nbsp; This list will contain an unknown number of entries, the number of entries will change continuously
 as tiles are checked for suitability.&nbsp; The process runs roughly like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are in a tile and want to move to another</p>
<p>1 - You check each of the adjacent 8 tiles,</p>
<p>2 - if the tile contains an obstacle or it's off the edge of the grid, you ignore it</p>
<p>3 - if the tile is <em>open</em> then you assign it a score (number of steps to reach it plus an estimated distance to the destination ignoring obstacles)</p>
<p>4 - one you've done this for all the tiles, you sort the <em>open</em> list with the lowest scores first</p>
<p>5 - when you check the first tile in the sorted list, you look at all of it's neighboring tiles</p>
<p>6 - if a tile passes the test in step #2 then you add it to the <em>open</em> list</p>
<p>7 - once you've looked at all the neighboring cells, you remove that cell from the
<em>open</em> list and add it to the <em>closed</em> list (there is still data that needs to be maintained in case it is ultimately part of the chosen path</p>
<p>8 - you continue this process until you reach the destination tile</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the Open list length can vary significantly depending on the path, the Closed list will grow steadily until the destination is found</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've thought of several techniques to track the necessary data</p>
<p>1 - put two tables (Open list and Closed list) on a hidden sheet</p>
<p>&nbsp;- this would allow the length of the two lists to be changed easily, any gaps in the open list from moving a tile to the closed list would be filled by resorting the open list</p>
<p>2 - use arrays with very large bounds, or arrays that I adjust using ReDim Preserve statements to increase the array size when needed</p>
<p>3 - use a collection with a user defined variable Type.&nbsp; I find collections confusing because you can't depend on the indexes remaining the same, e.g. if you Remove item number 1 from a collection, then item number 2 is now number 1, etc.&nbsp; Sorting a collection
 seems to be problematic as well since they are read only</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typing this up I've decided the best place to start since I'm using Excel is a hidden worksheet which will allow me to use Excel's built-in Sort, Copy, Paste methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Pointers are welcome.</p>

<h2>            Strange characters in an Outlook email</h2>
                    <p>An email was forwarded to me that was written back in 2011.&nbsp; It took some time to read it.&nbsp; Here is a portion:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have been =earching for the average CO2 produced by Australians.&nbsp; On average, =ach Aussie produces 19 tonnes of CO2 pa, Americans 20t, UK 9.4t, China =t, India 1t</strong></p>

</p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;have seen similar things from time to time, and didn't know why.&nbsp; I found that nbsp means non breaking space.&nbsp; There are differing forms of these, ( eg "<span>&amp;=bsp;

<p><span><span>"=" Some time replaces the first letter of some words.&nbsp; And rarely at the end of a word.</span></span></p>

            Good Day

My Name is Phillip Roos and i will be happy to help the best way possible and in a timely manner.

Please try the following solution of repairing your office package:

The first thing you can do is to navigate and select the start button
2) Type in control panel
3) Navigate to "Programs".
4) Then select "Uninstall a Program"
5) Then find your office installation and right click (Usually say Microsoft Office 2016 or something similar)
6) Select change
7) Now a window will pop asking for "Quick Repair" or "Online Repair"
8) Select the Quick Repair option and reboot
9) If the problem continues select the Online Repair option and reboot

If the problem continues i do recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the office 2016/2013 package.

Please let me know if this helped or not, i will happily assist you further.

Kind Regards
Phillip Roos

<p>You are most likely brushing your touchpad with your fingers while typing, or your touchpad is set so sensitive that typing keys near it makes it receive input. Either disable your touchpad if you don't use it, or turn down it's sensitivity.</p>
<p>Options for adjusting your touchpad can commonly be found under "Mouse" on your Windows "Control Panel". Alternatively, check your system tray (the little icons to&nbsp;the right of&nbsp;your taskbar) to see if there isn't any icon there.</p>
<p>The problem occurs just as well on Mac OS as on Windows. For example, see this thread:<a href="http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-operating-system/76340-macbook-pro-touch-pad-sensitivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-operating-system/76340-macbook-pro-touch-pad-sensitivity.html</a></p>
<p>I had well over a dozens laptops now and I have never come across a laptop with a touchpad set too sensitive by default. I wonder if my touch is that soft, or if all those other people are really hammering on their keyboards.</p>

<p>Hi Mike</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have vision issues too and I think it was a bad idea removing this setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I got round this issue by downloading a program called winaero, once you have installed the program I set system font first then sign out then I set icons and menus last Don't forget to sign out each time you make a change. This program is free and
 very useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diddy&nbsp;<br />

            In addition to diddybhp's comments, it is true that installation of a new build always removes restore points because those restore points do not apply to the new build.&nbsp; Allowing old restore points to hang around could result in corrupting the system
 if an old one were used. &nbsp;

<h2>            Two-factor verification with android and outlook app not working</h2>
                    <p>I recently enabled two-factor verification on my microsoft account and now I'm unable to login to my hotmail account on my LG G3 android using the outlook app. When I generate an app password online and type it into my phone it says the password is incorrect.

<p>
</p><p>I've removed my hotmail account from the outlook app and rebooted my phone. What am I missing?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;PDRebecca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my glory to reply to your case here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to this error, we need to check the following things</p>
<p>1. The certificate installed on your Exchange On-premises sever. You can use the
<strong>Get-ExchangeCertificate </strong>cmdlet to check it. For more information, you can refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/encryption-and-certificates/get-exchangecertificate?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/encryption-and-certificates/get-exchangecertificate?view=exchange-ps</a>.
 And, please make sure your Exchange on-premises certificate meets the requirements described in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/certificate-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/certificate-requirements</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The network traffic between your Exchange Online and Exchange On-premises supports the TLS. As far as I know, this issue will occur due to the on-premises firewall which stops the traffic. So, if it is possible, you can try disabling the local firewall
 at an off-work time to see if it makes a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Check the outbound connector for your Exchange Hybrid. You can use the&nbsp;<strong>Get-OutboundConnector&nbsp;</strong>cmdlet via referring to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/mail-flow/get-outboundconnector?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/mail-flow/get-outboundconnector?view=exchange-ps</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is recommended that you provide the above mentioned information in the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/new">
Private Message (PM) </a>for us to check after you get it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;PDRebecca,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your private message.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Via checking your domain (***designs.com), we have found that it is not hosted in Office 365 and the MX record of that domain is not pointed to Office 365, either. Given the situation, the migrated user (to Office 365)
 will not receive the message sent to him. In addition, related Office 365 DNS records (ie, the SPF record) of that domain hasn't been added. As a result, the migrated user (to Office 365) won't be able to send, either.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, we found that domain is not a federated domain, either. Given the situation, it means your Hybrid setup is not successful. I suggest you re-configure the Exchange Hybrid via the instruction of&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-hybrid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-hybrid</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anything is unclear, please let me know. I will be glad to further assist you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,<br />
Alan</span></p>

<p>After working with our firewall vendor I was able to get the connector working in exchange online and that allowed me to receive email from the Exchange Online User.&nbsp; I still cannot send email to him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I am in a hybrid configuration, everything I have read has said that I should not change my publix&nbsp;MX records as that will route all traffic through Exchange Online and not my On Prem&nbsp;server.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at your&nbsp;link for the Hybrid Configuration and while I don't find it all that helpful of a document I believe we are following everything mentioned in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;PDRebecca,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Glad to further assist you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, please clarify whether you are talking about "A@contoso.com (migrated to Office 365) account, B@contoso.com (located in your Exchange on-premises/Exchange 2010 account), but A@contoso.com is able to send to B@contoso.com
 and B@contoso.com is not able to send to A@contoso.com, contoso.com stands for your Hybrid domain"?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If so, please provide the following information so that I can help check it (for protecting your privacy, you can provide the following information in the PM)</span></p>
<p><span>1. the NDR (Non-Delivery Report) user B received while B@contoso.com tried sending to A@contoso.com.</span></p>
<p><span>2. your Exchange 2010 on-premises send connector. You can use
<strong>Exchange on-premises PowerShell</strong> cmdlet&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/mail-flow/get-sendconnector?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get-SendConnector "Contoso.com Send Connector"

<p><span>3. your Office 365 inbound connector. You can use<strong> Exchange Online PowerShell</strong> cmdlet&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/mail-flow/get-inboundconnector?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get-InboundConnector

<p>
</p><p>Also, please be noted that email between your Exchange online and Exchange on-premises will not be checked the MX record as it will be regared as the internal mail flow. But the domain (contoso.com) you verifed in your Office 365 should be set as "Internal
 Relay" but not "Authoritative". If so, you can refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-accepted-domains/manage-accepted-domains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-accepted-domains/manage-accepted-domains</a>&nbsp;(configure

    <title>Why can&#39;t I play music through the USB on my WP7 with Ford - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twitchyguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I play music through the USB on my WP7 with Ford Sync&#63;</h2>
                    I have a 2011 Ford Taurus with My Ford Touch/ Ford Sync by Microsoft and all the features of my phone seem to be compatible with the exception of USB audio streaming. What gives? I can use a Zune, iPod, and a iPhone but the Windows phone isn't compatible?
 Will this be fixed with Mango? I know I can stream via bluetooth but with bluetooth you cant see song titles and you can't use voice commands to call up songs. I really would hate to replace my WP7 with a iPhone but if they aren't compatible...

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can understand your concern! A Windows Phone 7 device does not function that way over USB. Only&nbsp;through Bluetooth you can stream your songs with your Ford Taurus.</span></p>

There may well be a registry change that would work although I do not know what it is.&nbsp; Years back I tried one and it was OK but it is something I have not looked at in years....just no need for me to do it.<br />
<br />
That said, Easy Sync might be a solution for you to look at:<br />

    <title>Opening an Embedded Excel Table in an Email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kriszza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening an Embedded Excel Table in an Email</h2>
                    <p>I embedded an excel table in an outlook email so that the recipient can use it to enter data and forward to a supervisor.&nbsp; I am able to open and edit the spreadsheet before sending the email but, after sending it, it won't open. I would prefer not to have
 to use an attachment, since the end user needs to go through this process multiple times daily and complete the task quickly.&nbsp; Can this be done?</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice.</p>

            <p>Yes you can copy the Excel table in the body of the e-mail in Outlook. You will need to use the paste special option to retain the formatting and
<b>Link and Destination Styles </b>while copying the table. </p>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<p>1. Select the required portion from Excel worksheet (Columns and rows).<br />
2. Open a new e-mail in Outlook 2010.<br />
3. Under the <b>Message </b>tab in a new e-mail -&gt; Click on the drop down menu under
<b>Paste Special</b>.<br />
4. Select the option <b>Link and Destination Styles (L)</b></p>
<p>Now you may send the e-mail and the recipient can either reply or forward which will give the option to edit the Excel table and send it.</p>
<p>You may refer the following article on more about the
<b>Editor Option (Advanced)</b> in Outlook:<br />

            I tried this and it didn't work.&nbsp; Perhaps more details would help.&nbsp; I'm using an Excel table that has some pull-down fields.&nbsp; Individual records in the table are copied and pasted into an email and sent to a supervisor.&nbsp; The supervisor copies the record
 into her/his own log, which is also formatted with the pull-down boxes.&nbsp; If they do a straight copy and paste from the email to the spreadsheet, the pull-down boxes are lost.&nbsp; They can retain the formatting by using a "keep destination formatting" paste.&nbsp;
 What I'd like to know is if there's a way to paste the record into Excel so that it won't&nbsp;overwrite the destination formatting, when a regualr cut and paste operation is done.&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for providing the details about your other issue which is related to receiving emails&nbsp;for Account verification that you have&nbsp;not requested, and&nbsp;the affected email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked your account and noticed that it is working fine on our end. Please provide, via the Private Message tab,&nbsp;a screenshot of the page for your Safe senders list, and three (3) sample email addresses that you are unable to find there. Take note
 that you need to sign into this website using your Microsoft account to get into that tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the issue on receiving emails for Account verification, please be informed that it will be sent to your account if you are resetting your password, updating your security information, and/or Two-step verification is turned on. It is possible
 that someone else is trying to access your account or using it as an alternate email address if you are not requesting for those codes. I suggest that you visit this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/help-protect-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> for the steps on how you can protect your account.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for your message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider private&nbsp;the email addresses I entered in the safe list. Sorry but I cannot comply with your request to provide a screenshot of that and three email addresses that are no longer there and that should be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition there were many (maybe at least 80 email addresses that had been added to the list. Some of them were domains (@andthedomain)&nbsp;so that any person with any email address from&nbsp;the same&nbsp;particular domain could write to me. Now there are only a few
 email addresses in the safe&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding receiving emails for account verification you wrote: <em>"...please be informed that it will be sent to your account if you are resetting your password, updating your security information, and/or Two-step verification is turned on."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware about that. The messages Micsrosoft sends (regarding account verification) are messages that mention that if I (the user) did not request any of the issues mentioned in the message, then maybe the account was compromised and therefore Microsoft
 advices the user&nbsp;to change the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the reason previously mentioned, right after having received a message from Microsoft that explains that if I did not request the code verification then I should change my password, right after that, I (the user) change the password. Since I (the user)
 have&nbsp;to change the password for security rasons because of having received the warning message (and the warning messages exists because there are circumstances that trigger warning messages), then I (the user) change the password and then I&nbsp;start to receive
 messages about the change of the password that I did for security reasons. </p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing is the event that I did not do and that triggered the first warning message and another thing is that in response to that warning mesage I change my password and then a message is generated.&nbsp; These are 2 different situations.&nbsp; But you know this
 already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will attach in the private message a copy of some emails I have sent reporting warnings that I did not trigger. I have not been able to report all, I received many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

Welcome back to the forum. You were previously asked to provide three samples of e-mail addresses but you said you cannot comply with the request as you consider them private.
<br />
<br />
We understand how you value the privacy, as they may contain sensitive information. But we'd like to let you know that&nbsp;<span>Microsoft uses them to diagnose your issue. We do not use this information to contact you (outside of this issue) or market to you.<br />
<br />
With regard to your description </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(regarding account verification) , yes you are correct.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">These are 2 different situations.<br />
<br />
Upon checking our resources, it doesn't say that your account is in an odd state. But if you're suspecting that someone might have accessed it and deleted contacts in the safe list, you can visit this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/hacked-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link </strong></a>as it contains information which may help you on how to secure the account.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
You've also mentioned about reporting some messages to the Abuse department. Please wait for the updates as the Abuse department will notify and let you know as to how the issue is being taken care of.<br />
<br />
Should you have further questions, don't hesitate to post back to the forum.<br />

            <p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continued thinking about the matter I reported and the circumstances in which it happened. As I mentioned in my private reply, I started to use a new computer. I have been thinking if I caused the problem myself. I believe this may be the case this time.
 I am not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use an IMAP method to handle my email. I was aware that IMAP mirrors in Windows Live Mail what happens in the server regarding emails (messages). An email deleted in the server is deleted in Windows Live Mail and viceversa. But I had not realized that
 this mirroring characteristic works also for the email addresses or domains included in the safe list. I never paid enough attention to the functionalities of the safe list managing possibilities in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that, maybe, when I started to use my new computer, I&nbsp;may have selected a checkbox that forced the server to update itself according to the content of Windows Live Mail and therefore, since the list of safe email addresses and domains in&nbsp;Windows
 Live Mail was probably empty, maybe that reflected in the server and the information in the safe list in the server was erased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if this is what happened because I would have expected Windows Live Mail to copy in itself the content of the server and not, the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the type of emails I shared with you in the private conversation, I have reported those and many more to the abuse department. It is difficult for me&nbsp;to understand what is causing that I receive those messages. I will explain this with an example
 related to the image below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text in the image below explains in spanish that someone that I do not know (whose email address I removed to protect her privacy - I wrote in the image "removed email address") started a process to replace all the information related to security in
 the account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides I not knowing or not recalling the account name that I replaced with the phrase "removed email address", I do not know to what account Microsoft is referring when Microsoft writes "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and if that account is related to my accounts
 in any way because of how my account name begins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I do not generate those warning emails in the account that I reported as "impacted" &nbsp;in the private message that I sent before, in my mind, I start to associate my account name with *** Email address is removed for privacy *** mentioned in the warning message. But this association
 is not one that I can make with certainty because the complete name of the email account is not written in the warning message (the "*****" are written for obvious reasons), therefore I remain in doubt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition I cannot make the association with certainty because the other possibility is that someone decided to include my email address, as an alternate email address in her (or his) account and therefore&nbsp;I receive warning messages when that person makes
 changes in his/her account. This means that there is a possibility that that person was not trying to make any changes in my email account and that *** Email address is removed for privacy *** mentioned in the warning message is not related to my email address at all, but simply,
 that I receive warning messages because my email address was included as an alternate email address in the other person´s account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot determine with certainty what happens, therefore I do not know if my account is really affected or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I do not know if my account has been impacted or not I start to take security measures (like changing my password and starting to use double verification) just to try to minimize the risk but I never really know what I achieved or did now achieve in
 terms of security, particularly because some time later I receive another warning message that I did not generate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other factor that generates doubt is that the warning messages that I do not generate seem to arrive in "groups". It is as if during some period, spread over time, some messages arrive and then no more. Some time passes and then some more arrive, maybe
 one, maybe a few.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing that I noticed is that maybe sometimes a change related to the use of my account triggers receiving some warning messages that I did not generate due to a change of security info. For example, connecting to check my emails using my computer
 and Windows Live Mail in a different location because I travelled. Another situation that seems to have triggered receiving (outside of the normal time frame) a warning message that I did not generate&nbsp;has been changing my account password. If I change my password
 I know that I have to expect an inmediate message from Microsoft in relation to changes that I did&nbsp;in the account. But I it is strange to receive warning messages the next day, a few hours later or two days after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account was hacked two years ago. I recovered it and then, one or two days later,&nbsp;the same account and the account I had created to participate in Microsoft Answers to rescue my main account were hacked. I created another one that was also impacted and
 finally I recovered my accounts. This experience forced me to try to protect myself more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to describe what I have noticed and be as precise as possible within the time I was able to dedicate to this today.</p>

                    In Outlook 2003, if I have an email moved to certain folders, the sender and subject of the email disappears. If I move the email to a different folder the sender and subject appear.

            Yes you are. The fields any view displays are listed at the top of the view. The Navigation Pane is on your left. The next pane is the Message pane.&nbsp;It&nbsp;displays the name of the Folder at the top (e.g., "Inbox")&nbsp;and the fields it is displaying immediately
 underneath the name of the Folder.

            <p>The fields are in the tan bar just beneath the Folder names. You have only selected&nbsp;no fields for display in these views, so Outlook has no idea what you want to see. R click the bar and use Field Chooser to select the fields you want to display in that
 view, one of which would be recipient and one you would not want is Sender (since that will always be you).

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>It might be simpler to suggest using the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the View menu.</li><li>In the Arrange by option at the bottom you'll see Current View.</li><li>In that menu Click Define Views.</li><li>When the dialg appears Click the Reset button.</li></ul>
<p>This will set your view back to it's orignal state.</p>
<p>If the Reset button is not available then</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Modify</li><li>Click Fields</li><li>Find <strong>From</strong> in the left list</li><li>Click Add</li><li>Find <strong>Subject</strong> in the left list</li><li>Click Add</li><li>Use the Move Up or Move Down buttons to position the fields in the right list (usually below attachment and above Received)</li><li>Click OK (twice)</li><li>Click Apply view then Close</li></ul>
<p>You will need to repair all the broken views this way.&nbsp; So repeat in each folder where the information is missing.</p>

            Might be another way to do it, but it doesn't sound any simpler. Since this is a new folder created by the end user, not sure what the "Reset" button will accomplish. Reset to what? There are default settings for the Sent Items Folder,&nbsp;but none for a new
 message folder.

            <p>The OP obviously hasn't created a new view, otherwise he'd understand what you were asking him.&nbsp; So he's "Customised" the view some way.&nbsp; The Reset although harder to get to would be easier for him to apply than repairing/rebuilding the view.</p>
<p>Let say you are using the Messages View in a sub folder of the Inbox.&nbsp; You "accidentally" pull the Subject column heading of the column headings.&nbsp; You now have a customised version of Messages in that Folder.&nbsp; If you go to Define Views it is listed as &lt;Current
 view settings&gt;, Click Reset and it will return to Messages it was based on&nbsp;and reinstate the missing column.&nbsp;&nbsp; Outlook retains the settings of the Default views.</p>

            Anti-virus software components insert themselves into the operating systems core and create files/folders/registry entries in various locations. It is not uncommon for some anti-virus programs to not completely uninstall itself using the the shortcut in
 it's All Program's Program folder or the usual method of <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-uninstall-programs-in-windows-xp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
Most anti-virus vendors provide <strong>clean-up utilities</strong> or <strong>removal tools</strong> on their web sites to remove remnants left behind after uninstalling, or for a failed uninstall or failed reinstall. Remnants include related registry entries,
 files and folders created in various areas of the OS. It's always best to download directly from the vendor's site to ensure you are using the most current version of the uninstall utility as it is not uncommon for third party hosting sites to have outdated
 versions which may not work properly. See <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/407147/answers-to-common-security-questions-best-practices/?p=2316638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to clarify if you are referring to the updates made with your Windows 8 or just the Skype app. If you are referring to the Skype app. It is likely you downloaded the one through the Microsoft Store. I suggest that you try on using the standalone
 version. Which would only release updates if there are additional features that our developers would incorporate to the new version. You can try on downloading the Skype for Windows through this link:

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Folder Pane &#47; Reduce space between mailboxes - Increase information density</h2>
                    <p>In Outlook 2013, the folder pane format dramatically changed VS the Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>There is way more space between the various mailboxes&nbsp; Information density has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 2010 version, I can have ~10 "favourite" folder on top...&nbsp; followed by 30 PST mailboxes (mix of imap and offline archives)</p>
<p>I can still expand my personal mailbox and still see everything on one screen without any scroll bars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 2013 version of Outlook, I can hardly get&nbsp;more than 10&nbsp;mailboxes at a time on the screen.&nbsp; I need to scroll constantly vertically.</p>
<p>I wish there was an option to reduce the wasted space by allowing the user to eliminate the space between each PST folders in that folder pane, and reduce the text size, to bring it similar to what it was in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any chance somebody looks into that ?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Security Essentials keeps stopping, why&#63;</h2>
                    Hi I am running Win XP 32 bit with SP3 &nbsp;and using Google Chrome. Every third or fourth start up the MSE icon is red, clicking on the start button has no effect and I have to run the command "services.msc" and double click on the Microsoft &nbsp;Antimalware
 Service, then click on stop and then click on start, even though it says it set to "automatic". This starts the program but I am not happy with this sort of fix. My installation was on to a brand new hard drive and no other anti virus program has ever been
 installed.
<div>This problem seems to be quite common from what I have seen when I was searching for an answer but to be fair I have MSE on 2 other machines running Win7 with no problems</div>
<div>I have Spybot and Malwarebytes and have scanned my system with both, these have been installed since initial windows as has C Cleaner. I cannot have a antivirus that stop and start when it likes. Any answer?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            First of all, I have heard many reports that Spybot have some functions (one of them is TeaTimer or something) that conflicts with MSE. So that may be a problem. I would just remove it because its better and safer alternative is Malwarebytes Free (neither
 Pro nor Trial).<br />
<br />
Now, for Malwarebytes. As I told you, Malwarebytes Free works well with MSE, but its Pro (or Trial) is many times seen to be conflicting with installed antivirus (although, I know, Malwarebytes persons claim it doesn't).<br />
<br />
Now, for CCleaner. CCleaner or any other registry cleaner is not supported by Microsoft, neither me. See this:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2563254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft support policy for the use of registry cleaning utilities</a>
<br />
<br />
If you want to use it (which atleast I would not recommend) then follow this:<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you use
<span>CCleaner</span> earlier than 4.03.4151 then:</span></p>
<b>CCleaner</b></span> --&gt; "<b>Application</b>" tab --&gt; Uncheck "<b>MS Antimalware</b>" in "<b>Windows</b>" section.</span><br />
<br />
Go through above points, perform required actions and please reply what you have done and what was its results and is your problem solved.<br />

<div>Thanks for your input, I never could get on with the "Tea Timer" part of spybot so don't have it loaded. I find that both Spybot and Malawarebytes seem to pick up things that the other one misses hence I run the two and as for C Cleaner I never use it
 to clean the registry for the reason stated.</div>
<div>I would also say that all the above are running on the family's machines without any problem as, was mine until recently.</div>
<div>It wont hurt to take Spybot and malawarebytes off my machine and see what the results are though. Will let you know.</div>

            I know that Malwarebytes and Spybot may or may not conflict with MSE. But why take chances?<br />
<br />
Its good that you didn't use CCleaner for registry cleaning. Please check once that "MS Antimalware" is unchecked or not (See my previous reply for finding it). If its checked then please uncheck it as it cleans some important files of MSE which cause MSE to
 report "Potentially Unprotected".<br />
<br />
Also, I would recommend you to run <a href="http://www.appremover.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AppRemover</a> to ensure no conflicting software is installed.<br />

            The problem as described is PRECISELY the same as I have!
<div><br />
<div>(Prior to posting, I followed the suggestion of trying "AppRemover" to see if it found anything&nbsp;</div>
<div>remaining from a "trial" anti-virus I had installed for a brief time but nothing more was found.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like the originator, I'm using CHROME as a browser and also CCleaner.</div>
<div>I checked CCleaner and it does NOT have -- and never has had -- a check box in the&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anti-malware value.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The last time this happened, I found a MicroSoft posting that said something about&nbsp;</div>
<div>"re-setting the system clock." &nbsp;Sure enough, my time setting had changed -- and THAT is&nbsp;</div>
<div>the second time this also has happened!</div>
<div>A re-boot, after setting the time correctly, brought M-S Security Essentiials back to the green&nbsp;</div>
<div>"protected" status.</div>
<div>However...</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I've re-initiated CHROME for another online session, I find the RED "unprotected" icon&nbsp;</div>
<div>again is present!</div>
<div>It's not very convenient to have to dump-out of an active, multi-window, browsing session just to&nbsp;</div>
<div>re-boot...for NO ACCEPTABLE REASON!</div>
<div>So I have to ask, just WHAT is going here?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Services? &nbsp;Checked: automatic and enabled</div>
<div>Old apps? Checked: swept for remnants, nothing found</div>
<div>CCleaner? &nbsp;Checked: no option, as specified, ever used and certainly NOT during these various &nbsp;</div>
<div>attempts to figure out this weird problem,</div>
<div>System time? &nbsp;Re-set properly but WHY is/was that necessary?</div>

I don't think so because Original Poster (OP) of the question said he installed MSE on brand new drive with nothing but MSE installed as antivirus. You said you installed a trial version. But you can follow this thread for your answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Prior to posting, I followed the suggestion of trying "AppRemover" to see if it found anything&nbsp;
<div>

I assume you have removed that trial version with AppRemover and re-running AppRemover is showing nothing but MSE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Like the originator, I'm using CHROME as a browser and also CCleaner.

From CCleaner version <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
4.03.4151, by default, 'Antimalware' value comes uncheked so I think you installed later version.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>

This is also a appreciable difference between OP's situation and yours.<br />
<br />
What I think is your PC is infected with virus and its somehow connected to Google Chrome {I have seen that latest version of ZeroAccess/Sirefef does infect Google programs to hide its
 identity, but I guess and wish its not in your case}. That's why when you open Google Chrome, virus activity starts and MSE goes red (MSE goes red for multiple reason, real time protection off {as you are suspecting}, very old update definitions or due to
 a critical threat found). Please open MSE when its red and see the reason it states behind being red.<br />
<br />
You must do a scan (whether MSE states virus detection or not) with <a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HitmanPro</a>.<br />
<br />
@Peter: You should also do a scan as recommended above.<br />

            Ok, I have now removed C Cleaner, Spybot and Malwarebytes the last 2 with App remover, NOTE it only found these two did not find MSE (if it was supposed to).
<div>And less than 24 hours later I have just started my machine to find the MSE icon red. The only way to restart it was using the run command "services.msc".</div>
<div>I have checked my machines time and it's ok.</div>
<div>I have access to 7 desktop machines, 2 laptops with 7 of them running XP the other 2 vista &amp; Win 7, they are all set up the same with the same programmes on, some home built and some factory built. Three of these 1 LT &amp; 2 DT are all showing a similar problem
 with MSE. There operating use is again very varied from business to Grand children aged 11.</div>
<div>From my experience and the number of reports of this problem on Google I find it difficult to believe that all the reports are down to conflicts with other programs. I am no expert but logic is dictating this conclusion&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;ERROR message when opening files in Word 2010&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>When I try to open a any kind of Word file, I get an error message - "Microsoft Word has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience."</p>
<p>The contents of the error report are:</p>
<p>AppName: winword.exe</p>
<p>AppVer: 14.0.4536.1000</p>
<p>AppStamp: 4af1d344</p>
<p>ModName: ntdll.dll</p>
<p>ModVer: 5.1.2600.5755</p>
<p>ModStamp: 49901d48</p>
<p>fDebug: 0</p>
<p>Offset: 0001b21a</p>
<p>Then it gives me the option to restart word. I say yes, but when Word opens, it's just a blank file, so I have to open the file again from within Word.</p>
<p>I have also tried un-installing Office and then re-installing it, but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is also the only Office program this occurs with.</p>
<p>Please HELP!</p>

            Okay I figured out the problem. In options I have Word automatically save files as a Word 97-2003 document (*.doc) instead of a regular Word document (*.docx). For some reason, with this option enabled, it wouldn't open files correctly. So I changed it
 to save files as a regular Word document, and now it opens files just fine. I'll just have to remember to save files as 97-2003 manually. Thanks for the help!

<p><span>I have a Nokia nuron 5230. After a master reset can you recover the apps you had installed before? The memory card still shows the same free space, so the apps are still there somewhere, I jsut can't find them through the file organizer yet</span></p>

<p>I don't think I backed them up, unelss the phone does that automatically?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a bunch of stuff, like opera mobile. I know I can get them back from ovi store, but I wanted to see if there was a way to restore it without having to reinstall and set them up all over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also the issue of memory. When I did a master reset, the memory card contents did not seem to change. So that means I have a lot of unusable files on there? If I reinstall the apps will the go to the same folder and replace the old files? I want
 to be efficient with my memory usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just installed x-plore and found some hidden folders in (E:\resource\apps and e:\system\apps). Including the opera mobile folder. But I didn't find some games. Where would java games be held? Also, these folders only have like 5 mb of memory, I'm looking
 for like 100+ mbs of stuff. I usualyl install apps through nokia pc suite. Does it download the .sis files to a temporary file somewhere and then install the apps?</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I was wondering if possible to get copies of Office 365 training videos.&nbsp; Specifically:</p>

<p>
</p><p>As well, what is the potential to edit the Video to add comments or remove items from the video to tailor to our establishment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Bradley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't find any official download sources for these training videos. My personal suggestions is that you could add these public video links to a training presentation. Send the presentation files to users, so they could visit these links to see the training.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems your initial purpose is to use these videos create a custom training video for your organization. You could use some screen record tool (e.g. record a video when you use Skype for Business to share presentation) to directly create a training video
 with samples in your tenant. </p>

    <title>My Family Setup Needed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomwhiteley66  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Family Setup Needed</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very short time ago I started experiencing problems with my Windows Phone 8.1, up until a few hours ago I could download apps, but then I tried a few minutes later and it said something about editing My Family settings and I couldn't download apps. I then
 went online and left My family so that I was not registered any more with those accounts. After this I created a new account as a Parent and added my old one (the one I use for the Windows Store on my phone) as the child. I then edited the settings so that
 I could download any apps, but still no luck. The message title is now "My Family Setup Needed", even though I have set one up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked other posts and questions regarding this matter but could not find a fix for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou,</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Tom</p>
