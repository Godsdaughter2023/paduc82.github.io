<h2>            Cant access office 365 online on my laptop</h2>
                    <p>Ive just activated my office 365 as I'm a student but when I go to try and use word on my laptop it only allows me to download the app for mobiles or tablets. Do I get a pc office license to download the apps on my laptop or can I just use it online?</p>
<p>On install status it says 'you can install office on up to 5 pcs, 5 tablets and 5 smartphones' but theres no download link for pc?</p>
<p>Elsewhere I'm unable to use it online on my laptop but I'm able to on my phone. Under subscriptions I have 'office online for education' which is what I'm trying to use at the moment but word online won't open on my laptop.</p>
<p>Any help/ideas would be appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            People receiving Spam from me, but nothing shows in my &#34;Sent&#34; folder</h2>
                    A couple of weeks ago people received spam supposedly from my account. I checked my "Sent" folder but nothing was sent from my account. I went ahead and changed my password anyway. I also created a fake contact at the beginning of my list so that if spam
 were being sent to my contacts from my account, that one would bounce and be an immediate alert to me. This week the same exact thing happened. People are receiving spam showing it to come from my account, my fake contact did not produce a bounce, and my "Sent"
 folder does not indicate&nbsp;that the spam was sent from my account.&nbsp;How is it that people are getting spam emails purporting to be from my account when I see no evidence that anything was sent from my account.

You shauld see the macro name in the window<br />
Select it so it goes blue.<br />

<p>So thank you for trying.&nbsp; I have now realised that if I put the same pixels in a row and a column they will perhaps produce a square.</p>

<h2>            Normalizing Data from multiple sources</h2>
                    <p>Hey -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm grabbing data from multiple different sources, and I'm trying to figure out a way that I could normalize the data(mainly the partner name) so that I could have a unique identifier when I want to do a lookup formula like VLOOKUP or Index Match. I'd even
 like to put it in Power Query or Power Pivot. For example, we have partner data from different sources with very similar names for the partners, but it's different enough that it doesn't allow me to easily merge the data together if I want to do lookup formula.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example of how the naming conventions for our partners from two different data sources differ.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Do you have a master list of partner names? You can take something like you have above and show all the potential names, then put the corresponding name you want for your report. Then VLOOKUP in a helper column on the master list to pull the names that you
 want. </p>

            <p>You are talking about a process known as ETL, Extract - Transform - Load, not "normalizing".&nbsp;&nbsp; Normalizing a database is the process of optimizing the DESIGN of the database, not the data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You already have the "extract" part down, you are getting data from external sources to load into your spreadsheet/database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you want to work on the "transform" part. Bascially what you want to do is read an incoming record, check the value in the partner name against your list of variations. If you find a match, insert the 'standard' value and write the record out to the
 "good" file.&nbsp; If you don't find a match, write the record out to the "error" File. If you don't want to split the incoming file into 2 file, you could set an "error" flag.&nbsp; After finishing the transform you have to go back and "manually" look in the error
 file, or rows marked as error.&nbsp; A person has to determine what the correct value is and either change or better, add a new row to the list of variations.&nbsp; Then you can re-run the transform to fix the remaining problem row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally you load the corrected rows to the final location. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a technique you may want to look into. It is called "Soundex". It is a technique originally designed for the US Census for translating names into a standard format based on the sound of the name. The benefit of the technique is that it reduces the
 effect of simple misspelling to group the names closer, if that is an issue with your data. You would create a new helper column for the soundex translation, then sort the file on the soundex column before doing the transform.

<h2>            Excel Worksheet and backups suddenly get Unreadable Content Message</h2>
                    
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><span>I have a 400 line Excel 2007 single worksheet&nbsp;spreadsheet.
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Each row has a Comment inserted in one of the cells. The Comment has been formatted as follows: "Size" has been adjusted, "Colors and Lines" has been adjusted by choosing "Color", "Fill Effects",
 "Picture", "Select Picture" and a .jpg file from a certain folder is selected.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>The result is that when I hover over this cell in any given row, the .jpg file that was placed in the Comment appears.&nbsp; There are other simple text comments in several other cells in the worksheet.</span></span></div>

<div><span><span>This all was working fine for me for several months, and I was making backups just to be safe.</span></span></div>

<div><span><span>Suddenly, I started getting "Excel found unreadable content in..." &nbsp;and it offered me to "recover the contents of this workbook". When I choose to recover, I get my entire worksheet back without
 any comments (ones with .jpgs and ones without), and I am told "Excel was able to open the file by repairing or removing the unreadable content".</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>I also get a chance to view the "log file" and this is its contents:</span></span></div>

<div><span>&nbsp;The same thing happens with all of my backups of this sheet, and those were backups of working versions of this sheet.</span></div>

<div><span>This is all unbelievably frustrating.</span></div>

<div><span>Does anyone think this was due to an automatic update by Microsoft?</span></div>

<div><span>Do you have any suggestions for recovery?</span></div>

<p>As the recovery log suggests, the issue might be with the picture/ Drawing type that you are trying to insert, My best bet is to recreate the worksheet as the issue seems to be with the sheet which is corrupted by the drawings, I tried searching for an answer
 on the net and most of them suggested to recreate the worksheet, it is difficult to predict until we reproduce the same issue. Perhaps if you can share the workbook, I can have a look at it or the other community users who visit might try different things
 to resolve your issue</p>
<p>SOLUTION : Recreate the sheet :)</p>

<p>Black Barron, thanks for taking time to respond and thanks for your suggestion</p>
<p>This is what I'm trying to avoid - recreating the sheet by having to manually insert the .jpg files into Comments - a real pain.</p>
<p>Actually, this happened once before (months ago) and that's what I had to do. Now it happened again, and if I spend the time to fix it, I fear it could just happen a 3rd time some day.</p>
<p>Also, all the comments I had that did not have a .jpg inserted are not recreatable.</p>
<p>What frustrates me, is that by virtue of the size of the file before I tell Excel to "recover" seems to be the size that has all the .jpg information still in there, whereas after it recovers the file, discarding the "so-called" unreadable part, the file
 is MUCH smaller, but has every cell filled&nbsp;with the correct data&nbsp;except for all&nbsp;the Comments that had .jpgs in it or not.</p>
<p>Taking another approach, and I don't have the talent to do this myself, one cell in each row has the name of the jpg file (without the path and the ".jpg" extension) of the image I want to insert into the comment in another cell in that row.&nbsp; If I could
 automate this process, the recreation of this spreadsheet would not be so daunting (though I'd still not be able to recover any of the comments that were just text comments - but I'd live with that). I've tried recording a Macro while going through the process,
 but was unsuccessful. I've set up the column that would contain the images with a blank comment in each cell&nbsp;adjusted to&nbsp;the proper size.&nbsp; So all I need to automate (after selecting the cell to work on) is:</p>
<p>Right-Click</p>
<p>choose Edit Comment</p>
<p>Right-Click (within the crosshatches)</p>
<p>choose Format Comment</p>
<p>click Colors and Lines</p>
<p>click Color</p>
<p>click Fill Effects</p>
<p>click Picture</p>
<p>click Select Picture (it remembers the most recent path to where my .jpgs are)</p>
<p>type in the file name (which is in another cell on the same row in my spreadsheet) and add ".jpg"</p>
<p>Return</p>
<p>click OK</p>
<p>click OK</p>
<p>and I'm done - move onto the next cell in that column and repeat</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I somehow automate that?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'd be glad to share the workbook. How do I get it to you? I don't see where I can attach it in here.</p>
<p>Thank you and anybody else so much for looking at this.</p>

<p><span>Office Version:Excel 2007</span></p>
<p><span>Operating System:Windows 7 (on x86)</span></p>
<p><span>I have macros that are used to link values from mulltiple sheets to one "exchange file" that holds values between all the other sheets. I get a similar error to that above when trying to call the "exchange file".</span></p>
<p><span>However...</span></p>
<p><span><span>Office Version:Excel 2007</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Operating System:Vista (on x86)</span></span></p>
<p>I do not get any error, and my macros work fine. The macros were initially created in Excel using a Vista machine and then a second set of similar spreadsheets (with the same macros) were created using a Windows 7 machine.</p>
<p>Could it be a Windows 7 and Excel 2007 problem?</p>

<p>I have a similar problem.&nbsp; I have a web application that allows users to save docs to a NAS server.&nbsp; The users can save 2007 docs and spreadsheets, but when they try to open them from the application they get the same error you show above.&nbsp; It happens to
 all spreadsheets regardless of what the spreadsheet contains.&nbsp;</p>

            I faced same problem today as well.<br />
Had pictures in the comment field<br />
Now Excel 2010 tells me<br />
<br />
"Excel found unreadable content .... "<br />
<br />
Excel was able to open the file by repairing or removing the unreadable content<br />
Removed Part: /xl/drawings/vmlDrawing1.vml part.&nbsp; (Drawing shape)"<br />
<br />
The pictures are gone !!!<br />
<br />
Have you found a fix other than recreating the sheet.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
It appears to be caused by deleting a picture comment.&nbsp; It deletes it fine, saves and closes excel correctly, but on re-opening, the error appears.<br />
<br />
I'm on Windows XP, Office 2007.&nbsp; I was able to get the original document back from before the so called "repair", from a backup tape.&nbsp; If I backsaved it to the old Excel format (Excel 97-2003) I don't experience the error again.<br />
<br />
That wont help if you're using functions from Excel 2007 onwards, and you can't get the original file back, but saved me!<br />

<p>Storage space for your Outlook.com email is ever-growing, but If the amount of email in your inbox and folders grows too fast, it may bump up against the account's quota, and you might not be able to send or receive any messages.

    <title>Methods of evaluation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edward gentile  say:</h3>
<h2>            Methods of evaluation</h2>
                    <p>As a long&nbsp; term&nbsp; insider&nbsp; I have&nbsp;&nbsp;often&nbsp; employed multiple&nbsp; partitions as part&nbsp; of&nbsp; my&nbsp; data&nbsp; backup&nbsp; straagies . This has gotten&nbsp; even&nbsp; better&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; ability&nbsp; of Windows&nbsp; Ten&nbsp; to create&nbsp; its&nbsp; own&nbsp; selectable&nbsp; boot&nbsp; menu . I am amazed&nbsp; however&nbsp; at the&nbsp;
 logical&nbsp; progression&nbsp; of this&nbsp; and the real&nbsp; time&nbsp; events&nbsp; that&nbsp; funnel&nbsp; the systems&nbsp; configurations&nbsp; into&nbsp; various&nbsp; and curious flavours and colors .</p>
<p>Having finally achived (as an initial release insider ) the holy grail of a permanently activated,&nbsp;no end date, RTM, &nbsp;I</p>
<p>have and will continue to participate in the fast ring. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE FOCUS</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my ssd machine,&nbsp;after getting preview 14267&nbsp;&nbsp; my Magic&nbsp; Jack&nbsp; lost&nbsp; the&nbsp; ability&nbsp; to download&nbsp; and display&nbsp; my call history and contact lists. This issue persists on all builds&nbsp; After 14257. Being&nbsp; aware&nbsp; of the fact&nbsp; that after build 10586 (RTM-2) The
 next builds are Previews and have expiration&nbsp; dates. OK, that's fine , great even,. Not wanting to miss the&nbsp; next&nbsp; build and fall behind&nbsp; and still needing the freedom&nbsp; my MJ&nbsp; provides and faced with the possibility of some unforeseen wrinkle&nbsp; in the insider&nbsp;
 program&nbsp; , I shrunk&nbsp; the C: partition&nbsp; , created a new -&nbsp;3rd partition and installed 10586 RTM.&nbsp; So I now have the earlier build non expiring on the same drive. MJ works fine and I boot the preview volume periodically and do some tweaks etc. on the previews..</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another machine also a 9879 preview I lost permanence so I imaged the drive to an external hdd&nbsp;wiped the disk and reinstalled&nbsp; 10586 . Fortunately&nbsp; and as explained&nbsp; in these&nbsp; forums&nbsp; the&nbsp; permanence was recovered.&nbsp; I then once again shrunk&nbsp; the&nbsp; drive
 and Installed the current&nbsp; preview&nbsp; to the new partition. Oh yes I figured I may as well Install An Enterprise&nbsp; Edition&nbsp; preview and keep getting up builds&nbsp;for it. The Enterprise&nbsp; can't&nbsp; activate but&nbsp; there&nbsp; is that&nbsp; evaluation&nbsp; window. So far COOL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A seven&nbsp; upgrade&nbsp; machine with home version also has builds going to alternate partition .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another machine had some Kernal issues related to the hdmi and vga drivers when multi booting (currently corrected).</p>
<p>I have one drive that is unshrinkabe with 10586 .1511 .&nbsp; That I swap out frequently in place of the ssd on ssd machine. It has permanence ,as does the ssd partition&nbsp;# 3 (system reserved&nbsp; is always&nbsp; partition 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well that's all for now , happy redundancy .Still have all music from my Windows&nbsp; 98 and even my resume from Windows&nbsp; 95.</p>
<p>Thank You Sincerely&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft&nbsp; and The Insider&nbsp; P</p>
<p>review Program </p>
<p>Any&nbsp; Questions .?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Happy to answer .</p>

<h3> judy m e  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual screen errors using Publisher 2010 on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>We recently ( 3 months ago) upgraded a computer to Windows 10 and operate dual screens.&nbsp; We find that if we use Publisher 2010 on the second screen we cannot make adjustments to pictures in documents as they immediately jump from the document into a different
 part of the screen, and the mouse has difficulty in dragging the back into place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This only happens in Publisher, all other programmes work fine suggesting and we have never had a problem with Windows 7 suggesting it is a Windows 10 andPublisher issue rather
 than a mouse problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can keep Publisher open and move it to the (smaller) laptop computer screen and the same document then edits perfectly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have updated Publisher to no avail.&nbsp; We have replaced the second screen and the same problem occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are currently resisting upgrading our other computers from windows 7 as we don't want to get the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to this problem?</p>

            <p>Yes I tried a repair and the same problem persists.&nbsp; &nbsp; I notice that there was a similar question from a Pedro Guerrero on the 21st February reporting the same problem, and that others have picked up on this question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This suggests that there is a wider issue here, and Microsoft should not be pushing people to move to Windows 10 when there are problems with compatibility with your own products.&nbsp; Should we just go back to&nbsp;Windows 7 until this is resolved? &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I understand that this a problem is one which Microsoft has been aware of for some time and it is disappointing that we have been encouraged to upgrade to windows 10 without any warning for users of Publisher that this might be a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft would
 have been awar that we use publisher because they kept sending messages saying our computers were compatible and could be upgraded to Windows 10 .&nbsp; Presumably there not enough users of Publisher for this to be seen as a problem however Microsoft has a dutry
 of care to its users.&nbsp; Incidentally I am still waiting for the telephone call that I asked for last week to try to resolve this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a very disappointing situation really, and one which I hope Microsoft will resolve for all those affected sooner rather than later.

            Thank you David, but unfortunately we have already tried this, and turned off the snap function as well&nbsp; - all to no avail.&nbsp; Interestingly we have the same problem with all our computers and in some cases everything goes to the left and in others to the
 right depending on the arrangement of the second screen.

            <p>It seems that Win 10 is not as ready for extreme high resolution and multiple monitors as advertised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the 3rd Office application I've noticed reports of display issues with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been many reports of "scaling" issues in PowerPoint on dual monitor setups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in the last week or so I've seen reports that Excel does not handle multiple monitor support very well beyond a single external monitor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, expecting MS to fix your apparent problem in Publisher 2010 is a waste of time.&nbsp; MS will say that there are not enough 2010 Publisher users with this problem to dedicate time/money to a fix.&nbsp; They will simply recommend you upgrade to Win 10 and
 2016 (but there is no guarantee that this will work better!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>FYI: posting a request on this forum asking for a call from MS support is simply wasting electrons.&nbsp; MS Support does NOT "officially" monitor this forum. There are a few MS Support "engineers" who participate in the forum, but they will NOT initiate phone
 calls. There have been many reports on this forum that even when someone talks to MS phone support and they are given a promise of a call back by MS, the call back does not happen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to talk to MS Support you will have to initiate the call yourself!&nbsp; First, check with your IT department to find out if you have a MS site license that includes a dedicated phone support number. If you do, you will get infinitely better support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have to contact standard MS support you will have to fight your way past front line support who will be absolutely clueless about this problem.&nbsp; When you phone in, the first thing you should do is ask for a trouble ticket number. The second thing
 is to ask to be transferred to 2nd level support (aka supervisor). They will force you to go through their script, but keep asking. You need a trouble ticket because this sort of esoteric problem will be hard to find a real expert who can help you, so you
 will be playing phone tag as they start transferring you around.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when they claim to be transferring you, they also have an unfortunate propensity for "accidentally" disconnecting your call ... oops ... Thus you need the trouble ticket when
 you call back ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>PS, for this sort of problem I personally strongly prefer using online chat support. You talk to the same group of support techs, but there are a few advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>No ESL accent issues</span></li><li><span>Provides you with an instant time stamped transcript</span></li><li><span>When you get transferred to the “right” person, they can review the history</span></li><li><span>If they don’t read the history, you can copy / paste the past conversation to them, saving you having to repeat yourself</span></li><li><span>They are more likely to go off line to ask other people for help (good for you)</span></li><li><span>You don’t have to listen to “elevator muzak” when they are off line</span></li><li><span>You have 2 hands free to surf the web when they are not talking to you.
</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>For some reason, I found that waiting for online chat responses intrinsically
<strong>LESS</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>frustrating than cradling the phone headset and listening to elevator muzak.
</span></p>
<p>.</p>
<p><span>Make sure to copy the text from the chat window and save it before closing the chat window. It is handy to have a timestamped copy of the conversation, if only to publish it on the internet ... &lt;evil grin&gt;</span></p>

Solved this frustrating issue for me! (new laptop with Windows 10/publisher 2016 - same software/windows versions as previous laptop but issue was new).

            This is helpful for me in Publisher2016. However disabling a major functionality is quite awful, as easy alignment is one fo the key features I use on a daily basis. Quite annoying.<br />

            This "fix" did work, however, I agree with Maria. This is a major problem in Publisher2016 using Win10. I rely on guides for alignment. Publisher is one of the major reasons for use of 2 monitors!&nbsp;

<h2>            Copied and renamed form in database but Access saves changes I make in new form to old form</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need 2 forms in my database that track two different projects. I thought I could just copy my existing form for one project and rename the new form to the name of the other project and be able to work in the new form without Access changing the old form;
 however, when I deleted some fields/made some changes in the new form's subform, the changes were also made in the old form's subform!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both my new and old forms are set up as a main form with a continuous subform (obviously b/c they are copies of one another). The new form (Main and Subform) are based on different tables than the old form (the basis for both old and new forms are: one table
 for the main form and one for the subform)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to rename the fields in the tables for my new form b/c they do have some of the same names as tables that are the basis for my old form?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT: </strong>Or is it b/c I have the same toggle buttons with the same VBA code in the new form, and I should rename my buttons and the code underneath? The buttons just make a comment field visible and I can press it again and hide the field.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did press the buttons in the new form to see if it work--to see if I need to rename them. After I did that, I opened the old form to see if the code pointed to the old form and made the comment fields visible there and it didn't. Maybe that made Access
 link the two forms(?).</p>
<p><strong>END EDIT</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for any help!<br />

            <p>A subform is a separate object - see the SourceObject property.</p>
<p>So you would make a copy of the subform as well, then set the SourceObject in the second form to this new subform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the changes between the two forms are minor, it may be better to write a few lines of VBA to show or hide certain fields in one set of forms.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word templates files &#40;Dotx&#41; are not syncing with the OneDrive Mac client</h2>
                    <p>I am running into an issue with dotx files not syncing with the OneDrive Mac client on an Office 365 Business account. If I place that file in the sync location, I get an sync problem error "an item couldn't be uploaded to OneDrive." Below are the troubleshooting
 steps I have tried so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Created new template with a single word, same issue</li><li>Copied and removed both folders with templates, renamed the folders and moved backed to the sync location. The folders and non-dotx files sync properly, but not the dotx files.</li><li>Checked for any files or folders with symbols not allowed, found none</li><li>Reset OneDrive using ResetOneDriveAppStandalone.command, same issue</li><li>Uninstalled OneDrive and reinstalled, same issue</li><li>On a Windows 10 machine, the sync is working properly for the dotx files</li><li>If I add a dotx file via the Windows 10 machine, it does show up on the Mac, but then get the "an item couldn't be uploaded sync error and any changes I make on the Mac side will not get sync'd back.</li></ol>

<p>Hi Qing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't get a private message from you, but the dotx files are now syncing with newly created ones and the previously created ones. I wish I could say that I did something to fix it, but I have not changed or updated my setup since I originally posted.
 As far as when the issue started, I just installed and started using OneDrive within the last two weeks and everything was syncing just fine except for any dotx files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>I have a old Skype account created with Facebook login that more than 6 year ago.</p>

<p>I'm usually able to login to Skype using my old Skype account but I have recently updated to a new Skype Version on my mac and there is no "login with Facebook" button nor entring the login "Facebook:myfirstname.lastname" work.</p>
<p>I'm wonderling if my old Skype account can be converted to a proper Microsoft account or is there a way to login to Skype using old Skype account?</p>
<p>I could create a new Microsoft account for using Skype but my contacts are on my old Skype account.<br />

<p>I am new at this, so please be patient. The "extra" folders are not in their own folder set. They are included with other similar folders (eg. Calendar, Contacts,etc.). The pattern is:</p>
<p><em>Contacts</em>- my e-mail address (this folder is empty)</p>
<p><em>Contacts</em> (this has all of the relevant data)</p>
<p><em>Suggested Contacts</em>- my e-mail address</p>
<p>Contacts - deleted items archive</p>
<p><em>Suggested Contacts</em>- Deleted items archive</p>
<p>The pattern is similar for the other folder categories (calendar, tasks, etc.). When I right-click on the folder only titled "Contacts", I can delete it but it, of course, has all of the relavant data. When I try to delete the Contact folder followed by
 my e-mail adddress, the delete option is grayed out.</p>
<p>I am not sure what you mean by "root" in the folder set. Please clarify.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            So, the 19 and growing  suggested contact folder I have will just eventually take over my entire outlook app and I will just have to look for a more reliable program that doesn't eat itself, is that what you are saying??? 



In my 25+ years selling and supporting Microsoft products, this perhaps is the final straw that will drive me to find another vendor for many apps for myself and my clients. 



Do you have any idea how many hours I waste every month telling people that they just have to live with this **** as long as they stay with MS Outlook? 



this is the biggest, most unbelievable piece of **** that I have  seen in all my 60+ years walking this earth. 



I will simply chose some pertinent quotes from my searches stating that there is nothing that can be done, that everyone just has to live with this ****, and to quit bothering me about it and yell at Microsoft and provide them with the email contacts and phone numbers in my outlook contacts.

            <p>You have 19 accounts in your profile each with their own data file or 1 data file with 19 suggested contacts folders?
</p>
<p>The first (1 suggested contacts folder per data file or mailbox) is by design. If you have more than 1 per data file, something is wrong.
</p>
<p>The purpose of suggested contacts is save addresses you send mail to who are not in your contacts - without cluttering up your contacts folder. You can configure Outlook to not save these contacts but if you delete the folder (using MFCMapi) it will come
 back. </p>
<p>You can hide the folders you don't use on the navigation modules by creating groups (i call my groups "Hide")&nbsp;and dragging the folders to the group and collapsing it.

<p>The E-mail addresses in the Suggested Contacts folder are addresses that are not in your Contacts folder and&nbsp;to which you've sent messages&nbsp;&nbsp; Control this on File&gt;Options&gt;Contacts.&nbsp; At the bottom is the "Suggested contacts" section.&nbsp; Uncheck the option there.</p>

            I have three email accounts and a new iPhone replacing a Blackberry. <br />
<br />
I want to live out of one default calendar.&nbsp; The iCloud created a new calendar.&nbsp; It apparently copied my default Outlook Data File calendar to an iCloud calendar.&nbsp; I moved the iCloud calendar to the top of the calendars list, and declared it default.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
However, when I add a new calendar item from the Home &gt; Mail &gt; New Items &gt; Appointment screen, it places that on an unused Outlook Data File calendar.&nbsp; When I create a new appointment from the calendar screen, it goes to the iCloud screen.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I don't know where to find how to make everywhere in Outlook 2010 use the same default calendar.&nbsp; Can you help?&nbsp; Thanks, BH<br />

            The "default" depends on which data file you are viewing. When you view the account's inbox, the default is it's calendar; when you view the iCloud and start a new appt, that is where new appointments are saved. ICloud should move new appt to the iCloud
 calendar or you can <a href="http://www.codetwo.com/sync-for-icloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">use an addin to sync

            <p>Thanks Diane,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting that Microsoft's design approach was, "If you set up an appointment at your desk/PC, you set it up on one calendar.&nbsp; If you set up an appointment away from your desk on an iPhone, you set it up on another calendar."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that most users don't think in terms of databases; we think in terms of task or functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The logical problem with synchronization is that it assumes multiple databases.&nbsp; In terms of calendars and contacts, I strongly suspect many users would really prefer a single database - not multiple ones that need to be synchronized.&nbsp; There are plusses
 and minuses to either approach of course, but I wish Microsoft gave the user the choice.&nbsp; Maybe you have more voice in design than most of us.&nbsp; Again, thanks, BH</p>

    <title>Formatting page numbers on index ranges - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maaml  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formatting page numbers on index ranges</h2>
                    When defining an index reference as a range something weird happens to the number formatting. A defined range of 23-39 is shown as 23-29. However, for page numbers above 100 Word limits the characters shown, 103-109 becomes 103-9 and 123-139 becomes 123-39.
 Is there a way to ALWAYS show the full page numbers?

            The way Word displays page ranges was probably based on the prescriptions of, say, the
<em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> in the era when Word was first coded; it hasn't been changed in the decades since even though style recommendations have changed over the years. As Stefan says, there doesn't seem to be any way to change it. You might want to

            We have figured out what was causing the issue. With this version of IE, the normal bar asking about pop-ups&nbsp;doesn't appear in the browser, so it was a pop-up blocker causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Once the browser was upgraded the message "Do you want to allow pop-ups" appeared in IE. When we said NO, the report did not populate correctly, but if you said ALLOW then it did.

<h2>            Nokia E51 RTSP and streaming</h2>
                    hello everybody.<br />
i have a very interesting problem with my nokia e51. I goes like this:<br />
- e51, fresh phone, 2 days old, no software installed, tried to stream something from m.youtube.com (rtsp://... like links). It does open the built in real player, it connects to the server, but nothing else happens next.<br />
- tried also with an audio streaming link(rtsp protocol as well), real player opens, it connect to the server, it transfers the name of the station and track, but that is it. Nothing else, no sound, and finally no connection to server.<br />
- i installed nokia internet radio because this one supports http streaming links. this work well through wifi. i also tried the rtsp link in internet radio, but it says buffering till 100% than "Radio playback failed!"<br />
- .3gp and .aac and .m4a files saved on the device have no problem in running.<br />
- does anyone have any ideea what could be the problem? could itt be a limiting done by the softwware of the phone? (like not accepting rtsp protocol??)<br />
<br />
The phone is a nokia e51, vodafone branded.<br />

            Open realplayer and go to the settings menu and check the network tab. The access point should be set to the one you want to use (I presume a wifi access point). I find that realplayer frequntly chages this setting back to Vodafone Live, even though it
 is not a vodafone phone, and that access point is not valid for my SIM.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening a .xls file from Sharepoint causes Excel to think the file is corrupt</h2>
                    <p>Excel files opened from Sharepoint give Excel errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cannot open the file&nbsp;&lt;file name&gt;&nbsp;because the file format or file extension is not valid"</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>"The file format and extension of &lt;file name&gt; don't match"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I tell Excel to open the file anyway, I'm presented with a blank workbook. I've tried to suppress the&nbsp;message by setting ExtensionHardening to 0 in the registry, but the file still opens blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I right click and save the file locally before opening it, it opens just fine. Why does opening a file directly from SharePoint make&nbsp;Excel think the file is corrupt?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This scenario occurs with Excel 2016 and possibly 2007. Not sure what version of SharePoint we're using.</p>

            Hi Jan,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update. Which kind of environment do you have set up? Is it Skype for Business Hybrid/Server deployment or purely Skype for Business Online?<br />
<br />
Does this issue happen to any other user in your organization?<br />
<br />
Please try to troubleshoot this issue via using another PC <em>(e.g. any non-problematic colleague’s Pc)</em> or different network environment to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<h2>            Outlook isn&#39;t working right after windows update on windows 10 &#34;Pro&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a recent update windows did on its own, Outlook would not start. It hung up on the "processing" cue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got it fixed by deleting .ost files per some instructions here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All was going well until I went to look at my address book, and NONE of the addresses were there, although when I type an address I get a few contacts under whatever letters I type in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying to import an address backup, Outlook does not want to start again, going back to the processing screen and staying there again. It does work in safe mode.<br />
<br />
Also...I'm now getting a prompt that asks if I will allow windows to make changes to my computer when I start Outlook up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

    <title>No upgrade option for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calsilver  say:</h3>
<h2>            No upgrade option for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a Lumia 640 XL&nbsp;LTE running Windows 8.1 Update 2.&nbsp; I recently installed the Upgrade Advisor and it tells me that an upgrade to Windows 10 is available for my phone.&nbsp; It instructs me to go to Phone Update in Settings to download it.&nbsp; When I go there,
 there is nothing displayed ,it just says downloading updates 0% and doesn't change&nbsp;and when I press download it doesn't do anything.&nbsp; I looked online at some videos and they show the Upgrade Advisor giving you a box to tick saying "Enable Windows 10 download"
 but I'm not getting that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very frustrating.&nbsp; I only really want Windows 10 because my Fitbit won't run with 8.&nbsp; The phone is relatively new and I'm not buying a new one just to use my activity tracker.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this happened to anyone else? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Car </p>
