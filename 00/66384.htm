            Hi Mark.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'd install VLC player which is the most highly regarded and will pick up any file types that WMP cannot play if you install it at all defaults, plays DVD's for free.  
<br /><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a>
<br />
<br />Did you import the files via USB cable as this may mean they were corrupted and isn't reliable to always work.  For this reason I'd use iCloud to wirelessly sync them in the background so you effortlessly have an uncorrupted copy on phone and PC.  You can do the same for other devices with OneDrive.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            No you have not lost the original file. Apparently you have copied (or maybe moved, copied and deleted) the file from the phone to the PC.
<br />
<br />Not surprisingly that is a apple photo file extension:
<br /><a href="https://file.org/extension/aae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://file.org/extension/aae</a>
<br />
<br />This page says that NotePad can open this file type:
<br /><a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/aae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://fileinfo.com/extension/aae</a>
<br />
<br />In that case you probably won't need a separate viewer application.
<br />
<br />This page has a link to an app that can open this file type (and many others):
<br /><a href="https://file.org/free-download/free-file-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://file.org/free-download/free-file-viewer</a>
<br />
<br />Sorry, I have not tried the tool myself.
<br />
<br />This page offers to "analyze" your AAE file (useful if you have a problem opening the file).
<br /><a href="https://www.solvusoft.com/en/file-extensions/file-extension-aae/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.solvusoft.com/en/file-extensions/fi...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />So, after viewing the file, see if it has an option to SAVE AS to a new format.

For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

            Hi Mark, the aae file is not a video or image file, it contains a list of edits you made to photos on your iPhone. 
<br />
<br />It is not meant to be played on a PC
<br />
<br />Right click an aae file and choose 'Open With' - Notepad
<br />
<br />You will see all it contains is some tagged code, that's all !

            Even with the snap feature turned on, you have to ram your mouse pointer into the side of the screen while dragging a program. &nbsp;It's very difficult to accidentally trigger it. &nbsp;You probably never drag a window to the edge and then
<i>keep dragging until your pointer bumps into the edge</i>, do you?
<div><br />
<div>Note that if you have selected "Prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen", and it still happens, then it is due to some other program running on your computer, such as Asus MultiFrame.</div>

<p>It worked under winxp because HP produced software/driver installation for that win version only.</p>

    <title>Critical_Process_Died - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dirk.burger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Critical_Process_Died</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 by upgrading from Windows 8.1, on a high spec Lenovo Thinkpad (i7, Solid State HD 256 GB, 8 Gb Memory etc), which is not more than a year old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have work related software installed - it is my work laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When starting up the laptop I get the&nbsp;error message "Critical_Process_Died" - I get this message almost every time I start up the laptop. Yesterday it was followed by a couple of other crtitical messages which I unfortunately did not record - but I was afraid
 of losing my "system".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely frustrating (I cant get OneDrive to sync either - but that is posted on a different post).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all very frustrating -&nbsp;but is there someone that knows how to fix this error&nbsp;on Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Sahil,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having similar computer operating system problems as Dirk.Burger, that were described in his Aug.25,'15 question. However if, a big 'if', the computer manages to boot it does not remain operating long enough to implement your suggested fixes before
 BSOD displaying the message, Stop Code: CRITICAL PROCESS DIED, appears. From there I find the only next step is to 'force off' the computer and try re-boot again, and again, unfortunately with the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I so much want to get rid of Windows 10, go back to a simpler, pre-10 world when my computer worked reliably. What do you suggest?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geoff</p>

Please visit <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/diag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/diag/</a> &nbsp;and run the diagnostics.&nbsp; That will validate the windows and the office.&nbsp; You will need to install an active x component, but once we rule that out there

            well, the oganotifier is a way for windows to validate itself.&nbsp; I've never owned an illegal copy of windows, and I've never had that pop up before.&nbsp; If you have validated your machine at the above link, and it's legal, you can simply google for oginotifier.msi
 and follow some of the instructions that will turn up.<br />
<br />
***note:&nbsp; I've never performed any of the suggested work-arounds, so you are doing this on your own, without support***<br />

</span><span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span><span><br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your question!<strong><span><br />
</span></strong></span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><span>“Side by Side architecture uses a trick in a file called a 'manifest' to call a special system file instead of the regular Vista system file
 (a .dll). The error is saying that finding that special dll written for that application is not working somehow. (side-by-side configuration is incorrect)”</span></span><span><br />
<br />
I)</span><strong><span> Download, install and run the windows cleanup utility to remove any remaining files from the previous installation.</span></strong><span><br />
Link to download cleanup utility: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301/</a><br />
</span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><br />
</span><span>II)</span><span>&nbsp;<strong>You
 can also try using the System File Checker to locate corrupt or missing Vista files.<span><br />
</span></strong></span><span>Here's an article on that:

<p><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>III) </span><span>Try installing iTunes from a
<strong>new user account</strong> with administrative rights. If you do not have any other account on the computer, follow these steps to create a new account.<br />
<span><br />
-Open User Accounts by clicking the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Start</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>button, clicking</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>User Accounts and Family Safety</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>(or
 clicking</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>User Accounts</strong>, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>User Accounts</strong>.</span><br />
</span><br />
- Click<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Manage another account</strong>.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span><br />
<br />
- Click<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Create a new account</strong>.</span><br />
<br />
- Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Create Account</strong>.</span><br />
<br />
<span><span>IV) </span></span><span><span>If the first three steps do not work, w</span></span><span><span>e
 would need to find out exactly which dll file is causing this</span>. For this, you would need to collect some data from the “<strong>event viewer</strong>”.<br />
</span><span><span><br />
</span></span><span>1) Click
<strong>start</strong>, type <strong>event viewer</strong> in the <strong>start search</strong>. Click on event viewer to open it.<br />
2) Once on the event viewer, expand “<strong>Windows Logs</strong>” and select “<strong>Application</strong>”.<br />
3) Look in for error message “</span><span><span>side-by-side configuration is incorrect</span></span><span>”.<br />
4) Click on the error to open it.<br />
5) Note down the data provided in the general tab and let us know.<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>Ive recently had problems with my syrface RT, which Microsoft has told me I will need a new devise. The screen is frozen on the black Surface page. I just wondered does anybody know if I can somehow retrieve all my data from the Hardrive. I have months worth
 of travelling pics on it and am devastated if they're all lost for good. Any help woul be amazing. Microsoft have basically told me they're unable to help and that the drive will be wiped once they receive the device.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi CarysTrezise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your question! I am sorry to hear that your device is stuck on the Surface logo screen. I'll try my best to get your device to start working again, especially since you have many traveling pictures saved and you definitely wouldn't
 want to lose them.</p>
<p>Have you taken a look at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/windows-stops-responding#StuckStartupLogo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>? </p>
<p>There are some troubleshooting steps provided for when you are stuck on the Surface startup logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>:&nbsp; Press the power button on your Surface and hold it down for 10 seconds.<br />
This ensures that Surface shuts down instead of just going to sleep.<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>:&nbsp;Next, press the power button again to turn Surface back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you were able to get past the logo screen by following those steps.<br />
If not, please report back to me and we will try other troubleshooting methods.</p>
        </p>

            <p>I would definately invest some time in making the most of the community here to try and breathe life back into your surface rt before you send it to microsoft, since it is true, there is no (cheap) way to access the ssd inside the surface if the os is corrupted
 beyond&nbsp; 'refresh' .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose a specialized data recovery company might be able to open up your surface and recover data from the hynix ssd chip on board, but most likely this means the loss of your surface rt as it is not made to be serviced internally easily.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first&nbsp;thing I did was put a micro sd in mine, and locate all libraries onto the sd card, so that if anything happened to the s2 internals, all such data was still on a recoverable drive.</p>
<p>Skydrive is also handy in this respect. </p>

            <p>Hi there Shiho</p>
<p>
</p><p>ive spent around 2 hours with another colleague from Microsoft on this matter. And they have advised that the tablet will have to be replaced. I've taken my tablet to a data retriever but they had no luck in retrieving my data. He thinks the flash drive
 has failed. Does this mean there is no other way to retrieve my data? To be honest I'd rather get my data/pics over replacing the tablet. Do you know of any other way I can retrieve my data?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>ive taken my surface to a data retriever specialist, however he was unable to retrieve the data and seems to believe the flash drive has failed. If the flash drive has failed can I still get someone to access the SSD chip or is this a pointless thing to
 do?</p>
<p>id rather retrieve my data than keep the tablet to be honest.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Carys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It máy be possible for a data retrieval specialist to connect the ssd to a controller and access the data on it..</p>
<p>SSD's do indeed fail at a level which makes them totally inaccessible though, and it is likely about 80% of the work to get to the point of being able to determine if this is the case or not - a point where they are able to power and interface the ssd chip.
 In other words, wether good results are gotten or not makes little difference in the bill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you chose for the Surface to encrypt itself with Bitlocker and are not in posession of the key, that would complicate things beyond the plausibly feasable though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would approach several companies, and ask for hm what is the word I am looking for in English - an estimate of the final bill from all of them, and a description of how they intend to go about things,&nbsp;and decide if it is worth it to you. Since this is
 all very delicate stuff, and any blunder they make can be signed off to 'faulty hardware'&nbsp; I would definately spend some time checking out the reputations of these companies before committing to one.</p>

<h3> teleputer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Usb install booting black screen with no cursor</h2>
                    <p>So heres what happened, I desired to move from windows to linux mint, i really liked it, games ran just as good with the new Valve Proton Engine, but then i desired to use my other ssd to make my computer run both windows and linux mint, I have done this
 before on my dell optiplex 790 and it was flawless, and i have installed windows 10 on my custom computer multiple times before and i had no problems with it, but this time it shows the normal boot screen with "Hit F12 for Boot Options" as normal i hit it
 boot to the USB, it shows the circling dots and then a black screen, the keyboard and mouse seem to be functioning properly, and i tried all my video outputs, and the USB drive was not Reading or Writing anything, so i tried my other Drive that was only 16
 GBs but it did the same thing, and i did use the Windows provided software to make the drive, so then i tried out the hard drive from my optiplex ..... it did the same thing, oh well, now i need the help of the community to fix it<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</p>

            Hi Tele.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />If you want to Dual Boot with Linux see this guide:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/dual-boot-windows-10-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/dual-boot-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Teleputer,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

    <title>Why is my Xbox One headset adapter not working&#63; I bought the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neurologicill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my Xbox One headset adapter not working&#63; I bought the proper cable adapter with it.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! Recently, my friend gave me his headset adapter because he said he ordered a new pair of Turtle Beaches and they came with its own adapter.</p>
<p>He gave me ONLY the adapter though, and said I'd need the conversion cable so to look online for something that would work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The port that is in the Xbox One Headset adapter is 3.5mm. But the turtlebeach mic cable is 2.5mm. So logically, I would need a 3.5mm male to 2.5mm female adapter. Well I bought one and here's the link so you can know what I bought.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/400706935066?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ebay.com/itm/400706935066?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649</a></p>

<p>Anyways, once I received this cable adapter, I plugged in my Headset adapter into my controller. It fit perfectly, obviously. Then I plugged in the 3.5mm male side of the cable adapter into the headset adapter and it fit perfectly. Then I plugged in my turtle
 beach 2.5mm into the other end of the cable adapter and it fit perfectly.</p>
<p>But when I go into lobbies, or in parties, no one can hear my voice. The adapter I bought fits perfectly. Can someone please explain?</p>

<p>I went to settings &gt; system &gt; update controller and it said "Controller is up to date". So I'm pretty sure I haven't missed any controller updates. I did a hard restart on my xbox one whenever everything was plugged in and it still isn't detecting my voice.</p>
<p>Any other advice? </p>

<p>Not all of the Turtle Beach headsets are compatible with the X1. &nbsp;You might not have a compatible headset. Compatible headsets are XP510, EarForce XP Seven's, XP400, &amp; X42. &nbsp;If you don't have one of those it's not going to work.</p>

<p>So I'm guessing my x11's won't work? I am not a fan of wireless headsets due to battery and charging stations. Wired headsets are always reliable and you never have to change anything. So I've used x11's for a while now.</p>
<p>I don't understand why they wouldn't be compatible. I quite literally plug my audio cables into the back on "Audio out" port in my TV and I can hear footsteps and everything properly. But the only thing I can't do is use the mic on it. But its all just a
 headphone jack essentially so how does compatibility even come into play? </p>

<p>Are your Turtle Beach's the PX11's; they can be used on PS3/360 and PC? &nbsp;I can't find any just x11's on Turtle Beach's website. &nbsp;I believe it has something to do with the sound/audio codec. &nbsp;I know we had this discussion here on the forums right after the
 X1 came out and TB released a list of compatible headsets.</p>

<p>I will break down how my current gaming set up is and was.</p>
<p>I have used X11's for a very long time simply because I enjoy wired headsets 1000x more than wireless. On my xbox 360, I plugged up the red &amp; white cables into the aux cord, and the mic cable simply went into the controller. Wa-la, I can chat and hear game
 audio.</p>
<p>Now that I have migrated to the Xbox One, I plug up my red and white cables to the "audio out" on my tv. By doing that, I can hear everyones footsteps in a CoD match and I have very nice sound quality on games. But I cannot chat because there is nothing
 to plug the mic cable into.</p>
<p>My friend gave me a Xbox One Headset Adapter, but just the adapter. No cables. So I bought a 3.5mm male to 2.5mm female converter online. So now my set up is, for game audio I have my red &amp; white plugins in the "audio out" on the back of my HDTV. And I have
 the Xbox One Headset adapter plugged into my controller with the 3.5mm side of the converter I bought online plugged into it. Then I have my X11 mic cable plugged into the 2.5mm female side of the converter.</p>
<p>However, even though all the hardware matches, I cannot chat through the X11 mic.</p>

<p>Hm interesting. My sons setup is similar with x12. I have it plugged into the TV audio out. My x12 has a cord to plug the mic/amp into as well. So I have that plugged with a USB plugged into the x1. Sounds like you may not have that so my guess is the x11
 isn't compatible. I could be wrong though &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Rosemary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merging several folders into one depends on which folders are merging. For us to provide the best resolution possible, we'll be needing additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you trying to merge folders in Windows Explorer?</li><li>Which folders are you trying to merge? Is it the main folders or subfolders?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the folders for a better view?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you're trying to merge subfolders in Windows Explorer, you can easily create a new folder and move the files or folders manually to the new folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

            I'm trying in windows explorer to merge a number of folders with pictures in them. Manually doing it is time consuming. I would've thought that you could highlight the folders and select a "merge folders" option. Interesting that this feature is not available.

    <title>Unable to connect to internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> advent123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to connect to internet</h2>
                    <p>I had to reinstall Win 7 64 because my desktop was sluggish and unresponsive. After the reinstall I lost several device drivers including the Ethernet Controller driver. I managed to reinstall all the drivers (I think). The network icon at the bottom right
 of the tray has no longer the red band across it. I know that I fixed something with the driver installs. However, I still cannot access the internet. When I click on the network icon I am prompted to enter my password, which I assume is the long password
 on my Frontier Communications modem. But it shows that the "modem has reported an error (error 651)" and keeps "redialing". Am I missing something in the setup? Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I appreciate your efforts towards resolving this issue. I will certainly help you with the issue. This issue usually occurs when the driver is missing or corrupt. I would like to ask you a few questions.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What type of installation you have performed?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>What happens when you try to connect to internet?</span></li><li><span>What is the status of Network Adaptor in device manager?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: <strong>Use the Internet Connection troubleshooter</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This will diagnose all the common issues and fix them automatically.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Open the Internet Connections troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Click View all, and then click Internet Connection troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Step 2: <strong>Try disabling your anti-virus software </strong>and then try to establish the connection</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Step 3: <strong>Reset TCP/IP</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You can try to reset TCP/IP if you have Internet connection issues. This article describes two ways to reset TCP/IP.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong><span> <span><br />
If the first method didn't fix the issue I would suggest you to try the steps in the article and check if it helps.<br />

            <p>I believe your Internet service is DSL using PPPOE.&nbsp;&nbsp; This requires a log on using your Frontier account user name and password.&nbsp; (Dialing refers to attempts by the modem to connect.)&nbsp; That log on is often saved in a profile in the modem.&nbsp; (It is not normally
 shown on the modem.)&nbsp; Alternatively, Windows can be configured for a broadband type of connection, in which case you have to enter it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Did you have to log on before you reinstalled Windows 7?&nbsp; If not, there is probably a user name and password saved in your DSL modem.&nbsp; In that case you should be using Local Area Connection and not Broadband as your connection type.&nbsp; Check the connection
 type shown in Network and Sharing Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to resolve this it would be best to call Frontier support.&nbsp; They should be able to help you connect.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes to the PC prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2. If yes, can you specify if it is an update or software change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have made changes with respect to updates, perform System Restore which will revert your PC back to the time when the update was installed along with the change in Cortana. To learn how to perform the above, refer to the section
<strong>Restore from a System Restore point</strong> provided in the link below&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc, but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring.
</p>
<p>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss
 of important files as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>I see there are several threads on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened to me on my 32 bit clean W10 AU install. My main 64 bit PC is unaffected although the majority of reports will obviously&nbsp;be for x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have proved by means of a restored disc image from early September that the issue seems to be related to some Windows feature or app that is automatically updated. It has nothing to do with the latest cumulative update. The restored image was fine for
 a few minutes and then the problem occurred, presumably as Windows launches into an update and install routine. The restored image 'has no knowledge' of the issues. It was a perfect working image at the time created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This 32 bit PC has had two notifications (the Windows notifications at bottom right) keep randomly appearing over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: OneDrive needs your attention to finish installing files ? I have no idea what that is about as&nbsp;OneDrive is up to date and of the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2:&nbsp;We are installing some new features to your PC. Again, I have no idea what that is about either as nothing obvious shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have applied the 'fix' of changing regions and then changing back again which, although it worked at first has again reverted to the white Cortana search box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So its over to you guys at MS. The problem is real that's for sure, and it seems to be&nbsp;unrelated to anything anyone is doing.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to Set Primary monitor in Extended Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> framos917  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Set Primary monitor in Extended Desktop</h2>
                    Recently upgrade to Windows 7. I have a thinkpad t60 with mini port replicator. I am trying to use extended desktop. I have external monitor on my left and thinkpad on my right. I can only seem to get extended desktop working with my think pad as primary
 monitor, so I have to keep moving all my icons to the external monitor to the left (and in front of me). How do I keep same monitors' perspective but just make my external montior my primary montior? Note I have tried dragging the monitors in the "Change Appearance
 of screens" window, but then my cursor moves opposite of the perspective.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here is how you can do this:<br />
a. Right click on an empty space on the desktop and click on Screen Resolution.<br />
b. At the top, you will see your current main display with the Start Menu in the lower left corner.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>NOTE: </strong>If you do not know which monitor is which, then click on the Identity button to display the number on the display to match them with.<br />
c. At the top, click on the numbered display device (ex: monitor, projector or HDMI TV) that you want to make your main display to have its border highlighted.<br />
d. Check the Make this my main display box, and click on OK to apply.<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You will notice that you when you check this box, the Start Menu will now be in that numbered display.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Charger Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgewestover  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Charger Problem</h2>
                    I have had my Surface Pro 4 for about 6 months. Up until now the charger has worked fine. Today I noticed that it is not charging. I havae pluged and repluged it in to different outlets. I have plugged and unplugged and replugged the cord into the charging
 box. It will come on to charge but after a few seconds it will stop. I had plugged another charger for my apple watch into the black box usb port and it was not working as well but worked fine when plugged directly into the wall. So I figured it is the charger.
 Any thoughts on what this is or how I could get it fixed?

            If you are in the US and have access to a nearby Microsoft retail store you can go there and get the issue resolved immediately.&nbsp; They will check the charger and your sp4 and fix or replace as necessary.&nbsp; You can also contact the

<h2>            windows 10 update has disabled my computer</h2>
                    <p>I clicked to install windows 10 this morning on my HP pavilion dv6 laptop and for several hours things seemed to go well, but since&nbsp;leaving and coming back after it said it was tweaking a bit more.... (really?), it just keeps flashing on my screen saver.
 The icons will appear and disappear, there is a black bar at the bottom inviting me to search the web, but nothing works.&nbsp;Everything at start up looks normal but once I sign in and get to what should be my home screen, just flashing. I can't click on anything,
 can't do anything except get to task manager (which since I'm the ultimate end user is of no use) and I can shut it off. Help?!!!</p>

            <p>I have the same problem . I can't get to clean boot mode with instructions you have given because it is now partial windows 10 . Not 8.1 or 7 .</p>

    <title>Question About Windows 10&#39;s New &#34;Download And Install Now&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackplatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question About Windows 10&#39;s New &#34;Download And Install Now&#34; Windows Update Option&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that in Windows 10, build 1903, a new feature called "Download and Install Now" will be offered in the Windows Update query for new version builds when they are available for your system.&nbsp; Users will always have the option to manually install
 feature updates until the current Windows 10 build on your computer is about to expire,&nbsp; At that time, the new feature build will be installed automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this means is that only security and stability updates will have full automatic options.&nbsp; The manual install of feature updates will be an Action Center notification that an update is waiting,&nbsp; But the user will have the option to wait until the old
 build is just about to expire before the new Windows feature updates are installed on their own.&nbsp; (Typical support for Windows 10 feature builds is 18 months.)&nbsp; All Windows 10 users will also have the option to pause other updates, (security and stability
 patches) in seven-day cycles for up to thirty-five days. (Five times each time.)&nbsp; This helps the user make sure that there aren't any last minute hiccups with updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that the "Download and Install Now" is coming for build 1803 and build 1809.&nbsp; Is this true?&nbsp; Or does the "Download and Install" new manual Windows Feature Update Build not begin until build 1903 is on the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jack&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jack,
<br />Michael Fortin described this novelty in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/04/04/improving-the-windows-10-update-experience-with-control-quality-and-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/201...</a>
<br />AFAIK there were no additional official information.
<br />We can make a guess but do not know for sure.

<h2>            What happens when i change my email address&#63;</h2>
                    My email address is linked with my laptop and I want to change my email address. I was wondering if when I do this will my laptop automatically update my email address or will I have to do something? I want to change my email address without having to
 make a new profile on my laptop and without having all my photos and apps deleted.

                    <p>I'm having trouble launching a application (Quicken)&nbsp;and was told to reinstall .NET Frameworks for my version of Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>I removed it and reinstalled it and it&nbsp;did not work.&nbsp; I then tried the&nbsp;Microsoft Fix it 50736 and that didn't work.&nbsp;
