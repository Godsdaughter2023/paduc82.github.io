<h2>            Tell windows where my windows apps are installed.</h2>
                    Hello all,<br />
<br />
After having a LOT of problems with my windows 10, I decided to do a clean install/reset. My Forza horizon 3 was installed on my hdd, windows on my ssd. I unhooked my hdd because I didn't want to loose any data on that. I know forza is still installed there,
 since I can browse the game files in WindowsApps. When I reselect the install location for apps, it askes me to delete all the apps on my hdd. Reinstalling is really not an option here with internet speeds of around 150kilobit/s ethernet... (Downloading in
 first place took 3 weeks <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.tenforums.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2f004.png" />). I really want to play, is there any way to do it?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing a program, a new subkey containing settings like a program’s location, its version, and how to start the program, are all added to the Windows Registry.
<span>&nbsp;</span>In your case, Windows 10 is unable to find Forza Horizon 3 since it was not registered in Windows Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to resolve your concern, we recommend reinstalling the Forza Horizon 3. Please follow the steps on

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. I know how to reinstall the game, but that was my point: I don't want to, because of the slow internet. I'm quite comfortable fiddling around in registry, is there any way I can add it myself or is this blocked by Windows?</p>

<p>It isn't blocked, but you would need to know every single registry entry the game makes during install. &nbsp;This can be from a few tens to many thousands of entries depending on the program. &nbsp;Before you did a clean install it would theoretically have been possible
 to extract all the registry entries, but even that would not have been guaranteed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you will need to bite the bullet and re-install<br />

<h2>            &#40;Resolved&#41; 2nd monitor zoomed in slightly</h2>
                    <p>I have encountered an issue with my second screen being zoomed in slightly. It happened out of the blue, both monitors went dark and when they came back my second monitor had a different background and was zoomed in slightly. Half of the task bar at the
 bottom screen is cut off, but this effect persist along the perimeter of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some information on my setup.</p>
<p>-My second monitor is a Sony Tv</p>
<p>-I am running windows 10</p>
<p>-I have a Intel core i5-6400 processor</p>
<p>-During the incident i was running a program to manage my wallpapers, called wallpaperengine. Immediately after the incident, when the wallpaper changed, it was not active on my second monitor.</p>
<p>-Before the incident my most recent update was 6 days ago and i have used my setup since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some things i have tried to solve the problem</p>
<p>-I tried playing with the resolution, changing the resolution never allowed me to see my full task bar.</p>
<p>-I tried playing with my default wallpaper settings</p>
<p>-I uninstalled my display drivers (after doing so and restarting, the problem appeared to be fixed, although my second screen was just mirroring the first instead of being independent. It then immediately reverted to the broken state of being zoomed slightly.
 Checking the driver revealed it had been reinstalled at that point).</p>
<p>-I searched for display driver updates (I found none)&nbsp;</p>
<p>-I searched for windows updates (I did find an update, but it did not fix the problem)</p>
<p>-I tried adjusting settings inside of wallpaperengine</p>
<p>-I uninstalled wallpaperengine</p>
<p>-I preformed a clean boot</p>
<p>-I reset the settings on my tv to factory defaults</p>
<p>-I looked for an "overscan" option in my tv settings but there was not one</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am not sure what else to try and google has not been able to assist. This setup has functioned for me for 3 years now and this has not happened before. Thanks in advance for any advice.<br />

            Hi there,<br /><br />Have you tried changing the DPI settings on the second monitor? You should be able to find this in the same location where you change your resolution<br /><br />My second monitor does this too but I resolve this by changing the aspect ratio on the monitor itself to a setting called just scan maybe have a flick through the different ratios

<p>Hey thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second screen, the Sony tv, had no such settings for dpi or ppi. I poked around in the display settings on windows 10, and changed every setting that appeared in the menu, including the "Change the size of text, apps, and other items" drop down menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing some digging i tried to follow the steps in this guide:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ttps://support.corel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001485408-Display-Options-How-to-change-DPI-Scaling-Level-for-displays-in-Windows-10-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which had me use registry editor to set a custom scale factor for my dpi. However, when trying to use my settings app for the second part of the guide, there was no slider. I then tried to use control panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; Display to find that
 Display was not an option that appeared on my control panel. After kicking around I discovered that's because it was removed in an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it did not work I have reverted the changes I made with registry editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion, but no luck I am afraid.</p>

<p>Sounds like a screen resolution problem. If you are using a LCD screen...</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click an empty part of your desktop then click Properties</li><li>Click the Settings tab</li><li>Move the resolution slider all the way to the right</li><li>This should select the native resolution for your monitor</li><li>Click OK</li></ul>
<p>If you are using an old style CRT monitor try resolutions 1024x768 or 1280x1024.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

<h2>            NTUSER.DAT Copied to users profiles errors.</h2>
                    Recently i have tried to update all the user profiles on a computer. To do this i took a ntuser.dat file and just replaced this file on every user profile. The computer now has some errors. IE Outlook will not open it just gives an error same with any
 other office product. Other errors show up also but this is the most common.

            NTUser.dat is the user part of the registry, which applies for a particular user account. I'm wondering why you copied the NTUser.dat file to every user profile (and overwriting the existing one)?<br />
<br />
All the user specific data such as mail account configuration, internet explorer settings etc are stored in NTUser.dat.

<p>I do not think it is active anymore but I may be wrong.<br />
<br />
If I could make a suggestion though, the only things of worth from the chest are the hero dolls and the chicken suit ( both of which you need for achievements).
</p>
<p>The easiest way to get these now would be to play on Live and ask someone in the game for them. I am sure as long as people are still playing online you won't have any difficulty finding someone willing to give you them.<br />
<br />
When your in the game and connected to Live go into the game settings and check to make sure 'all orbs' are activated. This way if anyone is online you will be able to see them. One of the best places to find people is Bowerstone market, back when I played
 it this is where most people loitered to trade and swap items.<br />
<br />
Sorry I could not help you with the website issue, but this should help you get the items you need for the relevant achievements.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-21.gif" /></p>

<p>Yeah the site is down. You can still play the games but anything you win wont be able to be transfered to your GT so the chicken suit and hero dolls will have to be traded online with people. Me also i need two hero dolls and the chicken suit.</p>

    <title>Power Options settings revert after changes made and saved - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cashtime55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Options settings revert after changes made and saved</h2>
                    An intermittent problem, on a PC only 5 months old, but recently it has started to 'Require password on wake-up', even though settings are set to No (including Screen Saver option), also Power Button setting goes back to 'Do Nothing' from 'Shut Down',
 but these problems don't occur every time after wake-up. I always put my computer on Standby every evening, using a program called 'Wake-up From Standby Mode and Hibernation' to wake it up in the mornings at a set time, then it loads Firefox, so the internet
 is up and running with the latest weather for when I get up. So it's a bit annoying when I'm faced with the login screen, and have to go over and click on the login button.<br />
As suggested in a reply to another post I made on the subject (by Try*3), I went through the list of checks, including the System File Checker. This found 3 'corrupted' files - Uxtheme.dll, Themeui.dll, and ThemeService.dll. The Uxtheme.dll is installed as
 I use a third-party Vista visual style/theme. Unfortunately, after the SFC carried out repairs, I no longer had the Vista VS and theme. As I would rather have my Vista style and put up with the occasional login screen after wake-up, for now I have restored
 the system back to how it was before the SFC repairs. I may run the above again at a later date to see if the problems still occur without the Vista theme active.<br />
<br />
These are the relevant system Power Plan Settings produced by the powercfg command:<br />

            Final report: Yes, I can confirm that my Power settings no longer change, and it seems that Blaze 3.5 was definitely the culprit. I hope this provides a solution for anyone else having the same problem.<br />

<h2>            Uninstalling DLC games</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have some games installed on my xbox one (with my account) as a DLC. Now, If I uninstall it from my xbox to clear some space, will I be able to re-install it using the same codes that I used previously ?</p>
<p>Or will they still be tagged to my xbox one account and can be installed later ?</p>
<p>Or, will I lose them forever and have to purchase them again ?</p>
<p>and what does it mean when xbox one says that I own the game after applying code ?</p>

<h2>            sfc &#47;scanonce WinXP Home</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran sfc /scanonce and it found a problem and asked for system disk, when I installed the disk it could&nbsp;not repair the problem. I tried different Win XP Home disks with SP 3. Error message did not list what file&nbsp; is bad. I have done this before on other computers
 and it sucessfully repaired the problem.&nbsp; Any ideas how I could figure out what file is bad?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Doug</p>

            Nope.<br />
<br />
When sfc /scannow runs successfully, you will only see a starting and completed message in the Event Viewer System log.
<br />
<br />
When it starts and stops successfully you only will see events like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64016<br />
Windows File Protection file scan was started.<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64017<br />
Windows File Protection file scan completed successfully.<br />
<br />
There is no information about what it did or what it didn't do.<br />
<br />
Even if sfc /scannow finds something to do, you will not know what it did.<br />
<br />
If you want, you could tell us about your system and what the problem is and maybe somebody will have some ideas.<br />

<p>It was running slowly, had another comp that was acting the same and I ran sfc /scanonce and it made a night and day difference in the way&nbsp; the computer ran after it did the repair. Was hoping it work again.</p>

            It might seem that way, but all sfc /scan&lt;anything&gt; does is make an effort to populate the dllcache folder with backup copies of critical system files.&nbsp; If anything is missing, SFC will want to replace it and prompt you to insert your genuine bootable
 XP installation CD that needs to be the same SP as your installed SP (or it is going to complain - a lot).&nbsp; Then if one of those 3498 files ever comes up missing on your system, Windows File Protection will make an effort to replace it with the backup copy
 from the dllcache folder.<br />
<br />
If your system is running slow and since this topic is about sfc /scannonce why don't you start a
<i><b>new</b></i> topic describing your slow system and some folks might be able to help you figure out how to speed it up.&nbsp; There are lots of good tips for this particular issue.<br />

            I am most interested in figuring out how to find what was corrupt or missing when I ran sfc /scanonce. Maybe it was just a fluke that it made the one computer run better, I wasn't the only one that noticed that one computer ran faster.
<br />

<br />
I am pretty sure that if somebody gives me a system and they say it is booting and/or running slow, I can take in in the back room for 30 minutes, do nothing but eat my lunch, bring it back out and get them to
<i>try it now</i> and they will be convinced it it is running faster!<br />

<h2>            Toshiba Satellite s55 hard drive replacement with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite s55 with Windows 8.1 and the hard drive has basically failed. Just before it became unbootable, I was able to boot one time and attempt a clone of the hard drive to a new one I bought. Unfortunately, out of the five partitions
 on the drive, only three were able to be copied. The recovery partition, and I believe two file system (FAT32, NTFS) partitions were saved; c drive and one file system partition were corrupted and would not copy. I attempted to restart the computer, but was
 met with errors to the effect that boot media was not detected. Subsequently, I've been able to get the recovery menu upon startup, and I attempted a refresh so I can keep my files, but reinstall Windows, but after working for the better part of a day or two,
 it gives me an error stating that it could not be completed. I still haven't tried the recovery option as I'd like to try to recover my data. I've also attempted to boot from usb with the new drive and access the recovery menu, though I don't believe I've
 been successful with actually getting the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm hoping to get some help setting up the new drive with Windows and any other drivers that might be required on the new drive to actually run my computer.

<h2>            Unable to download a game from &#39;Gamehouse&#39; error&#58; application requires Win XP or Vista editions of Microsoft Windows OS, Installation will now exit.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: GRANDMA KNOWS LITTLE ABOUT COMPUTERS AND NEEDS HELP PLEASE!!!</p>
<p>I am lost when it comes to computers. &nbsp;My daughter gave me her old desktop computer (WINDOWS XP) about a year ago. Everything was working fine til a few days ago. I logged off Tuesday night and when I went to log on Wednesday I could no longer use Google
 Chrome, I had to uninstall it and re install it.,When I did it said something like Chrome needs XP or Vista or newer editions and may not work with all apps. Thursday when my grandson came he tried to download games from "Gamehouse" site. I have used this
 site for a yr and never had a problem, til now. When I try to download games &nbsp;a msg pops up saying APPLICATION REQUIRES THE XP OR VISTA EDITIONS OF THE MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATION SYSTEM. INSTALLATION WILL NOW EXIT. &nbsp;I can no longer down load any games from
 this site which I have never had a problem with before. Why would this happen out of the blue? Why would GOOGLE CHROME all of a sudden stop working?? What can I do to fix it? I hope its an easy fix because I know very little about computers. Every time I try
 to do something it keeps saying something about needs at least XP or VISTA and it never said this before. One week before this happened I switched from Comcast to Verizon Fios triple pkg,but it was working after I switched over for about a week or two, then
 all of a sudden I log on and have all these problems. How can I fix it? the computer already had XP on it when she gave it to me. I am on a fixed income and can not afford to nor would I know how to install Windows 7 or something else. Is there an easy fix
 please?? Why would this happen out of the blue? What can I do to fix it so my grand son games can get down loaded? I have been down loading these games for a yr w/o a problem then out of the blue the same time google chrome stops working,games no longer down
 load. this is what pops up APPLICATION REQUIRES THE XP OR VISTA EDITIONS OF THE MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATION SYSTEM INSTALLATION WILL NOW EXIT. The game never downloads....PLEASE HELP!!!</p>

<h2>            Registry error halts new program installs on Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have been trying to install several 64 bit programs.... Ad-Aware, OpenOffice, Visual Studio 2008, &nbsp;VS 2010 &amp; vcredist_x64.exe and they all fail. I have run Microsofts Clean-up utility and have run several registry cleaners &amp; have even gone into
 the registry to manually change permissions of&nbsp; the offending registry item and have not been able to make any progress in getting programs to install</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The problem registry item sits at</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\UserData\S-1-5-18\Components\7E756C51681BDA34F86C2167896E312E\EFEE0228DC83E77358593193D847A0EC</p>
<p>Neither I nor any x64 program can write to the registry location above, and I cannot manually change the permissions to allow programs to write to those locations. Is there any thing I can do to change this behavior to allow writing to this location?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for any help..</p>

<p>There are a couple of things you can do, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop using registry cleaners. They are bad news. By using several of them, you have probably done irreparable damage to your machine.</li><li>Seize ownership of the problem key, then set the desired permissions. </li></ul>
Whether seizing ownership will fix the issue depends largely on the damage done by your registry cleaners. If this was my machine then I would use System Restore to set it right back to a point before any registry cleaner was used.

<p>That is not an option. I have been successfully using registry cleaners as a standard maintenance procedure since Win 95. Until now I have never had a problem with the registry cleaners I use. If I used your logic, I would have to Format C: and reinstall...not
 an option at this point in time.</p>
<p>Problem is.... every time I attempt to change permissions on the particular registry key, regedit refuses to set permissions to what is needed, and required. Ownership of the offending key is non-transferrable, according to regedit.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that you have used registry cleaners since Windows 95. I have equally no doubt that you let yourself be impressed with the numerous claims about registry "errors" that your cleaners claimed to fix. But have you ever taken out your stop watch
 and performed a few tests that proved conclusively the benefit of such tools? Tests that can be repeated by other people? You were lucky that your cleaners just milled about a bit and did not do any damage. The occasional posts we deal with in this forum tell
 a different story. The fact is that your average registry contains more than 10,000 keys. Only the software or driver manufacturers know exactly what each key is here for. If you do not believe this, have a look at some section concerning a printer driver.
 What does each key mean? What happens if you modify or delete it? The instructions for just these keys would fill a whole book!</p>
<p>The phrase "Ownership of the offending key is non-transferrable" means nothing to me. All I know is that you can seize ownership for any registry key, same as you can seize ownership for any file or folder, with almost identical methods.</p>

<p>Okay then...let me attempt to spell out the problem in small enough words you can understand.....</p>
<p>1) I attempt to install vcredit_x64.exe on my machine, using the right click method and clicking on Run as Administrator field</p>
<p>2) Program stops with message...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Error 1402. Could not open key:</p>

<p>3) Using regedit I search for the above key and find it at...</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\UserData\S-1-5-18\Components\7E756C51681BDA34F86C2167896E312E\EFEE0228DC83E77358593193D847A0EC</p>
<p>Attempts to change security settings on the key EFEE0228DC83E77358593193D847A0EC gives the following message..</p>
<p>&nbsp;"You do not have permission to view the current permission settings for&nbsp;EFEE0228DC83E77358593193D847A0EC, but you can make permission changes."</p>
<p>4) At this point I bring up the Permissions window for key&nbsp;EFEE0228DC83E77358593193D847A0EC and find there are no settings in the window. I then proceed about attempting to add Administrator rights to the key and when I attempt to save the new settings I
 am confronted with a new window that says...</p>
<p>"Unable to save permission changes on&nbsp;EFEE0228DC83E77358593193D847A0EC.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the same happens when I try to change permissions on the parent of key&nbsp;EFEE0228DC83E77358593193D847A0EC and attempt to propulgate the permissions through all child keys. I have run out of ideas on how to change the permissions on the said key, and was hoping
 that someone here had an idea or solution I could try to fix this particular registry key.</p>

<li>I have no desire to hijack this thread. Anyone is welcome to respond. </li></ul>

<li>Being sarcastic can be risky because it can turn into a boomerang. While I now do understand the small words you now use for my benefit, I wonder if you ever took the trouble to read my recommendations. I suggested that you should seize ownership of the
 problem key and/or its subkeys, yet your latest explanation never even mentions the word "ownership". It is the key to your problem!<br />

Your lack of knowledge or help in this post is disappointing.<br />
You allow anonymity as permission to act like an arrogant know-it-all.<br />
Yet you've done nothing but clog up a forum with useless banter. <br />
If you can find an answer

<h2>            Incompatible USB wifi adaptor</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have been trying to update windows 10 to the most recent version, which is apparently the reason why my games won’t launch, but I keep getting an error saying that my USB WiFi adapter is incompatible and to remove it and try again. Is there any way to
 update windows with this USB adapter, or do I have to buy a better adapter or Ethernet? I have the Linksys AE1200/2500 802.11 Wireless LAN Dongle if it helps.</p>
<p>Sorry if that’s a stupid question, but I don’t want to buy something more expensive if I don’t have to.</p>

<h2>            Change the amount of RAM used as Shared GPU Memory in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>System: Gigabyte Z97-D3H-CF (Custom Desktop PC)<br />
OS: Windows 10 Pro 64bits (Fall Creators Update)<br />
CPU: Intel Core i7 4790 @ 3.60GHz (4 cores - 8 threads)<br />
RAM: 32GB Dual Channel<br />
Graphics: NVidia GeForce GTX 1080 (Founder's Edition)<br />
Dedicated Video Memory: 8GB</p>
<p>System Video Memory: 0</p>
<p>Shared Video Memory: 16GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>allocating half my RAM for shared video memory when the card has 8GB of dedicated video memory seems like overkill to me. Is there a way to change how much RAM windows 10 allocates as shared video memory? Specifically, I'd like to change it from 16GB to
 8GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Jason,</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>RAM allocation is being configured only via BIOS settings. To be more accurate for allocating your memory, we suggest contacting the manufacturer of your motherboard which is

            I do have the same problem. I have a program linked between 3 computers which are on 32 bit OS. Now, I have this new laptop with the windows 7 64 bit.
<br />
My 32 bit program is not working in this 64 bit windows 7 os. In order to be able to access my program as well as to link with the other 3 comps, I tried to downgrade the win 7 to xp 32 bit.
<br />
<br />
However the similar case appeared on me too, "program is blocked due to compability issues".<br />
<br />
Any how you guys have some solutions for it?

            What exactly are you trying to do?&nbsp; Why are you wanting to reinstall Windows XP?&nbsp; If you want to install or reinstall Windows XP on your computer just boot the computer with the Windows XP CD and follow the onscreen instructions.&nbsp; BEFORE you proceed with
 this make sure that you have your product key or else you will be up the proverbial creek without a paddle!&nbsp; Also make sure that you have a backup of your personal files, it goes without saying that if you do a clean install that all the files on the disk
 will be lost, and even if you do an in-place or repair install that glitches can happen and that you may still lose all your files.<br />

            <p><em>"And yes, it's a disc based version."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only version, it seems. I was not able to find it on EA, or other game download sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What exactly is, or is not, happening ? Any error messages ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>- This should not apply if you have done the 1511 update to Win10, but prior to this some games would not
</p>
<p>launch on Win10&nbsp; if you use a Windows DPI setting over the default&nbsp; (100%).</p>
<p>In this instance you need to use Compatibility option &gt; <em>Disable display scaling with high DPI settings.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- There is a noCD for patch version 1.2 for this game <a href="http://megagames.com/games/black-and-white-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
--here--.</a>&nbsp; If the game still does not launch when </p>
<p>using the noCD then you know something else is wrong.&nbsp; If it does, I reckon DRM Blocking is the issue.</p>
<p>Should you decide to try the noCD note that you do not need the <em>.nfo</em> file. Just move the noCD
<em>White</em>.<em>exe</em> file </p>
<p>to the games install folder, or sub-folder, with the original <em>White.exe</em> file .</p>
<p>(I usually move the original file to a new folder for backup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- NOTE: Firefox has been flagging some Mega Game downloads as&nbsp; potentially containing 'PUPS'
</p>
<p>(potentially unwanted programs) lately. As with DRM Blocking, this is another new elevated security measure.</p>
<p>I've been using this site for about ten years. If the site does have PUPS in some downloads I believe they</p>
<p>are not from the noCD fixes.</p>
<p>( PUPS come from many sites, and includes things such as the Chrome browser install that comes with Adobe Flash Player updates. If you miss clearing the tick box during the process, and didn't want Chrome, you have a PUP).</p>

</p><p>Have you extracted the two files from the compressed folder you downloaded ? </p>
<p>I explained how to use the noCD <em>.exe&nbsp;</em> previously.</p>
<p>...you do not need the <em>.nfo</em> file (delete this after extracting).</p>
<p>Just move the noCD&nbsp; <em>White</em>.<em>exe</em>&nbsp; file&nbsp; to the games install folder, or sub-folder with the original
<em>White.exe</em> file</p>
<p>(sometimes the games .exe is not in the main folder, and may be in a sub-folder eg-
<em>binaries</em> ) .</p>
<p>- I usually move the original file to a new folder for backup.</p>
<p>- Make a new shortcut from the noCD&nbsp; .exe after it is in place (use the Send to &gt; Desktop option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if you have not patched the game you will need to use the&nbsp; patches or the noCD will not work.</p>
<p>You need both 1.1 and 1.2 (1.1 is pretty large for that era, so the game must have had a few bugs).</p>
<p>- Patch 1.2 link is on the same page as the 1.2 download -</p>

            Once you've found the secdrv.sys file, what do you do after that? I opened it with Notepad and there's loads of foreign letters with "This program cannot be run in DOS mode." on top.

            <p>You don't do anything with the secdrv.sys&nbsp; file. This is just an indicator that Windows will prevent that</p>
<p>game from launching.&nbsp; My understanding is previous versions of Windows came with the secdrv.sys file</p>
<p>pre installed in System32 and sysWOW64, but they have not included this file in Win10.</p>
<p>There would be more to it than just not having the secdrv.sys driver in Windows, as popping one into
</p>
<p>Windows does not prevent games from being blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The&nbsp; secdrv.sys&nbsp; driver was used by various versions of SecuROM and SafeDisk copy protection schemes.
</p>
<p>It is this driver that MS is blocking.</p>
<p>I've read one theory that MS and the company that developed&nbsp; secdrv.sys&nbsp; had a falling out.</p>
<p>So MS is now punishing people who still have disk based games as a way of getting even ?</p>
<p>Apparently the&nbsp; secdrv.sys driver needs to run in Admin mode which theoretically leaves it vulnerable,
</p>
<p>but neither MS nor the parent company wanted to fix the problem because these old forms of copy protection
</p>
<p>are out of use, so we gamers with a collection of disk based games got the shaft because simply blocking
</p>
<p>it was relatively cheap and easy way out for Monopoly$oft.</p>
<p>Well, the consumer only get the shaft if they go with the recommendation or suggestion to buy the game again from&nbsp; an on line game dealer. If you don't want to submit to extortion use a noCD fix.</p>
<p>- With Win10 a noCD fix&nbsp; is only one way to circumvent the DRM Blocking 'security feature' with a disk based game.</p>
The noCD fix bypasses the disk check, cutting the&nbsp; secdrv.sys&nbsp; driver from the picture.
<p>
</p><p>- How DRM Blocking works exactly I don't know, but would&nbsp; guess it simply ends the Task when secdrv.sys is</p>
<p>detected on a game disk. This would assume there is no disk check function when running the installer,</p>
<p>because these games will install to Win10 before being blocked (thankfully).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- The best possible solution would be for MS to come to the party. Stop being the condescending
</p>
<p>Big Brother and allow it's users to make a choice regarding this so called threat.</p>
<p>All we really need is for MS to give people freedom of choice, and provide a Windows Update that has
</p>
<p>an on/off option for DRM Blocking.</p>
<p>This could be included in Window Features .</p>

<p>
</p><p>However, did you uninstall the any anti-virus installed in the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firewalls (whether Windows or third party) hinder network connections and/or sometimes block driver installation or result into corrupted installation. So, that makes it an important steps to uninstall the security software (is any installed in the system)
 with its removal tool to check if the issue is reproduced in an anti-virus free system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know various removal tools for third party security software,&nbsp;I would&nbsp;have you refer to the following thread link:</p>

<p>Same thing happened with me. At the time I was using my cell as a hot spot plugged into my laptop. After unplugging the USB cable and leaving the hot spot active I was able to get it to install. It seamed to be MTP setup / drivers for my cell phone.</p>

            <p>I did a bit of reading and it is a Windows Portable Device driver that originally came out for Vista, Win 7 and Win 8, but seems to be required for lots of Windows 10 PCs depending on what removeable media/device you connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the update after seeing tons of posts from people who got the same notification, one who installed it and had no complaints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the update, it took less than 1 second and does not require a reboot. My PC still works as it should (so far) so I would deem this a harmless update, but just outright weird.</p>

<p>If Microsoft want to keep serious computer users can I suggest they expand the more information option in windows update (pre-installation), as soon as possible, as this update did not follow the usual route to update completion making people feel that this
 could be a virus. I'll point you towards Linux Mint update&nbsp;descriptions and change-logs as the goal to aspire to.</p>
