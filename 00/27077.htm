<h2>            How to migrate Outlook Premium personalized domain to Office 365 Business</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have outlook premium subscription, and I created a personalized domain there. Now I have purchased a new subscription with Office 365 Business Premium. And I want to use my domain there and cancel the outlook premium. How can I do that? Anyone knows how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on this article:
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-com-Premium-closed-to-new-subscribers-93934667-4db8-40bd-84b3-fc4823026ddd?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Outlook.com Premium closed to new subscribers</span></a><span>,
 it is not feasible to move the Outlook.com Premium domain to other providers, f</span><span>or now you should continue to renew your Outlook.com Premium subscription to retain control of your domain and to continue using your personalized email
 address.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Does OneDrive for Business and Next generation sync client &#40;onedrive.exe&#41; support modern authentication&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are planning to configure modern authentication for one of our customers for OneDrive for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please let me know if OneDrive for business supports modern authentication?</p>
<p>Also do the sync clients Next Generation sync client (onedrive.exe) and the older one groove.exe support modern authentication?</p>
<p>
</p><p>the customer is using onedrive.exe to sync onedrive for business content, but a version of groove.exe would also be available on end users workstations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are there any MSOffice version considerations to be kept in mind during the rollout?</p>
<p>- Are any registry changes needed to enable modern authentication for onedrive.exe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not much documentation available on this, so if you could please help me with some relevant documentation on this. Also steps on how to setup / enable modern authentication for onedrive for business and the sync clients (onedrive.exe and groove.exe)
 would be very helpful.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you in advance!<br />
Nitin<br />

<p>Hi Nitin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is indeed no any Official articles about the modern authentication on OneDrive.exe. I will share it back, if I can find any articles. Modern authentication for SharePoint Online as well as OneDrive for Business is set by default in the tenant level.
 We don't need to take any action to configure something.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding "<span>&nbsp;</span><span>I came across the info that modern authentication is only enabled at tenant level by default for tenants created after august 2017</span>", this applies to Exchange
 Online and Skype for Business, not SharePoint Online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sky&nbsp;</p>

How can you say there are no Office entries on the disk? You previously said that you installed Office Professional. Make sure you have cleared all Office entries and install Home and Student again. I can't see any other reason for this.

<h2>            Thank you for your answer. But it does not solve my problem.</h2>
                    <p>When I look for Outlook, at times the computer shows up with Hotmail, understandably because they both come from the same interface - Microsoft. When Hotmail comes up, bearing a Microsoft logo, I am unable to select Outlook in particular, because both come
 from Microsoft.</p>
<p>One day I entered a password on Outlook. Soon thereafter, Hotmail comes running in saying my login is OUT OF DATE. In fact, t is showing that as we speak.</p>
<p>On those cases, I am unable to get Outlook, because they "look" the same. That is why I surmise that since Hotmail was created decades ago, it is unable to "talk to" Outlook, and Outlook does not know that when I sign up under the Hotmail banner, I should
 be able to get the same services that I expect from it, namely, Outlook.&nbsp;<br />
Bottom line is this, <strong>Outlook</strong> treats <em>Hotmail</em> as a "stranger," as illustrated in the
<strong>bold</strong> face used for Outlook, and <em>italics</em> for Hotmail. This is an
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">illustration</span> because I do not have the engineering language to show who is who and what is what.</p>
<p>Therefore, my problem is that I CANNOT&nbsp; "make" <em>Hotmail</em> to be known and understood by
<strong>Outlook.</strong> That's beyond me. But to say that I should "always" use one platform when using a cellphone for example,
<strong>OUTLOOK, </strong>and keep <em>Hotmail </em>&nbsp;only for the computer is really beating about the bush. It's NOT an answer I expect from Microsoft.</p>

<p>To further illustrate the point, it's like DEMOCRATS&nbsp; and REPUBLICANS. They don't understand that they BOTH&nbsp; work for the people, meaning, citizens and refugees, those seeking asylum, those wishing to emigrate here but who do not happen to have a so-called
 "white skin," and Native Americans, the latter of whom were the first to set foot here. We have relegated them to very small and shameful pockets of a country they once roamed from East to West and from North to South.<br />
Am I being political? Not a chance. But we can see that a rule is supported by one party, eh Courts strike it down as Unconstitutional. Nobody seems to understand that the reason for the separation of powers between the Executive, the Elected Members of Congress
 AND the Judiciary are supposed to "<strong>harmonize</strong>' the output of their discussions. people, why is this so difficult to understand? Disagreement is to what built this country. The aim of the so-called Founding Fathers (Where were our Mothers?)
 was that a three-way balance should be achieved in order to avoid bias of one entity against another.</p>
<p>If harmony were to be truly established, then the darker-skinned folks should also have been at the table when the rules and laws of the country were created. As they stand they are inadequate. Attitudes MUST change so that people see each other as members
 of One Family, the Human Family; One race, the Human race, One World where all belong and have EQUAL rights and privileges.<br />
Sorry to be so long-winded. It's not that I am trying to make fun of a very serious subject. But, in my humble mmd, it is the easiest area to show how perpetual disagreement is not helping humankind as a whole. It's when we divide things into unequal parts
 that everyone is unsettled. Why? The object of Justice is Peace.<br />
Therefore, I just want to use BOTH&nbsp;<strong>OUTLOOK </strong>and <em>Hotmail</em> as upholding the same banner of Microsoft. Harmony must come from within.<br />
I apologize if my words, intended to be as illustrative as possible, are misinterpreted to suggest that I favor one side as opposed to the other Matter of fact,, we are prolonging the inauguration of the Kingdom of God on earth as so vividly explained in the
 Lord's Prayer, where all we have to do is to take what already exists in heaven and implement it here on this earth. The longer we delay with meaningless wars, and strife, and skirmishes, the longer will be the advent of what should already have been manifest
 by now, two thousand years later. Get this, the Lord's Prayer is in the present tense from start to finish. Christ said the Kingdom of God "is at hand." That, to me, is as simple as saying the Kingdom is already here, but we must work to make it a physical
 reality. We can't claim piousness in our worship if we fail to put into action about which Jesus implied was waiting for us to cleanse ourselves, stop wars, stop fighting so as Peace o earth may take root to make this world the footstool of God.<br />
Again, I make no distinction between religions. If God is One, and all Founders of those religions claim that they were sent by God, then it should be obvious that God is not confused. We are the ones that tend to bring differentiation where it is not needed.
 The Kingdom is already established in the spiritual world. God cannot be King without a Kingdom. So, it should be obvious that all religions lead into the next in the history of the Planet. The supplement what was lacking in the former religions. Moses led
 His people through the desert. That's why if one person cuts the ear of one, Justice demanded that the aggrieved should also cut the ear of the perpetrator. But once the tribes live in settled communities, cutting somebody's finger because they did the same
 to you cannot be just. We will all have one or two fingers missing in the end. No, Love your neighbor as yourself. Same People, same religion, but due to changing circumstances, social laws also change. There was once apartheid in a country. Now, it is gone!
 People are tasked with solving different kinds of problems now. Poverty is still a challenge. Therefore, we should all pull together.</p>
<p>Again , I apologize for any misunderstanding arising out of my discussion. But I hope Microsoft will realize that more homework needs to be done to make these two platforms see each other as one, embrace each other, and all peace on earth will thereby have
 been established. For ever and ever. Amen.<br />

<p>First thing, the battery might not be charged.. This sounds far fetched but the N900 can be pretty inconsistent when the battery is completely flat.. It sometimes *looks* like it is charging (flashing yellow) but actually it isn't.. this is particularly
 the case if the phone is not booted up.. as is your problem now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you connected the phone without the battery, did anything appear on the screen at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone can go into a recovery mode (flasher mode) when you plug it into a computer.. the display stays dark, but a Nokia logo appears on the screen</p>

            My gut is telling me this is likely to be a flat battery.. I know that sounds really lame and basic, but I've seen that so many times before..<br />
<br />
However, you said your phone just died.. did it die whilst you were using it or was it left on charge over night and it was dead in the morning (or something like that)<br />
<br />
Do you know anyone with or have access to a Nokia 5800, 5230, X6 or N900? They all use the same battery and it can often be very reassuring to swap. you might find your phone is happy...<br />
<br />
Which version of windows are you using (or are you using a Mac / Linux system)?<br />
<br />
What happens if you repeat the USB test, but press and hold down the U button on the keyboard whilst you plug the phone into the USB cable?<br />

<h2>            LTE</h2>
                    hi everyone i have just updated from a 920 ta a 930 and i have noticed that when i am out and about it seems to operate on LTE &nbsp;and when i make or answer a call the LTE is replaced by a H also &nbsp;under mobile and sim it does not have the option to toggle
 between 3g and 4g like my 920 does is that normal? and what does LTE and the H symbolls mean ? rgds Roy ps while &nbsp;im at it sometimes a phone handset with an arrow pointing out of it to the right &nbsp;appears up next to the LTE and sonetines a small rectangle box
 that looks like it is denoting a sim or memory card app apears does anyone know what they mean Roy

<p>LTE means 4G, H means 3G. As your phone and/or network does not support telephony voice calls over 4G/LTE it is quite normal for the connection to drop to H/3G during such a call.</p>

    <title>Keeping 2010 Word App open after closing all of the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan peters sr.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keeping 2010 Word App open after closing all of the files&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    When you launch 2010 Word it opens a file called "Document 1". That's all well and good but if you close that file it also closes Word right along with it. You can open another file then close Doc 1 but if you close the other file it closes Word again.
 My question is can you close all of the documents and still leave Word launched. You can with Excel, Power Point, Visio and every other Office App. Why not Word 2010????? It's really a pain when you're working with a lot of files and want to close one when
 your done with it then open a new one. You have to re-launch the whole app.

<h2>            Latest W10 insider build 10547 hangs up on install</h2>
                    <p>I have tried installing Build 10547 four times now. On three of the four the system stopped at 75% of the third stage of the build ( 93% of the total process).&nbsp; Only one of the four succeeded completely however when trying to actually use the program, the
 pc froze once again. Each time I had to manually restart the computer instigating a recovery to the previous build.

            <p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in the same boat. &nbsp;So I downloaded 10547 iso using torrent, and now am installing now. &nbsp;Now total 13%, so far so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I wonder what the purpose of insiders is....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-Tetsuji</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit; &nbsp;DVD update is stalling at 93% total (75% configuration phase)......it's not a media problem. &nbsp; Up to now I have tried windows update twice and dvd once. &nbsp; What I felt strange was the size of the dvd was only 2.67GB for enterprise edition. &nbsp; &nbsp;Is it
 correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I should mention that a window with "\windows\system32\mcbuilder.exe" in the bar, but only with a cursor blinking inside (no letters) appeared at 92%.</p>

            <p>I am in the same boat I have tired three times and each time mine hangs at 97% total (90% of the configuration phase).&nbsp;
<br />
After system reset it restores the previous 10532 build. I would like to get past 10532... it doesn't play nice with 64 bit Chrome.

            <p>I had 2 failed installs of Build 10547.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first appeared to complete. &nbsp;But when I tried to log in to my Microsoft account, the mouse worked, but the keyboard did not respond. &nbsp;When I forced a shutdown by holding the power button, my Gateway NV52 performed a rollback to the previous Build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second never got to a point of completion. &nbsp;The install hung on a loop of flashing screens (light, dark, light top - dark band at bottom) - the computer continued to "flash" until I again forced a shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am beginning to wonder what is Microsoft doing. &nbsp;The current build (10532) has never let my video resolution exceed 1024x768, but the build prior to that finally did render a proper 16x9 resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a facetious thought about what may be going on. &nbsp;Like sports teams that let 2nd string players in the game to gain experience, could it be the Microsoft is letting 2nd string programmers try their hand at coding? &nbsp;I used the Windows 7 preview releases,
 and the Windows 8 preview releases (on different computers), but I never saw the problems that I have personally witnessed on the Windows 10 previews. &nbsp;Some of the builds were a mess (as 10547 appears to be). &nbsp;Surely Microsoft can do better than this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then there are the Start Menu / Cortana issues in Build 10240. &nbsp;What is going on here? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get your act together, Microsoft!</p>

<p>I had similar problem when I upgraded from build 10525 to build 10532.&nbsp; Could not open anything with left click on start button.&nbsp; Finally determined that problem was with AVG antivirus program installed on build 10525 and build 10532does not like&nbsp;this program.
 AVG does not work with build 10532 due to new file compression introduced by Microsoft in build 10532.</p>
<p>If by chance you have AVG or Avast anti virus installed on the build you are trying to update from, remove it and try again.&nbsp; Worked for me.</p>

<h2>            alphabetize sentences</h2>
                    <p><strong><em><span>Hi,
</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>I</span></em></strong><strong><em><span>am trying to find out if I can alphabetize sentences in Word (2010). (Create an index of first lines in alphabetical order).
</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>This list is correct:
</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About suffering they were ...
</span></p>
<p><span>Absalom and Achitophel ...
</span></p>
<p><span>A cold coming we had of ...
</span></p>
<p><span>Adam´s Curse (Yets) ...
</span></p>
<p><span>A flower was offered to me
</span></p>
<p><span>All along the valley, ...
</span></p>
<p><span>An old, mad, blind, ...
</span></p>
<p><span>A simple child ....
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Following is the same list after Word has alphabetized it. The program appears to go by the first words instead of first letters. Thus, all sentences that begin with „A“ come first
 and „A cold coming ...“ precedes „About suffering ... „ even though the first sentence begins with the letters „AC“ and the second „AB“.
</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A cold coming we had of ...
</span></p>
<p><span>A flower was offered to me
</span></p>
<p><span>A simple child ....
</span></p>
<p><span>About suffering they werve ...
</span></p>
<p><span>Absalom and Achitophel ...
</span></p>
<p><span>Adam´s Curse (Yets) ...
</span></p>
<p><span>All along the valley, ...
</span></p>
<p><span>An old, mad, blind, ...
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Can anyone tell me if it is possible to have Word alphabetize as I do in the first list of sentences? I have contacted Microsoft support via phone (got a very helpful technician but this is not his speciality) without resolving
 the problem and was referred to this site. </span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Best regards, </span></em></strong></p>

            <p>Unfortunately, Word's sort does include spaces (a space sorts ahead of any other character). The only way you can get this type of list to sort the way you want it is to remove the spaces, sort, and then restore the spaces.</p>

            You may just have to resign yourself to Word's sort method. The same will be true in an index. I can tell you that a lot of publishers are rolling over on this just out of convenience (though I do prepare documents for one that has not--the dictionaries
 produced by Barron's Educational Series" are still sorted properly).

            <p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I will have to remove all the spaces - I really do not think the Word sort method will do in my case and must have this done properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, however, find it odd that there is no way around this with today´s technology.&nbsp;</p>

            If there were enough demand for it, it could probably be made to happen, but consider that in 15 versions of Word, Microsoft has still never managed a proper Title Case (something WordPerfect, I'm told, has always been able to do). At least they've stopped
 mislabeling it and now call it "Capitalize Each Word."

<p>Sorry for the late response.<br />
I already tried uninstall the office in my PC but the problem still occur.<br />
I think the problem is in exchange server because when I open my mail via OWA it can't delete an email or empty the folder.</p>

<p>You are actually correct. It may have something to do with the exchange server since deleting email also didn't work for Outlook Web Access. Have you recently done any updates on your exchange server? If this is deemed to be an issue with the exchange server,

            Setting the&nbsp;AutoSaveInterval value (at&nbsp;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Options) to zero would disable the AutoRecover function. But note that if there is some corruption in these entries, you may have to delete them for the changed

    <title>Why can&#39;t my WM6.1 phone sync Task Due dates with Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> molexconnector  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t my WM6.1 phone sync Task Due dates with Microsoft Exchange 2007 correctly&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Touch Pro 2 with standard ROM WM6.1. If I change several task due dates at once (either sync set to 'As items appear' or as a sync after fixed period) then all the later tasks are changed incorrectly to the due date of the first task and their
 due dates are lost. If I sync my Pro 2 with MS Exchange2003 then everything seems fine. If I do the same with MS MyPhone it's fine. All contacts, other fields in tasks (except start date), contacts etc all sync flawlessly with Ex2003, Ex2007 and My Phone.
 I have tried hard resets, deleting the account and re-initialising and still MS Ex2007 won't work... is there a fix? Any help appreciated... Cheers.&nbsp;

            I asked this question a while ago but&nbsp;no replies... There are a couple of other threads with people having issues with WM 6.1 and Exchange synchronization. What are other peoples' experiences with this or am I the only 6.1 owner with this issue?&nbsp;I'd be
 interested to know ...&nbsp;

            Here's the full story and results so far...<br />
<br />
1) WM6.0 and 6.1 phones both work with Ex2003<br />
2) WM6.0 and 6.1 phones BOTH fail to sync task dates correctly on Exchange 2007 ( I have tried this with 2 phones AND 2 DIFFERENT Ex2007 providers therefore it seems NOT to be either the phones or the way the providers have set up EX2007).<br />
3) WM6.1 works with MS MyPhone beta<br />
4) WM6.0 and WM6.1 both work with EX2007 ONLY&nbsp;if each task is synchronised separately between each and every change (Setting phone activesync to 'as items arrive' means waiting for several minutes to ensure previous task has finished synching, and synching
 after fixed period also causes the same problem).<br />
<br />
I'm led to the conclusion that there is either a problem with WM6.x or Exchange 2007 programming and it seems more likely to be Ex2007 as MS MyPhone
<em>beta</em> works fine.<br />
<br />
So come on MS GIVE US A PATCH PLEASE...

            I don't know where the Exhange Support Group is... another forum thread? Searching other MS threads brought up afew people with WM6.x / Exchange 2007 sync problems... it may not be a code error but I've tried 2 different companies and both my phones are
 completely standard WM6.x ROM's... if it was a data transmission error then it wouldn't be a) consistent and repeatable and b) occur over wifi and the phone network. I assume it's code based because I can't think what else it could be... I don't really care
 what the cause is... I just want to fix it and being only a user (albeit not a complete novice) of WM /Exchange was hoping for someone with more specialised knowledge to be able to help... If you are out there then solutions, rather than discussions of causes
 is where I'm hoping this will end up and any ideas greatly appreciated...

<h3> michaelpicco  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to open a table selected by a combo box&#63;</h2>
                    My goal is to create a form to be used as a tool.&nbsp; The function of the tool is to supply a list of tables in a combo box, from which a table will be chosen to be used as a source to populate a link-table.&nbsp; It seems that I'd want to use the"After Update"
 event to open the selected table, but the "HOW" of doing so is escaping me.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me some direction?<br />

            <p>1. I would highly suggest you do not open tables for people to work in directly.&nbsp; Once opened, there is no way to control certain things or validate entries except with rudimentary validation rules and those can be problematic.&nbsp; I would suggest using bound
 forms to work in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Having said that, you can open a table by using</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoCmd.OpenTable Forms!FormNameWithComboOnIt.ComboBoxNameHere</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: Added combo box part to code that I forgot to include.</p>

            First I agree with Bob. Users should NEVER be given access directly to tables. However if this is a database used only by you, then his code in the After Update event of your combo should do the job. Make sure the Tablename column is the bound column.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>However, I'd like to know what you mean by "used as a source to populate a link-table". That doesn't sound right.</div>

            Thank you Bob &amp; Scott for your replies.&nbsp; With regard to your concern about making tables available for the user to modify ... this wasn't my intention.&nbsp; My premise is to keep users away from being able to manipulate tables directly.&nbsp; With this being said,
 perhaps being a bit 'green' is my current 'malady'!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The goal here is to take a table that's been created from an Excel file and use that table to populate what I've referred to as a 'link table'.&nbsp; This link table will tie two other tables together, so that a query on those tables can be used to extract data
 for a report (actually 4 sub-reports on a main report).&nbsp; The data from the Excel file will be the basis we will use to create a BOM (bill of materials) report for each of hundreds of products.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The link table ties a raw inventory table with a product table, in order to create the BOM report.&nbsp; Much of what I've done has been trying to deal with a rather ugly database, without having to start over from scratch.&nbsp; Until I came on the scene, nobody here
 had a clue as far as setting up something resembling a relational database, as opposed to a massive 'flat-file'.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time, patience and understanding!<br />

            Well in that case, I would create a table of tables and have the user choose from a description so they don't see the tablename. Then use the selected table to generate your queries.&nbsp;

    <title>Microsoft Access 2007&#58; Create a hyperlink that links labels in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dormae7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Access 2007&#58; Create a hyperlink that links labels in different forms&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to create a hyperlink between two labels in exisiting forms in the same document for MS Access 2007? I am trying to show that if data is available in one label of one form, I want to hyperlink it to additional data via a label in a different
 form. For instance, the label titles would be the same in each of the different forms and would contain identical information, but the forms also have different parent/source tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried working with the relationships, but couldn't find anything of use with it. I know you can create hyperlinks in the forms, but it creates an entirely new label and I can't select specific lables to set the hyperlink too--it only hyperlinks to
 another form in general. I also know you can create hyperlinks in a column in the table but that can only go to a web page or another document--nothing in the same document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope to create a hyperlink that links identical data in the forms in both ways, respectivley, such that form 1 will link to form 2 if the data is identical and form 2 will also link back to form 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated! Been working on this so long but I can't figure it out. Is it even possible on Access?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't fully understand your issue clearly. If you want to create a hyperlink that links between two forms, In the Design view of Form, on the Design menu, you can click
 Hyperlink, in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, click "Object in This Database" under Link, then select another form that you want to link under Select an object in this database. You can also add a hyperlink to another form according to the above steps. Here
 is a article that you can refer to.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response and the link. I know you can create hyperlinks to link to another object in the database (i.e. another form), but I was wondering if you could specifically make the hyperlink target a specific page within a form. For example,
 if I was referring to information by the same customer, could I hyperlink that customer's page in one form, to that same customer's page in a different form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end I do not think that is possible. I might have to look more into relationships, but if you or anyone else knows whether or not this is possible, that would be wonderful if someone could help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello D,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hyperlink control will only open the form object. However, there are a number of ways you could have your second form open to the same record as your current form.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You could create a label field on your current form that looks like a hyperlink field and set the On Click event for that label to use the OpenForm method where you can specify a filter or where
 clause. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoCmd.OpenForm Method</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb238021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb238021.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You could apply a filter to the second form when it’s opened where the filter has a form reference to a field on your current form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sample uses Form1 and Form2. When I click on the hyperlink field in Form1, I open Form2. In the form On Load event for Form2, I added this code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_Load()</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Me.Filter = "Field1 = '" &amp; Forms!form1!Field1 &amp; "'"</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Me.FilterOn = True</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This code applies a filter to Field1 in Form2 with the value of Field1 from Form1. Note this sample assumes Field1 is a text datatype field. If you were filtering
 a number the code would look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_Load()</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Me.Filter = "Field1 = " &amp; Forms!form1!Field1</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Me.FilterOn = True</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I accidentally deleted email items from user's mailbox. The following command:<br />
get-mailbox -resultsize unlimited | search-mailbox -searchquery "my query" -deletecontent.<br />
<br />
"my query" was wrong format but the command was able to be excuted.<br />

I tried to find email items by using in-Place eDiscovert feature already, mail items are listed there without subject and content.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to get these mails back.<br />

                    <p>I've been collaborating with a few people using a personal OneDrive account. We've got the OneDrive Folder synced with a folder on our PCs and we can co-author Office files (Word &amp; Excel) when opening them from the Synced&nbsp;OneDrive Folder. My only concern
 with using&nbsp;a personal OneDrive account is that it is not secure. Anyone who has the shared folder link can access all the files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve the security concerns we subscribed to Office 365 Business Essentials. When we started using&nbsp;Office 365 Business Essentials in the same way (but with OneDrive for Busines instead of OneDrive Personal) it didn't work. We are unable to co-author
 Office files&nbsp;from the Synced&nbsp;OneDrive Folder. The facility appears not to be working as designed as we keep getting errors. Users are permitted to both open the shared files at the same time but Office does not open them in co-authoring mode. We therefore
 run into issues when changes are made because there is a conflict and the second person who tries to save a change has to save as a new version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned, we have subscribed only to&nbsp;&nbsp;Office 365 Business Essentials (which doesn't include Office products installed on the PC) and therefore have separate Office 365 personal licences (using different email addresses) for&nbsp; PC installed Products (Word,
 Excel etc.). Could this be the problem? Can we just sign the&nbsp;&nbsp;PC installed Products using the email address associated with&nbsp;&nbsp;Office 365 Business Essentials?</p>

            Hi. Thanks for the help. The problem was that Office PC installed products were not signed on with OneDrive account. Once we signed on Office PC installed&nbsp;products&nbsp;with the OneDrive account it worked. Sam
