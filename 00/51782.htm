<h2>            Where are my WLM Storage folders kept&#63;</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5b083aa-54dd-42c8-8f8f-315a8e25becd" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acba51cf-a2ad-4699-9f20-354f42f0c501" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know where is my WLM storage. When I installed WLM I changed the default location to the location of my choice.</p>
<p>Everything seems fine. For years now WLM starts and displays the folders and it contents properly.</p>
<p>Recently I wanted to do some operations on files in WLM storage using Windows Explorer and I get stumped.</p>
<p>Under Windows Explorer the folders structure under "Storage folders" is much different from the structure displayed under "Storage folder" in WLM.</p>
<p>Above&nbsp;are screenshots of both folders.</p>
<p>Not believing my eyes I've decided to change WLM storage location thinking that during copying files to new location the folders will be shown again. No luck.</p>
<p>In the new location under Windows&nbsp;Explorer the&nbsp;folders structure&nbsp;under "Storage folders" &nbsp;is the same as it was in old location and does not reflect the structure displayed under "Storage folder" in WLM.</p>
<p>Hence my question: </p>
<p><strong><u>How WLM knows what is&nbsp;the Storage folders structure and where those folders are physically located on my hard drive?</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks,</p>

            <p>I have found some folders under Imported Fo ## folders.</p>
<p>Why are they kept in different folders under Imported Fo ## name instead of being stored&nbsp;in reflecting &nbsp;the same folder structure as in WLM?</p>
<p>To add insult to injury some storage folders appear also directly under Storage Folders folder.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but I was looking for the key not for the value.</p>
<p>Yes,, I do have <u>Store Root value</u> in the registry and it points to my <u>
message store location</u>.</p>
<p>The question I posted was, </p>
<p><strong><u>How WLM knows what is&nbsp;the Storage folders structure and where those folders are physically located on my hard drive?<br />
<br />
</u></strong>Storage folders and message store location are 2 different things.<br />
I know the answer to the 2nd part of that question, but I repeat the first part:</p>
<p><strong><u>How WLM knows what is&nbsp;the Storage folders structure ?<br />
<br />
</u></strong>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you for getting back to us. </p>
<p><br />
The information for the folders that are saved on&nbsp;Windows Live Mail&nbsp;is on the <em>
Mail.MSMessageStore</em> file. The storage folder should still be under the path where the message store is located.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to verify, can you please try to&nbsp; open any email under the storage folder that is not showing on Windows Explorer? Were you able to open it properly or do you receive any error message? Please give us the requested details for confirmation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are looking forward for your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 PC fails to boot, restarts as soon as Restore begins</h2>
                    <p>While trying to update to the 1709 update, my computer completely froze (left it for many hours, stuck mid-motion at 81%, no disk activity).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A restart now has it in the following state. It starts, shows PC log, then attempts to recover / restore previous version, but it immediately turns off and reboots again. Same thing happens, starts to recover, flashes message 'restoring your previous version
 of windows' then it restarts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a recovery disk from another Windows 10 PC and ran this, and attempted to run repair, restore previous version, every single line in the Troubleshooting and Advanced section that did not involve a complete wipe, no luck. They can see Windows 10
 volume, but any attempt to repair fails. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, though, i can access cmd prompt via the troubleshooting tool, and C volume and X volume are at least cohesive enough that I can read them and look through the files. This is stopping me from doing a complete wipe and reset (I have a LOT of
 things on this computer, and though critical stuff is backed up, I would prefer not to start again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the SrtTrail.txt file, following my latest repair attempt, I have the following message at the end:</p>
<p>Root Cause Found:</p>
<p>unspecified changes to system configuration might have caused the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair action:</p>
<p>Result: Failed. Error code = 0x32</p>
<p>time taken 125ms</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair action: System files integrity check and repair</p>
<p>Results; Failed. Error code 0x57</p>
<p>time taken 1526ms</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have access to command prompt, I feel as if there should be something I should be able to do to get this working again. I had a look at bootrec.exe but do not know enough about boot process to use it. Not sure that's where the issue is either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or direction would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started the custom installation but it won't let me use Primary, with an error msg 'The selected disk is of the GPT partition style'. Since it should (probably?) be MBR, this may be an indication of what my problem is, something's gone wrong with my
 partitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I imagine that I'll have to reformat my partition and install Windows afresh, and will not have a windows.old save. Fortunately I have backups of critical files if that is the route I will need to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further advice to avoid a format/wipe would be welcome, otherwise I will go ahead :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP, I need my laptop for work a.s.a.p. After the latest Windows 10 updates, I am unable to open any program, file, folder etc on my laptop. Not even the windows icon on the bottom left, nor the task manager (not even after i press control+alt+delete).
 I can click on them all, but nothing happens after i do. What do I do?</p>
<p><br />
I'm using an Acer Aspire ES 15 laptop running latest windows 10.<br />
<br />
If anyone is having or have had same/similar issue and know how to fix this PLEASE REPLY
</p>
<p><br />
Ps...is anyone else feeling frustrating? . I thought we were supposed to be able to trust microsoft and trust the updates (especialy sence we don't even have a choice now on when/how often updates are installed cuz there automaticly done) it seems after every
 single update there are major issues caused, and not even just with win10. I have a desktop computer with win7, and a surface with windows 8 and I always find some problem after AANY update. Uggh so frustrating.

            Hi Branika, 
<br />
<br />It sounds like it may be a temporary profile issue...
<br />
<br />Do me a favor, let's try a hard boot. Push and hold the power button down for 10 seconds (screen should go black) - let it sit for a few seconds. Push the power button. It'll say do you want to start windows normally, choose that option. Upon rebooting, try to log back in and see if your icons are accessible. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            HI AD1999,<br />
<br />
Corrupted system files is one of the possible reasons why you are having issues exporting files using Paint3D and opening files using the File Explorer on with your Windows 10 computer. We suggest that you run the<strong> System File Checker</strong> tool and
 the <strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management </strong>tool to scan and correct any issues. System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool in the operating system. SFC checks for system file corruption. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)
 is a command-line tool that can be used to service a Windows image or to prepare a Windows Preinstallation Environment image.<br />
<br />
Kindly follow the steps in this article posted by <strong>ZigZag3143 (MS-MVP)</strong> to perform SFC and DISM:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">

    <title>The Burger King Mentality of Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hatewindows8sosomuch  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Burger King Mentality of Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Hey Microsoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to point out that you guys are trying WAY to hard to be like your competitors. What's sad, is that you have had such an upper hand in both the personal and business world for software, and you are losing out on all the success&nbsp;you could have
 had, while you were spending time copying others.&nbsp;I am relating you to Burger King, because their entire marketing scheme is to copy McDonalds, who is clearly winning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Your roll out of Microsoft 8. Wow! How moronic was that? You literally force-fed the entire world to use the most idiotic operating system ever. You had the entire world in your palm, everyone knows how to use your operating system, we have all grown
 up using it. And because you guys wanted&nbsp;part of the&nbsp;trendy coffee shop Apple iphone / tablet market, you transitioned EVERYTHING to your garbage Windows 8. Colorful, miss-matched size boxes, that move as a search bar? I sincerely want to see what your corporate
 meetings were like. I want to see how that presentation to the board occured, I want to look in their eyes and watch what hopeful emotion to win looks like, followed by immediate and horrifying sadness from loss.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would never think, ever, to pay so much money for the 'easy to use,' communist style Apple computer, but I did. I returned a computer with Windows 8 on it, and spent
<strong>3 TIMES</strong> the amount of money, buying an Apple laptop. I searched around for a retailer that would sell me a Windows computer that WAS NOT WINDOWS 8, and due to your licensing and scheming, and your dirty tricks, there was none. So out of complete
 frustration,&nbsp;I turned to Apple, and was so relieved to actually use something that was logical and sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried purchasing two phones with your Windows 8 nightmare programming on it for my wife and I. RETURNED within 2 days, bought 2 brand new iPhones for WAY more money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you getting the point? Your consumers don't come to you looking for tablets and copies of Apple products. If you geniuses hired intelligent people, or thought about what you were doing a bit deeper, you would hold&nbsp;a customer base that loves you. Instead,
 they are all returning your products, and hating you for it, all while paying WAY more money to get away from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I just want to point out in other areas where you are losing, so horribly, it's sad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) <strong>Hotmail</strong>: Hotmail isn't even an option for automated email apps for phones and computers. It is so bad compared to other email accounts like Gmail.
<strong>Have one, never use it, gmail is way better.</strong></p>
<p>b) <strong>XBOX</strong>: I can't stand the fact that your products break, and I have to pay monthly for an online account. That is so stupid. Not to mention, you guys trying to attach bells and whistles to your product to charge $100 more and to lure people
 is also stupid. You know just as well as I do who you are losing business to (we've all read the reports).
<strong>Threw my XBOX 360 off a cliff, literally. Bought a PS3, love it. Am going to buy a PS4.</strong></p>
<p>c) <strong>Remember the Zune</strong>? That was also a horrible defeat. I can't blame you for losing so bad on that one (other than trying to make trendy operating systems for it), that was a genuine attempt to get into the Mp3 player market. Good try, but
 it sucked. <strong>Bought a Zune, it broke, couldn't return it, gave it to charity drop off, bought an iPod.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Where you are winning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Props to your Microsoft Office team. I love you guys, thank you for making amazing software that has allowed me to be successful in my career.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, Burger King. You guys seriously need to get back to your roots and start doing things your way, or make huge deals with Apple, because they are destroying you. Also, PLEASE STOP TRYING TO BE COOL AND TRENDY. Your Marketing groups and whoever is driving
 your child-like, 'lets do this together,' hold-hands, PE class text-book cover, feel-good, Owl City soundtrack nonsense needs to be fired immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should also consider hiring me. Judging by what you guys have shown this world in the last couple years, you could use all the help you can get. I'm extremely intelligent, have a strong understanding and grasp of analytics, finance, and marketing. No,
 not in your average Silicon Valley ways... I'm talking oil company style; guerilla tactics.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hit me up.</p>

<p>Yes I use built in touch pad,and it occurs on all the programs. Such as: I am copying something from my laptop to a pendrive, the pasting dialog box appears and disappear suddenly. I want to delete a file then I just right click on that file to delete, the
 option box appears and disappear suddenly. It's occurring both on desktop and inside a folder.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Accidentally merged &#39;3D Objects&#39; folder with my D&#58; drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently got a new laptop that has a small SSD &amp; a large HDD. To preserve space, I was transferring my default folders (Documents, Music, Video, Downloads, etc) from the C: (SSD) to D: (HDD). Most went fine, but on the last one I managed to tell Windows
 to merge my 3D Objects folder with D: drive. The icon under 'This PC' still shows the 3D objects folder, but it is labelled D:\ now. If I go into that folder, its definitely my D: drive, with everything the same whether I go in through that folder or the Drives
 &amp; Devices. When I look at the properties of the folder, it shows drive properties (instead of folder properties).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ... how do I get my 3D objects folder back? I'm less worried about having that particular folder than I am about having something screwy going on in my directory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi DG.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This can happen when you fail to create a new folder on D to move the 3D Objects User folder into, so it moves it to D itself.  
<br />
<br />To Restore the Default 3D Objects User folder use whichever options works here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-resto...</a>
<br />
<br />One you restore the Default Shell User folder, you can then move it the correct way which is the create a new folder by that name on D, then move it's Location from the Properties box as shown here:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />The contents of the 3D Objects folder will not be restored along with it as they have been dumped into the D folder and will have to be copied out into the restored 3D Objects folder after you restore it's default or move it correctly to D.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>The option to <strong>just remove your files</strong> performs a quick format on the device then reinstall Windows. This doesn't take long, and is to be used if you'll still use your Surface device. Your files are not actually fully deleted, only the index
 or pointers to these files are removed, thus, some or all of the data files can still be recovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Fully Clean the Drive</strong> option on the other hand will perform a full format of the hard disk which will involve a longer, more detailed and secured process of erasing your data. This can take several hours to finish. This option is applicable
 if you want to sell or pass on the ownership of your Surface device.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Office 2013 RT came pre-installed on Surface RT, thus, resetting it will not remove the package from your device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your question about your Microsoft account being modified or deleted from the device, yes, the account including all of your personal files will be deleted, and your settings will be reset. All apps that you installed will be removed. Once
 reset, you can still use your existing Microsoft account as the account itself will not be deleted from the cloud, only from the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important that you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
back up your files</a> before performing a device reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more information about how to reset your Surface RT, check this article:

<h3> grillat2k  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to add microphone level to volyme mixer&#63;</h2>
                    Installed the nifty little program called 3RVX. With that i can easily change volume and also mute. However since the microphone level isnt in the volyme mixer it doesnt get muted by 3RVX. How do you add microphone level to volume mixer?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Are you able to listen to sound while playing from the Microphone?<br />
<div>I would suggest that you follow the steps provided below and check if the issue persists.<br />
a)&nbsp;Right click on the volume icon on the taskbar.<br />
b)&nbsp;Select the option Playback devices.<br />
c)&nbsp;A new Window “Playback” will open.<br />
d)&nbsp;Select the Tab Recording.<br />
e)&nbsp;Right click and select show disabled devices and show disconnected devices.<br />
f)&nbsp;Check if you have Microphone icon.<br />
g)&nbsp;Right click on the Microphone icon and select Enable.<br />
h)&nbsp;Click on OK<br />
i)&nbsp;Check in the volume mixer if you get the Microphone volume level.<br />

            Hi, the microphone is there and its working without a problem. I just cant see the microphone level in volyme mixer.<br />
<br />
btw, Microsoft should add this 3RVX program to windows 8 becuase its extremely convenient and easy too use, pretty much a must have if you dont have media buttons on keyboard.

<h2>            Line in &#34;unplugged&#34; on Win 8,1</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo Z500. In the front panel there's a single 3.5mm jack for both in and output. So far so good, mobile phones work that way and I don't really have anything against that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I do have a problem with, is when I need to use it as line-in but it won't work. (speakers work and always worked just fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to record audio through the line in but on the audio device manager it shows as unplugged and I've been so far unable to figure it out.</p>
<p><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a10978f0-ecb0-49d6-a893-43da88bba09e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried updating to the latest driver, disabling and reenabling, uninstalling and reinstalling the device and doing anything that i thought could be a possible cause of this malfuctioning, all without results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm truly desperate and I hope sombody out there can help me see this through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much,</p>
<p>
</p><p>beikeni</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Bonus question: what's that "Stereo Mix" device in the list? the audio card? if so then why does it have a volume bar next to it? isnt in-n-output supposed to go through peripherals such as (duh) the microphone and the line in?</p>
<p>What use does it have? can it be used to solve or bypass the problem im experiencing?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 free upgrade and formating the laptop</h2>
                    Hi all!Recently my laptop has been running a little slow,so i decided that i should format it and reinstated as it was when i bought it.Now,when i bought it it came with windows 8.0 and being a laptop the windows product key is in the bios.Im currently
 at the latest build of windows 10(i got my free upgrade way back when the offer started)and im curious what will happen after i do the format.Will i be able to upgrade again to 10,because the offer seems to have ended,or am i stuck to 8.1 maximum?Is there
 any way i can provide my key and show that i was indeed eligible to get the free upgrade and that i already got it so i can upgrade again?Thanks for any help guys!!

            <p>The free upgrade issued your computer with a Digital License which is valid for the lifetime of the device so yes you are entitled to reinstall completely. That License is held by the Microsoft Activation Servers and is specific to your hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the Media creation tool for your version of Windows from here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you select the right version at each step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot from the media and go through the setup process. When you get to the point for entering a key use the option to enter a key later. Once setup is complete it should activate automatically using the License held by Microsoft for your computer.</p>

            <p>Hello Shafaat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple display monitors are a great way to spread out your workload, divide your work space, and prevent restriction of single monitor tasks. About your query, there is no set limit on using extended monitor displays, but a user is only limited by his
 ability to carry out the hardware it can support. With this, the video card will serve as a determining factor. All video cards should utilize the same driver in order to ensure that it will work smoothly together. Furthermore, it is highly dependent on both
 motherboard and graphics/video card that will be integrated on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to write again if you need additional assistance regarding your query.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are zip files, so after you download each drive to its own folder, expand the zip file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a root folder named: U180</p>
<p>Create the following subfolders: </p>
<p>Audio, </p>
<p>AtomChipset, </p>
<p>CardReader, </p>
<p>IntelVGA, </p>
<p>RealTeKLAN, </p>
<p>TouchPad,</p>
<p>Intel Bluetooth<br />
AzureWave Wireless LAN<br />
Intel Wireless LAN<br />
Intel Rapid Storage Technolog<br />
Camera</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now download each driver to its own subfolder and expand each .zip file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most likely you may only need to install the chipset and maybe the VGA driver during the install process.

<h2>            Day One Console - Burnt Out&#63; Help needed&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>My Day1 console has just gone off. I powered it up after leaving it off for around 20 hours like usual and it there was nothing? I swapped the plug fuse then a 2nd console cable and power adaptor (got 2 consoles on day one release). I tried the 2nd power
 cable in and the orange light went out. After trying various others things I pinned it down to the console. After a while of letting it cool down I powered it up to try &amp; release the game that was in the drive. There was a crackling noise coming from the back
 right of the console then a strong smell of burning so I immediately unplugged everything in case there was a fire.</p>
<p>After half an hour I powered it up again carefully in the open and the drive released the disc on request so I smelt for smoke and all seemed well. I poked around the dashboard and then I put the game back in and began to play but after around half an hour
 the console cut out and now won't power on properly? It powers on then cuts straight back off again. The power adaptor is fine, it seems like the console is over heating or has hardware failure :(</p>
<p>It was bought from a catalogue in the UK who I've informed so do I return it to them or to M$? I need to know so I can get the issue resolved asap.</p>

<p>After our 3rd call to the UK catalogue company requesting assistance and decisions they finally told us to go to m$ and get the repair done with a ref # they gave us. After an hour on the phone speaking to somebody in India from m$ my wife ended up tearful
 and frustrated as they wouldn't accept our cards for some weird reason? (2 of the cards are registered to my m$ account!
</p>
<p>We rang the bank to see if it was a security issue (pain in the *** but necessary) and the arrogant pleb on the other end was so awkward we ended up being locked out of the account!</p>
<p>I'm now so frustrated that I'm going to return the XBOX to the catalogue and ask for a refund! I'm not going through this crap again 'cos I can only assume after reading all the posts in here that it'll happen again...</p>

<p>the OP says he swapped a fuse in the plug. if he did that in in the power brick, which DOES have a fuse in it, then he probably blew the warranty on it. also, if you plug your xbox one's power brick into a surge protector, you likely WILL blow it. the xbox
 one's power brick was not designed to be plugged into a surge protector, just the normal wall outlet</p>

<p>The OP is a professional computer technician with a fuse tester and volt meter to hand. He also has a 2nd XBOX one as explained and tried both power adaptors in his diagnosis (after checking the fuse which was okay). His diagnosis is that the XBOX one power
 unit inside the console that controls the voltage to the mainboard is not up to the job. The power adaptor has it's own voltage dropper and would blow prior to the console if there was a surge or any voltage issue.</p>
<p>We've just rang the bank back and can confirm that the card issue was due to microsoft trying to take £391 out of the account so was refused (thanfully). Due to this issue we're now going to return the console back to the retailer and let them deal with
 it and I hope anyone reading this dows the same ;)</p>

<h2>            New computer&#58; Screen blacks out randomly for no reason.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a new computer. All the parts were selected and put together manually.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the screen blacks out..The monitor is fine and all, it just seems like the computer lost connection to the monitor. After it blacks out, the sound still goes on (when I'm watching videos or listening to music), but it freezes after a few
 seconds. Producing a buzzing sound. This happens at random times.&nbsp; Sometimes it can happen 2 or 3 times within 2 hours. Whether I'm playing a game, using photoshop, or browsing internet, it just happens.<br />
<br />
Computer Specifics:<br />
<br />
OS: Windows 7 Pro, 64 bit.<br />
<br />
-Asus P7P55D Motherboard<br />
-Kingston 4GB 1333MHz CL9 1.5V <br />

If there's anyone that can help, that would be awesome! Thanks.</p>

            Expand the 'Graphics tab' in the upper left corner of the CCC. At the bottom of the list you should see 'ATI Overdrive'. Click on ATI Overdrive. When it opens you'll have to 'Accept' terms of use. When Overdrive opens you'll need to check the box marked
 'Enable manual fan control' to set the fan speed. The CCC needs to be in 'Advanced' mode to use ATI overdrive. When I first installed the CCC I was given the option to use 'standard or advanced' settings. I chose advanced.

I receive the following error:<span style="font-weight: bold"> 0x80073B01: The resource loader cache doesn't have loaded MUI entry.</span><br />

I don't know why but I also found the CatRoot2 Directory in the bin and I restored it.<br />
<br />
I assume that one of these causes are involved in the issues I have on my computer. But the question is how to restore my computer without being forced to format it.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much, in advance, for your help.<br />
Waiting for your answers.<br />

Thanks you Diana for all your help, you are so kind :).<br />
