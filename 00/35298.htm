<h2>            Western Digital Elements 1 tb External Hard Drive Not Loading Properly in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday, I accidentally unplugged my external hard drive from its USB port on my computer. This had happened a couple times before and everything turned out fine. Now it won't load properly.</p>
<p>When I go to "My Computer" Windows recognizes the hard drive and attempts to load it on explorer. The progress indicator gets to about 95% and then freezes. As a result of this I cannot run chkdsk and disk management. I couldn't even reformat the drive if
 I wanted to. I tried the generic solutions like powering down and unplugging everything and suggestions I've seen here like uninstalling the drivers and letting Windows automatically re-install them. The HD itself keeps running as it normally does with the
 blue light indicator flashing. I can't find any reference to my problem specifically and I was wondering if anyone could help. I'm not particularly tech savvy and it's getting frustrating. Thanks in advance.</p>

<span>Hi EvenStephen,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Do you see any yellow bang in the device manager?</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span><strong>troubleshooter</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span></span><span><span>.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Under
</span></span><span><span><strong>Hardware and Sound</strong></span></span><span><span>, click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Configure a device</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>‌<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would also suggest you to try connecting to a different computer and check if the issue still persists.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may also get in touch with the device manufacturer to check for updates.</span></p>

<p>pretty sure its an issue with 1803 because i was regularly using this feature before i updated so what would be the fix for this? using an alienware aurora</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Right Click Speaker Icon near clock lower right&nbsp;- Playback Devices<br />
<br />
Highlight Speakers - Properties (lower right same page) - Enhancements&nbsp; Tab - Check Disable all Sound Effect<br />
Apply - OK<br />
<br />
2. Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to
<br />
see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take
<br />
several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

 tried clearing the store cache, I have rebooted my laptop multiple times, I have uninstalled and reinstalled my third-party AV, I have run a full scale system scan. The store does not give me the option to uninstall and reinstall and the store troubleshooter
 just said there was an error in the app. I couldn't provide any feedback because the feedback app won't download as it goes through the store. My laptop uses an AMD Ryzen 5 with Windows 10 Home version 1803 and OS build 17134.345.&nbsp;</p>

            Went through every step. Step 3 with the troubleshooter said there was no issue that could be identified. Step 5 with PowerShell said AppxManifest path does not exist. Step 8 I had previously completed before posting my question. Step 9 with the new user
 gave absolutely no change to whether or not anything would install. I am still getting error 0x803FB005 but feedback hub apparently installed at some point during all the steps

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            How is this fix different from the Fresh Start option that comes with my Windows Defender? How will this effect applications such as AMD software, Cisco Modules, HP applications, Realtek bluetooth driver and wireless driver, because the Fresh Start program
 claims all that will be removed.&nbsp;

            I assume that you mean that you'd like to print an Excel spreadsheet as a pdf.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The easiest way to do this is to download and install free <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CutePDF Writer</a>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Then just select CutePDF Writer as the "printer" when you want to print from any application, including Excel.&nbsp; This doesn't "convert" an existing file.&nbsp; You have to open the file in the correct application and then create a new pdf file by "printing" it.<br />

            <p>Hi Dr. JesusMejia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the complete error message that you receive?</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the PC?</p>
<p>3. Do you have another computer connected to the same network?</p>
<p>4. Who is your Internet Service Provider(ISP)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are getting an error message 'Windows has detected an IP address conflict' 'Another computer on this network has the same IP address as this computer', then it means that means more than one computer is using the same IP address, which is resulting
 in a conflict.</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Each computer on a network must have a unique IP address.
<br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>To fix this problem, run the Network troubleshooter. </font><span><font color="#000000">Follow steps from this article:<br />
</font><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/get-help-with-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Get help with "There is an IP address conflict" message</font></a></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If that does not help, release and renew the IP address computers with the same IP address.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">To do this, follow these steps:</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">a. Click on <strong>Start. </strong>In the Start<strong>&nbsp;</strong>search box, type
<font><b>cmd</b>. Right-click on <strong><span>cmd.exe</span> </strong>and choose
<span><strong>Run as administrator</strong></span></font>.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">b. In the prompt, type <font><b>ipconfig </b>and press Enter key<strong>.</strong></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">c. Type <b><font>ipconfig /release</font></b> (note the space between ipconfig and /) and press Enter.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">The IP configuration information will refresh. You should see your IP address change to 0.0.0.0.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">d. Type <b><font>ipconfig /renew</font></b>&nbsp;(note the space between ipconfig and /) and press Enter.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
The DHCP configuration for all adapters will be renewed. To renew the IP address for a specific adapter, type the adapter name that appears when you type ipconfig at the command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Your computer will attempt to obtain a new IP address from the network. This may take a few minutes.<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If this process is successful, you will see a new IP address listed when the IP configuration information refreshes.</font></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried the suggestions&nbsp;proposed in my first response?</p>
<p><br />
If you're on a home network,&nbsp;reboot all the computers and the router it will straighten itself out unless you are running static IP.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            So running the 5.5.0a version stops the crashes? <br />
<br />
The software I used was WinDbg. Analyzing .DMP files is a science really, and something that requires
<i>much </i>reading and practice over time. Looking at the 'probably caused by' to find a culprit is the absolute beginning. You eventually learn to look and read through call stacks, memory, loaded module lists, what codes mean, etc. You'll also be able to
 look at a dump, its bug check, and even if there is no clear indication of what the issue is anywhere in the dump itself, you can from there form educated guesses based off certain 3rd party drivers you suspect causing conflicts, etc.<br />
<br />
For your dumps, I took a look and saw that there was nothing really that implied hardware errors yet, but also the modules list noted the
<i><b>vmxnet3n61x64.sys</b></i> driver being dated pre-2011 if I remember correctly, which said to me that it is possibly not the latest version depending. It was one of the only 3rd party drivers on the system given it's a server especially, so this raised
 more than a few flags to me.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <u><b>CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION (109)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that the kernel has detected critical kernel code or data corruption.</i><br />
<br />
<i>There are generally two causes for this bug check:</i><br />
<ol>
<li>A driver has inadvertently, or deliberately, modified critical kernel code or data. Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later versions of Windows for x64-based computers do not allow the kernel to be patched except through authorized
 Microsoft-originated hot patches. For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=50719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Patching Policy for x64-based Systems</a>. <br />
</li><li>A hardware corruption occurred. For example, the kernel code or data could have been stored in memory that failed.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
Looking at the dump initially, I can see no real clues as to what may be causing it. Most if not all *109's start like this. I took a look at the loaded modules list and found a driver that MAY be possibly causing this issues if device driver related -
<i><b>vmxnet3n61x64.sys</b></i> (<span>This files most often belongs to product <strong>
VMware PCIe Ethernet Adapter NDIS 6.1 (64-bit)</strong>. and were most often developed by company
<strong>VMware, Inc.)<br />
<br />
</strong>If not, let's go ahead and run a Memtest for NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours):<br />
<br />
</span>Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<br />
<i><b>If Memtest goes ~8 passes without error, we could enable Driver Verifier to look for further possible device driver conflicts and or corruption:</b></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

    <title>Windows 10 does not hibernate properly &#40;after Creators update&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 does not hibernate properly &#40;after Creators update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So this is driving me somewhat crazy...</p>
<p>I have an Asus Q551L running Win10 Pro x64 and upgraded to a SSD a while back. Initially, things were a bit 'un-tuned' but after a while I got everything set up and running perfectly. One of the last issues I had was that the computer would not go into hibernate
 properly - it would power down and save all data to disk but the power indicator would remain on (drive activity stopped though and fans would shut down). After messing around with the power settings (I don't recall what the exact item was that fixed it...
 kicking myself) and such I managed to get it to hibernate properly and life was good... until I installed the Creators Update a few weeks ago. And now the power-down/hibernate issue is back. No matter what I change in the power settings, it does not want to
 go into a full power down state even though powercfg tells me that hibernate is supported (though I cannot find settings in the BIOS to change/enable the S1/2 states - but which I don't use).</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced something like this? Any pointers on what I should try next? I've made sure that its not an application holding it up nor an external device (unplugged all)... also ran sfc /scannow with no indication of an error...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            That does not address the issue. The issue is that I want to hibernate but it doesn't do it correctly. Something in the Creators Updated modified my settings so it now does not fully go into a power down mode. If I wanted to fully shut down, then that
 is what I would do, but I want it to hibernate. So yes, I need further assistance.

<p>Though I appreciate the effort, this really does not address the issue.</p>
<p>Can I run a clean boot and then go into Hibernate? probably - yes. Does this address the issue. Not at all.</p>
<p>I did not install any new programs between when I was able to hibernate fully and when it started hanging. The only change was Windows Creators update. I would reason that this caused the issue since nothing else has changed. All device drivers are up to
 date with nothing new being released since. I reason that therefore the issue lies with something that the update changed without my express permission (typical for W10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So once more, I ask if there is any way that I can figure out what is causing the issue... is there a way I can determine this using the Event Viewer? any log files that get or can be generated when a hibernate is requested that show what items are being
 executed?</p>

<p>Ran all the troubleshooting options I found. It did make a few changes to the power settings, but only related to time before sleeping. Since the default is short, I also found out that Sleep doesn't work (had to do a hard restart)... so likely it is related
 to the power options, but not something that is readily available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I would like to get away from a 'try this' approach and do some more methodical testing. How do I log the processes that are being shut down/stored or similar during a hibernate? If I can do that, I have a feeling that the last process in that
 list will be the issue...</p>

<p>So...<br />
some troubleshooting steps I've taken:</p>
<p>1) Did a clean restart and then ran the computer for a usual amount of time and under normal workload to get things to where they would usually be.</p>
<p>2) Then performed a Hibernate to get the error/issue to appear. </p>
<p>3) Went to Event Viewer&gt;Windows Logs&gt;System</p>
<p>I found a few entries just around the time when the system went into hibernate that I have questions about. They appear in this order (earlier to later):</p>
<p>- Information: Kernel Power: The system is entering sleep.<br />
- Error: TPM: The device driver for the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) encountered an error in the TPM hardware, which might prevent some applications using TPM services from operating correctly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- Information: EnhancedStorage-EhStorTcgDrv: The following informational event has occurred (0x0, 0x4, 0x0, 0x0). D0Exit</p>
<p>- Information: Kernel-Power: The system has resumed from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last entry occurs as the last entry before the system 'hangs'... or before I power it back on a few minutes later. It looks like the system tries to sleep (=hibernate?) but then tries to wake up again... what could cause this?<br />
Also, the TPM error, not sure about how to handle that. I am not using TPM for anything... I took a look at TPM.msc but it just gave me the 'reduced functionality' feedback. Suggestions?<br />
The EnhancedStorage item... not sure how to look at that. Any suggestions? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling that the issue has to do with one of the items mentioned above. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Darian,</p>
<p>no disrespect, but the whole 'how about you try this' approach is not helping. Updating (and first uninstalling) drivers for graphics and similar is usually the first thing I try. I am looking for a more structured approach, something I would expect from
 a software/IT professional. The process of debugging requires first that the problem is understood, something that is usually gleaned from log files.. the problem being that I cannot find a way to generate such logs and the Event Logs are so cryptic (see above)
 that I cannot further use that information.</p>
<p>At this point, from looking over the available logs and the fairly consistent error that I am now getting that "need to update xx" or "xx is out of date" i am suspecting that it may somehow be related to a time setting (perhaps this is just a different problem,
 perhaps it is the root). I have checked the time &amp; location settings and they seem fine, but when I go into AVG (my anti virus app), it tells me that there is a newer version, even though the date on the current version is later than the recommended update...
 this would lead me to believe that there is an issue with the Windows Time... but it does not show up as such... ideas?<br />
Bottom line, I really need a way to get my hands on debug log data. without it, I am just chasing possible issues, rather than finding the root issue... so logs. Any pointers?</p>

<h2>            Harley&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Revenge. Anyone else completely disappointed&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>SPOILERS AHEAD!!!</p>
<p>Ok, I'm a huge fan of the Arkham series so far. I love what Rocksteady has been able to do for Batman in the gaming world. But what the *** is with this new DLC?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I get to play as Robin, great!... Oh? I can't even navigate a part of the city as him, much less the whole thing.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Where are the huge grunt battles? I don't think there was a fight that involved more than 10 guys at once. I remember busting in on Penguin and fighting 30+ bad guys and being SO excited that I could finally open up and get a 70+ combo going with relative
 ease.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The 'stealth' parts of the game were garbage. I didn't feel like a bad @@@ at all. Thanks to the layout and enemy types, I pretty much fumbled my way through each enemy. One of the 'stealth' oriented areas was strictly snipers. Snipers don't move! They stood
 in one spot and sometimes watched as I took out their buddies. At one point one watched as I hid behind a pillar, then turned around and scoped the area again. WTF?</p>
</li><li>
<p>No new characters introduced. So I'm in the same area as AC, fighting the same exact enemies as AC, against one of the same main antagonists as in AC. Where is there any differentiation from the main story? Not a single new Batman character was introduced
 to the universe.</p>
</li><li>
<p>No boss battle what so ever. Harley goes down like a *** both times you encounter her. Puts up absolutely zero fight.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Length, as I battled a few enemies in the same room as Harley, finally playing as a Batman that's not in a flashback, I think the game is just about to pick up. Nope, I finished the 10 or so enemies, grab Harley, cue credits.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Anyone else play this so far? What did you guys think? Am I missing something?</p>

<p>(1) to be fair I dont think anyone was expecting a long campaign &nbsp;just to tidy up where is harley once Joker died. I dont think they going to bring Kroc or Scarcrow in for this particular episode. Even in comics or the tv shows the villian team ups were
 rare, MAYBE they could have done harley and posion Ivy.Since Rocksteady has been so good to keep Batman cannon straight or the bare minimum modify the batman universe not many people going to complain(harley's two outfits in the game instead of what she wore
 for the tv show). so yes more bosses would be sweet it wouldnt make sense just to throw stuff in just for giggles.</p>
<p>(2) on the stealth issues I think we been trained like good monkeys to be sneaky or we die in five seconds that when it seems too easy we think something wrong. the area where I picked up the key to free batman, too me seemed there were like five ways to
 achieve my goal but they kind of point towards option one or two(ambush everyone either go top to bottom or bottom to top and save harley for last so you dont get cheat killed because you forgot a henchmen.</p>
<p>(3) did you really think Harley was going to fight much or long. to think about it most of batman's villians are long for fighting. Other than Bane most bad guys is set up some plane, set it in motion to cause batman to show up, batman finds a way to solve
 a puzzle dependent on the villian, they discover they are close when they fight ten bad guys, repeat it two or three times then fight the main bad guy defeat them and turn them in.</p>

<p>I didn't expect it to be long at all 2 hours is plenty to tell a good story. It's just, in this instance, the story kind of sucked. The DLC is titled Harley's Revenge, she should actually be acting bat *** crazy(no pun intended). Instead we're left with
 a the Harley we've seen already, maybe a little more whiny, but not acting all that differently.</p>
<p>There was basically zero story telling. At no point did I feel that anyone was in real danger. We're told Batman is heartbroken and confused at the loss of Joker and Talia... but where is that shown.. AT ALL?! We also find a negative pregnancy test. So now
 Harley isn't pregnant and that 'story line' is wrapped up without any official mention by any of the characters? It was all just very sloppy and not put together all too well.</p>
<p>I wanted one of two things to happen. 1. Give me a loose story where I pound through a BUNCH of enemies. Maybe a well put together boss. or 2. Give me a great story and keep the game play light like it was. Instead we got this crap story with very little
 interesting game play. Where is the incentive to go back and play again?! (don't you dare say those stupid balloons because a collectible doesn't mean much if there's no incentive to collect)</p>

<p>It was totally disappointing! Not even worth 10$ Maybe 5$ I got alot more out of the map pack which was like 5$. I was really excited for this dlc ever since it was announced in April I think. It wasn't even 2 hours I beat it in just over an hour and after
 the story there is nothing to do other than pop those balloons. The "story" was really boring, nothing happened, and after you beat it it just starts all over again from the main menu, you cant even explore afterwards. I feel ripped off. Rocksteady put so
 much into arkham city and it is worth every penny, this DLC is the exact opposite. This was a $h!**y way to "wrap up" the main story, it didn't add much.</p>
<p>BTW!!! Did anyone else notice that when you start as batman and you talk to gordon he says something like "After this we have to talk about that OTHER thing" what could he be reffering to? What is the other thing? Possibly the third game?</p>

<p>Yeah, that "other problem" was very curious indeed, even more curious is that it's all ready been stated that this DLC is to be the last for Arkham City, perhaps a "real" standalone piece could be on the horizon involving the Hush storyline (wishful thinking!),
 RockSteady are about to announce TWO AAA offerings at the upcoming E3 extravaganza so you never know. &nbsp;I'm in the complete opposite camp as you on this DLC though, I would've paid more for this in a heartbeat, I played 'Harley's Revenge' for most of the day
 yesterday and can't wait to get back to it today, I still have two more balloons to pop!...:-)

<p>I'm not disappointed. I didn't expect it to be too long from the start. I actually really enjoyed it, and it got me back into playing such a great game.</p>
<p>For improvement, I'd say the story could have been more, as I'm all for the storyline. Just being able to play as Robin in the story and beat up new thugs, that's about it. As I said before, didn't expect too much as I assumed this would be about what we
 would get out of the DLC.</p>

<p>[/quote]<br />
<br />
Lets take your points one by one shall we<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>To start with, Rock Steady were honest with fans right from the announcement of HQR, that you would not be able to free roam as Robin in any part of Arkham City, so it was never implied or sold on the fact you would be able to use Robin to free roam
</li><li>If you notice in the story, the GCPD had pretty much shut down Arkham city by removing the Thugs left behind following Arkham City's conclusion. So what you have is only a small amount of thugs left that joined Harley, so no you were never going to get
 huge combat battles until the final moments in the DLC for Robin and Batman, who each have a big fight for them at the end
</li><li>To be fair the predator elements were weak, especially as the Robin taking down Harley is a cheap copy of the Catwoman vs Two Face battle in her story part of her DLC. But it was unique to use Robin's skill set, unless you already have his DLC then its
 just a walk in the park </li><li>Why would new characters be introduced? The title of the DLC says it all, so what or who did you expect to show up in a story that was all about Harley?
</li><li>Well Harley is the main villain, whilst she is a true homicidal gymnastic nut job with a hated for all things batman, she is still a fairly physically limited character in battle so...yeah, was never going to be that threatening in direct combat and ultimately
 its not fighting her thats the challenge for you as the gamer </li><li>The Length is fine, if you dont spend time exploring to find all the balloons (4th playthrough and still only have 29/30! after finding 26 on first go) and just blast through the story elements then yes, just over an hour. But if you take the time to explore,
 especially as Batman in the flashback stage, then you will see all the subtle changes to the Industrial zone since the end of Arkham City. It was always advertised as just being over two hours of gameplay, which it is if you go for all the cheevo's and play
 the story out<br />
&nbsp; </li></ol>
<div>For me the DLC delivered everything I hoped it would. It told an amazing additional chapter in the Arkham City story, gave us a real insight into the emotional and mental state of Batman following the loss of Talia and death of Joker in the final moments
 of Arkham city, and we see the concern for him from those closed to him in Oracle, Gordon and even Robin, who tries to convince Gordon that everything is fine where clearly it isnt<br />
<br />
You also see a change in voice acting with Batman and Harley having a much darker tone in HQR, especially Batman who is far more aggressive in his interrogating then he was in the main story. It is very clear that something is wrong with him, and hes not sharing
 it with those close to him, which is never good for someone like Batman<br />
<br />
Well worth the money just for the cut scenes alone, it delivered everything Rock Steady said it would...job done, now I want to see how the story continues or concludes even more in the next game<br />

<p>I can't really come up with anything about this DLC that I wasn't impressed with, if I were to express "disappointment" with anything it would be that no new challenge maps were included, I would have loved a Combat Challenge involving knocking those robots
 around some more, or the "cheap copy of the Catwoman vs Two Face" environment would have made an excellent Predator map. &nbsp;Tara Strong further cemented her right to voice Harley Quinn after Arleen Sorkin's years of brilliant work, I especially liked the "You're
 Crazy! &nbsp;No, I'm in MOURNING and you might want to REMEMBER that!" bit which establishes right off the start that she's completely lost it this time around (was there ever any doubt!), the "monument" she built was so like Joker's work that I'm beginning to
 question whether or not he's actually dead! &nbsp;Harley Quinn is one of my all-time favourite characters from ANY story and this DLC did not "disappoint" whatsoever. &nbsp;The Catwoman DLC is one of the greatest DLCs ever and this one doesn't lag too far behind it,
 I give the Catwoman Pack the edge for it extended over to the the challenge arena, I'm still lookin' for my 30th balloon too Cokney Charmer, we're probably looking for the same one, I'll race ya...:-)</p>

<p>I can't believe you're even mentioning the Catwoman DLC along side of this. That was an excellent addition to the base game. This adds absolutely nothing to the Arkham series lore. Yes, any idiot could have guessed that Batman and Harley are taking the events
 after AC hard. They don't show it in any differentiated way besides through 3rd parties mentioning it. I don't care if some grunt says "I hope Harley doesn't kill us since she's all crazy now." Or &nbsp;how Gordon mentions Batman is acting weird lately. HOW?! Both
 characters were no more distraught than if they lost their favorite hat. BOTH OF THEIR LOVERS JUST DIED!! I wanted to see Batman almost reach the point of murder, only to be pulled back by his virtues, I wanted to see Harley torturing B-Man, or mindlessly
 killing her henchmen. SOMETHING!</p>
<p>Also, to the other guy. I'm not saying Rocksteady lied about anything, I'm saying they could have done many things very easily that could have made the DLC much better. I don't mind that Robyn didn't have free-roam, but can you honestly say that would have
 been hard for them to do? That alone would almost be worth price of admission. They were lazy and did a half assed piece of work.</p>
<p>Also, Arkham is all about the giant battles. If you're not going to have them, you need to rework your story.</p>
<p>Here's my final argument. Do you remember the Scarecrow segments in AA? Remember how awesome of a change that was to the main story. It almost didn't fit in, but it was perfect. Would you say that single segment of the game was more interesting than the
 entirety of HQR? THAT is the quality work that I wanted. Something new and refreshing. They obviously have the capability to do work like that. So why are we left with such a bland experience of 'fight 3 guys in this hallway, find X-item, fight 5 guys in this
 room, get to Y-checkpoint, play this sub-par quality predator room, get to Z-checkpoint.' The quality isn't there and that just can't be denied. This DLC was produced by a 3rd string team at best. I shouldn't have to pay for 3rd string quality content.</p>

<p>then you missed the point completely.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you missed the subtle details in this DLC, such as the change in tone of Batman's voice acting, the anger in the words, the more aggressive interrogation style, the concern of all the characters close to Batman because of the events at the end of Arkham
 City that have clearly affected Batman far more then we knew before, then HQR highlights this all too well</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I feel you are being far too harsh on it just because you didnt get it or expected more from it then Rock Steady claimed it would be....that is not Rock Steady's fault, they dont have to manage your expectations</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Its a shame you didnt enjoy it but, its clear from your ranting that you totally missed the point of this DLC and that is not the fault of Rock Steady</p>

<h2>            Flickering Start Menu  - Windows 10</h2>
                    After sometime I start to notice issues with my desktop, lately if I left click my start menu all of the icons are flickering and I am not able to select anything.&nbsp; This doesn't happen until the computer has been on for a while.&nbsp; I thought at first it
 may be my keyboard, but I unplugged it and even tried a different one.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp; I can restart and it goes back to normal...

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a problem with the start menu flickering earlier, but I fixed it by killing the
<em>Windows Shell Experience Host</em> in task manager. To do this, open up task manager (press
<strong>ctrl + shift + esc</strong>), then press "<em>more details"</em> (if you haven't done that before already).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After you have done this, press the <em>name</em> button to sort the processes alphabetically from
<em>z</em> to <em>a</em>, and then look for the task named <em>Windows Shell Experience Host
</em>(It should be near the top since you sorted the names from <em>z</em> to <em>
a</em>)&nbsp; Highlight that task by clicking on it once and then press "end task" on the bottom right corner of task manager (alternatively, you can press
<strong>alt + E</strong>). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you press the start menu again, it should recreate the task without flicker- if it does not open without flicker, you can respond to this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I am not clear in any way please let me know, for I enjoy helping others with computer problems. If I helped you, it would also be nice to let me know- I'm just here to help!<br />

</p><p>Thank you! The first method seems to fixed the problem for me! But weird thing is after I restarted my laptop, the battery icon shown in the taskbar was gone, but then I managed to fix it by disable and enable again the "Microsoft AC Adapter" and "Microsoft
 ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery" in Device Manager (Batteries)</p>

<p>This is absolutely not the problem. I have contacted Microsoft directly numerous times about this issue myself personally. The great support agents are on the right track to finding and fixing many of the issues but this one seems to be all together illusive
 for Microsoft support to be able to handle. I think that the problem primarily exists because of the secret narrative that is being pushed to try to prevent hackers once and for all. Thank you for doing this, it is about time that Microsoft take the approach
 of Proactive instead of the Reactive mr fix it from yesteryear. You and I both know that freelancing is the culprit.
<br />
<br />
As a re: to solve your problem, try getting a straight forward answer from a Microsoft representative instead of the typical&gt;&gt;
<strong>THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER&gt;</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong><strong>Run Hardware and Device Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Type in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the search box, then click it.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Hardware and Devices</strong></li><li>Follow the wizard steps to run the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshooter.</strong></li></ol>

<p>&nbsp; &gt;&gt; THE ANSWER IS FOR EVERYONE TO CONTACT MICROSOFT AND DEMAND THAT THEY PERMANENTLY END VIRUSES AND HACKING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well you know there will be that one guy that responds to this and says "Duh, you can't prevent viruses and hacking." Well to that guy I say, do you prevent me from going into your home and stealing your cookies? Ohm Nom Nom. I eat cookies.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brand new XPS 13 from Dell with Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I went through the initial Welcome steps to enter my Microsoft account and everything worked fine.&nbsp; It then rebooted me to an actual Windows login screen and now I can't login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put in my email and password and just get an error saying: We are unable to connect right now.&nbsp; Please check your network and try again later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am connected to my network just fine as it let me do the initial setup steps without any issues.&nbsp; Now I'm stuck at a login screen and can't do anything.&nbsp; The login screen says Other User and asks for my Work or school account which is what I'm entering.&nbsp;
 What do I do?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Lost over 17,000 Gamerscore. Please help fix</h2>
                    <p><u>I have been directed here from Xbox support, and was told a programmer would be able to fix my problem. My file number is 1390098015. I have a lot of information to provide, so sorry about this.</u></p>











<p>My name is Patrick. I'm a 29 year old disabled veteran and full-time student. My gamerscore is randomly 17,000 points less than what it was. I grinded very hard to get my gamerscore over 100,000. Now, for no reason, it is 88,645. Yesterday, I clicked on my achievement page on the xbox one, and every game said 0/0. I restarted my console, and then the achievements were all there, as they should be, but the total gamerscore still says only 88,000. I took a calculator and literally tallied up every achievement I have, checked my math twice (as well as photographing my math) and got a total of 105,768 (17,000 points higher than what it says now).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I contacted xbox technical support, who have never heard of this happening, and said&nbsp;they will call back tomorrow. They didn't. When I called back today, a man told me that the xbox enforcement team had to have done this, and that they must have evidence that I am a cheater. His manager, Ceaser, told me that the xbox enforcement team does

<p>And here is a picture of my gamerscore today...</p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRW9jwA.img" /></figure><p><br /></p><p>The only advice I've gotten is to wait and see, but I saw on the forums that someone had this exact problem a few years back and was never resolved, and they had waited 12 days before posting. Please help.</p>

                    <p>Original title: Not getting wireless connection</p>
<p>Yo Kevin Hau, It looks to me as if you know what you're talking about. My son's laptop has been up&nbsp; graded from XP - to windows 7 - now he cant connect to his local network. At the up-graders workshop the various wireless connections show up OK - at home
 there is a red line through them. No wireless connection. The up-grader says its not his problem - it works at his workshop he cant explain why it doesn't work at my sons home and cant help. - Could you please assist him in this problem? Thank you - we will
 be grateful. Frans.&nbsp; <br />

<p>Have the same problem.</p>
<p>Method 1, the external hdd works fine on another computer (non windows 10) &amp; other external hdds work fine on this Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p>Method 2, troubleshooter recognized this as a driver problem but failed to update &amp; solve the problem. I think this is probably due to unavailability of a newer driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The external hdd is Seagate Expansion 2TB (SRD0NF1). In devices &amp; printers, it is recognized as "Unspecified".</p>
<p>Please update ASAP.</p>

            I am having the same issue. I've tried all of the steps listed but the problem still exists. The trouble shooting tells me there is a drive issue but when it tried to reinstall the driver it does not fix the problem. I don't want to buy a new external
 HD and all of my data is on this one. Is there something else I can try or can I go back to Windows 8?<br />

    <title>Wrong type and number of RAM slots in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mihaibd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong type and number of RAM slots in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS X550LDV Notebook which has 8GB SODIMM DDR3 RAM. The notebook has 4GB on the motherboard and I added another 4GB in the empty slot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem that I noticed recently...don't know if it was there before:</p>
<p>In Task Manager and in other apps (e. g. Speccy) it is reported that my laptop has 4 DIMM Slots of which 2 are filled but that is obviously not true...how can I fix this?</p>
<p>All my drivers are up to date (or so says the Windows Update service). On the ASUS website there are no drivers available for Windows 10...since they all got automatically installed when the first update was performed.</p>

            The total count in task manager says 4 slots and it also says DIMM...the second photo shows the real 2 slots (not 4) &nbsp;with SODIMM (not DIMM) so the software is wrong, but why?&nbsp;
