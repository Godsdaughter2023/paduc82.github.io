<h2>            PowerPoint won&#39;t open on Mac</h2>
                    Every time I try to open PowerPoint the application opens and then immediately crashes before even reaching the home screen. I'm also not getting any error messages, the app just pops up and then disappears when I try opening. I've tried uninstalling and
 reinstalling and I've checked for updates for Office and with my Mac.

            <p><span>Hi Ychen_701,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To investigate this issue, I’d like to confirm the following things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>It seems that you cannot launch PowerPoint via clicking the application. If you double click a ppt file, can PowerPoint start properly?</span></li><li><span>Do other Office applications have the same issue?</span></li><li><span>Open PowerPoint&gt;click PowerPoint on the top menu bar&gt;About PowerPoint&gt;capture a screenshot of the pop-up. Meanwhile, what is the version of your operating system.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Access safe mode</a>, check if the issue persists.
</span></li><li><span>Do you install some add-ins with PowerPoint?</span></li></ol>

            <p>I'm having the same issue. I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Below are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Double clicking a ppt file does not launch PowerPoint either. Same thing happens: starts to open, "Get Started" window pops up for half a second before disappearing and crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. No, the other Office apps work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I can't open PowerPoint</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I haven't done this yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. No, I don't install anything else. with PowerPoint.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Constantly asking for password</h2>
                    Outlook 2016 started asking me for my password yesterday (Sunday) and nothing I try gets me access to emails. I can log in to Outlook.com so password is correct. I tried creating another profile but it cannot get past checking my account and password.
 Just tells me my Log into Exchange ActiveSync mail server is incorrect. Assistance would be much appreciated.

            <p>I have the same issue, my account has already been migrated to "Outlook Exchange" (showing Outlook Mail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already created MULTIPLE new profiles, removed credentials, and a bunch of other items.&nbsp; No luck with any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Outlook 2016/Office 2016, Windows 10 Pro, and connecting to an Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the weird thing.&nbsp; It fixes itself if I create a new profile.&nbsp; Let me be clear, JUST creating the new profile fixes the issue.&nbsp; I don't even have to use the new mail profile.&nbsp; Just creating is allows it to work for my entire session UNTIL I reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like a definite bug.&nbsp; Or some kind of strange security setting in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; Also to be clear, I'm running Office 2016, NOT Office365.

            <p>My problems appear to have been solved by creating a new profile. My missing 80 emails have also re-appeared. The migration swapped my domain name and my outlook alias so creating the profile with my outlook.com address seems to have solved my problems.</p>

<h2>            Content Farms - Setting to exclude them from IE search results</h2>
                    <p>Where in Internet Explorer is there a setting to exclude "content farms" from search results?&nbsp; Do they have a setting at all?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By content farms, I mean all those websites that come up in search results, seemingly having some true information, but they actually have NOTHING relevant, and have merely done some sort of programming to pick up on your search terms, and make it look like
 they are relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome has an extension where these can ALL&nbsp;be turned off with just the one setting, rather than having to manually input each and every website address that you want blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've been trying to&nbsp;register my 5800XM (latest firmware) with CWM Australia for days now, but I just can't get it to work. I've tried both the house WLAN (which the phone is correctly set up for - no problems web browsing/VoIP/podcasts/etc) and 3G as the
 net connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run the "Nokia Musi Store" app on the phone, and&nbsp; get a browser-like screen where I select my country (Australia). It then does one of two things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) most of the time, it does nothing for several seconds and then pops up "Music Store: Unable to perform operation"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) much less frequently, it instead goes to a screen where I can enter information including the CWM PIN. If I then press "Join", it rejects anything I got wrong (eg. non matching password fields) and I have to do it again. If I didn't get anything wrong,
 though, it just does nothing for a few seconds (the 'Join' button is inaccessable during this), then the Join button comes back, but absolutely nothing else changes - no error message, no new screen, no UI changes at all in fact - it just looks like I never
 pressed "Join".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because of this, I'm not going to be able to register within the 2 month limit (phone was a present, so sat with someone else for a while) despite starting well in time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just not acceptable.&nbsp;And I won't even go into all the other problems I've had with both Nokia device and PC software in the last months. Suffice to say I'm a software developer, and I'd be embarrased if it were me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know a Nokia number in Australia where I can get someone to sort this out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I called the care number on Sunday, issue ended up being raised to next level support who would "call me back between 24-48 hours". Needless to say they didn't. So I tried to call them back at 5.45pm local time today but, after going through the menus, they
 were "not available" (the Nokia site with the number says they're open to 8pm local time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile I've tried registering on a PC instead, at the suggestion of Sunday night's support person. I hadn't done this because I didn't want to be locked to a PC that I wasn't going to use (my usual laptop wasn't with me at the time), but they said
 they could unlock that manually so I didn't have to wait 3 months before being able to use my laptop. That would have been useful to know up front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that didn't work either.I've installed the latest Ovi Player, connected the phone in media transfer mode and tried several ways of getting the CWM registration process started:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Comes With Music button on main store screen -&gt; Join Now button (interestingly the "Comes With Music button did nothing the first few tries, but then worked)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) "Sign In" button on main store screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) "Join Now" button on main store screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of them does anything except spin the circular "progress bar" on the status bar for a couple of seconds. Absolutely nothing else. No error/status messages, no hint that anything changed, nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried removing and reinstalling the software, and starting it from the command line with "oviplayer://musicplayer/?setTerritory=en-AU" per the thread here. No difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone does show up in the "My Music" part of Ovi Player, and works "fine" (relatively speaking) under Ovi Suite, so there can't be much wrong with the setup. The internet access is via physical LAN to a NAT router, on which I disabled the firewall just
 in case, and everything else works fine with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've probably spent something like 10 hours over 2 weeks messing with this now. I get the feeling that's more than Nokia's testers did.</p>

<p>(I'm keeping a log of the events here, as I suspect it will be needed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still no call back by Wednesday Feb 24th so tried calling them again (1300 366 733 #4 #2).<br />
<br />
Got through the menu system, the "we are very busy - consider calling back later" warning, and the lengthy queue wait to a man who was impossible to understand (partly because of the extremely **bleep** call quality).<br />
<br />
I explained I called three days ago and hadn't received the promised "24-48hr" follow up call. He asked for the case reference number,&nbsp; which of course I was neither given nor knew about. No problem, he found it from my return phone number. He went off to check,
 put me on hold, and I'm cut off. I waited 15 mins for a callback (he knew my number after all) but nothing.<br />
<br />
So I called again. After another "we are very busy - consider calling back later" warning, and a lengthy queue wait I got a woman, who was a bit easier to understand. She looked me up from my phone number and found the problem report.<br />
<br />
After putting me on hold for a few minutes, she very unsurely informed me that Comes With Music in Australia was "having a system update" and "not working at the moment".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't believe that. I'd been having the same problems with the same behaviour, whether trying to register on the device or PC, for several weeks. Nothing ever seemed any different. I had once got a message about CWM/Ovi Music not being online when running
 Ovi Player, but not recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore I had, at one point last Sunday, tried another "clean" PC and phone just to see what happened. That is, I installed Ovi Music, connected up another 5800XM (a UK one, that time) and tried to register. That time it did actually do something, for
 once, returning with an error message that the connected phone wasn't a CWM device (true). But as soon as I went back to my own PC/phone, it behaved exactly the same again. Even after a complete reinstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I asked how long it had been offline for, but she "didn't have access to that information". I asked how long it was going to be offline for, she ddidn't have access to that information either. I asked if she could confirm it had been offline since the
 previous Sunday, same answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave my reasons why it didn't seem a likely explaination to me, but was told she couldn't help and I should continue to wait for the "12 to 24 hour" elevated support return call, however long it took. I expressed doubt I'd get one at all, and reiterated
 my concern about the 2 month CWM registration limit, and got a vague (and hardly confidence inspiring) "oh that'll be alright".</p>
<p><br />
So I will continue to wait. I might do some googling to see if this problem is related to the 40.0.005 firmware version, which both phones were upgraded to as I've found that that creates all sorts of other problems.</p>

<p>Short form:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2019 is a snapshot of Office 365 / 2016 taken about a year ago. It includes most, but not all "new" features added to Office 2016 by Office 365 to that point.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2019 does NOT get any of the "new features" being added to Office 365. </p>
<p>

</span></p>
<p>Microsoft Office 2019 builds on the success of Office 2016 by adding some great new features. Microsoft has listened to user feedback and made changes and improvements that help people get their work done faster and with fewer steps. In fact, there are so
 many new features to talk about in Office that telling you all about them is going to require several articles! This first article in the series discusses features and functionality that is common across multiple applications. In later articles, you’ll find
 out what’s new in each individual application.</p>
<div>
<span>Office 2019 vs. Office 365</span>
<p>Office 2019 is what they call a “box product” (even if you download it), or a retail product. You buy it once, and then it’s yours for life (or as long as you want it). Through automatic downloads, you will receive security and maintenance updates for Office
 2019 but not updates that contain new functionality. In contrast, Office 365 is a subscription-based product that is continually being updated by Microsoft automatically and in the background.</p>
<p>Office 2019 was officially released in September 2018, but its feature set was frozen back in April 2018 when the Commercial Preview was released. As of April 2018, Office 2019 and Office 365 had identical features, but since then, Microsoft has continued
 to roll out new features to Office 365, whereas Office 2019 has stayed the same. That’s why there are minor differences between them.</p>

    <title>MapMyFitness issues and suggestion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geauxmook  say:</h3>
<h2>            MapMyFitness issues and suggestion</h2>
                    <p>I have a couple of issues I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing and also a couple of suggestions for improvement between the Band and MapMyFitness.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues:</p>
<p>1. On a couple of occasions, workouts that I tracked using my Band have not synced with my MapMyFitness account. This is extremely frustrating and both times there was there was nothing different than when it tracks/syncs with no issues. I've tried resets,
 log outs, etc... but I end up having to enter the information manually into MapMyFitness which really defeats the purpose of linking the apps.</p>
<p>2. Band and Health app syncing never works on the first couple of tries. I have an iphone 5 with iOS 8.3 and every time I open the Health app it tries to sync with the Band but never does. Usually, I have to close and open the app a couple of times for it
 to finally sync. This is really frustrating and probably my biggest gripe with the Band.</p>
<p>3. For Microsoft Band 2.0, please reconsider the shape of the Band to be a little more form fitting or flexible. For me, it can be uncomfortable/bothersome to wear at times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions for Band &amp; MapMyFitness improvements.</p>
<p>1. Please sync steps with MapMyFitness. I can't believe that this most basic fitness/health measure is not synced.</p>
<p>2. Add more types of exercises like the MapMyFitness offers or reach an agreement with MMF to sync exercises to the Band.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Share generic map information with MMF. It doesn't need to be interactive, a simple image would suffice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make these suggestions because the Band does not offer the fitness community forums/challenges that MMF/UA Record apps have established. &nbsp;I enjoy using MMF/UA Record for the social aspect and the Health app for a more detailed view of my fitness/health.
 I understand syncing of all information is not going to happen but these few improvements would make both apps much more effective and useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, I am thoroughly enjoying the Band and all of its capabilities. I hope to see continued improvements between the connected apps that make the user experience even better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I too am experiencing a problem getting my Band to synch with MapMyFitness.&nbsp; It worked the very first time I setup up synchronization to MapMyFitness but any cycling workouts afterwards have not synchronized.&nbsp; I agree, this is VERY frustrating!&nbsp; Overall
 I think the band is great, but one of the main reasons I purchased it was the integration between the Band and MapMyFitness which seems to be broken.&nbsp; I have tried disconnecting the app and even revoking access on the MapMyFitness side and then setting it
 back up again to no avail.&nbsp; What could be wrong?

            <p>Anyone know if MapMyFitness will synch its data to Health Vault App or is it supposed to only go one way? For example if I was to use MapMyFitness to track my runs/rides then it synching to the HealthVault App on my phone?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the issues you folks are having on the synching, this really sucks. I too was hoping for this to work flawlessly. I just don't know if this issue will make me go back to Jawbone (UP3).

            Jagster, as far as I can tell it is only one way. The times I have tracked workouts using MapMyFitness it has never synced with the Band, but that could be because of the issues I'm experiencing with syncing between the two apps anyway.&nbsp;

<p>I chatted with Microsoft Support this yesterday after coming back from my run because the band did not synch with mapmyfitness. They basically just had me disconnect/reconnect the app but still was not working. At least one of your rides synched, which is
 validation that it does at least work but not consistently. At the same time I opened a ticket with mapmyfitness to see if they have any suggestions. For all we know it could be an issue on their end to. Hopefully they get back to me today.

            <p>Interesting I too am having the same issues. I have had the band a week and this has been syncing fine with both runKeeper and MapMyFitness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The syncing to BOTH applications stopped yesterday (26th April) and isnt syncing either sleep or run data as before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spoken to Microsoft support who have no idea and basically told me (which I did)to perform a soft reset, followed by me doing a full rest and re-installing all the apps. The only suggestion they have now is to replace the device. Which I am unsure
 will resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few things which happened on the 26th which maybe the cause of the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My Microsoft Health App updated to the latest version (version 1.3.10421.1) - This is what I think is the issue</p>
<p>- There was reference on-line to the portal being updated on the 27th (US time), it could be that the data being pushed from the portal does not match what is being accepted by MMF and causing an issue which we cannot see the error for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- A recieved an email from MapMyFitness with the subject "Introducing our new activity feed", again the format may not match between companies and something is being rejected somewhere</p>
<p>- I upgraded from MapMyFitness Standard to MapMyFitness+ (which I believe is separate app but without the adverts), this could be an account issue my side which I have duplicated</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone else has had any of the above happen at the same time which may give a clue where the issue lies? It is a bit strange that runKeeper is also not working now in the same time period. One thing I did notice too was on the 25th the
 time it took for the data to sync was very slow (1 hours) compared to the almost instant results before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have a good point regarding the updates. So Sunday, I went for a run and the data didn't synch to MMF so I manually entered the data. So this morning I just thought I'd check MMF to see if the data from the band posed and low and behold, there it was.
 Maybe you were right, there was just a glitch between the updates. As I stated above, I opened a ticket with MMF to see if they know anything. Other than that, it appears it is working just lagging. I'm going to go on a bike ride this evening and see if the

    <title>Lumia 521 no service with Singaporean carrier - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sailorceres---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 521 no service with Singaporean carrier</h2>
                    
<p>I have an unlocked Lumia 521 from America. I bought a micro SIM card from Singtel but I can't receive any cellular service. I checked the card on another phone and it works fine with the other phone. I don't know why this is happening since the Lumia 521
 is compatible with Sngapore's GSM frequencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since I've haven't received any indication that the phone is locked, how would I actually unlock it if I were to get a code? The only instructions I've seen from T-mobile (American carrier) indicate that an unlock prompt will appear when a non-authorized

<p>You are right, if it was locked you should be prompted for the restriction code as soon as you switch on the phone with a different SIM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've tested the SIM in a different phone, but have you tried another SIM in the phone? If whoever had the phone before in the US used an older Mini-SIM that had been cut to Micro-SIM size, it could have caused damage to the contacts in the phone because
 older Mini-SIMs are slightly thicker. As long as the SIM card that did the damage was still inside, this can go unnoticed - it's often only when another SIM is inserted that such damage manifests itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hoping that this is not your situation, though if no proper Micro-SIMs work in your phone I can't think of another cause.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem in Outlook in Win 8.1 &amp; Win 7 and it has been going on for years. None of the above formulaic suggestions make any difference. You guys are just writing from a script. The only way to get rid of the changing font, which won't change
 back, is to go to Text format, which loses all the formatting and any graphics. It gets worse. Sometime the delete key starts a new paragraph, instead of deleting a line. Again, only reverting to the Text option can get around this. The bugs in Composing a
 new message in Outlook.com mail system are unbelievable. We would all like to know when they will be fixed.<br />

            I seriously doubt that this chronic formatting issue relates to private info re email addresses and passwords, so I don't know why you sent the other user a private message. Clearly you do not have a clue. This Outlook formatting problem is huge, as is
 the additional problem that it always leaves large spaces in the recipient's copy, and/or in Outlook.com text that is copied and pasted. This problem is in other threads.&nbsp; Please consider referring these Outlook.com formatting glitches to a higher-up MS engineer.
 I and the above user have given you ample info.<br />

I have determined this happens when I right click to accept a spell check correction after I have completed my email. &nbsp;whatever word I update default the font back to Calibri 10 even though my preference and the rest of my email Arial 12. &nbsp;In the middle of
 the email it is hard to see the variance, but once sent it is embarrassingly obvious. &nbsp;

            <p>I've had this problem with Hotmail for years, on a desktop that I no longer have, and a 2013 laptop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My default font is Times New Roman, but most of the time, when I reply to an email, my font spits out Calibri, always Calibri.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I have to change it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if I paste in text from somewhere else, it'll paste as Calibri, not TNR. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In an email that I'm responding to, and getting TNR, when I start a new paragraph -
<em>poof</em> - it switches to Calibri!&nbsp; Happens <em>all</em> the time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So every time it's Calibri I have to highlight what I wrote, go up to the fonts and change it to TNR. &nbsp; But I shouldn't have to! &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your default is TNR, then you should get TNR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or is that asking too much?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens in I.E. and Firefox (I had to switch from I.E. to Firefox because after updating from Windows 8 to 8.1 I kept getting script errors.&nbsp; Way to go, Microsoft!).&nbsp;

                    Hello, I have three keyboards installed on my Lumia 640 but can't download the dictionaries except for the first keyboard that is also the system language. In the keyboard settings pane I see a "need attention" message under the keyboards and a "couldn't
 download this dictionary, retry or ignore". If I try again I get the same message. Any idea? Thank you.

            <p>Hi, I'm on 10.0.14393.693, the problem began after an hard reset, I already tried using the Device Recovery Tool with no luck (but it solved other problems like tiles won't updating, screen not dimming before locking and other things).</p>
<p>The OS is in Italian, region Italy. I installed Croatian and US keyboards but for both can't install the dictionaries for auto correction: OS says "preparing download" and then something like "need your intervention".</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Whitelisted email going to junk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Whitelisted email going to junk</h2>
                    Until this month, I've never had serious issues with Outlook.com. But this entire month I've been finding tons and tons of Safe Sender emails going to my junk. They were added to Safe Senders years ago. I'm talking Paypal, Ebay, etc. I do a lot of online
 shopping and bill paying, so it's important I keep these in my inbox. These email addresses had shown up no problem for years. Years. Given the amount of junk I get in the Junk Folder, this is very inconvenient. It looks to me like something in Outlook's development
 was messed with this month. How long will this be going on for? Please don't give me a canned response. There's nothing wrong with my settings since I never once changed them for this to happen. I've double-checked my Safe Sender's and Blocked Sender's list.
 I now have to check my Junk Folder once a day to make sure I get everything.

            My issue does not regard migrating. Yes, the wildcard @domain.com was done. That's a basic action I would think anyone would do first.

Then again not. From the link Arvinda provided, SKU111.CAB is the installer file for Office 2003 Pro. I don't know of a download for that one.

    <title>Delete data from subform - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayhyde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete data from subform</h2>
                    <p>I have a form which has a subfrom displayed as adatasheet, and it is bound to a table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The datasheet is populated based on calculations from fileds on the form, which mar result in 1 to fifty or more records. That part works fine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Iam dealing with the situation in which a user changes a filed on the form. Since this may result in a different number of subrecords, I need to first delete the existing records and recreate them. I have a field on the form which (theoretically) will
 tell me the number of records on the subform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I set NumRecs equal to that number and then</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set rstSpread = dbsTemplate.OpenRecordset( _<br />
"SELECT (some fields)] " &amp; _<br />
"FROM [Resource Date Spread]" &amp; _<br />
"WHERE (([Resource Date Spread].[Resource Data ID]) = " &amp; ResDataID &amp; ")")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For R = 1 To NumRecs<br />
rstSpread.FindFirst "[Duration ID] =" &amp; R<br />
rstSpread.Delete<br />
Next R</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which works, but I would rather count the number of records returned and use that for Numrecs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless there is an easier way to delete the records surrently showing on the subform, before I repopulate them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>???</p>

            <p>If you are deleting records, you would run a DELETE QUERY to delete the records (not understanding why you need to delete the existing records and then recreate them as it sounds a little like you don't quite have a well-designed structure) and then an append
 query and then requery the form.&nbsp; No recordset iteration should be necessary but the big question is how is the subform related to the parent form and how are they linked (master/child fields) or are they even linked?</p>

    <title>Office Standard 2016 Activation not showing correctly in volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaredyb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Standard 2016 Activation not showing correctly in volume licensing</h2>
                    <p>I would first like to say how helpful this company is they are the greatest. You know calling the number given from a chat session with the Microsoft Licensing Center gets you nothing but a confirm that the key is good. So they send to tech support 10 attempts
 later I finally make it throw to have someone answer and not hang up on me and I hear what a day to see if the problem goes away. Next day I call again and I go through the same fight of 10 calls and hear from tech support to reinstall do that, now I am super
 mad. Problem still exist, end user is not happy with new computer because of this, and I got crappy service. I researched the **** out of the issue and now I am stuck researching and asking for help for the community. So here is the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brand new computer no office installed (checked under uninstall programs), installed from Microsoft Volume Licensing Center the English ISO for my 64bit Windows 7 device. At one point it asked for the key I gave the MKS key, everything was pleasant then
 the install finished and I see Buy/Try/Activate the program whenever i open the software. The MVLC shows 1/50 seats are used, Microsoft says good code, Microsoft Office 2016 says active under the account info. Can someone tell me how i might be able to remove
 this annoying pop up?</p>

            My issue is with Office 2016 not 2010. Please provide help on this issue as I am not the only person with this question needing an answer. Also after all the issues I been through with your support staff why would you tell someone to go here, to just be
 told to post somewhere else. Since i am on the subject of posting why would you have a community center and then tell them on every post to go to this other posting site instead.

            <p>The outsourced "paid" MS Staff manning phone/chat support are not well regarded here (I'm being polite!).&nbsp; They are adequate for trivial problems, but for problems like yours they are useless. All too often they refer people who have called them to us, where
 most of the replies are provided by unpaid volunteers (yes, Praveen is an exception, an apparently paid MS Support person).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to add to the run-a-round, but Praveen is right. Technet is a better place for your question, more technically advanced users, more likely to be familiar with volume licensing are likely to be found there than here. This forum is primarily for consumer
 licensing and application support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As well as technet, you may want to consider posting to the business version of this forum. Again, you are more likely to encounter people familiar with volume licenses there than here.

<h2>            Why does my Nokia Lumia 635 phone keep doing this to Facebook page on IE so often&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Has anybody ever seen Facebook do this on their 'feature phone'? I've only ever seen it happen when I'm on Facebook via Internet Explorer at their m site for mobiles.</p>

<p><span>Why does my Nokia Lumia 635 phone keep doing this to Facebook page on IE so often?<br />
It happens about 1/4 of the time when I refresh the page or I come back from another tab. I've learned that the workaround is to just refresh the page again or click the back arrow or to hit ANY link at the top of Facebook's display and then it will load it
 to display properly.<br />
I've got to say that nobody should suspect any APPs since I only have a few silly ones like Hill Climb and Pin It.<br />
Also, FYI, I don't browse **** or like ANY sites including YouTube except I do sometimes watch a YouTube video that someone posted on Facebook.<br />
I'm an admitted Facebookaholic, not that that matters except for the fact that obviously this deal happens to me many times everyday.<br />
And also, I should say that I use m.facebook.com with Internet Explorer and not the Facebook APP since it lacks a few handy features that even the mobile Facebook site offers us.</span></p>

            <p>I was told that these Nokia Lumia 635 phones are well known to be lacking adequate RAM. It only has 1/2 of what should be the minimum RAM and nothing is sold anymore with this little RAM.</p>
<p>I was told this over at my <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdapps/why-does-facebook-on-nokia-lumia-635s-internet/ac8e8be1-c6a0-443e-9225-b9bacc131af5">

            <p>I guess it all doesn't matter to me anymore. &nbsp;I got an early Christmas present at T-Mobile today, a SAMSUNG Galaxy J7. They put my SIM card in and all of my Photos are now on my new phone. I've just now got to learn to use this Android thing. I've been a
 longtime fan of Windows phones since I could ActiveSync my Outlook stuff since way back in the Outlook 2003 days when you bought ActiveSync on a disc and had to plug in or Bluetooth it to sync everything. I had 5 Motorola MPx-220 Windows flip phones before
 my 2 Nokia Lumia 635s.</p>
<p>It's a sad day but life goes on.</p>

            Not that anyone asked but&nbsp;I took that Android J7 thing back to T-Mobile today and returned it and I had them slide the SIM card back into my trusty Nokia Lumia 635 Windows 8 phone that I luckily still have since I own it.<br />
I'm on cloud 9. <br />
If I feel the need to get something new, I'll buy an unlocked Nokia Lumia 1020 Windows phone from a seller on Amazon for $110-$225 and not one of the overpriced ones.<br />
But for now I'm happy as a pig to have this one back. I'll never complain about it again.
