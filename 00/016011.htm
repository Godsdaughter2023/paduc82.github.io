            <p>What David Wolters says about vis a vie W7/W10 pretty much sums it up for me too. As already mentioned the business is moving away from Windows completely- that in itself is no big deal. The majority of our work is done on UNIX based systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my personal computers. I still have 2 x W7 ult. systems, 1 x build 10240, 1x 10547 TP, 2x OSX (snow leopard and Yosemite), various Linux, bare metal and VM. One of my previous W10 test beds I reformatted over the weekend and have started a new ARCH
 build on that. - I get bored very quickly with one OS so I'm constantly changing bits of the network. Kinda my hobby these days.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>To reiterate what I've said before, and kick off this thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a test virtual machine I've managed to customize Windows 10's GUI to where it looks very nice, remove all Apps,&nbsp;quiet it down so that it doesn't send my private data hither and yon and, and verify I can run all my desktop applications, yet&nbsp;<strong>STILL
 I have no interest in "up"grading</strong> from Windows 8.1.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because we just don't know where Microsoft is going with it, and their general direction hasn't
<em>at all </em>been in the direction I need them to go since around the&nbsp;time of Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me the "continuous updates" model is going to backfire, as people need to be able to plan for the future more than 4 months out.</p>

            <p>Well, I've been testing Windows 10 since the start. I didn't like it at all and vowed not to upgrade from 8.1.</p>
<p>Today, all my PC's and 1 old notebook are upgraded to 10. Once of my notebooks is too old, even for 8, the other is waiting for Windows 10 drivers (which Sony said they would provide next month)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like 10, but then I liked all version, with the exception of Windows ME and Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I would think like some of the readers, I would still be on Windows for Workgroups 3.11, which was great for me, as I installed the first network that saved me swapping disks from one PC to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running so many different programs, without crashes, or any other symptoms, playing games, much better than in 7 or 8.1&nbsp;</p>

            I've been using Windows 10 as my primary OS in a multi-boot configuration since the start of the Insiders Program. I'm more than ready to get it off my main system and go back to something that actually works better as my primary. I'm finding that I'm
 tolerating Windows 10, but don't actually enjoy using it. The experience just seems to worsen with each new build. The dash of new eye-candy brought in with each new build in exchange for some sub-system that has been rewritten to fit the metro motif is just
 not holding my interest anymore.

            <p>I'm tired of the spying, don't want any part of the ads, have no use for a store and "apps" from a store. I want more options for configuring my OS to look the way I want it to look, not the way it would look best on a phone. So no, I won't be downgrading
 anything to Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been a fan of MS since the mid-80s. I've worked professionally as a MS Systems Engineer since the 90s. It's time to expand my horizons. I'm going to learn something new. In fact, I just purchased a new laptop with Suse Linux Enterprise Desktop. I've
 been testing openSuse in a VM since about the end of June, when I decided MS wasn't going to improve on Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If 10 had been an improvement on 7, it would be a different story. Very few options. Too much spying (telemetry). An advertising platform built into the OS. Trying to force everyone to the Store. Trying to force everyone to the "cloud". Forced updates. Peer-to-Peer
 updates. WiFi network connection sharing. These are all reasons that no one should want to downgrade to 10, and are just a few of the reasons I won't be downgrading to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No computer with Windows 10 will ever be allowed to connect to my home network. Never ever. Since I won't have a Windows 10 PC, I don't want to give out my password to someone that may share my WiFi network with their contacts/Facebook friends. I've already
 informed all of my relatives that if they downgrade to Windows 10, their computers will not be allowed on my network, and I may just forbid them from entering my house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because my job requires staying up-to-date with the latest technologies, I'll run it every so often in a VM, but never on my production PC.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Like you I haven't any insoluble problems with Win 10 (save for the future uncertainty issue), but
<strong>I don't agree that it's better than 7 or 8.1 in any substantial way</strong>.&nbsp; If that's your experience I'd&nbsp;be interested to hear what you feel is better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many folks report improved experience with the new system that&nbsp;would likely be the case with a fresh, new installation of an older OS as well.&nbsp; Very few people know how to keep a Windows system running as efficiently as when it's first installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I was able to measure that Win 10 did better than&nbsp;an older system&nbsp;is that on an Intel GPU-equipped system the image rendering benchmark and several of the DirectX benchmarks of the PassMark PerformanceTest benchmarks ran a&nbsp;little faster on
 10 than 7.&nbsp; But other parts didn't run as well, so it felt like a net loss to me...</p>

<p>
</p><p>My experience has been that through <em>significant </em>non-standard tweaking (e.g., uninstalling things like Cortana that aren't supposed to be uninstallable) I've been able to get Windows 10's memory footprint (while doing nothing) to be about the same
 as Win 8.1's, which in turn is just a little larger than that of Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, since Win 10 privacy has had so much attention, I have it even less likely than Win 8.1 to try communication online on its own.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>THANK YOU! &nbsp;Especially for the bravery to say so, if nothing else!</span></p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then again, I still need to be able to download W10 for testing my applications on. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the MSDN download server 'download.msdn.microsoft.com' TIMES OUT after 4 hours and 51 minutes, closing the connection. &nbsp;I've got a priority ticket open for
 fixing this, and it's been A MONTH AND A HALF or so. &nbsp;I'm starting to wonder if I'll have to bite the bullet and renew "pending the fix" only to be disappointed later with some kind of vogon bureacracy "we only support connections above XX Mbits" or some other
 such "we don't want to fix this" reply. &nbsp;That, of course, would RUIN my MSDN subscription, making it TOTALLY impractical for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, it's topic-relevant in that I couldn't even migrate my VMs to W10 if I *WANTED* to because I can't download the RTM, and my 10074 build won't upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[FYI - the msdn download server has a security context that times out in around 10 hours, which means you need a 3Mbit or better connection to download the 4Gb file, and a lucky enough downloader that can resume at the 4 hour 51 minute point - the 'help
 desk' people have all of this info, including screen shots of wireshark captures, etc.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to tie it all back, if Microsoft can't even get the MSDN downloader to work properly, how can they POSSIBLY get an OPERATING SYSTEM right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>so /me NOT migrating to W10. &nbsp;Only for testing my stuff. &nbsp;When MSDN fixes the download server [or re-enables the 'download manager', which worked].</p>

</p><p><span>same here, when the msdn download server has been fixed well enough.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>thinking of that I came up with a 'hack' method that *might* work with MSDN's download server, if I use 'curl' to attempt to download parts of files, by specifying the range directly, then re-assembling them on my end. &nbsp;It would mean getting a new
 URL ever few hours, using a wireshark capture. &nbsp;it's a total HACK, yeah, but I might be able to assemble an ISO image THIS way for W10 RTM.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>otherwise the 4:51 server timeouts (closes connection from server end) and 10 hour security context expires prevent me from downloading ISO images greater than about 700Mb (or maybe 1.5Gb if I'm lucky enough to get a retry via wget or something).</p>

</p><p><span>you can always get some old laptops and install Mint Linux (with Mate or Cinnamon) on them, then say "here, use this".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So yeah, W10 definitely was the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back for ya, from what I read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[I began using FreeBSD and Linux back in the early noughties, when I found out that OSX was based on the Mach UNIX kernel, so there were now 2 main operating systems, Windows and *NIX, and I should become an expert at both, and I prefer BSD and Linux now]</p>

    <title>Microsoft&#39;s Commitment to Windows Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kurtis01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft&#39;s Commitment to Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>I was very interested in getting a new Microsoft Lumia 950 device in the very near future. To that end, I did chat with a Windows Store representative who confirmed that this device is not compatible with Sprint or Verizon networks, then promptly left the
 chat before I could ask another question I had, which is more general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was actually stunned that Microsoft's current flagship device does not support 50% of the major networks in the US which leads me to the obvious concern and question .. Is Microsoft is really committed to the Windows phone market?</p>
<p>

            Another approach is to mount the ISO to install the same version of Windows 10 that you have now, as if you were doing an upgrade. Run setup.exe and go through the "upgrade" process. This may fix things, while leaving all of your installed Apps and data
 as they are now.

            <p><span>Hi Saul,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to our community. We will try our best to help you troubleshoot the issue. Here’re some points of information I’d like to confirm for a better understanding of the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>1.Is the error the entire log information. If not, please share with us the entire log. And we appreciate a screenshot of the error message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.Did you deploy Exchange hybrid and the Lync 2013 the same time? Or the Exchange hybrid was deployed previously and recently you started to set up the Lync 2013?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.Do online and on-premise Exchange users both use the Lync 2013 accounts?
</span></p>
<p><span>Or Skype for Business hybrid is deployed as well?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. I assume that the other functions of Lync 2013 work well. (no issue loging in, no issue seeing other’s status…)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            <p>Hi Brook,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back. Here's the corresponding answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Not able to see this in the error logs but here is the screenshot of what we're getting. This only happens for users</p>
<p>that were migrated to 0365. IM presence for Exchange On-prem users works fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a116e1cf-0e4d-491f-8fc8-2fff4ee1f6f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a116e1cf-0e4d-491f-8fc8-2fff4ee1f6f4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. We have Exchange and Lync installed long time &nbsp;ago and are still running in our environment now. We are planning to migrate all users to EO so we do this phase by phase that is why we decided to configure an Exchange&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hybrid setup. So now we have an Exchange Hybrid and a Lync On-prem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Yep, Online and On-prem use the same login credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. All Lync and Exchange functions works perfectly fine except this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, everything on the link below is already done also:</p>

            <p>Hi Saul,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>IM/Presence in OWA is a supported feature for Lync Server 2013 integration with Exchange Online. To achieve that, we need to configure a shared SIP Address Space in Exchange Online and configure a Hosting Provider on the Edge Server. Could you please
 check if you have corrected the related settings?</span></p>

            <p>Hi Saul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is weird. The IM presence in OWA should work if all the requirements in the KB have been met.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Please choose one affected user, share with us the two following information:</p>
<p>a.<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</span></a>, run
<em>Get-Mailbox 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** |fl emailaddresses</em>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In your local AD, capture a screenshot of the <strong>MAIL</strong> attribute of the affected user.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.Use the Lync Server Management Shell, share with us the result of <em>Get-CsAccessEdgeConfiguration | select AllowFederatedUsers</em> and Get-CsHostingProvider –Identity “Exchange Online” |fl</p>
<br />
<p>Since these information contains your privacy, I have sent you a private message to request it. Please click this link to access your Private Message:

            <p>Hi Saul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. There’s Lync Server 2013 only in your environment. It’s not a Lync hybrid deployment. The EnableSharedAddressSpace flag should be set to False.</p>
<p>Please run to <em>New-CsHostingProvider -Identity "Exchange Online" -EnabledSharedAddressSpace $False</em> to set it to False.</p>
<p>Then run <em>Get-CsHostingProvider -Identity "Exchange Online" |fl EnabledSharedAddressSpace</em> to check it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I understand that you have directory synchronization enabled. There is no action for you regarding #2 mentioned in the KB as the directory sync tool will sync the SIP address to Office 365. However, based on the results
<em>Get-Mailbox ***| fl emailaddresses</em>, both the two users are missing their SIP address, which is abnormal.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest you delete the SIP addresses for these two uses in local AD and then re-add them:
SIP:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. After that, let the sync tool sync with Office 365.</p>
<p>Please make sure the default SMTP address, SIP address and the UserPrincipalName are the same.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the SIP address still doesn’t show up in exchange online, please check if it’s caused by some specific filter settings.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SIP addresses don’t show up in Exchange online. Do you mean that you remove the two user objects from the sync scope of Azure AD Connect?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you modified these objects, we suggest you run the PowerShell command in the Azure AD Connect server to sync with Office 365:
<em>StartADSyncCycle –PolicyType Initial</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            How do I disable &#34;new build&#34; updates but not other updates&#63;</h2>
                    I just learned (from <span>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/10061-no-start-menu-action-center-notifications/6a9ed620-a54b-4c9b-829e-d71823662726) that the "family safety bug" that makes a system unusable if you have (or ever had) a child
 account present is also present in 10074.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I read correctly, 10074 is being pushed both to the Slow and Fast rings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that my "downgraded from 10061 to 10049" machine will soon get 10074 and become unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I prevent 10074 from being installed on that machine, but still get "normal" updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S. When will that bug be fixed????</p>

            So, what constitutes low end, mid, high end? For most folks it is indicated by the price of the device. For the manufacturers it is realized by what they put in, and leave out. Current high, and low, end iOS devices (5, 5S, 5C) have the same amount of
 RAM. They differ in co-processors, screen res, storage, build quality, etc. If you go back to earlier iOS devices with less RAM, you will find that they cannot run some current titles as well. If you saved money by buying a budget device, you should expect
 to be restricted in some aspects. If running high end games was a significant goal, getting a device that supported that would seem to be advised.

            SO you try to connect the 6610i?<br />
sorry, I don't know what is 1601..)<br />
Ca-42 should work, but originally the cable for 6610i is DKU-5, which is the older model.<br />
SOmetimes antivirus programs might be interfering with installation process, so if you have such programs running, stop them. Again, this is pure guess work, your setup should work.<br />
Make sure also that you have latest PC Suite (6.70.22). You can check version:<br />
rught ckick phone icon in windows tray area(bottom right), select about PC Suite, also system info is usefull to report here

    <title>Internet Explorer Favorites Folder Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpeverlearning  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer Favorites Folder Problem</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I'm hoping someone can help me with a maddening problem!&nbsp; I am using Vista and Internet Explorer 7.&nbsp; I access my favorites via the pull-down list from the menu at the top, with my favorite bookmarks organised into folders.&nbsp; All goes well until I access the
 same folder a few times within the same session.&nbsp; Suddenly, when I highlight that folder again, a tiny mark appears in the top right hand corner of the highlighted folder, and it no longer opens to reveal the bookmarks within that folder.<br />
If I right-click the folder and select "open", then a box will open with the bookmarks and I can open them from there.&nbsp; Alternatively, if I open a new tab (without closing down IE), the folder and its bookmarks will be accessible&nbsp;in the new tab.<br />
This little mark is obviously some kind of lock on the folder, but I don't know what I am doing to put it there, or how to get rid of it once it's there.&nbsp; It's not happening to the same folder each time, and can sometimes happen to a few folders, although I
 usually give up and open a new tab by then.<br />
Backtracking in the history doesn't seem to help unlock it either.<br />
Any suggestions would be most appreciated - although there are ways around this, it is annoying, so a quick fix would be nice.<br />
Many thanks.<br />

<p>I have a laptop and a desktop.&nbsp; I wasn't using outlook effectively and wasn't sync'g my phone.&nbsp; I exported all my contacts from each computer and my cell phone to a txt file to get rid of the duplicates and a bunch I no longer needed.&nbsp; Then imported them
 back to outlook 2007.&nbsp; Fine until I tried to sync them back to my VX6900.</p>
<p>I've deleted and re-added the phone.&nbsp; I've cleared all options (of course, this dumped all my contacts).&nbsp; I manually added back several contacts to the phone and they seem to sync, but I have 200 + more to add back to the phone.&nbsp; (The calendar syncs ok).&nbsp;
 I'm not using any of the other options.</p>
<p>I only want my contacts back in my phone.&nbsp; I read all the old info on this problem, but it hasn't seemed to help me.</p>

<p>chuckret,</p>
<p>Have you tried adding them in batches?&nbsp; You could make a folder in Outlook and move all but already sync'd contacts there, then add them back say 20 at a time and then sync after each batch.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook.com Alias Mail Account SMTP Error using Email Client to access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saugaato ray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com Alias Mail Account SMTP Error using Email Client to access Outlook.com</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have created an alias to my outlook.com email account. The alias is of my corporate email ID. The alias was created without any issues, and the alias was configured for 'send and receive'. The 'send and receive' function is working fine from the webinterface
 of outlook.com.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Problem #1</b></div>
<div>Now, I configured the corporate email ID in my email client, MS Outlook 2013. The configuration was done with the auto-sync facility available with MS Outlook 2013. The sync is working wonderfully well in receiving mail (pop). But incase of sending mails,
 some of the mails, especially the one with attachments are not getting delivered. I understand the actual process happening in like this -
<u>Outlook 2013&gt;Outlook.com&gt;My Email Alias SMTP Server.</u>&nbsp;Somehow the system is failing in some mail deliveries.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Problem #2</b></div>
<div>I used another of my corporate ID in the similar fashion but this time with another email client. I configured the email client as POP and SMTP, and not auto-sync. The POP server used was pop3.live.com, with my email alias accessing the pop server. The
 system is working fine without any issues.</div>
<div>The SMTP server has been configured as smtp.live.com with port 587, SSL/TLS. Here, the problem starts. Some of the mails are getting lost, especially with attachment. &nbsp;understand the actual process happening in like this -
<u>Outlook 2013&gt;Outlook.com&gt;My Email Alias SMTP Server</u>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But if I change the SMTP server to my corporate mail server, smtp.domain.com, the system works wonderfully well, with 100% mail delivery, even with attachments (including heavy attachments).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Somewhere the system of Outlook 2013&gt;Outlook.com&gt;My Email Alias SMTP Server is becoming unreliable.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CAN SOME ONE HELP ME BY THROWING SOME LIGHT OR RECTIFY THIS ISSUE.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why I want to route my mails through outlook.com?</div>
<div>1. Has larger capacity than my corporate mail.</div>
<div>2. Has better features to sync with other devices.</div>
<div>3. Backs up mail even if my email client corrupts (which my corporate smtp sever never does).&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. Quick to access using webmail option.</div>
<div>5. Integrates with my social network. Hence, with a single log-in I can perform multiple task.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Saugaato, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience that this issue may have caused you. Let me assist you on this matter and rest assured that I will endeavor to assist you as best as I can and hopefully we can get this issue fixed for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for us to properly address your concern, please provide an answer to the following questions that I have outlined below on your next reply for isolation purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using email client when you encountered the error message? If yes, can you please try to access your Microsoft account using webmail (<a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a>) then send a test email to see if the
 problem still persists? </li><li>Can you please provide us the steps that you've performed on your end prior to the incident?
</li><li>Have you tried sending email for one specific contact only and see if the problem still persists?
</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, we would like to inform you that the <span>code (Status: 4.4.7) that you received typically indicates a problem on the receiving server. Verify the validity of the recipient address, and verify that the receiving server is configured to
 receive messages correctly. <u>You may also have to reduce the number of recipients in the header of the message for the host from which you are receiving this NDR</u>. If you resend the message, the message is added to the queue again. If the receiving server
 is online, the message is delivered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We look forward for your response on this matter. </span></p>

    <title>Word Mobile, Excel Mobile and PowerPoint Mobile fail to recognise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> it team.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Mobile, Excel Mobile and PowerPoint Mobile fail to recognise Office 365 Home subscription on any of my devices&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    About 2 weeks ago everything was fine and then all of the sudden those 3 mobile office apps switched to "read only" mode on all my Windows 10 Surface tablets and Windows 10 Mobile phones. Had licencing problems with the full Office suite on all 5 Surface
 tablets as well, which I managed to resolve myself. But to no avail with the mobile ones. Logged off them on all devices, reinstalled, logged in and unfortunately at any attempt to create a new item or edit a viewed one it says: "Office 365 required You need
 Office 365 to create …, but you can view them for free" Level 2 couldn't help in the last 10 days. I'm still well within my device limits. My Office 365 Home subscription is all paid for, always in time. Any ideas anyone?

            Hi MS!<br /><br />The following is a trick from another user:<br /><br />1- Uninstall all office three apps, (Word, Excel &amp; PowerPoint)<br />2- Restart your phone<br />3- Install them again<br />Now they should be working perfectly, you can now create new documents, or edit existing ones, with a lot of free editing features included, these are really some amazing apps.<br /><br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_office-insider_excel/office-mobile-apps-open-files-on-read-only-mode/f61dfee9-16d6-453e-9a18-b1b8796ff7cd">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/for...</a>

<p>Hi Juan/All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already implemented the suggested steps some days ago, which didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the same message on all devices I tried so far, including MS Surface tablets, laptops, MS Windows 10 Mobile Phones, Android phones and tablets, iPhones and iPads, when I use my MS account or 2 others I share my Office 365 Home subscription with. It
 only started occurring about 2 weeks ago. Strange enough My Office app and OneNote mobile are able to validate my subscription across different devices.</p>
<p>I think, it has got something to do with botched MS Accounts' services. The whole "cloud hype" on any platform is rubbish. Even worse on Google's Android, Apple iDevices or Adobe Cloud, based on my own empirical experience.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any further possible solutions.</p>

            I'm not quite clear what exactly you need help with ? If you are trying to buy a new handset from Verizon which is running Windows, I believe the only Lumia which they carried was the 735. That was release almost 3 years ago and has been discontinued over
 a year ago. I don't see how we could help you here - if that's what you're after.

            I think its associated with Push notifications for App's like Nokia Reader and Nokia Push.<br />
So I'd delete it and any of those App's. I read somewhere that earlier versions were incompatable with QT 4.7 so you may want to download the latest Store client from Betalabs after you've removed it to clean up the QT files.

<p>No, we cannot. There must be some underlying cause that is slowing your phone down such as too many applications running in the background, low phone memory on the C: drive and running anti-virus software, which isn't needed on a Symbian device.</p>

<p>I know, but I have no applications running in the background. I use 'App Stop' to view the applications and are always 'Messaging, Calendar, All WRT Widgets, Clock, QtAppBooster, Contacts, Register and WhatsApp'. All these applications are executed at power
 up phone.<br />
<br />
I have installed a few applications (all in memory C): Opera Mobile, App Stop, Smart Office, Screen Snap, Battery Monitor, Mr. AppLock, X-Plore, Shazam, Fast Tube, WhatsApp and Radio Internet. I have 103 MB free in C. I don't use Antivirus.<br />
<br />
In the mass memory I have about 400 musics, some 23 videos and nothing else. The browser cache are empty, I have 23 contacts of friends, 0 messages messaging and 23 entries in the phonebook. MY PHONE IS FULLY WELL but little fluid.<br />
<br />
I do not understand what happens. The desktop is little fluid, the delay in opening applications and when I see a video shot in HD with the camera is 'loading ...' for about 3 or 4 seconds on certain occasions. I want to install an application to see the CPU
 usage but no have on Nokia Store.<br />
<br />
WHAT CAN BE? The phone worked fine before. Never had a fall or anything. I got expensive and take good care. This phone only gives me a headache and I always come to this forum&nbsp;<span><span>and just</span>
<span>get</span> <span>silly answers</span> <span>
or</span> <span>get</span> <span>no</span> <span>
answers.</span></span> Hence it is my anger.<br />

<p>&nbsp;Hi. Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you trying to get the '<strong>Lumia Black</strong>' update? What is the exact error message that you're getting? Do you have a stable Wi-Fi or a cellular data connection?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check that your phone's date+time is set correctly. If possible, try to connect to other Wi-Fi connection for us to further isolate your case. Make sure that your phone's system settings are all updated:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/search?q=lumia+pusher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/search?q=lumia+pusher</a>.</strong></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Repeatedly drops connection with exchange account</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>I run Windows 10, and Office 2016 (Office 365) &nbsp;with latest updates on a relatively new custom computer. I have been using Outlook 2016 since it was introduced (upgraded from 2013), and until recently no issues.</p>
<p>Recently Outlook has been randomly dropping the connection to the Microsoft Exchange account. (OST) file. My internet connection is still up, but Outlook stops talking to the Exchange server, and will not allow me to send or receive mail.Lower right notice
 "trying to connect" shows. I can go on-line and use outlook at my Microsoft Account home page when it stops working on the deck top, so it seems unrelated to what is happening at server.</p>
<p>Most times I have to reboot the computer and restart Outlook to get it to reconnect. I ran the RCA test, and do not see any issues. I saved the test results if that helps, but as far as I can see, it does not identify any issues, even when the system is
 disconnected from the server.</p>
<p>Drops seem to be random and happen when I am using computer, as well as when it is sitting idle.</p>
<p>I hoped someone could point me in right direction to get it sorted out. Really a pain to keep rebooting computer.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Based on your description, the issue doesn’t occur in other PCs. It indicates that Office 365 online services are working well. As a new profile will probably fix many of the client issues, please try it to check if the issue can be resolved.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, since our forum focuses on Office 365 online services, we have limited resources about such client related issue. I suggest you go to

<h3> janey me  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you change the spacing &#38; margin in notebook layout for the heading on each page&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;I know how to change the margins &amp; paper size, but it's the header at the top of each page in the notebook layout I'm stuck with. I can't find any reference to how to alter it in all the drop down windows. &nbsp;Someone please help!
<div>I find the notebook layout documents in microsoft word for mac 2008 really useful. The only thing i can't find out how to do so far is to change the header on each page so the margins match the ones I've created for that document. &nbsp;At the moment, I've
 got margins of 0.25" all round but the header at the top of each page is still set at the default &amp; I can't find any pull down menu or toolbox tip to help me match it up with the rest. Also, I wish there was a way of altering the default font in microsoft
 word documents because I really don't like the fonts they use!</div>
<div>If anyone can help, I'd be grateful.&nbsp;</div>

            I believe Phillip overstated the case quite a bit :-) but he is correct re Header &amp; Footer margins in NBL View. Most of what you can do is discussed in Word Help:
<br />
NBL is simply a user interface explicitly designed for appearance &amp; convenience. As such there is not much about its dimensions that can be customized. However, if you've changed the Header/Footer margins in
Print Layout</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Draft</span>
 of what fancy face you throw up to view it through.<br />
<br />
The default font for new Word documents is determined by the default paragraph style called
 regardless of which "view" you work in.<br />
<br />
Styles are the preferred means of formatting Word documents. They provide more efficient, more consistent &amp; more stable document construction. In addition to the built-in styles you can modify individual styles [such as

</p><p>I just had a user have this happen this morning. He nearly missed a conference call he setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically we have a service called Mimecast that archives all inbound and outbound emails. We were able to find the original appointment there with the Skype for business conference info so he could start his conference call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened a few weeks ago but we dismissed it as him not actually sending the appointment. Now I'm digging into that one further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would cause an appointment to disappear from the account? I have audit logging turned on for this person's mailbox and I cannot find anything in the audit log related to this message. It may be because of my inability to search the audit log using powershell
 though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something strange though. In outlook web I can see the appointment in the inbox when in threaded conversation view.</p>

<p>Hi PIALLD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have found the item in the outbox folder, which means that the item does not send out successfully. But there are two acceptance replies, I need to collect the following to look into the issue.</p>
<p>1. Does this calendar item show on the two recipients' calendars?</p>
<p>2. Even you found it in the outbox folder, you still cannot see it in this user's calendar, right?</p>
<p>3. Do you install the latest Outlook update? If so, please share the detailed Outlook version number with us.</p>
<p>4. In OWA, does this item show in the calendar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Yes. On the Review tab, click the Compare button and select Combine in the dropdown menu.<br />
<br />
In the dialog, use the two Browse buttons (the folder icons) at the top to select the two edited documents.<br />
<br />
If the More button is visible, click it to open the rest of the dialog.<br />
<br />
Select the kinds of changes you want to include.<br />
<br />
At the bottom, it usually works best if you choose "Word level" and "New document".<br />
<br />
Click OK, and the program does its thing.<br />
<br />
If you have more than two edited documents, you have to combine two, then combine the result with the third, and so on.<br />

    <title>Using Vlookup or other to pull progressive bonuses in commission - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using Vlookup or other to pull progressive bonuses in commission</h2>
                    <p>So, the spreadsheet is for commissions for car sales. My dealership has progressive bonuses. Sell at least 12&nbsp;cars and&nbsp;I get an extra flat 300 bucks that month, sell 14 cars and its 400, 16=500, 18=900, 20=1,100, 22=1,300, 24=1500 and every car above 24
 pays an additional 300 bucks. Then there's the gross bonus, 8,500 gross gets 300, 10,000=800, 12,000=900, 14,000=1,100, 15,000=1,400, 17,000=1,800, 20,000=2,500 and stops there. So, I have a sheet for each month and a template sheet that I copy/paste for new
 months. Assuming that I'll be using something similar to VLookup, my progressive list will be listed with the template sheet. The template calculates front and back-end gross, and total units, including half deals that I split with other salesman for whatever
 reason. So, if someone could explain the formula necessary to tell the bonus for both progressives, that would be great.&nbsp;This has to be able to work with pulling the 12 figure if I sell 12, 12.5, 13, and 13.5, and be able to pull the total front end gross&nbsp;from
 my one column and calculate which gross progressive I would get. </p>
<p>I know I could just use the VLookup with a full list of 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5, etc.,&nbsp;and the progressive I get listed&nbsp;next to&nbsp;each number, but if I have to calculate for the gross, then I might as well do that for the unit bonus too.
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance to whoever helps me. </p>
<p>--Edit--</p>
<p>As you can imagine, a car salesman leads a busy life. So, here's an example of my template. Now these progressives are on top of my normal commission. So it's the total of all positive gross at the end of the month that is calculated, negative gross doesn't
 detract, and I have that in the formula for total front end gross at the bottom of column T/F (Total Front), T/B (Total Back) is the gross the finance manager makes selling warrantees and extended protection plans and what not. This does not count towards
 gross bonus. Progressive unit bonus is totaled at the bottom, and putting anything (mainly another salesman's name, but it could be anything) in the split column will halve total commission. I just realized I don't have it split the front amount if it was
 a split deal when totaling at the bottom. A little help with this would be nice too. I think I got the brunt of it made up, just need a little help with the technical parts.
<a href="http://1drv.ms/1mE0hSX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Deal Template Public</a> is a link to edit this file on my onedrive account. It's ok to modify and experiment with this. It's just a copy, but I would leave the columns the same. As you can see,
 the first sheet has the template that I will copy and paste into new sheets each month. This also has the bonuses as they are listed on my pay plan sheet. Once you hit each level, you get that amount instead of the last amount, not in addition to.
</p>
<p>Again, sorry for the delay, but life keeps me busy. That's why I have this so I can just enter it and move on instead of writing it down somewhere and fumbling to keep track of it, or assuming every car is a mini (the 130 amount).
