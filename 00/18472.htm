<h2>            How can I sign into two Outlook.com accounts at the same time&#63;</h2>
                    Hi - <br />
<br />
My wife has an older hotmail.com account and I have a new outlook.com account, but once one of us signs in, we can't sign into the other account - it keeps bringing up the account that is currently open - even with a new browser session.<br />
<br />
Is there a way that we can both view our email accounts from the same computer?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

Ever since Microsoft removed linking it has been more problematic to view 2 accounts at the same time.&nbsp; One way you can is to use 2 different browsers (or two instances of the same browser).<br />
<br />
Of course if you sign out of one you can then sign into the other.<br />
<br />
Another option (which I prefer) is to use an email client like windows live mail.&nbsp; I have 5 emails so for me that is the only option.<br />

<p>Yes, I have the same problem. Don't worry—go to "Account settings," and click "Sign in with another account." That should solve your problem.</p>

</p><p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On looking at this, it refers to Sharepoint MySite profiles and specifies a requirement of Sharepoint on-premise 2010 or 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our setup of Sharepoint is on Sharepoint Online and we use Delve profiles in Office 365 (not MySite). Can you confirm whether this script should work?</p>
<p>

            <p>I won't pretend to understand how UEFI BIOS extensions have been implemented on all platforms,</p>
<p>but I have abused a couple of inexpensive Windows 8.1 tablets bought recently - one to play with Windows 10 and the other to use for document reviews. Both are tiny 16GB SSD 7" tablets that came with the Bing version of Windows 8.1. Toys compared to what
 I normally use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trashed and rebuilt both computers in the past two weeks and found a few things about using Recovery USB sticks:</p>
<p>In Win 8.1: Settings &gt; Recovery &gt; Boot from other Device / UEFI Device will boot a Win 10 DVD and do an install / update</p>
<p>In&nbsp;Windows 10: Settings &gt; Recovery ... most options will not allow booting from a Win 8.1 USB Recovery drive... it tends to insist on a Windows 10 Recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does work is to either force a recovery mode BIOS recovery.... pull the plug / force a hardware reset a few times and the software UEFI extensions give up and drop into a low level hardware BIOS from which the boot device options will show the 8.1 Recovery
 drive (if plugged in) and then will boot from that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Less brutal is to use the Settings &gt; Recovery options to find the Advanced options&nbsp;and then the BIOS UEFI option to get down into the low level hardware BIOS boot options... and then select the USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It varies from computer to computer.... the main thing is to get into the old fashioned hardware BIOS to enable choosing the USB Recovery drive as the boot device.</p>

<p><strong>Mubeena have you manually copied your data (not via usb recovery) to a USB or DVD's?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If not, please BACKUP your data by just copying your files in c:\users\"yourname" as well as other
</strong><strong>folders you may have other personal files.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you have windows.old and windows.old.000 you have upgraded windows 2 times so recovery</p>
<p>of your data back to the original is alittle&nbsp;harder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes there is a work a round by </p>
<p>booting to a bootable&nbsp;utility DVD or windows 10&nbsp;DVD</p>
<p>renaming your current windows folder to windows.w10 (or similar) </p>
<p>then rename windows.old back to windows</p>
<p>Fix the boot entries and boot back to your old windows 8.1</p>
<p>But this is not guaranteed to work and you may need to repair windows 8.1 again</p>
<p>With a windows 8.1 DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have all your data and you want to wipe everything and reinstall window 8.1 fresh.</p>
<p>Then you will need to reinstall all your programs and restore &amp; copy back your data.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You should download windows 8.1 ISO image with windows creation tool.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>You can also read this to help backup your data. It is different as you do not use dual boot so</strong></p>
<p><strong>do not try fixing it his way you only have one system booting at a time because you copied</strong></p>

<h2>            Word 2011 for Mac Indexing</h2>
                    <div>
<p>
</p><p><span>When making an index using Word 2011 for Mac, is&nbsp;<span>there a way to move from one term being indexed to its next occurance in the text while leaving the Mark Index Entry box open and keeping the entry the same,
 so that I don’t have to keep retyping the entry (which is different from the highlighted term in the text) over and over? &nbsp;For example, "Pynchon" in the text needs to be entered as "Pynchon, Thomas." If I use “Search in Document” to look for additional “Pynchon”s
 in the text, once I highlight the next one, the main entry turns into just "Pynchon," and so I have to add ", Thomas" each time. &nbsp;I don’t want to just use “Mark All,” because then I'll end up having to delete lots of them that actually refer, for example,
 to Pynchon's novels. &nbsp;I'm looking at hundreds of "Pynchon"s here and it's a problem that's going to recur with many other names and terms, so I'd be grateful for a possible solution. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>

</p><p>PLEASE read the question before replying...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paula: &nbsp;There is no "good" way to do this, because as you have discovered, the next selection replaces the previously-entered text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only the Main Entry is involved, you can COPY it, then PASTE into the dialog box each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To specify all of the entries in the dialog, you can record a little throw-away macro to fill it in for you. &nbsp;You need to display the Developer tab to record macros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could, of course, use the "Mark All" facility to mark every occurrence of the search term in a single command; but of course, a good indexer would never publish such an index :-) &nbsp;However, it may be quicker for you to use Mark All, then use Search to
 revisit all the tags and delete the ones you do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you Search for the main term as '^d XE "jumps' you will find only index entries whose main term begins with "jumps". &nbsp;^d is the code for "a field", XE is the code for a field of type Index, and the quote begins the main term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Groove displays &#34;Unknown Artist&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I searched everywhere but I cannot find any solution to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put some of my music collection on my phone (Lumia 950) and I'm using Groove to play it. However, it doesn't display artists name correctly - for each one of my albums it shows me "Unknown Artist". I have set all my tags using
<strong>Mp3tag </strong>software so they are all set perfectly. The problem does not occur in any other music player I have tried. It does display artists name at the top, just below the album pictures, however under each individual song it just displays "Unknown
 Artist".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any clues how to fix it?&nbsp;</p>

            I'm having this problem it's so annoying! I bought a genuine SanDisk 128GB Micro SD card from Amazon, sycned all my music/films no problem and went onto the phone and I have a huge chunk of "Unknown Artist" but when you go onto the "Properties" if you
 hold down on the song it says at the bottom where it's located in the correct Artist folder. They are named properly because I checked in my iTunes. I even tried adding an "Album Artist" if it was blank and that seemed to have worked! Really frustrating this
 shouldn't happen with a new Windows 10 Phone I seem to be having problems with it left, right and centre! &gt;:(

            <p>I have the same issue too on Windows 10 Pro v1511 (Build 10586.446) but only with FLAC tracks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sometimes keep both a 320 Kbps MP3 and FLAC copy of albums, the MP3 versions converted from the FLAC ones using dBpoweramp R16. The strange thing is that the MP3 versions show the artist correctly yet the FLAC ones, which the MP3 ones are converted from,
 show as Unknown Artist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that there is a bug in Groove that is not reading the Artist tag properly because that same tag reads fine when converted to MP3 without any further editing.</p>

            I had a sudden thought the other day why this may be happening; is it because certain music isn't available on Groove and it can't find the correct information? But this shouldn't be the case, surely! My 950 is off being "repaired" hopefully I'm sick of
 it! &gt;:(

<h2>            In Outlook 2016, when I click to Compose a new message, the window does not appear</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 2016 on a Windows 10 computer that is fully patched. When clicking to create a new email message, the Outlook icon on the taskbar shows a 2nd window and it looks right.&nbsp; I don't actually see the new email window though. I've also checked video
 drivers and they seem to be up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I start in safe mode, I do NOT have the problem any more but there really isn't anything to disable as this is a pretty new computer - just installed a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Researching online, I found one article where a similar problem was reported and it was suggested to do a repair. When I go into Programs and Features though, Microsoft Office 2016 is not even listed as an installed program. It came pre installed&nbsp;with this
 Dell computer.&nbsp; If you think I should do a repair/reinstall, where can I find the launcher to do the repair since it's not listed in the installed programs list?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 keeps crashing after it automatically updated to 16.0.6366.2036</h2>
                    This morning I was prompted to install the latest update for Office 365/64bit&nbsp; 16.0.6366.2036. After the installation completed I started Outlook and it crashed after about 20-30 seconds and it keeps happening after I restart the app. As far as I can tell
 It doesn't affect any of the other Office 365 applications. Is there a way to go back to an older version that is more stable?

            Thank you, that solved the problem. It was an add-in to open PDF's inside Outlook from Nitro PDF 10. The add-in is called Nitro Pro 10. I'll have to open a support ticket over at Nitro's website and see if they provide an update yet that works with this
 version.

            Unfortunately disabling add-ins didn't solve the problem as I thought it would above. It takes longer now before it crashes and the crashes occur on all of the Office 365 apps, but it just takes longer on Excel and Word. I also have two language packs
 installed on that system. So my next step is to remove those since I don't have the same issues on my Notebook with the same version but no language packs installed. If that doesn't' work I'll uninstall Office and reinstall it.

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 925 Motherboard Problem</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div>Device : Nokia Lumia 925</div>
<div>IMEI &nbsp; : ***</div>
<div>Device Refers to: Nokia Lumia 925</div>
<div>
<p>Customer Care / Sri Lanka Refer to : Softlogic Communication Services (PVT) Ltd. Sri Lanka</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I was using a Nokia Lumia 925 device. Suddenly three months ago the device stopped working and it had shut down without any abnormality. I normally plugged it to the charger and the device was not turning on. I Tried several times and failing to do on
 that day (12 Apr 2015) I handover the device to the Nokia/Microsoft authorized partner in Sri Lanka on 16 April 2015.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>On 16 th April they have logged a entry&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p><strong>SRWP001335</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">for the inspection for the phone and next day when I checked with them they informed me that my Lumia 925 device was beyond repair. I was shocked at this moment and it was not even single time repaired or
 even had a prior problem. I confirmed from them that no physical damage was happened to the device and they told me that the&nbsp;<strong>Motherboard of the Device was fried.&nbsp;</strong>They unable to point out the reason for this also and suggest that this might
 be happen due to&nbsp;<strong>manufacture defect</strong>.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>I bought this device exactly 14 months before this happen. But unfortunately my warranty was expired 2months ago. I spent more than Rs50,000 on purchasing this device and it was a dream of mine. So I explained my condition to the service point people and
 they tried to fix the device again&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p><strong>SRWP001518 and 003157</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Yet it was beyond repair. Then I asked them that if it is a manufacturer defect what would you do for me as it was not my fault. As 14 month life span is not recommended for a high end phone like lumia 925.
 Then they told me that it is possible to replace the motherboard and it would cost me around Rs 27000.00. At this time the the market price of the phone is also Rs 35000 and I asked for a some price deduction and they have got a 50% off confirmation from Microsoft
 and I told OK to go for it with motherboard replacement for Rs 13500. At that time the service center here in Sri Lanka only had one Lumia 925 motherboard left and they told me that I can collect the phone the same day. So I rushed to the service center and
 on the way they have informed me that the remaining motherboard also having problems and cannot be replaced. Then they promised that it is possible to import motherboards from Netherlands and it will reach Sri Lanka in a week or maximum two weeks time. But
 it never came. As per their information they have tried more than three times to lodge the order for lumia 925 motherboard and still it is showing as out of stock.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I was a really a good fan of Nokia for last 10 years. I started my Nokia life with Nokia 3120 which still I have and still working. Then I used Nokia 7610 then I used Nokia n95-8Gb which still works and Nokia
 X2. Recently before 14 months time I moved to Lumia 925 which was a dream phone to me. But the thing which that happened I was really upset and frustrated with all of your handsets, customer service and after sales division. I mean a company like Microsoft
 cant be that much ignorant. With all of this the emotional attachment which was with Nokia and Microsoft was broken. Due to this incident only I had to go for a low end android mobile which do not want to use until I receive my lumia 925.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>Finally I will summarize&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">My Lumia 925 had only 14 month life</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Lumia mobiles have a very short life span compared to other previous Nokia phones</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">If the warranty is expired even for a day even if you a decade old customer you are not welcome</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">After sales and customer service experience is horrible, just horrible.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Customer Service cant confirm about shipment or stock even after three months</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">They cant even say whether the stocks are there or not even they were shipped until the stock comes to the customs</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>As a loyal decade long customer I have burnt 50000 money just for a 14 month phone.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>Its true that windows phone is bit in the back seat when compared to other mainstream mobile phones. But customers like us who really appreciate the uniqueness of Nokia Lumia made the survival of this fallen giant. Therefor Microsoft please if you cant make
 new customers please please please don't loose the remaining customers. As you know frustrated customer can be your worst enemy. Do you think after this above mentioned horrible incident, I will recommend any lumia phone to any of my friends or family? Still
 I don't have my phone. After three months from the 16th April still my phone is not fixed. Customer center people say that If I had the warranty remaining even if the phone was discontinued the device will be replaced with a device like Lumia 830. But due
 to 2 months expiry I was thrown out even though I was a very loyal customer who used Nokia when the smart phone mania was not there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi tiny_chef1 I am also having the same problem with my Lumia 925 and it stopped working just after the 1 year of purchase. I went to nokia service store but they were unable to solve my problem. I purchased my mobile from India and now I am in Aachen,
 Germany so is it possible to get my phone fixed here. If it is possible then please guide me through the process and if not then tell me what will be the scrap value for this dead set. &nbsp;

            Unfortunately your handset is now out of warranty regardless of your location. Even if it was within warranty, in your case it would be valid only in India, not in Germany.

Device &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : Nokia Lumia 925<br />
IMEI &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : ****<br />

<p>
</p><p>thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>I have contacted the local support team on this regard on several times. As I mentioned in previously also the local support team has granted a wave of of 50% for the motherboard after concerning about my case. But they are keep on telling that Nokia/Microsoft
 is now discontinuing this 925 model and they are unable to find any, I MEAN "ANY" motherboard from ANY of your warehouses including Netherlands as well. As per their feedback they have raised order for Nokia Lumia 925 motherboard for more than 5times including
 last weeks order sheet and yet they reply from the other end always comes as "out of stock"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as at today 16th of August 2015, it has been nearly four months (nearly 120 days) since I handover my handset to the local support team on mid April 2015.
<strong>Is it true that you guys don't manufacture Lumia 925 phone or parts anymore as per this above mentioned scenario?
</strong></p>
<p>As I asked from the Local support team they also unaware that whether 925 motherboards are available or not. So they are giving me the same options that&nbsp;</p>
<p>go for a phone for a dealer price - which only a Rs 2000.00 deduction where I spent more than Rs 50000.00 on purchasing the device 14 months back. for the cause of warranty expired for 2 months time I was isolated and given a small cookie of deduction worth
 Rs 2000.00 for my Nokia lumia 925. Do you think is it OK?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here, I went for this phone for a reason. For the features like the camera and the hardware. The connection between me and Nokia is some way emotional where as I am using only Nokia for the last 10 years (Nokia 3120 - still works) where as in this case the
 trust I had on the devices and the company is decreasing. As you can clearly understand for a person who had used Nokia for 10 years, if someone ask for my recommendation for Lumia for anyone, do you think what would be my comments? &nbsp;Therefore humbly request
 proper inquiry on this case and please please provide me a reasonable reply at the earliest.</p>
<p>herewith I have attached a copy of the invoice as a proof which dated 16 April 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>I also had exactly same problem with my Nokia Lumia 925. It stopped working just after 2 months of expiry of warranty period, in January 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service Center checked it up and observed the problem with motherboard of the phone. They said it would cost Rs 10000 to repair/replace the part. Reply from customer care center was same that after warranty it is all chargeable to the full cost irrespective
 of me being an old and loyal customer of Nokia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I forgot that phone and bought a new Android phone worth Rs 5000 which is working extremely well without any problem and all my apps are configured on this device.&nbsp;I am enjoying all net based applications including banking, social networking etc
 &nbsp;and all basic features like phone, music, video, alarms, camera etc etc on this less expensive yet effective device. (please don't ask me about brand).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my conclusion is that all smart phones have similar apps and features as per customer requirement and there is no need to buy costly phones. However that is individual's choice.&nbsp;</p>

Hi, Well yesterday (1 Sep 2015) i too woke up to a dead Lumia 925, and just like you i have been a nokia fan since childhood, anyway, i went to the Microsoft Care Point in Mumbai since i live in India, :P they say that the phones bricked and that a new MB would
 be required, for which it will cost me Rupees 9,000/-. And Im skeptical to pay them so much money when i know they will order for a new MB god knows from where and have it installed in my phone, so i decided to do a little bit of R&amp;D and apparently a new MB
 cost about 4000/- from aliexpress. But i don't trust this option either coz it will take 40 days to be shipped and would not know if its genuine. A perfect Solution i feel is to buy a 2nd hand 925 which is not so old and not so new that it wont cost u much
 and take the MB from that device and replace the screwed up one from your Phone. This will at least ensure the MB is a factory installed MB, giving u peace of mind and a longer life span for ur device, FYI my next Phone too ill be LUMIA! so Microsoft if ur
 reading this don't rip the loyal users in such ways, u cant blame us if the phone decides to conc-off overnight, be reasonable, 150 dollars for a motherboard that may be lying in the thousands in ur factory is not really worth it and i say 150 dollars coz
 today one dollar is 60+ rupees and it is expensive.&nbsp;

<p>
</p></div>
<div>I was using a Nokia Lumia 925 device. Suddenly three months ago the device stopped working and it had shut down without any abnormality. I normally plugged it to the charger and the device was not turning on. I Tried several times and failing to do on
 that day (12 Apr 2015) I handover the device to the Nokia/Microsoft authorized partner in Sri Lanka on 16 April 2015.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>On 16 th April they have logged a entry&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p><strong>SRWP001335</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">for the inspection for the phone and next day when I checked with them they informed me that my Lumia 925 device was beyond repair. I was shocked at this moment and it was not even single time repaired or
 even had a prior problem. I confirmed from them that no physical damage was happened to the device and they told me that the&nbsp;<strong>Motherboard of the Device was fried.&nbsp;</strong>They unable to point out the reason for this also and suggest that this might
 be happen due to&nbsp;<strong>manufacture defect</strong>.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>I bought this device exactly 14 months before this happen. But unfortunately my warranty was expired 2months ago. I spent more than Rs50,000 on purchasing this device and it was a dream of mine. So I explained my condition to the service point people and
 they tried to fix the device again&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p><strong>SRWP001518 and 003157</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Yet it was beyond repair. Then I asked them that if it is a manufacturer defect what would you do for me as it was not my fault. As 14 month life span is not recommended for a high end phone like lumia 925.
 Then they told me that it is possible to replace the motherboard and it would cost me around Rs 27000.00. At this time the the market price of the phone is also Rs 35000 and I asked for a some price deduction and they have got a 50% off confirmation from Microsoft
 and I told OK to go for it with motherboard replacement for Rs 13500. At that time the service center here in Sri Lanka only had one Lumia 925 motherboard left and they told me that I can collect the phone the same day. So I rushed to the service center and
 on the way they have informed me that the remaining motherboard also having problems and cannot be replaced. Then they promised that it is possible to import motherboards from Netherlands and it will reach Sri Lanka in a week or maximum two weeks time. But
 it never came. As per their information they have tried more than three times to lodge the order for lumia 925 motherboard and still it is showing as out of stock.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I was a really a good fan of Nokia for last 10 years. I started my Nokia life with Nokia 3120 which still I have and still working. Then I used Nokia 7610 then I used Nokia n95-8Gb which still works and Nokia
 X2. Recently before 14 months time I moved to Lumia 925 which was a dream phone to me. But the thing which that happened I was really upset and frustrated with all of your handsets, customer service and after sales division. I mean a company like Microsoft
 cant be that much ignorant. With all of this the emotional attachment which was with Nokia and Microsoft was broken. Due to this incident only I had to go for a low end android mobile which do not want to use until I receive my lumia 925.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>Finally I will summarize&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its true that windows phone is bit in the back seat when compared to other mainstream mobile phones. But customers like us who really appreciate the uniqueness of Nokia Lumia made the survival of this fallen giant. Therefor Microsoft please if you cant make
 new customers please please please don't loose the remaining customers. As you know frustrated customer can be your worst enemy. Do you think after this above mentioned horrible incident, I will recommend any lumia phone to any of my friends or family? Still
 I don't have my phone. After three months from the 16th April still my phone is not fixed. Customer center people say that If I had the warranty remaining even if the phone was discontinued the device will be replaced with a device like Lumia 830. But due
 to 2 months expiry I was thrown out even though I was a very loyal customer who used Nokia when the smart phone mania was not there.&nbsp;</p>

I think there is a special offer on the lumina 640 for USD79 at the Microsoft store.&nbsp; Might be better to just buy that!

                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I installed OneDrive on my mac and tried to log in, I get a message about my email address being used for both onedrive and onedrive for business, and I don't know why. What does this means? I don't remember creating a business account. How can I cancel
 the business one? I always select the personal OneDrive account and all my info is there.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Angel Jonathan GaMa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m sorry for my slow reply.</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback. We have reported this symptom to the backend team and appropriate team has been involved for further investigation. At the meantime, we suggest selecting ‘personal’ when the account type prompts during OneDrive setup. The personal
 OneDrive shall be synced to local successfully. </p>

<h2>            Unable to activate downloaded 60 day trial version of Office Home and Student 2010</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>I have downloaded a 60 day trial version of<br />
Office 2010 Home and Student,&nbsp;and initially&nbsp;it tells me the product key <br />
is valid, but when I click on Continue, it then tells me the installation <br />
has failed and to enter another product key. </p>
<p>I am entering the product key that was sent to me by Microsoft in the email.&nbsp;I have downloaded the program various&nbsp;times now and entered different respective product keys, but the same thing happens. Very annoying.</p>
<p>Each time I have downloaded the program from the Microsoft site. My OS is Windows 7.</p>
<p>Could you please offer any advice?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance<br />

            <p><span>Office trial applications are limited period offers, and they stop working after the trial period expires.</span></p>
<p><span><span>So if the trial period has expired, then downloading another trial version may not help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try uninstalling the entire Office 2010 suit from the system, using the fixit mentioned in the following article:</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Mukherjee,</p>
<p>thank you very much for your reply. Unfortunately, it did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and re-installed Office 2010 Home and Student over 7 times now, each time using the Fixit app you advised, but the same thing happens. I install the application from the link&nbsp;Microsoft sent in the email and enter the respective product
 key, also sent with the email. It goes green, tells me the key is valid, but also when I click on "continue", a red cross appears with the message " installation has failed, please select a different product key".</p>
<p>I am more than frustrated now, as I have spent so long&nbsp;trying to resolve the issue, but without success. I need to use Office and just cannot get it to complete. This does not really motivate me to go out and buy the CD! :(</p>
<p>Any other ideas please?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Tracy</p>

            Did you try to download a different trial version as mentioned by Mukherjee earlier, that is other than the Home and Students you had already tried.<br />
Since it is a trial version that you are using, why not try a different one.<br />

            <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>thank you for your email. I have tried to download another version today, but for some reason have not been able to. When I choose to "try now" for Office Home and Business, or for Professional, I am not getting exactly the same screen as yesterday. Neither
 am I receiving the&nbsp;email with the "install now" link in and the product key info. Instead, after clicking on "try now", I am taken to the billing info screen and prompted to enter the respective details. If I do this and then click CONTINUE, I receive a message
 saying that I do not have anything in the shopping cart and therefore cannot continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the download several times now and after each time I have deleted the&nbsp;temp internet files and cookies. All very strange!</p>
<p>Any ideas please? My patience has completely run out now. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>thank you for your reply. Unfortunately my problem persists. I am trying to download a TRIAL version of Office 2010. I have tried Home and Business and&nbsp;Home and Student and the same thing happens each time. That is, I download the program from the microsoft
 site (the same URL as illustrated in your thread for trials) I enter the product key that appears on the Microsoft page, it goes green, appears as valid, and then when I click on CONTINUE, it tells me the installation failed and to enter another product key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without exaggeration I must have tried this 25 times or more now, each time properly uninstalling the application and latterly, running the suggested FixIt program to guarantee Office is completely uninstalled.</p>
<p>I have previously used a trial version of Home and Student 2010 on this pc, so I know it is possible. I just cannot understand why I cannot complete the process now. But to say that my frustraton has hit the limit is an understatement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has any further advice, I would be most grateful.</p>
<p>My OS is Windows7 64 bit.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            As far as i can guess, if possible go for a clean install of Windows.<br />
You can also get in touch with support for Office 2010 over phone, in the US, by calling 1 800 936 5700.<br />
See what they have to say.<br />

<h2>            Profile photo missing at log-in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This may be related to the Facebook app crashing as soon as it opens, but I've noticed that when I log in, Windows doesn't show my profile photo on the load screen like it used to.&nbsp; Now it's just the generic grey-and-white person icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I suspect this has to do with the Facebook app crashing as soon as it opens (when it would normally display the "Sync profile" option), but still, would be nice to get the photo back.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?&nbsp; (For either problem?)</p>

<h2>            Excel Solver addin not functioning</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 365 on a 64bit windows 10 system and am having an issue where as soon as i try to enter the data tab on excel with the solver ad-in enabled i get the following error message "<span>Cannot run the macro 'SOLVER.XLAM!MainEx'.
 The macro may not be available in this workbook or all macros may be disabled.".<br />
<br />
this is confusing to me as it appears even when i have all macros enabled on my laptop. I should also mention that i have attempted to reinstall office 365 already and that the error message occurs as soon as i access&nbsp;the data tab in excel before i even attempt
 to click on the solver icon.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</span></p>

            Hi, how are you, thanks for posting in our microsoft community. Did you try to fix it by disabling and then enabling the solver add-in. <br />Also you should check if the ActiveX Settings for all Office Applications is disable, to do this just in excel click File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt;Click the Trust Center button &gt; Click ActiveX settings &gt; If “Disable all controls without notification” is selected, choose one of the "Prompt me" options instead and click OK.<br /><br />Hope above suggestions help you and best luck!

<p>Hello Jose</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im afraid i have already tried using ActiveX settings on prompt me and on the enable all settings. Are there any alternatives you could suggest ? i am also theorizing that i may have somehow downloaded a corrupted version of solver if that is possible even.
 Is there some way make a clean re installation of the solver ?</p>
<p>

</p><blockquote>Hi, how are you, thanks for posting in our microsoft community. Did you try to fix it by disabling and then enabling the solver add-in.
<br />
Also you should check if the ActiveX Settings for all Office Applications is disable, to do this just in excel click File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt;Click the Trust Center button &gt; Click ActiveX settings &gt; If “Disable all controls without notification” is selected,
 choose one of the "Prompt me" options instead and click OK.<br />
<br />
Hope above suggestions help you and best luck! </blockquote>

<h2>            Print preview disappeared in Excel 2008 after upgrade to Mountain Lion</h2>
                    Print Preview was working fine in Excel 2008 under Snow Leopard. I have just upgraded the OS to Mountain Lion (10.8.5) and Print Preview has vanished.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have looked at the forums and found no remedy. Apple have referred me to Microsoft...</div>

            I'm continuing to use Snow Leopard &amp; have Office 2008 installed. Excel's File&gt; Print menu structure does not contain a Print Preview command. It hasn't disappeared, it never was there in that version. It was eliminated from the program starting with Office
 2008 (although <i>Word</i> continued to include a Print Preview feature in that version). The only method of previewing how the document will print offered by Excel is to use Page Layout View which is not listed in the File menu structure. It's accessible
 from the View menu or by clicking its icon in the lower left corner of the document window [next to the Normal View button].<br />
<br />
Once the Print dialog window opens there are 2 'preview' options provided by Apple:<br />
<ul>
<li>The <b>Quick Preview</b> feature displays a scaled down preview of the document which appears within the Print dialog window. In SL there is a check box below the Quick Preview area to turn it on/off. I don't use 10.8 but I believe the feature works the
 same in that version of OS X.</li><li>Use Apple's <b>Preview</b> program to view the document in full size [actually displayed as a PDF but without having to save as one].</li></ul>
<br />
I believe it may be the latter of those options that you're unable to locate. In OS X 10.6 there was a
<b>Preview</b> button at the bottom of the Print dialog window -- right next to the
<b>PDF</b> button. As I understand it, that button was eliminated in the OS X 10.8 Print dialog window. You now have to click the PDF button &amp; select
<i><b>Open PDF in Preview</b></i>.<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=link&amp;apdid=mchlp1049&amp;viewlocale=en_US&amp;bookId=133741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Preview a document before you print</a>

<h2>            Picture vs Name in Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>i have an issue that popped up recently. my user and most users in our environment have the option for a picture in the top right corner in office 365. the alarm notification, settings button, help button then a picture or a space to place a picture.&nbsp; picking
 the picture or icon will bring in&nbsp;a drop down menu with the pic, name and logon info next to the pick. under the pic a "change" hyperlink. and then 3 menu options... "about me", "view account" and "sign out".</p>
<p>recently a user pointed out to me that they could not change their picture... in looking everything is setup similar but in the top right there is no picture... only the users name. so across the top you have alarm, settings, help and their name with a pull
 down.&nbsp; picking the pull down shows the name and logon info and then the about me, view account and sign out... nothing for the picture.
</p>
<p>i have tried the following...</p>
<p>1. different browsers.</p>
<p>2. different themes.</p>
<p>3. different computers both on the lan and off.</p>
<p>i'm not finding much in my searching on this. any help would be great.&nbsp; here's what i'm seeing to better explain.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>It happens sometimes in Office 365 where the link called: change, under the picture is not visible, once you go to your Mail, you will see the link, and you can change the picture. I guess it's something related to that if you go to the homepage of O365
 (portal.office.com) for the first time after logging in, that link won't be available, until you go to another page.

    <title>Remove Header Sections - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heather36  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove Header Sections</h2>
                    <p>I am working in a 93 page document, that I need to reformat and insert new information. Unfortunately in this 93 page document, it has about 50 different Header sections. I've gone through and deleted all of the headers since they will change as I make changes
 to the document, but all of the sections remain. How can I delete the sections? This applies to the footer as well. There are obviously just as many footer sections. Is there a way to do it all at one time?
</p>
<p>What's happening is that I will want the same header on each page, but I have to at this point, go to each section and type it. What happens if my company wants a change made, I will have to do it 50 times. And then deal with the footers. :(
</p>
<p>Please help. </p>

<br />
The OP's document has 50 Sections. Every Section in a document has 3 headers and 3 footers, any one or more of which may or may not be linked to the previous Section. How many times do you suppose the OP would have to do this on a 50-Section document?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, the OP&nbsp;is asking how to combine the Sections, not how to delete headers &amp; footers... Deleting the Section breaks, which can be done via Find/Replace, will address that issue and is also the simplest way of getting rid of all the unwanted header/footer
 content, whilst at the same time ensuring every Section has the same page layout. the only issue that might need addressing is the need to ensure the page layout &amp; headers/footers from the first Section are preserved. For that, see:

            <span>1.&nbsp; There is no way to move the scroll bar to the left side of your screen.<br />
2.&nbsp; You'd need to install a mobile browser to the device - there is a mobile version of Firefox in the works, but nothing is available at this time) and the mobile version of IE is not available to be downloaded and installed to the device.&nbsp; But truthfully,
 Opera Mobile is really the best mobile browser for windows mobile devices at this time, so why would you want to use something different?

            Actually, the best windows mobile browser out there is Skyfire. goto <a href="http://www.skyfire.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.skyfire.com</a> it works awesome on my HTC Touch Diamond. It pulls up the full page just like on your computer. Myspace, Youtube, you name it. It will pull it up and works and functions just like your desktop.

    <title>Cannot compose a new Outlook 2013 email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sky_runner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot compose a new Outlook 2013 email</h2>
                    <p>This evening I was in the middle of writing&nbsp; an email using Outlook 2013 when it froze</p>
<p>I restarted Outlook. When I clicked on &lt;New Email&gt; the new email window is created but I cannot get to it.</p>
<p>If I reply to an email I can type my reply in the reading pane but if I click on &lt;Pop Out&gt; I can see the new window is created (by looking at the window previews by hovering over the Outlook Icon on the taskbar) but I cannot get to the email window.</p>
<p>I have deleted my mail account and recreated it</p>
<p>I have done a full repair of Office.</p>
<p>I have restarted the PC each time.</p>
<p>I still have the same problem</p>
<p>I am also unable to open an email in its own window by double clicking it, though I can read it in the reading&nbsp;pane&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I run in safe mode the problem is not there. I have disabled add ins (just bitdefender) but when I reopen in normal mode the problem is back.</p>

    <title>I deleted my Insider Preview..now what&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nramjieawan  say:</h3>
<h2>            I deleted my Insider Preview..now what&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I signed up for the windows insider program and installed the insider preview of windows 10.&nbsp; After using it for a couple of weeks, I removed it and installed Ubuntu.&nbsp; I mainly installed the preview build to reserve my copy of win 10.&nbsp; However I deleted
 Ubuntu and installed a copy of windows 8.1.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to the insider preview site to try and reinstall the preview version of windows 10 but it say's they are not currently accepting any more PC because windows 10 is nearly complete.&nbsp; Also I cannot install the get windows app from the store, it
 keeps saying I cannot add features to this edition of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I screwed?&nbsp; Will I still be able to get my version of win 10 or no?&nbsp; Also it's worth noting that the serial key I am currently&nbsp;using is an enterprise key that I kind of got from someone I know in IT.</p>

            I believe Enterprise upgrade will need to be a pay for, Home and Pro will be free.
