    <title>Movie Maker transitions disappear when video is added - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a&#43;k-pop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie Maker transitions disappear when video is added</h2>
                    After I browse videos/photos and add them to my Movie Maker project most of my transition options disappear as soon as I choose a file. The basic options are there and there is nothing wrong with them when I use them but it's frustrating that my options
 are suddenly limited for no apparent reason. It does the same whether I add a photo or video, though I mostly use it to edit videos (mp4)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I left screen shots in case I'm not explaining well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can't find an answer online easily because when I try to google it most of the complications are transitions not saving properly, I just want to have the options to even use them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping out!<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39e70e3b-6f8c-426a-8d9c-32699ca60e99" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/715270f2-dbc5-4ba8-9e57-315e65f47919" />

            You don't have a problem... when you select the first clip in the project your choices are limited.&nbsp; Add a second clip, select it and the full set of options will be there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transitioning from blackness doesn't work except for a handful of choices.

<h2>            PBR Image drive almost full</h2>
                    <p>Bought new pc a month ago with Windows 8, and during set up was invited to upgrade to Windows 10, and did so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that the PBR Image drive (E) shows 737GB free of 8.63GB, and is showing red,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking into the drive, I've a few files with most of the stuff:&nbsp; Dell/Image/install.swm (3.4GB), and Dell/Image/install2.swm (4GB).&nbsp; I also have two other files with the same volume: /Preload/base.swm (3.5GB) and /Preload/base2.swm (4GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I leave this drive as is, or am I going to get a warning some time soon?&nbsp; Anything I should do?&nbsp; Looking at other threads, I don't particularly see a solution.</p>

            <p>Hi Niall,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We would be glad to help you with the issue you are facing today. I understand the difficulty with the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10 includes a feature called Push-Button Reset that gives you options for returning your PC to a known configuration. You can use this to recover
 from a problem, or to return it to the factory state. This can be handy if you are selling a PC, or giving it to another member of the family and want to give them a fresh start.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Push Button Reset provides two options:
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
•Refresh your PC without affecting your files <br />
•Remove everything and reinstall Windows </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Since the error states "PBR Image (X) device shows red and that it is almost full" it means that the recovery partition is running out of space. If you have
 added files on recovery partition please remove and try adding more space to the recovery partition.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Shutting down your computer daily </span></span><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">will increase the life of the computer because your components will get less wear and tear. When the computer is on, every component is getting power and the temperature
 of the memory chips, graphics card, etc. are higher than if the computer were off. If your computer does absolutely nothing at night (downloading, converting, backing up, etc.), then there really is no reason to keep it on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">If you don’t use any power-saving modes, then it’s a really good idea to shut your machine down. Power saving modes like turning off a monitor or hard disks or putting the computer to sleep are almost as good as shutting down,
 but if you don’t have those enabled for whatever reason, then shutting down is essential.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">Lastly, leaving a computer on will consume more power, especially if it’s a desktop and does not go into a power saving mode like sleep!</span></p>

<p>Windows Live mail has been discontinued by Microsoft and as Windows 7 will also be dropped by Microsoft later this year (not supported any more in Jan 2020) I would suggest that you start to look for a new machine before that date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should still be able to use your email by going to the website&nbsp; live.com or Live.co.uk and log in that way.</p>
<p>

<p>Anyone else experienced electric shocks from the wired controller? My tv screen flashes black and sends a quite powerful electric shock to the controller (left side of it). Wireless, the tv screen just flashes black, obviously without the shocks... After
 the flashes, everyhing is back to normal, no reboots or error messages.</p>
<p>Since it's no longer under warranty Microsoft refuses to do anyhing about it. Just hope the the house won't burn down or my heart stops due to a faulty xbox...</p>

<p>It sounds like you do have a problem that needs the service center. Just because its not under warranty does not mean that they won't fix it, its just going to cost you for the repair. I believe the fee is $90, which is a lot less then a new xbox.</p>

    <title>Thanks, NetherRealm.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valorik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thanks, NetherRealm....</h2>
                    
<p>...Thanks for killing what little dwindling interest I had left in this game by having incompetent code-monkeys who can't even upload updates and new characters who aren't utterly gamebreaking. I got all the new DLC save for the Season Pass. First time I
 tried to use Skarlet in&nbsp;Training Mode? Game froze up completely. Second time it let me use her fine, but then after I backed out and tried to go into Training Mode with another character ... suddenly all my alternate costumes were gone. I went to the Nekropolis,
 yet it still showed all the alternate costumes and such. Went to the Krypt, it still showed I had everything unlocked. Went back to Training Mode AGAIN ... sure enough, doesn't even give me the option to select alt costumes for ANYONE.<br />
<br />
So...short of deleting the entire game from my HD and restarting, I don't see how I'm supposed to fix this. **** this, and **** you NetherRealm for making us wait an eternity for DLC that's not only subpar but also totally bones any and all progress you've
 made up to this point. I'm goin' back to SSF4. &gt;_&gt;</p>

<p>**** "calming down." I'm utterly sick and tired of these incompetent programmers who make us wait forever for crap, and when it finally DOES come out it's STILL FUBAR garbage. Do they not TEST this crap at all before they give it the green light? Obviously
 not, because from what I've read this is a pretty widespread problem. There's no excuse for it. First NetherRealm can't even make the online code remotely adequate on release, and they make us wait like 2 months for a "patch" that ultimately seemed to break
 more than it fixed.<br />
<br />
You can "calm down" all you want because you boosted for your "My Kung Fu is Stronger" achievement. I was trying to get it legitimately through normal play (I know, I'm insane). So ... now my choices are either not play with any alt costumes at all until NetherRealm
 cleans up their mess (yeah, let's wait another 2-3 months for another gamebreaking patch, woo!), or I delete everything and start anew, which means the +100 hours of time I had put into mastering characters is null and void. And I'll tell you right now, I'm
 NOT starting over again with that.<br />
<br />
I'm one of the most patient people on the planet. I'll gladly wait an extra 6 months to a year for a game if it ends up better and more polished product in the long run, but when a dev makes us wait and wait and wait for crap that makes the product WORSE, I
 think I have all the right in the world to rage about it.&nbsp; If this is any indication of how NetherRealm is planning on handling themselves as a "professional business" then I'm done supporting these ****-ups. They strike me as a bunch of burn-outs with their
 heads stuck up their&nbsp;butts in 1991.</p>

<p>I understand the frustration actually, it's pretty bad. I don't play much online and I also only bought Skarlet solo, not the pack so I think I avoided a lot of issues but it's messed up for the rest. Hopefully a fix is sooner than we think. Not being able
 to use stuff you've purchased is retarded.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with anything you're complaining about? That literally makes no sense. Again, calm down and relax. Stop getting upset over nothing. You can still play the game. Nobody's stopping you. So you can't use your alternate outfits. You
 can still play, at least. Unless you think the game freezing once and having your alts disappear for a bit means you can't play it. I have no idea what your problem is. You make it sound like you froze once and you can't see your alts once or twice. Are you
 okay, honey?</p>

<br />
I refuse to believe you're really that daft.<br />
<br />
You got your My Kung Fu is Stronger achievement basically by boosting well before this "fix" came out. So you had nothing to lose really if this had happened to you and you had to delete everything and start over. So it's extremely easy for&nbsp;YOU to sit there
 and say "durrhurr calm down dude."&nbsp;As I said, I already put +100 hours towards getting that achievement, and now I either have to throw all that work away and start from scratch or sit on my @@@ and wait for them to conjure up another "fix."<br />
<br />
And stop acting like not being able to use the alternate outfits at ALL isn't a big deal. I paid over 1400 MPs for all the alternate outfits in SSFIV, so you better believe I'd be furious if something happened that prevented me from using them. I paid for the
 classic outfits in this and now I can't use them or any others. On some characters I used their alt outfits almost exclusively. So yes, it IS a big deal. The "LOL hay at least you can still play the game!" mentality is the weakest defense for a ***-up developer
 I've ever heard.

<p>It's not that big of a deal, though. Sorry, but it really isn't. You're letting this get to you way more than you're thinking. They'll fix it, just be patient and chill. Calm down, take a deep breath, and either don't play the game because you have to have
 your outfits or do play it. Honestly, you're making mountains out of mole hills now. Calling others daft isn't a great way with how you're sounding, either. Chill. It's just a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You aren't even explain why you suddenly have to delete your save for some random reason. What's going on there? Is it not loading at all? Is it corrupt? Did you just lose all your data? You only scream about not being able to use alts or having to randomly
 start over from scratch. Mind spilling more details? Honestly, this is real childish to get this upset at it. Yes, it is a bit irritating, but they'll fix it. Why let it get to you so bad? Summer not going well? You haven't really made any valid or knowledgeable
 points. Unless you meant to convey that you're upset you can't use an alternate outfit so that means you can't play and have to start over. That's what I gathered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe if you calmed down, realize it's not the end of the world, and explain yourself a bit better then I might understand and not think you're acting completely immature about it. Just calm down. It's only a game.</p>

<h2>            Marvall Avastar 350N slow downoload</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to gig speed internet at home and since doing so, my Surface Pro 2 has not been able to reach anywhere near the speeds of other devices in my home.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every other device in the house is getting 600mbps + for downloads, including my wife's
 Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; However, my download speeds max at about 30mbps.&nbsp; I updated drivers, cleared apps, and when none of that worked, went back to factory defaults and started over from scratch.&nbsp; Nothing has helped.&nbsp; On this one device, the download speeds are
 horrible.&nbsp; Upload speeds are unaffected, however, matching all of the other devices in the house at around 40mbps (faster than my downloads).&nbsp; I've worked with Comcast tech support and everything is fine on their end.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.

            Thanks for the quick answer.&nbsp; I thought there was probably a hardware issue since it was just the one, and that explains it.&nbsp; Yes, Comcast brought one of their xfinity gateways since my old router was not capable of 1gbps and voice.&nbsp; I was hoping there
 was a setting I was missing because I had good speeds on my own router, a Netgear AC1900.&nbsp; The night before the tech arrived, they had already switched on the higher speed and I was getting roughly 150mbps on my Pro2.&nbsp; Still not as fast as my wife's Pro3,
 but pretty darn good.&nbsp; But as soon as the new modem was installed, my speeds went down and everything else in the house went up.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check Screen resolution that you only have one display. If the system thinks you have two screens it will open the folders where you can't see them - on a screen that isn't there.

            <p>Freaked me out.... I was having the same problem. I'd click on a folder and nothing happened. I started having Microsoft conspiracy thoughts, "well, I guess they've figured that it's time for me to get a new computer". "Warranty ran out and they're on to
 me". I went to a number of sites earlier with the problem and no luck.... After having a couple more psychotic episodes I decided to try again online. And there you were, "Folders in Windows 8 not opening - no error message" talking about double screens. I
 have double screens but don't always turn it on. I said to myself, "Self, it makes sense, lets turn it on". Lo' and behold, I be dipped in poop&nbsp;if they weren't there....*</p>

<h2>            How to retrieve files from an old XP drive onto new Windows 7 computer</h2>
                    
<p>original title:I added my old XP HD trying to retrieve files from it. Can't figure out how to retrieve old files that were on the HD using my new Windows 7 computer.__</p>
<p>I bought a desktop with Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; I want to retieve files from my old hard drive that was using XP Pro.&nbsp; The mother board went bad but the hard drive was still intact. I tried to add the old drive in as a second drive so I could possibly get the files
 off of it (Pictures, word docs etc.). Windows 7 doesn't see the files but sees the drive. It showed up with only 1000 or so MG of data. Those were not the files I was looking for.</p>
<p>How can I retrieve the Files off of my old XP drive using Windows 7? Is it possible?</p>

<p>No need to worry, these are forum spammers. They do not have your information.</p>
<p>Regarding the update, that is very odd. RS5 release builds aren't public yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most probably it is showing due to a glitch.</p>
<p>Try Resetting Windows update once and see if the message goes away:</p>

            Hi Alexandra,
<br />
<br />If you can connect the two hard dries to your PC at the same time and the new hard drive is of the same size or greater, then you can clone the old hard drive onto the new drive using free software like Macrium Reflect
<br />
<br />Then pull the old hard drive out and replace it with the new hard drive on the same SATA port on your motherboard and your PC should boot from that drive . ..

<p><em><strong>The following looks like a long story<strong> (it is only 600 words)</strong></strong></em>.<em><strong> I do not know what the user's overall knowledge is, and what exactly was already done. Thus the info goes through the motions
 of configuring and checking most of the common aspects of Windows OS' LAN features.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>----------------------</strong> </em></p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup </strong>= Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
<strong>Home Network or Work Network</strong> = Basically similar(and better) to the previous methods of<strong>WorkGroup</strong> sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>

<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><strong><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong> If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic.</p>
<p>If end up with the 3rd party software uninstalled or disabled, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network (</strong><strong>works very well if all computers are Win 7 too).</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>

<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . All users that are allowed to share need to have account on<strong>all the computers</strong> that they are allowed to connect to.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone</strong> is an account, it means a group of all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It is available to avoid the need of configuring permission to each on its own, it does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong>

<h2>            Windows not booting normally, only safemode and password not accepting to work in safemode</h2>
                    <p>First of, I will provide complete information here so please read fully before providing suggestions so that no ones time is wasted by suggesting things that have already been tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, as subject states, I am stuck at windows 10 64 bit safemode login ( with no password accepting so still at login screen) and no matter what I try, I cant get to normal login. (Hp envy 15 laptop with no networking port).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did I get here?</p>
<p>I was trying to install a program or something when it asked me to boot to safemode and I accepted and now I am just stuck here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What have been tried so far:</p>
<p>f8 key for boot option doesnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried advanced startup to start in safemode with network by holding shifting and restart click but since laptop doesnt have network port so cant have internet connection with networking cable and wifi is not working so still safe mode is not accepting password.</p>
<p>Tried using cellphone with usb tethering mode to provide internet so that my microsoft password may be accepted but tethering connection doesnt work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried booting into command prompt or system recovery but that too asks for password and not accepting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didnt have a local account ever since using laptop. So no local password exists and I have tried all the passwords that I could have used if there existed any local account but nothing was accepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me without letting me reinstall my OS as it was preinstalled and I dont have seperate product key plus I cant start from the scratch.</p>

            Hi Shu.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />See if you can get out of Safe Mode using Command Prompt:  <a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/it/get-windows-10-computer-out-of-safe-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/it/get-windows-10-comp...</a>
<br />
<br />To access Command Prompt without a password you will need to use bootable media.  
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore to see if that can get you back to a working point.  If not then use Command Prompt to run the command to exit Safe Modes.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />Skip the Product Key during install and it will reactivate with the Product Key embedded at factory, or the default version key if it has converted to a Digital License.  You can reinstall Windows as often as you want in any way you want and reactivate with the license it comes with.  
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hey Greg..&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, I am grateful for your quick and detailed response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just wondering, since the password problem is because safemode is unable to access internet to verify my microsoft account password, isnt there any way using which I can have access to internet in safemode, without network cable as my laptop doesnt
 have this port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Say,&nbsp; usb tethering from my cellphone using its network data? It would be way easier if there is any way without losing any of my data or arranging installation media etc?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you try Safe Mode with Networking? <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
You can also use bootable media to access Command prompt to enable the Built-in Administrator, sign into it to create a new Local Admin account, sign into it, move your files over, check all programs run from it or reinstall them as needed, then when ready
 delete the old account: <br />

<br />
But you'd probably save time and end up with a much better install that never goes through this again if you take the time now to invest in the Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">

<br />
You can even first try running HP Factory Recovery via the ESC key at boot, to see if that's satisfactory:</p>

<p>Greg you are not exactly helping me here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to install new OS and thats the last option so kindly just focus on how to get out of safe mode instead of guiding how to install new OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I told you that I tried safe mode with networking but my laptop doesnt have networking port to plug in cable directly from modem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have bootable usb and I accessed command prompt using shift-f10 key and tried enabling builtin administrative but that was already enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Used command prompt to get out of safe mode using the command " bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error was the specified entry identifier is not valid.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the command prompt using the command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>C:/windows/system32/bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For some people it might be current instead of default so if anyone else is stuck in the same situation as me, please use a bootable usb.&nbsp; Bootinto that, press "shift-F10 and use the command.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you select the drive where windows is installed and in the startup its not always C:/.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greg, I have explained what worked for me so you may edit accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a bootable USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Boot from USB at start-up. For this, for some people F12 may work for startup boot options. ( it was not working for me so i had to change boot sequence from BIOS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. After booting from USB, just press SHIFT and F10. Command Prompt will appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. In the command prompt, you have to select the drive where windows is installed.(in my case it was E: so the command goes “cd E:“)</p>
<p>5. Then final command will be,</p>
<p>
</p><p>E:/windows/system32/bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(For some people instead of {default}, {current} should work. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>thats it. Problem solved.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            WMP-11 doesn&#39;t recognize any device in Sync</h2>
                    WinXP, WMP-11<br />
<br />
Three different devices -- 2 Sandisk, 1 Creative -- show up in Win Explorer, and actually
<i>seem </i>to be recognized in WMP-11 in the bottom right-hand corner when initially plugged in. However, they don't show up in the "tree" on the left nor do they show up in the upper right side when I click the Sync tab.
<br />
<br />
All 3 of these devices have worked and shown up just fine in the past. I've uninstalled/reinstalled drivers, uninstalled/reinstalled WMP-11, gone through so many steps I can't remember them all. I'm stumped.<br />
<br />
I know I can drag and drop music, but wanted to sync some Playlists. Thanks in advance for any suggestions anyone can give me!<br />

            Almost a week and no replies? Somebody? Anybody? <br />
<br />
If no one has an answer, can someone recommend a better program than WMP? <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Sorry. I don't use WMP or know anything about syncing, I've always used Winamp for my MP3s. It's gotten really bloated lately but the installer lets you pick only what you want. Forget exactly but you probably have to pick custom install. It says on their
 page "The way you listen, watch, manage, &amp; <b>sync</b> your media" so I presume it syncs.<br />

</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>And follow these steps:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware</span></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span></strong><span><br />

<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Most antivirus will check the rar as well as ZIP. If needed you can open the RAR and then check<br />
the uncompressed contents before you run or open any of them.<br />
<br />
7-Zip is an excellent free program to open RAR and others<br />

<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>That "someone" is very much incorrect. A rar file is very much like a<br />
zip file; it's a condensed file or bunch of condensed files. And just<br />
like a zip file, it might contain a virus, or it might not. And the<br />
same is essentially true of almost every other kind of file: it might<br />
contain a virus, or it might not.</p>
<p>And just like a zip file, it's safe to open it and see what the files<br />
are that it contains.</p>
<p>And finally, having opened it, and now having the components files<br />
visible, you want to be using a good anti-virus program that looks at<br />
and checked those component files before running any of them.</p>

<p>Windows has no ability to open rar files. You need a third-party<br />
program to do it (here's one: www.win-rar.com). And your safety will<br />
come from your anti-virus program if you try to run a component file<br />
of the rar file.</p>
