    <title>Alert icon for my e-mail on Word and Excel documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harmfulwebsiste  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alert icon for my e-mail on Word and Excel documents</h2>
                    <p><span>I just noticed an "alert" icon (yellow triangle) on the top right of my Word and Excel documents. &nbsp;There is also one of those head silhouette icons (since I don't use a photo for my profile).
 &nbsp;When I hover over this, it says that I am signed in to my e-mail account. &nbsp;There is also a drop down menu when I click on an arrow.. &nbsp;The drop down says "Account Error. &nbsp;Sorry, we can't get to your account right now. &nbsp;To fix this, please sign in again." &nbsp;There
 is a "sign in" to click on, but when I click on it, a small blank window opens up with one of those horizontal lines like when the computer is showing something loading or showing the progress of something. &nbsp;The window closes and nothing happens. &nbsp;The drop
 down also has my name, my Outlook e-address and options: &nbsp;"about me, change photo, account settings, switch account". &nbsp;If I click on "account settings", the new page is "User Information" and under that is says "Account Error. &nbsp;there are problems with your
 account. &nbsp;To fix them, please sign in again. &nbsp;But I don't know where I'm supposed to sign in. There is also a small box to click on "Fix me". &nbsp;When I click on that, the same blank window with the "progress" line opens, then closes and nothing else happens.
 &nbsp;Also listed: &nbsp;my name, Outlook e-address, "change photo", "about me", "sign out", "switch account", a choice for "Office background" and "Office theme", Connected Services (OneDrive-Personal with my e-address). &nbsp;I have no idea why the icons appear on my Word
 documents and I don't know how to get rid of them. &nbsp;I also don't know what might be happening to my e-mail account because of this. &nbsp;Anyone else have this problem? &nbsp;Anyone have any suggestions of what I can do?</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand the issue better, you may provide us a screen shot of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Sign out and then sign into the Microsoft account and verify the results.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sign out from the application, do the following:</p>
<p>Open OneNote. Click on File and then click on Account.</p>
<p>Under User Information, click on Sign out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this fixes the issue. If you still have issues, you may reply and we’ll be happy to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you. &nbsp;I got this far before I posted here, but I got the message &nbsp;REMOVE ACCOUNT saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Removing this account will remove all customizations and documents and notebooks may no longer sync to the server. &nbsp;For this change to fully take effetc, log off/log in to Windows at the next opportunity. &nbsp;Do you want to remove the account now?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was afraid to proceed since I didn't know if this would affect my e-mail or other things on my computer. &nbsp;Will saying "yes" to Remove Account only affect One Note?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signing out from the Office 2013 applications will not affect e-mails. It would only disable the synchronization of Office applications with the OneDrive account you have used to sign in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you may try the suggestions in the previous post and check if it helps in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let us remove the login credential from the Credential Manager, after which restart the computer and then try signing into Office 2013 applications and verify the results.</p>

            <p>We too are seeing the same issue. &nbsp;We are federated with O365 using AD IDs and SAM 2 for authentication. &nbsp;If I select add a new account and add in the my same account the error goes away but will show again as soon as I launch another Office application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you seeing this when your system is off the corporate network. &nbsp;I was unable to reproduce when externally connected.</p>
<p>

<p>No, I have not done anything regarding this. &nbsp;Other than this little icon, my Office365 programs seem to be working perfectly. &nbsp;It's like that "Check Engine" light in your car. &nbsp;You know you need to do something, but as long as everything is running smoothly,

    <title>How do I paste source formatting AND attachments from an email into - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarah_sms  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I paste source formatting AND attachments from an email into calendar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to copy a&nbsp;message, view my calendar in week view to&nbsp;identify free blocks of&nbsp;time, select a&nbsp;block,&nbsp;and paste into that free block. When I do this, only unformatted text appears--I lose the attachments and message formatting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've asked this question in other forums and haven't had success. Here are the responses I've had and why they don't work:</p>
<p>1. Convert the message into an appointment-- This doesn't carry over attachments. It also doesn't allow me to easily see my week at a glance to see where I'll have a block of time. So it requires that I click back to inbox, copy attachments separately, click
 back to appointment, paste, then click over to scheduler and scroll through my week to see where my free blocks of time are. No.</p>
<p>2. Move to folder: Calendar--Same result as above. Plus then I don't have a copy in my inbox to respond to later in the week.</p>
<p>3. Reply as meeting--you get message formatting, but no attachments. Also now I have to select and delete all the members of my team who were copied on the email and are now in the To: line of my meeting invite to myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<p>Since you have&nbsp;listed the workarounds and already mentioned that they are not feasible, nothing much I can recommend.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may however right click on calendar and open it in a new window. </p>

            <p>What type of email account? If Exchange 2013 via Office 365, you can use a calendar app and see the calendar in a pane above the message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming it's not an outlook.com account since you apparently can add attachments- appointments are plain text and don't support attachments in outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Adding attachments is always going to be 2 steps unless you use Move/Copy to and add the message as an attachment. The exception is if the message is RTF formatted with the attachment embedded in the text. Then you can copy it with the text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You can't paste a selection into a date block - that pastes it in the subject field. You need to double click to open an appointment. No, it won't carry over the attachment. Solution: open the message, go to the calendar, select the date then you can
 copy or drag the message or attachments to the appointment form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Don't use Move to, use Copy. Or drag the message to the Calendar icon or name in the folder bar. (Right click and drag for several options) This opens a new appointment with the message inserted as an attachment. Switch to the calendar and pick a date
 then adjust the appointment dates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Click cancel meeting. This creates an appointment instead. &nbsp;Drag the attachment from the message to the appointment.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks Marcus,</p>
<p>It seems like such an obvious and standard function of use that I'm just baffled that it's not available!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I really the only person in the universe who blocks out time in my calendar to review documents that were emailed to me? Isn't it obvious that the easiest way to do this is copy email; alt-tab to calendar in separate window; select available time slot
 from week view, and paste? How is this basic function missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rant, I know. Thanks for your response.</p>

            <p>Thanks Diane,</p>
<p>This is an exchange account accessed through Outlook 2013 (Office). I don't use the web interface for normal work email unless I'm using a non-work computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work-around you suggest above seems even more complicated than just dealing with the lost formatting and going back to my original email once the appointment is made to copy over the attachments separately, which is what I'm currently doing. But I'm
 just amazed that this simple functionality is missing. To me it seems totally obvious, but I guess I'm a "unique" user.</p>

<h2>            CLIPART INSERT DOES NOT WORK OR INSERT CLIPART IS NOT WORKING</h2>
                    
<p>RE:&nbsp;&nbsp; OUTLOOK 2007&nbsp;&nbsp; (not 2003)</p>
<p>When I attempt to INSERT CLIPART into an email message I am sending, it inserts a WHITE SQUARE instead of the clipart picture.&nbsp; This is happening in Outlook only.&nbsp;&nbsp; Word is ok.&nbsp; It just started happening and I need a fix for this issue.</p>
<div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi4.social.answers.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fresources%2fimages%2ftrans.gif%3fcver%3d2.13.0068.4" /></div>
</div>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/889885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/889885</a></p>
<p>1)&nbsp; I tried this 889885 but then got another error and looked in the KB for other clipart issues; none came up.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; I registered all my MS Office when I originally obtained it and have not had an issue until 7/22/10.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; I tried to to go to MS support and none of those links work, which I don't understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be email or chat, at least.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; What I did is</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Open up Outlook 2007</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Open up a New Message, assign the name, subject, then start to write a message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; I have in the past been able to click on INSERT, CLIPART, and clipart would open.&nbsp; I cannot insert any pictures from Clipart Gallery or from a Word doc or from Photoshop (not even one; they are white squares).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can insert pictures by attaching
 them but not in the message itself which I do not understand since I have previously been able to do it</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; I then selected something like smiley or house,&nbsp; double clicked on it and it would go into the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Now it is inserting a WHITE SQUARE&nbsp; almost as if it has changed the properties of the picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; There is no way to see the picture.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes when you mouse over the picture it shows, but then it disappears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; It is almost like it is in the background with a WHITE SQUARE over it in the foreground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; I cannot find anything in any forums or KB regarding this particular issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9)&nbsp; Using Windows Home Basic Vista; MS Office Professional Plus 2007;&nbsp; have not had a previous issue; have plenty of memory , so why has this started all of a sudden.&nbsp; I ran Norton and no viruses.&nbsp; I ran Windows Defender and no issues found.&nbsp; I ran
 cleanup, registry cleanup, everything in Norton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 Tried opening Clipart Gallery; same results</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (11) I used Outlook Help, then Run Diagnostics and everything was ok, it said Continue for more support and none of the support worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problem sending Publisher created emails using Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>I did an email merge with Publisher and was told I needed to set-up Outlook.</p>
<p>I set up Outlook and tested its ability to send out and receive emails.</p>
<p>When send out the emails from Publisher (after they are merged) I get the message &nbsp;(in Publisher) that they have been sent out, but they do not get sent out. They do not appear in the Outlook Outbox or in the Sent folder. They don't seem to make from Publisher
 to Outllook. How do I fix this problem? I cannot seem to find a solution online.</p>
<p>I know Outlook is working okay because I can send out emails. Publisher says the emails have been sent. What is the solution?</p>
<p>Thank you!!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go to all of your browsers and clear them manually. Search it up on google and there should be some easy guides on how to do them on each browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if you are lazy like me and would like to do it in one swoop. Give CCleaner a try, once downloaded and opened, you'll see inside the Windows tab is Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, if you have other browsers, choose the Applications tab
 and your other browsers should be listed there. If you only want cookies and cache to be deleted, make sure you uncheck everything else from the other programs and only check cookies and cache(and probably history) from all your browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 from trial 365 account, associated in error to 2003 exchange, how to disassociate and start again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a 2003 sbs server currently providing exchange onsite, we are about to install a new server and switch over to Office 365. during the testing and set up&nbsp;bit I have created a trail 365 account and registered a domain with it.
</p>
<p>I've taken a windows 7 laptop created a new user (domain admin user)&nbsp;and downloaded office 13 to it for some testing. All was&nbsp;going fine, until during the set up Outlook, I have clicked on set up with the current domain associated we have&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e the unsupported
 exchange 2003)</p>
<p>Now when I click on the outlook icon, it opens two windows, one says </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>" The resource that you are trying to use is located on an unsupported version of Microsoft Exchange. Contact your email administrator for assistance."</p>
<p>the next says </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>" Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook Window. The set of folders cannot be opened . the file XXX is not an Outlook data file (.ost)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question, on the basis I know this and&nbsp;it was a user error, how do I reset the program&nbsp;so&nbsp; I can start again and&nbsp;associate it with the 365 account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried un-installing the whole office&nbsp;program and reinstalling it but the same thing happens</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not very techy (obviously I suppose)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can anybody help please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jon</p>

<p>Reinstalled Office 2013. Made suggested repair to Outlook 2013 (put into Win8 compatibility mode) and now all seems OK. Hoping that Win10 will automatically be compatible in the future with all Office 365 Home programs.</p>

    <title>Problem with new Blu Windows Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahurks10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with new Blu Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>Hello all~&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe someone can help ms solve this problem I'm having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this new Windows Phone (Blu Windows Phone: WIN JR LTE; http://www.bluproducts.com/index.php/win-jr-lte) not too long ago since my old one won't charge anymore and I really have to keep in touch with family for emergency reasons. Well anywho, recently
 my phone is doing the thing again with "Low Storage" and won't let me get into anything to actual delete some things. But I did figure it all out but it still says I'm low on storage after deleting so much. So what should I do? Should I troubleshoot or restart
 my phone a new? Or not download apps at all and just kick it old school to just "talk and text"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, lately every time I try to get on an app to use it, like to message or call, it'll act like it's going to open but it keeps continuously reverting to the home screen non-stop. How can I stop that also from happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love the windows phone a lot, but this Storage thing is becoming an annoying issue. It really needs to end with this low space problem; trying to avoid returning my new phone and getting a cheap android or iphone (i don't really favor apple products)</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER had on this<br />
machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
Check your Firewall to make sure IE is allowed through it. Are you using any spyware/security program that
<br />
works on the HOSTS file or DNS? SpyBot, SpywareDoc and others do this and can block IE.<br />
<br />
If no joy something maybe blocking it.<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessories - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />

<h2>            Wifi connection problems HTC Touch2</h2>
                    
<p>Im facing a very stange problem with my phone.<br />
<br />
I have wifi at home that i can connect and surf the net with my laptop at any time with no probs.</p>
<p><br />
Now with my HTC T3333 (touch2), i do get connected but i cannot surf the internet, unless i do a reset of my wifi modem. Now when i do reset and start surfing the net, and disconnect, in a few hours if i do try to get connected, i do get the same problem.</p>
<p>This problem is taking place for the last couple of months time. In the&nbsp;previous 10 months of T3333 ownership, everything was perfect.<br />
<br />
The thing is, i can get connected and do a web surf at any other wifi spot, secured or not, with no problems at other places...<br />
<br />
My modem was checked and it was found to be in perfect operating condition.<br />
<br />
I did a search in this forum and on XDA but i did not find any solution to my problem though.</p>
<p>Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Okay, so it's your wireless router that you have to reset.&nbsp; That's a totally different situation.&nbsp; This&nbsp;sounds as if your Wi-Fi router may be&nbsp;to blame and not your Touch2.</p>
<p>However, if you want to be sure it's not your device, I'd first double-check that there's no more firmware updates for your WI-Fi router.&nbsp; Also check the support forums to insure that the latest firmware update did not "break" anything.&nbsp; Sometimes you might
 have to go back and flash an older firmware ... rare, but sometimes this is necessary.</p>
<p>If that does not resolve this issue,&nbsp;I'd try resetting your Wi-Fi back to factory defaults and reconfiguring it.&nbsp; This will sometimes resolve connectivity issues.&nbsp; We have a router at work that we've had to do this with a few times.&nbsp; It doesn't really make
 sense because nothing has changed on it, but it seems to stop working.&nbsp; By doing a reset to factory defaults and reconfiguring, that works.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, I'd try deleting your home Wi-Fi network&nbsp;from your Touch2, soft reset and then try finding your network, reconfiguring it, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, if that does not fix it and your comfortable doing one, I'd try a hard reset of your Touch2.</p>
<p>If the hard reset does not work, it's probably time to purchase a new Wi-Fi router.</p>
<p>I hope this works!</p>

<h2>            Error 30175-11 at installing Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have Win 10. After the Update 1809, Office Pro 2016 was verry slow and Word did'nt work anymore. I waited for the current update KB4464330, but the problem is still there. I deinstalled Office Pro 2016 and tried to reinstall. But I got error 30175-11.
 The tool mentioned at https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Error-code-30175-11-when-installing-Office-31961485-40a7-4402-b13d-16344c4778e4 also did not help. I have a 64bit system and bought the 64bit Office Pro 2016, but when I entter my registry code
 at my microsoftsoft account to download Office, the 32bit (x86) version is downloaded. Installing a 32bit Version of Office 2010 also did not work, the installing just stopped without any error.</p>
<p>Thanks for help!</p>

            At this point, the only thing I can recommend is performing a clean install of Windows 10 1809 and then attempt reinstalling Office.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings (or press Windows key + i) &gt; click Update &amp; security
<br />
<br />Click Recovery then click Get Started under Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Since we are performing a clean install, I will be selecting the option Remove everything, if you don't want to do that, you can click Keep my files
<br />
<br />Reset offers two types of clean installs:
<br />
<br />Just remove my files - this option is quicker and recommended if you just want a fresh start and you plan to keep the computer.
<br />
<br />Remove files and clean the drive - if you plan to giveaway or resell your computer, this option ensures the computer is cleaned properly. Its takes a bit longer, but it is recommended if you plan to no longer use this computer.
<br />
<br />Since I will be using this computer, I will choose the first option.
<br />
<br />Click Reset to begin
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will restart
<br />
<br />Preparing to perform a reset
<br />
<br />Resetting - this might take some time depending on the amount of data
<br />
<br />Windows will check the drive for errors and fix them.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 performs a clean install again
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience (OOBE)
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience assist with personlizing your Windows experience such as creating a user account, connect to a wireless network and adjust privacy settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />Choose your country, language, keyboard layout and time zone then click Next
<br />
<br />Read and accept the End User License Agreement
<br />
<br />If you want to customize your privacy settings, you can do so now. Please note, you can always do this after setup (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy). For now, lets use Use Express settings
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 restarts
<br />
<br />Setup your username, password and a hint then click Next
<br />
<br />There you have it, a clean installation of Windows
<br />
<br />Proceed to reinstall Office.

<h2>            Should Microsoft Charge to Locate Lost Phone</h2>
                    
<p>The new update is quite nice, expecially the locate lost phone function. But is it really a good idea to charge for this service? I've test it and found that the location circle is too wide to locate the phone. I don't think I can find the phone within such
 a wide area. If I cannot find it, should I pay for it?</p>

            I think this is a good idea, I at least will know if I was at work, home, store, ect... It gives a rough idea where you placed the phone.. Once I left it in my car, the wife when to a friends house.. I would then know, aprox, where it is..I thinks this
 is great..! <br />

            Considering I work a mile from my home that would be a bit to large a radius even to find out if the phone is at home or work.
<div><br />
<div>If it uses IP based geolocation, they'll probably need muchos more time to have better data on WiFi access point locations and IP Locations (although for me that would never work since my home ISP can assign me IP's from just about everywhere in the flemish
 part of belgium.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or of MS gets help triangulating the phone from providers, 1 mile is probably as good as you'll get.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need to have a really good 3 tower fix to get decent resolution out of&nbsp;cell tower&nbsp;triangulation (yes, imagine that, CSI&nbsp;exaggerates&nbsp;the abilities of that technology :p)</div>

            Hi QPF, <br />
<br />
First off, thanks so much for using Microsoft My Phone!&nbsp; The location feature you're talking about uses GPS or cellular tower information for sending your phone's location to our service.&nbsp; If My Phone was able to get its location from GPS, you'll notice a pretty
 small circle of where your phone is, otherwise it uses the cell tower data for that information and produces a much wider circle.&nbsp; Over time we hope to have both methods of location working consistently to produce small circles of location.<br />

            My device has GPS working nicely. How does MyPhone get the GPS to work? Is it automatically? Or do I have to something (Like run a map with GPS to get fixed)?

            Could be that when your QuickGPS helper data is out of date, or your phone doesn't use GPS helpers like QuickGPS, the app doesn't get a GPS fix it can use before it times out trying to use GPS. Even on recent TomTom devices, if you don't update once a
 month or so, signal fix can run out to take minutes rather then instant or seconds. I doubt the app will wait minutes for a GPS signal fix.
<div><br />
<div>Or your phones GPS is simply incompatible for some reason, which I bet will be added along the way. Microsoft is king of supporting every imaginable device ya know.<br />
<div><br />
<div>If GPS really won't fix, it'll most likely switch to cell tower pinging, which gives the seen radius. Although I have to say that that 1 mile radius, if its a default average range used for cell tower location detection, can be quite incorrect if your
 in an area where there is little population and a low tower density, or a tricky geography, or so many other interference reasons.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Dunno what Microsoft is actually using, but there are multiple ways to triangulate a phones position using towers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can check what tower your connected to and give a radius around that.</div>
<div>You can check 2 towers and give an approximate location trough the overlaps of their ranges.</div>
<div>Or 3 towers with their overlap, each tower added making the location data more accurate, but considering in absolute best case a tower's range is like 50-70 km, the overlap region can be quite large.</div>
<div><br />
<div>With more advanced techniques, you can find&nbsp;approximate&nbsp;range from a tower by also&nbsp;calculating&nbsp;in the latency, narrowing the range you phone is away from a tower, depending on the geography and the amount of towers you get a signal from, you can narrow
 it down to near GPS accuracy, but only in best case scenario's</div>
<div><br />
<div>But considering how thin some providers spread their towers, the chances you get enough data from&nbsp;more then 1 tower gets slim.</div>

<div>I'm trying to find out how MyPhone works. So I've tested the following scenarios:<br />
<br />
1. Run GPS application and wait until it gets fixed. Start MyPhone ap-plication to sync. I go to website and be able to find phone in precise location.<br />
<br />
2. Run MyPhone in home to sync location, it gives me 1mile radius circle.<br />
<br />
3. Run MyPhone&nbsp;in&nbsp;open area&nbsp;to sync location without running any GPS application, it also gives me 1mile radius circle.<br />
<br />
When I sync with my location.&nbsp;Will MyPhone try to start GPS and get fixed, or it just gets location data which is already exists in the phone? Will MyPhone try GPS, if failed, then switch to GSM cell tower location?</div>

            Thats not really what he asked MPalos,
<div><br />
<div>He asks if the GPS module needs to be initialized by another application before MyPhone can use GPS data, or if MyPhone inits the GPS module by itself trying to get a fix.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just checked myPhone location for my telephone and as I set in the settings to upload location data to MyPhone with every sync, it shows the location of the phone during the last sync within a radius of about 7 meters, which is clearly GPS (although
 its a bit of since it shows my work location while I was at home sleeping when the phone synced at 0:03 am .. so I guess it got that GPS fix somewhere during the day yesterday and sends that location, rather &nbsp;then the actual current one when doing the sync)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also need to note that i can't help test the find my phone Premium function because Belgium (+32) isn't listed in the listing where you can set your phone number.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And finaly, sync schedule is 1ce a day maximum, could that be expanded?</div>
<div>When I'm working on location at a client, which are usually under construction locations, I tend to input a whopping lot of data in the phone, both email traffic, phonecalls, sms and pictures.</div>
<div>Would be nice if the syncing happend more often so that I don't loose all my data or have to wait for a long sync during the evening.</div>

    <title>Adding different reps and weight for the same exercise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trevorshort20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding different reps and weight for the same exercise</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying at one of my workouts to the Health Dashboard.&nbsp; For this workout what I do is I have a different set of reps and weights for the same exercise.&nbsp; How would I add this to my Dashboard?&nbsp; It seems that I need to add the same exercise 3 times?&nbsp; Is
 there a simpler way to do this where I just add the one exercise only once? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Example.</p>
<p>Incline Bench Press:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Set #1:&nbsp;&nbsp; 120 lbs for&nbsp;6 reps</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Set #2:&nbsp;&nbsp; 140 lbs for 3 reps</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Set #3:&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 lbs for 12 reps or fail</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in order for me to add this to my workout, I need to add the Incline Bench Press 3 times and give each of them only 1 set with the respective reps and weight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, can I just add the Incline Bench Press exercise and then for each "set", I give the number of reps and the weight?&nbsp; Is there a way?&nbsp; It seems to be that the Health Dashboard assumes that you'll be doing # sets with the same number of reps with the
 same weight.&nbsp; In most cases in my workouts, that is not the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for any help.</p>

<h2>            My nokia x2 wont connect the internet on applications&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My <strong>NOKIA X2</strong> wont connect the internet on<strong> applications</strong>.
<strong>However </strong>it will connect normally to the <strong>browser feature,&nbsp;</strong>and I can surf the web no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for things like<strong> apps</strong> E.g.. The <strong>OVI store</strong>, and
<strong>Facebook</strong>, it wont connect. All that happens is the little<strong> [G]</strong> flashes on and off in the top left corner. Normally it would just stay
<strong>on</strong>. I have tried changing packet data settings, but that was <strong>
unsuccessful</strong>. So was re-downloading my settings from my <strong>service provider.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in short,<strong> Help</strong>. Its <strong>not a serious</strong>&nbsp;problem, and I'm<strong> not
</strong>gonna be throwing my phone away for the sake of this, but its just a bit
<strong>annoying</strong> when I can't access any <strong>application</strong> that requires the
<strong>internet.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thank you for the repay.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually the problem was not due to mistake in access point. It was due to the corrupted phone software. Today I approached Nokia Care and they reinstalled the software. Now the problem solved. ﻿</p>

<h2>            Error in loading DLL received when running a userform in Excel for Mac</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I created a userform on a PC using ActiveX controls that has multiple comboboxes, text fields and check boxes along with a command button.&nbsp; This is being sent to multiple users as a survey and one or two have replied that they are running Excel for Mac 14.3.8
 and are getting a <i><b>Error in loading DLL</b></i> error.<br />
<br />
Is there something I need to do to the form itself or a setting that the user needs to turn on in order to make this work?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            You can't do that directly. You need to use VBA to grab the text box contents and put it in a cell.<br />

<p>Hi There.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it is not possible to install Microsoft Edge on Windows 7, unless there is a way I don't now about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"internet explorer 12" is Microsoft Edge, and ME is only available from Windows 10 and up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or am I not understanding your question correctly?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Do not want our students to auto-upgrade Office 365 Proplus - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Do not want our students to auto-upgrade Office 365 Proplus &#40;Office 2013&#41; on their home computers</h2>
                    
<p>We do not want our students to auto-upgrade Office 365 Proplus (Office 2013) on their home computers. &nbsp;Is there a way to stop this when February 9, 2016 starts to do this? &nbsp;Some of the students that have and/or will need to download Office will need the
 2013 version for their class work and not 2016 yet. &nbsp;I do not feel we should have our students editing their own registries on their home computers. &nbsp;Why doesn't Microsoft give the the option to upgrade or not for our school and not auto-upgrade to 2016? &nbsp;Give
 us the option to download both versions and let the student pick the 1 they will need for their classwork.</p>

<p>Hi Sheryl,</p>
<p>To prevent users from&nbsp;upgrading Office 2013 to Office 2016, I’d like to share with you the following articles:<br />

<p>About your requirement to provide an option to upgrade or not, it’s a good idea, we suggest you submit it to the Uservoice, which is the best way to make our product and service better for you and others.<br />

<p>Thank you Kerwin. &nbsp;I have already reviewed those and they are not good solutions for students to do on their own personal computers at HOME. &nbsp;These computers are not on our domain. Just to be clear, this is the option for students and faculty to download
 and install Office for free on their home computer while they re registered for classes or teach at our college.
