<strong>Next</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Click the operating system that you want to repair and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options &gt; Startup Repair.</strong></p>

<h2>            forgot password to my email linked to my live account</h2>
                    In order to sign in my xbox live I need to sign in with my email and password because of this "proofs" thing. Problem with that is I do not know the password to the email address and the email address is an aol account that has not been active in years.
 Whenever I try to do the password recover using a new email it sends the reset link to the inactive aol email? Am I missing something here? How can I fix this issue? Very frustrated long time xbox live user here who has never had sign in issues before you
 started using "proofs".

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model no. of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that you get the error, "Sorry this PC Doesn't meet the hardware requirements" for your graphics card. This could be an incompatibility issue with the display driver installed in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I would suggest you to run the hardware and devices troubleshooter on the system and check if there is any issue with the display adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter: <br />
a. Press “Windows key + W”.<br />
b. Type “Troubleshooting” without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
c. Select “Hardware and Sound” from the Troubleshooter Window.<br />
d. Select “Hardware and Devices” under Devices option.<br />
e. Follow the On Screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, refer to the detailed specifications for the system to get Windows 10 installed:</span></p>

<h2>            Booting into Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey again. My Dell XPS 8930, only one year old, is giving me fits. It will get to screen with Windows logo and spinning dots, but will go no further. Ive tried everything I have read or heardto try to fix this, but to no avail. Its maddening! &nbsp;Once, for
 about one second, a screen flashed up that said “Inaccessible boot drive”. &nbsp;Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this, or at least retrieve my files that are stuck in the computer and are not backed up? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, folks, for any ideas!!</p>

            Hi Ronny.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Ronny.,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />If available, this is the best option
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>1) What are the status of the files on the computer?</p>
<p>a) Had the files been backed up to another drive or to the cloud?</p>
<p>b) Had a backup image been made and saved to another drive or to the cloud?</p>
<p>c) If you had to perform a reset save files or equivalent (reinstall drivers and applications) would that be a viable fix?</p>

<p>Hi, Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. Unfortunately, part of the problem is that my computer will not boot into Recovery Environment. The reboot is in a loop from Dell logo and spinning dots, to Windows logo and spinning dots, to an automatic reboot, then back to Dell
 logo and dots. Pressing vigorously and repeatedly on F2 or F12 at power on will get me to other screens about BIOS and setup, but adjusting those things does absolutely nothing. The hard shutdown doesnt help. Thanks again, Andre!</p>

            1. You may need to Edit Boot Options 
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/editing-boot-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a>
<br />2. Remove any recently added Hardware
<br />3. Check if firmware is incompatible with Windows 10. Open PowerShell (Admin) and run the following command. This is an old method for checking and may be outdated.
<br />
<br />schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser"
<br />
<br />4. If you recently added a driver, restart the computer and enter Advanced Boot Options Menu.
<br />Select Last Known Good Configuration
<br />5. Run Chkdsk /f /r to check hard drive corruption
<br />
<br />6. Use Easus Data Recovery for Windows to Recover Files. It's Free.
<br /><a href="https://www.easeus.com/data-recovery-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/data-recovery-software/</a>

<br />7. When finished, Create a Recovery USB for Windows 10
<br />Choose to keep Nothing in order to perform a Clean Install of Windows

<br />If you cannot sign in online to do this or on the PC, you'll need to reset the PC by going into Repair Mode as shown here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />It may be necessary to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install since it relies on it's own files and drivers and not those onboard WIndows that may already be corrupted.  
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Troubleshoot Options, then  try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />If you need to rescue your files use this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h2>            is052 error installing brother mfc-j6710dw printer</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently purchased this Brother printer (MFC-J6710DW) and installed it on my wireless network at home. I connected it to the router wirelessly using WPS and had no problems with it. However, installing the software has not been so great. I receive a
 is052 error during the install which has to do with a "block" while installing the printer/scanner drivers. The only thing Brother has been able to help with is stating that it's usually a 3rd party antivirus software causing the issue. I have gone as far
 as uninstalling my antivirus and it still will not install the drivers. One other issue I thought may be from registry entries, so I ran Wise registry cleaner and still the drivers won't install. I have fought this for 2 days and with no luck.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I considered going into safe mode and trying it but for some reason, hitting F8 isn't allowing the boot options menu to come up. I think i changed something a while back but I don't remember what was changed, but I do remember that boot menu not
 coming back up on startup .... Brother is telling me I need to contact Microsoft because it sounds like a registry issue somewhere. Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            Thank you Abdul!
<div><br />
<div>I have found no other problems installing or uninstalling other programs, I haven't made any changes in quite some time. In fact, I haven't had a printer for almost 2 years. It was an HP printer but the software uninstalled ok and the install/uninstall
 fix-it link you provided didn't find any other issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I moved on to the clean boot... but the error still remains. This error occurs with both installation from CD-ROM and the Full Driver and Software Package downloaded from the website. It also fails at the same exact time and place and as I mentioned before,
 Brother only says it's usually an antivirus causing the problem. I eliminated that chance by uninstalling the antivirus all together until this is repaired.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you again for your help</div>

            After a week of emails to Brother, and receiving endless redundant references to the is052 article they have listed on the website, I received a call (2 days after they said they would call me) and guess what... they verbally gave me the same exact information
 on the article. So if there isn't anything else you guys can think of, I'll be returning this product and going with another brand.

            That is NOT the answer! If you will refer to my intial post, I have completely uninstalled my antivirus software and disabled Microsoft's firewall. I have not been able to install these drivers, including doing a safe boot to ensure no third party software
 is blocking the install but all attempts have failed.

            I'm having the exact same problem with a Brother MFC-7820N fax/printer/scanner : the error I get when installing the drivers and software (downloaded from the Brother website) is IS052 InstallNetworkDriver. The only advice you get on the Brother website
 is disabling your antivirus and firewall. But I have no antivirus and the firewall is already disabled.<br />
Is there something else to try ?

            Hi Debby, 
<br />
<br />Have you deleted items from both your Windows Temp Directory and your App Data directory? 
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\Temp - ctrl + a and delete the contents. 
<br />
<br />C:\Users\YOURACCOUNT\App Data\Local\Temp (If AppData doesn’t display, go into control panel, file explorer options, and make sure show hidden files / folders is checked off”
<br />
<br />Delete these 2 locations, and see if you have enough free space. If still no luck. Go here - <a href="https://windirstat.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windirstat.net/</a> and download WinDirStat. It shows you exactly where data is being stored, so you can then choose to move that data to another drive (Ex. Documents Folder, Misc random folders, etc)

            Hi Debby.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First off, is this an error for a drive other than C because if so that is another issue where Recovery partition is given a drive letter in the last version Update which causes it to show low disk error.  
<br />
<br />If not then I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips here for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root including C:\$Windows.~BT.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            What size is your HD?  Many people have been reporting the same problem with portable devices that have only 32GB drives.
<br />
<br />If you have a 32GB drive almost the only work around is to do a "clean install" of the newest Windows Update (Version 1803).  After that, use my "Decrap" tips to free up space on your HD. Also use the tips to install as many peripheral apps as you can to the external drive, and save data files to the external drive.
<br />
<br />32GB DEVICES ARE TOO SMALL …
<br />
<br />If you have a 32GB drive, you have my condolences (I just barely dodged that particular bullet myself). 
<br />
<br />MS says that Windows 10 only needs 20GB to install, making a 32GB drive appear adequate. 
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a>
<br />
<br />But, in the “real world” that is not the case. MS and computer builders like to add “free sample” software (aka "crapware").  Over time, add some Windows updates, and system checkpoints and oops, you very quickly no longer have the 6-8GB of space required to do the major spring/fall updates.
<br />
<br />Go to this Feedback and upvote it and do ADD your comments:
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/Vgqfjb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/Vgqfjb</a>
<br />
<br />MS has marked it “We’ve got it”, but that is not enough. They need to be “encouraged” to produce a publicly documented fix for the problem they have created. One option is to recreate a "small drive" version of the Win 10 install that installs core features then prompts you for additional requirements specific to your machine and usage.
<br />
<br />Why did MS do this? Don't forget that Windows 10 has been in development for several years prior to it's release in 2015.  So back then, 32GB of SSD was still very expensive. AND, the initial versions of Win 10 were able to get by on 32GB for the first year or slightly more.  But now, due to "feature creep" it simply is not enough
<br />
<br />The wiki / article (next link) includes many tips and techniques you can use to free up space on your drive.
<br />
<br />Or, you can bite the bullet and do a clean install the current Windows Versions. In the long run, even with re-installing lost applications it may be faster that fritzing around trying to free up enough space.
<br />
<br />If you have this problem, please vote on this feedback to MS: <a href="https://aka.ms/Ilgpij" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/Ilgpij</a>  I am asking that they make repeat update failures a more urgent warning message.

<br />When your PC has limited storage space, or you simply want to keep things separate, use this guide to install or move apps to a different drive on Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />#3 Move as many data files as possible to external drives or the "cloud", ie OneDrive"
<br />
<br />#4 After you get the new version installed work through the tips in the next Wiki to do an "extreme" cleanup to free up space. The problem with this is that it is temporary. If you delete system elements, Windows will tend to replace them in subsequent updates.

<br />#5  I've am just learning about the "CompactOS" feature.  It is a feature that allows you to install Windows in a compressed format.  Depending on the specifics of your installation this can save up to 5GB of space.

<br />2017 05 01- COMPACTOS, SINGLE-INSTANCING, AND IMAGE OPTIMIZATION
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/compact-os" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a> 
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />You can now compress the files for the entire operating system, including your preloaded desktop applications. Compact OS lets you run the operating system from compressed files (similar to WIMBoot in Windows 8.1 Update 1), and single-instancing helps you run your pre-loaded Windows desktop applications in compressed files. The new processes helps maintain a small footprint over time by using individual files, rather than combining them in a WIM file.
<br />
<br />Here's some ways to shrink the image, optimize the image, and some considerations when deploying to low-cost devices.

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t play, rip, or recognize any audio cd&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t play, rip, or recognize any audio cd&#39;s</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 10 and now when I put a cd in the drive it won't play them or even recognize that there's a cd in the drive. Windows Media Player would always play the cd and I would use that program to rip music. Even File Explorer doesn't
 even list or recognize that there is a cd in the drive. I have new cd's that I want to rip into my computer and I cannot and it's really starting to frustrate me. Is anyone else having this problem? Does anyone have a solution or have a suggestion on how to
 fix this issue?

            With this issue worded differently, an "Insider" posted a response that one just need to search for, then run Windows Media Player. But I and the rest (143 complainers in the other thread and 126 in this one) have found that has no bearing on the fact
 that with Windows 10, the computer will NOT recognize that a CD is even in the drive. That has just obsoleted thousands of dollars worth of music CDs in my collection. F(*&amp;%-Off Microsoft!!!!!!!! Windows 10 is STILL NOT NEAR as good as Windows XP was 15 years
 ago. Progress is not necessarily in a forward direction.<br />

            I have not had a problem with a bought copy of windows 10. When I changed from windows 7 to windows 10 in the free upgrade, That is when I had problems. THE UPGRADE did not recognise my dvd burners in my P.C. And when I went back to windows 7,That is what
 you can do if your not happy with Windows 10. It came up on my screen ,That my copy of Windows 7 was a counterfeit copy, which it wasn't because I had bought a new P.c from a proper dealer with Windows 7 already installed on it. So if you buy a copy of Windows
 10 direct from Microsoft, It should be o.k.

<p>
</p><p>My Lenovo laptop came with Win 10. It's never figured out audio cd's, either playing them or ripping them. VERY frustrating. I feel ripped off. It also struggles to figure out DVD's but I've figured out round-about ways of getting it to "find" the dvd disk
 and play it.&nbsp;</p>

            While I truly hate this answer.... I've had some success with iTunes. &nbsp;The external drives I'm using won't show anything in Media Player (though they'll play after a reboot but without a track listing) but in iTunes they seem to be working fine.

                    <p>original title: WMP starts when trying to open MKV files without playing the clips</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi </p>
<p>I'm having some strange issue lately.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm using &nbsp;KMPlayer as my default media player &nbsp;and Win7 Codecs by Shark007(for other players that don't come with integrated codecs).</p>
<p>I usually use the integrated codecs within KMPlayer and everything works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, for some time now every time now, when I'm trying to open a MKV file, it opens WMP, without running the clip, just like double clicking on WMP shortcut.</p>
<p>The default app for opening MKV files is KMPlayer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried using Open with -&gt; KMPlayer but it didn't work. If I try this with other player, it works just fine.</p>
<p>Also, this is only happening with MKV files.</p>
<p>I also tried to reset the default app for MKV files and to reinstall KMPlayer but this also didn't work out.</p>
<p>And trying to open MKV files without KMPlayer installed (WMP set as default player) changes nothing.</p>
<p>I'm not having this issue with other video file formats.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 7 SP1 x64 Pro, up to date and the latest version of KMPlayer and Win7 Codecs.</p>
<p>Any ides?<br />

            <p>The process for creating and using the media repair kit was easy to follow however it did not work.&nbsp; After booting from a USB drive I created, found the startup repair.&nbsp; After several minutes got a message saying "Startup repair couldn't repair your PC".&nbsp;
 Sadly there was nothing wrong with my PC until the automatic conversion to W10.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Sticky Notes is a default program and you need not uninstall it to install the other app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, you can delete the application:</p>
<p>Press Windows key+R</p>
<p>Type in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %systemdrive%\Windows\system32</p>
<p>Locate the file StickyNot.exe and delete it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for replying! Now I would like to know how to change the permissions for viewing certain folders and deleting that App? I cant view the hidden folder "WindowsApps" and Im not getting an option to edit any of the "Groups or user names" security
 settings.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Michael</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend that you do not bother removing the StikyNot.exe file. The file is less than 0.5 MB and will not interfere with the Sticky Notes 8 app from the Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing permissions on System Folders is not recommended and can compromise security&nbsp;and&nbsp;other problems on the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I do agree with Ronnie that the StikyNot file need not be removed and will not cause a hindrance in your new app.</p>
<p>Anyways, by now I assume that you really want to delete it.</p>
<p>To gain permissions to delete, rename and modify, first of all, you need permissions of the drive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right- click the drive and select properties.</li><li>Browse to the Security Tab.</li><li>Click edit.</li><li>Select your user or Users and check the box for Allow for Full control</li></ol>
<p>Next, you need to verify that the file/folder is not set to read- only.</p>
<p>Right- click the file or folder and select Properties.</p>
<p>Uncheck the box besides read only if checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now viewing hidden files is easy as 1-2-3</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the location of the hidden file/ folder. In your case browse to %systemdrive%\Program Files.
</li><li>In the view tab at top, in the group Hide/Show, check Hidden files.</li><li>This should make the WindowsApps folder visible in a faint color.</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 Firewall will not save changes</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I make any changes in Windows 10 firewall after a few seconds they automatically revert back without any input from me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 Examples:</p>

</p><p>When I add a program to be allowed through, after a few seconds it disappears from the list and is blocked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I switch Windows Firewall off after a few seconds firewall switches back on again.</p>

<h2>            My Turtle Beach 420x headphones not staying on after connecting</h2>
                    <p>Hello, yesterday my friend gave me his new-ish TB Stealth 420x headphones that worked perfectly at his house, when I brought them to my house I plugged the transmitter in and pressed the power button and it went through it’s normal “Powering on”, “Pairing headset” and it did not connect! So I did my reaserch and charged the headset pressed the pair button on the transmitter and the green light started blinking and I pressed the power button on the headset and it said “ headset &nbsp;paired” so I let go of the power button, and much to my surprise, the headset just turned off, so I tried doing it a couple more times and it refused to work, then I update the firmware, still refuses to work, I set the transmitter up as a boot somthing and still refuses to work, I really need help! Btw this is on xbox one</p>

<h2>            Synaptics touchpad Driver Update Causes blue screen &#34;DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION&#34; Windows 10</h2>
                    I install build 10240 and everything was fine. After Synaptics touchpad driver v19.0.6.1 was installed via Windows Update, I see blue screen&nbsp;"DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION"&nbsp;every time I use the touchpad. I uninstall it and the problem&nbsp;is solved, but&nbsp;Synaptics
 touchpad drivers v19.0.6.1 installed automatically via Windows Update back each time I removed it.&nbsp;Is there a way for me not to updates for Synaptics?<br />
<br />
I use MSI CR420.

            <p>Me too, I use MSI A6200. &nbsp;I am getting fed up with having to go into device manager and rolling back the TouchPad driver when it re-installs. This is really a pain using the keypad strokes to emulate the TouchPad actions!!!!!!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver 19.0.13.0 from 18 Jun15 works. </p>
<p>The driver on windows 10 update is 19.0.6.1 and that is the rubbish one.</p>

            <p>The annual update of Windows 10 caused DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION again by reinstalling synaptics touchpad driver 19.0.6.1 i.e. the rubbish one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I had bought a usb mouse in anticipation of failure again,I attached this after the Blue screen violation and used to rollback the touchpad mouse driver, now working ok again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However since I had been away and not used my laptop recently there were loads of updates,&nbsp;it took 5hrs of downloading updates and applying them and reapplying some of them again after the blue screen&nbsp;.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most unproductive use of time! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the update is worth it?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Monitor Blanks - Solid Blue - but Computer is actually still functional</h2>
                    <p>Have Windows 10 Home Edition on my desktop system&nbsp; - which requires only automatic updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like every time there is any type of Windows update, I wind-up with a dead / frozen screen.&nbsp; The monitor turns a solid, pale blue, with nothing showing on the screen. &nbsp; The mouse is still visible and can be moved.&nbsp; I can through my home network still
 access the shared drives on the desktop my both of from my laptops, so it a a monitor freeze only.&nbsp; Computer is actually still functioning -- only the monitor display is frozen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have gone through and disabled the on-board video, installed a newer, updated, add-on video card, and have been updating the drivers for the new add-on video card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem has been going on for months but continues to return randomly.&nbsp; Keep removing all display adapters from the device manager -- except for the correct one installed in system, but Windows seems to generate some "other" display adapter for each update,
 and I am back to manual shut-down,&nbsp; rebooting, removing the extra - incorrect display adapter , and then rebooting to clear the deleted display adapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to stop the constant (and very annoying) monitor freeze and the constant cycle of manual shut-down, removal of the wrong video driver to keep my monitor working?</p>
