            <p>The upgrade is registered to the device, so if you decide to go back to Windows 10, that will not be a problem, you won't have to buy it after July 29th 2016, just make sure you take advantage of the offer with the 1 year period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

<p>See the following: <a href="https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/how-to-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-windows-from-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Throughout the history of Windows revisions, Microsoft has included an option to uninstall the operating system when you upgrade to a newer version. My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan. With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back to your previo

<p>I play on both Steam and Xbox. I really appreciate the Wishlite option with Steam. I can't buy everything&nbsp;I'd like when I come across it, so I put on my wish list. There are games I'd like to buy in the future for Xbox, but I have no way of keeping track
 of them when they are on sale and so I don't forget about a title.</p>

<h2>            EasyCAP DC60 &#40;Ulead software Version 2.1c&#41; under Windows 7 Professional &#40;64bit&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday I tried to use my brand-new <strong>EasyCAP DC60</strong> video capturing USB cable (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/EasyCAP-Audio-Capture-Surveillance-Dongle/dp/B000Z4AQFU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/EasyCAP-Audio-Capture-Surveillance-Dongle/dp/B000Z4AQFU</a>
 ) in order to save some of my VHS cassettes digitally.</p>
<p>First of all I was disappointed that the installer said: Successfully installed but when I tried to use it the software said "no driver found". After some Google research I found a driver for Windows 7/64 bit.</p>
<p>But now I have another strange/stupid problem. Video capturing works but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
problems with audio</span> . There are tons of "audio problems with EasyCAP DC60" posts) but found no solution.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>My problem:</strong> </span>The audio-data is not captured from the EasyCAP cable. It is captured from the internal microphone! So you'll have all ambient noise on the captures video. That is not why I bough
 a capture cable ;-)</p>
<p><strong>How can I "force" Windows 7 to using the USB cable for audio+video?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Btw:</span> </strong>Right click on sound symbol in Task bar --&gt; Recording devices --&gt; select Properties on the USB audio thing --&gt; Listen to this device does not the trick. Only got acoustic feedback from
 the internal microphone.</p>
<p>Disabling the internal microphone also not works.</p>

            Hi PKC222,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Skype doesn't publish the list of changes it is undertaking and its schedule. So, I am not sure whether it will happen or not or when. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers. More the feedbacks are, the earlier it comes - Open Skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Why does Medieval 2 total war Crash to Desktop during gameplay</h2>
                    It happens during a very specific portion of the game. Once it loads the game onto the battle map a CTD occurs giving no reason and leaving no system log in the game's folder. I have tried other suggested methods posted here and they are unfeasible I believe
 it to be a fundamental compatibility issue. My drivers and updates are all up to date and still the problem persists.<br />

Running an ASUS, HD 7670 graphics card, 1TB Hard drive, 10 GB DDR3 RAM, 8 Core 3.3 GHz Processor. If I left out any information please let me know<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that <span>Medieval 2 total war Crashes to Desktop while you play.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Did you try any troubleshooting Steps to fix this?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow the methods given below and check if the issue resolves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Perform Clean Boot.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important: Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type<b> ‘MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the<b> ‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click<b> ‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Provide Event Viewer logs</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Type "Event Viewer" on the Start screen. Click "Settings" and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: </span></p>
<p><span><br />
Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user<br />
logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error. Whenever these types of events occur,<br />
Windows records the event in an event log that you can read by using Event Viewer. Advanced users might<br />
find the details in event logs helpful when troubleshooting problems with Windows and other programs.<br />
Event Viewer tracks information in several different logs. Windows Logs include:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>Application (program) events. Events are classified as error, warning, or information, depending on<br />
the severity of the event. An error is a significant problem, such as loss of data. A warning is an<br />
event that isn't necessarily significant, but might indicate a possible future problem. An information<br />
event describes the successful operation of a program, driver, or service.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Security-related events. These events are called audits and are described as successful or failed<br />
depending on the event, such as whether a user trying to log on to Windows was successful.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Setup events. Computers that are configured as domain controllers will have additional logs displayed<br />
here.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
System events. System events are logged by Windows and Windows system services, and are classified as<br />
error, warning, or information.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Forwarded events. These events are forwarded to this log by other computers.</span></p>
<p><span>Applications and Services Logs vary. They include separate logs about the programs that run on your<br />
computer, as well as more detailed logs that pertain to specific Windows services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>

    <title>Windows Update causing Automatic Repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derekalvarado  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update causing Automatic Repair</h2>
                    First off, this is not a question about how to get out of the Automatic Repair loop.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is a question about why it gets kicked into this loop in the first place.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I recently bought a new PC (Asus Q501LA) loaded with Windows 8. Naturally, after initial boot and setup there were a number of updates to install. I left all updates checked and clicked Install (700+ MB). After it was finished it required a restart, so I did
 that. After shutting down, the computer restarts into Automatic Repair. (Let me tell you, this was really depressing, especially since this was a gift from my parents. After being a longtime Windows user I switched to Mac in late 2008. The experience was problem-free
 for all 5 years. Then, on day 1 of owning a new Windows PC, this happens?)&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, after research into how to get out of the repair loop I was able to fully restore Windows. Research also suggested installing updates 1 at a time. So, I began doing that. After getting through a number of them without fault, I would setup a restore
 point, just in case. After a day or so of slowly applying Windows Updates, I was fully caught up. After they were all installed, I was able to shut down/restart the computer a number of times without seeing Automatic Repair. One-by-one seemed to make all the
 difference.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then came Patch Tuesday (12/10/2013). This time it needed another 19 updates. Having not learned my lesson, or figuring 19 is a low number compared to the initial 76, I left all updates checked and clicked Install. Then a restart. Boom - Automatic repair.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Going through the same steps as before, but this time with a restore point, I was able to restore to a point just after the initial 76 updates. Then I started the process of installing the updates 1 by 1, some of them required a restart, others did not. The
 5th update in this process required a restart and - boom - Automatic Repair. I had to start the restore process (same restore point as before) and leave for work. When I get home I'll have to figure out EXACTLY which update is causing the Automatic Repair
 this time, and then go through process of restoring (again) after it happens.<br />
<br />
This may be a rant more than a question, but is this really the reality of owning a Windows PC? Do I have to worry about Microsoft disabling my computer every time an update comes out? &nbsp;I figured it wouldn't be this way since the PC I use at work (Win7) has
 never caused me any grief.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tips for avoiding this headache every month?&nbsp;</div>

                    My Xbox randomly dropped connection a few days ago and since then has not been able to reconnect to my WiFi. I have tried power cycles along with resetting the MAC address to no avail. This is very frustrating as all my other devices connect fine to the

<h2>            Windows 10 sound Auto Louder Problem</h2>
                    I have the problem after I downloaded Windows 10. Play media, pause it, wait a bit, resume, or Play a new Media, volume is way higher than it should but the number is the same. Quickly adjust it back and forth and it fixes it. I updated my sound driver
 to Realtek 6.0.1.7544 and it didn't fix it. volume showed it's on 25, but playing media sound is like as full volume. after changing the volume up/down it becomes as normal. but after sometimes, it becomes same problem. i tried many ways. reinstalling my realtek
 sound card driver, sound playback, but it didn't fix at all. please give me best solution?

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This setting&nbsp;has been hidden in the Creators update (for some reason, even though&nbsp;it's very popular, the logic in that&nbsp;eludes me but I digress) however there is a compact script tool that has been published to restore the use of the&nbsp;settings&nbsp;with a handy
 and&nbsp;easy to use interface. Follow the link below for the instructions and the download.</p>

</p><p>It works well and is safe to download and use.</p>

                    From a power off, I start my laptop and it only shows a blank screen except for the mouse.&nbsp; I leave it running and it makes no difference.&nbsp; I close the lid or press the power button to enter sleep mode.&nbsp; When I wake it up, everything is fine.&nbsp; I restart
 from a long sleep like overnight and it is fine.&nbsp; I get a log in screen.&nbsp; But NEVER from a cold, power off situation.

<h2>            Tablet mode not working</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>I recently came across the possibility that my Dell PC has a tablet mode for windows 10. However, whenever I turn it on, it's not working.
</p>
<p>Please advise!</p>

<p>Is your Dell PC a tablet? Does it have a touch screen? Not enough information here for anyone to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a desktop, the only thing you would see in tablet mode would be giving you a full Start Screen.</p>

            Do a System Restore, in Safe Mode if necessary:<br />
<br />
<p><span>Restore Point:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />
<br />
Cheers.</span></p>

    <title>mouse pointer pop-up&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdonaghy  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse pointer pop-up&#39;s</h2>
                    Is there a way to turn off the information boxes that pop up every time the mouse pointer rolls over a clickable item? Eg: in internet explorer, my favorites...when I move the mouse pointer over a favorite a small box pops up with the information about
 the web page in it or like on the top of these pages where it says vista assistant...if I point to it a box pops up with "Vista assistant" in it. Thanks

<p><span>Hi MDonaghy,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Site.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To Disable or Enable ToolTip Popups for Items in Windows Vista, follow the steps below:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. In the Start Search Box, type regedit</span></p>
<p><span>2. Scroll down HKEY_CURRENT_USER &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; CurrentVersion &gt; Explorer &gt; Advanced</span></p>
<p><span>3. You will see a list of entries. Locate FolderContentsInfoTip, StartButtonBalloonTip, ShowInfoTip. Click on modify and set dword value to 00000000 for each
 of the entry (to undo the same set the value to 00000001)</span></p>
<p><span>4. Scroll down HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; CurrentVersion &gt; Explorer &gt; Advanced</span></p>

<p>When dealing with file or folder names that have embedded spaces then you MUST surround the names with double quotes. This is standard stuff for all console commands, including robocopy.</p>

<p><span>I've had my Xbox One since December 2014. Since owning it, the device has been connected to our Wi-Fi network via a 5G connection of our dual band router. It's the only device utilizing this connection, as all of our other wireless tech utilizes the
 2.4 connection. The Xbox was situated on the ground floor of our townhome, with the wireless equipment about 10-12 feet away, tucked into a loft area right above our TV/entertainment center. During this time, I never experienced a single issue with the hardware
 or wireless connections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This past June, my wife and I moved to a new townhome. Our new place has a nice finished basement, so the TV and my gaming systems all moved down there. The wireless network equipment (same modem, router, and ISP as our previous house) resides on the
 ground floor in the living room, almost directly above where the Xbox is currently setup. Once again, the Xbox One was setup as the only device on the 5G band of the router. The first 2 months of gaming at the new place were fine with nothing out of the ordinary
 to note. I played a lot of Dying Light and Halo 5 Warzone Firefight with absolutely no problems. That all seemed to change the first weekend the Titanfall 2 test was released to the public. At first, my wireless controller would randomly disconnect during
 a gaming session. I swapped my battery pack - I own the officially licensed Play &amp; Charge kit - for some brand new AA batteries, but the issue persisted. My next step was to connect the controller via USB, and check for a firmware update, but the Xbox said
 the controller was up-to-date, and no additional updates were available. At this point I figured there was an issue with the controller, but aside from the random disconnects, it works fine, so I figure I'd replace it the next time I have a little left over
 from my paycheck. This is when things get really odd...</span></p>
<p><span>During the second weekend of the TitanFall 2 test, my system started dropping the network connection to Xbox Live. At first, I thought it was just a tech issue with the Alpha. I would get booted from a game session, and kicked back to the main menu
 of the TF2 Alpha. I never bothered to think to check my Xbox Live connection from the Home or System menu, as I just assumed the servers were being taxed with all the traffic of people trying the game. Over the course of the next 3-4 weeks, however, the situation
 has gotten progressively worse. Not only does my wireless controller randomly disconnect, but my network connection would disconnect randomly as well. Sometimes, it would even drop my network immediately after booting to the home screen, before I could even
 launch an app or game. When I attempted to reconnect, the system didn't recognize my network, and I had to select my 5G band again and re-enter the Wi-Fi password.</span></p>
<p><span>Two weeks ago, my wife and I decided to play some Rock Band, and we had no problems. The microphone was a previous gen wired mic so no issues there, and the wireless guitar worked perfectly. Last week, however, everything started dropping, all at the
 same time. We tried playing Rock Band, but the guitar would disconnect. Sometimes it would reconnect immediately, other times the connection light flashed continuously, and never reconnected. At this point, I decided to play something else, but attempted an
 experiment: I unplugged the USB from the controller, and booted-up Halo 5, but at the same time, made sure the wireless guitar was synced to the Xbox. After a round a single round of WZ Firefight, the network connection disconnected, I was completely booted
 from Xbox Live and both my wireless guitar and wireless controller dropped the connection to the hardware. This all happened at the same time - booted from game, disconnected from XBL, controllers dropped sync - all at the same time. My phone seems to have
 stayed connected to our network during this latest episode, which only adds to my confusion.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, I'm a bit frustrated. Everything had been working fine up until the last month or so, and we've introduced NO new wireless tech into the house since our move, so I'm not convinced that these issues are being caused by interference. I've
 performed multiple power cycles since issues started, the power brick is plugged directly into a wall outlet and has been since we've moved in, controller batteries have been swapped, and I've attempted to update controller firmware. Is there anything that
 would explain why all wireless technology disconnecting at/around the same time? Is the controller tech tied to the network wireless card in the Xbox, and is it possible the wireless card is slowly dying? If anyone has any insight, I would greatly appreciate
 it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Other things to note: <br />
- We are currently renting the townhouse we are in, so running a network cord through the floor is NOT ideal.<br />
- I am enrolled in the Preview Program<br />
- There is a wireless Vizio soundbar/sub/satellite speaker surround sound as part of my entertainment center, which worked fine and caused no issues at our old place.<br />
- Timing of these disconnects is totally random. Sometimes it happens at 1 in the afternoon, sometimes it happens at 10 at night.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Again, any insight anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!</span></p>

<p>Hey Pertski,</p>
<p>I had similar issues. I moved from a row home in the city to a house in the burbs. My Xbox One use to be in the living room but now resides in the basement. Odd things happen now. Tons of controller disconnects, guitar hero live disconnects etc. Not going
 to get into too much detail but the controller disconnects improved when I gave the Xbox One a better line of sight to my controller. It would sit behind the bar. After putting it on top of the bar it vastly improved. Also since upgrading to the S I get almost
 zero disconnects. &nbsp;For wifi everyone was acting dandy until a few weeks ago. When I boot up from energy saving mode it looks for a wired connection and takes about 10-20 secs to my find my 5ghz nighthawk router. On wireless I get DL speeds well over 100 but
 the Xbox One thinks they are only 2-5. I tried instant on mode and it finds the signal right away however the download speeds still vary. I believe it's a software issue all around.</p>

            <p>Hey Pertski -</p>
<p>It definitely sounds like your current set-up is less than ideal and that there is some interference happening between your Xbox One console and your networking hardware. Are you able to temporarily move your console and networking hardware to the same level to see if you experience the same issues? And while I understand you say that running an ethernet cable is not optimal, it's worth trying to see if it helps with stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you're able to try those things and if it helps. :)</p>

<p>Thanks to both J2TheL &amp; Miss Bijoux for the responses. </p>
<p>J2TheL,</p>
<p>Thanks for your insight. To clarify: jumping over to the One S solved your controller issue, but not the network connection. Is that correct?
</p>
<p>Miss Bijoux,</p>
<p>At some point this weekend I can try to haul everything into the living room and see how it goes. My work schedule makes it difficult for me to boot up the Xbox, let alone tear apart my entertainment center to get to everything.

<p>Miss Bijoux,</p>
<p>I was able to move the Xbox hardware into the living room and have had no issues gaming or streaming from the internet. Both the controller and the network connections seem stable and there have been no disconnects. While it's good to know that I won't have
 to replace defective hardware, I now have to redesign where my entertainment center is and what equipment is in there.
</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

            <p>Thanks for giving that a shot, Pertski! Bummer that you'll have to rearrange everything but at least you know that it works! I hope you find a new arrangement that suits you well. :)</p>
