<p>Hello OPfrog</p>
<p>Many thanks!&nbsp; the above worked successfully first time. Do you (or Dell/Microsoft) know what caused problem in the first place? Various comments about firewalls etc in other forums!</p>

</p><p>I'm trying to install Icloud for windows on my windows 10 laptop and i'm having difficulties.&nbsp; I've spoken to Apple and they have spent a long time talking me through different options to try and resolve it, including running it as administrator but the

            <p>Start by uninstalling every single piece of Apple Software you have installed. This includes iCloud itself, iTunes, Apple Support software etc.
</p>
<p>I personally recommend you use Revouninstaller to thoroughly remove all Apple Software. Its a possibility you might encounter the same error attempting to uninstall each without Revouninstaller.</p>
<p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com</a> (freeware).
</p>
<p>Also make sure you uninstall the Apple Software Updater itself too. </p>
<p>Try installing iCloud and iTunes again. </p>
<p>
Choose the Repair option if you still have trouble performing the uninstall of iCloud for Windows.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, to successfully uninstall iCloud for Windows, please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain the admin access.</li><li>Save all of your personal stuff like your photos, files.</li><li>Exit the unwanted iCloud client, then terminate all of Apple/ iCloud related processes by making the best of Task Manager.</li><li><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-30352718-726494/20160620191339.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fdiscussions.apple.com%2fservlet%2fJiveServlet%2fdownloadImage%2f2-30352718-726494%2f20160620191339.png" height="567" width="620" /></a></li><li>Re-try launching the traditional uninstall routine (Start &gt; Cpanel &gt; Add/Remove, or "Uninstall a program"); rid of other possibly unused items like Apple Software Update, if you do not use 'em.

            as far as I can find it's always antivirus/antimalware programs causing this exact issue. that usually means it's hacked/cracked processes being blocked. this shouldn't account for your installation processes being blocked, but could be.
<div>I had edited my Skyrim TESV.exe to allow &gt;2GB memory allocation and it was causing Kaspersky to give me this issue, i guess because it was doing things not intended for the OG executable.</div>

            I wanted to say I was just having the same not charging problem and had tried everything suggested. But just 5 mins ago I went to my laptop manufactures website (Gateway) to look for more help, well I found it! Under support for battery problems I followed
 the troubleshooting checklist and #2 was;<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;" <strong>Remove or replace any surge protectors.</strong> Remove any surge protectors between the system and the wall outlet. Disconnect them only for the purpose of troubleshooting this problem. Plug the system directly into a known good wall outlet. A lamp
 or hair dryer can be plugged into the wall outlet to verify it is working.<br />
<span>Over time, surge protectors can develop poor connections and introduce a potential for inconsistent power between the wall outlet and the system. Some surge protectors have fuses that must be reset in the event of a surge in power
 consumption. This could indicate there are too many devices connected to the surge protector with the power limit for the surge protector exceeded. If the surge protector has a fuse and resetting it solves the problem, disconnect some of the devices connected
 to the surge protector. Make sure the wall outlet is not connected to a wall switch where power can be turned off inadvertently.<br />
<span><strong>Important:</strong></span> Once the problem has been resolved; replace the surge protector if it was found to be the cause of the problem or reconnect it if something else was found to be the problem. Always use a quality surge
 protector in new or very good condition between the system and the wall outlet. Do not daisy chain or connect one surge protector to another.</span> "<br />
<br />
AND IT WORKED!! So I thought I'd share it because it was an answer that was never suggested in all the forums I visited. Hope it helps :)

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not seeing the reactivate button, it is likely that you are logged in to an incorrect Skype account. Make sure to
<strong>sign in using the same credentials</strong> (<em>Skype name, phone number or email address</em>) you've used when the credits were purchased.

    <title>Aps with error code 1321 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gil lang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aps with error code 1321</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to download Bluestacks. I did but it wouldn't work. So, I had to delete it and try to download it again. This thing (Bluestacks) doesn't appear in the control panel uninstall a program. It's a pain in the a.. to delete. Now, after going to that
 procedure many times, when I try to download it,&nbsp; I get the message error 1321 the installer has insufficient privileges to modify this file C:/ProgramData/Microsoft/Windows/StartMenu/Programs/BlueStacks/StartBlueStacks.ink.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I have deleted everything related to Bluestacks on my laptop(register editor,Programs data,programs x86 ans such) except that...when you you click on start, it's there among the apps. You right&nbsp; click on it, nothing happen. You left click on it and
 you get a box with start Bluestacks in it. You left click on that box, nothing happen. You right click on that box, you get another box with: Pin to start,uninstall,run as administrator and open file location. You left click on "uninstall" and it get you to
 the control panel where to uninstall it but Bluestacks isn't among the programs. You left click on "run as administrator" nothing happen. You left click on "open file location" and it get you to where the start&nbsp; Bluestacks folder is. You left click on it,
 nothing happen. You right click on it, you get a box in which among other thing is "delete". You click on delete and, you get a box that tells you: " you need permission to perform this action. You require permission from the computer's administrator to make
 changes to this file.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm the administrator of the computer. How can I get these s..... messages ? How can I get rid of that 1321 error warning and finally be able to try to download it again. Don't forget...there's no folder anywhere with Bluestacks in&nbsp; it where you can click
 to get properties and&nbsp; such.</p>

<h2>            Dual Monitors under Windows 7</h2>
                    Have just upgraded to Windows 7 Premium from Vista. Can't get the Screensaver to come in on the second monitor which it did just fine before with different pictures coming up on both screens. Have read some of the previous threads on this subject which
 seem to suggest this is a Microsoft program error. Is anything being done or can someone point me to some independent software that will do the same job. Not keen on this though.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi BTClubman,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>Does this happen with any particular screensaver or is it the same with all the screen savers?</span></div>
</li></ul>
<p><span>However, you may follow the steps below and check if it helps and post back the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Duplicate the display settings and check if you can view the Screensaver in the extended monitor as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To change your display settings to extended</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Open Screen Resolution by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, and then, under Appearance and Personalization,
 clicking Adjust screen resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click the drop-down list next to multiple displays, click Duplicate these display, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Multiple displays option appears only when Windows detects more than one monitor connected to your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you don't see an option named Multiple displays in your display settings, then Windows isn't detecting a second
 monitor plugged into your desktop computer. Or, it is not detecting an external monitor plugged into your laptop. When Windows detects this monitor, it will appear in the drop-down list next to Display. If you don't see it listed there, try clicking Detect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Make sure the monitor you want to extend your desktop to is turned on and plugged into the correct video port on your
 computer. You might also need to select the correct source labeled on your monitor's controls to ensure the monitor is using the correct video port. For more information, check the manual for your monitor or go to the manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following link for more information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the display resolution set for both monitors. Make sure the screen resolution is the same on each display.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p><strong>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer, </strong><strong>how do I find the product key?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system unit.&nbsp;It
 looks like the following:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.
</li></ul>
<span>
<ul>
<li>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</li></ul>

<p>That subscription was discontinued some time ago . The only users that that would still have that subscription would be those that have never intentionally cancelled or unintentionally broken their subscription through lack of payment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the same price range you can get a US <strong>or</strong> Canada subscription for a year.&nbsp; If you require both, you could purchase both simultaneously or choose the North American subscription. The North American subscription is more expensive than both
 combined but covers additional areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another alternative that might still be available through local and online retailers. That is the purchase of the US and Canada subscription for ~$30 in voucher form. These subscriptions are not renewable but you can purchase another voucher in
 the future. I do not recommend stocking up on vouchers because there are a few main issues I have seen in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The voucher does not have a printed expiration. The voucher could already be expired or expires anywhere from a few months to 3 years after purchase, if not activated. I have no idea if this was ever sorted out, though I have not seen recent issues with
 it. I often see more listings and references that the voucher cards do not expire, so maybe they did resolve these expiration issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. There can be an imposed limit on the amount of times a voucher can be used on the lifetime of the account. Once that limit is reached, you cannot active any more of that same type of voucher on your account. I have no idea what the limit is, if one exists.
 If the limit is reached the way around it is to activate it on a secondary account and use that to place phone calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Reactivation/Replacement/Refunds for non-expired or expired vouchers could be difficult to obtain. An online retailer with a good reputation/refund policy or&nbsp; a good credit card protection plan could help resolve issues.</p>

            The selected method of payment for the subscription would be the only thing charged. Other payment sources not attached to the subscription agreement would not be attempted. If your method of payment is Paypal and that provider rejected payment then there
 is a break in the subscription due to lack of payment. You&nbsp; can try to resolve the issue with Paypal or see if you can change the primary payment method. If possible, this generally has to be done as soon as notice is given, prior to the subscription ending
 (&lt;3 days). If neither of those options are available or successful, you will not be able to restore the subscription.

 no, there is no organization, just me. &nbsp; &nbsp;Web searches reveal this has been a problem for many but none of the solutions I found are applicable to me. &nbsp;Windows 10 Home doesn't have gpedit.msc (Policy editor) and the registry keys people have mentioned aren't
 in my registry. &nbsp;I've gone so far as to delete pretty much every registry key under HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft to no avail. &nbsp; I would appreciate help getting control of my computer back...

<h2>            Xbox one surround sound issues.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,I have a Phillips 5.1 home theater, connected to my Phillips hd TV,via a digital rca cable to its digital output port.</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 surround worked fine in this mode,however while using the 5.1uncompressed on the one,sounds like dialogue doesn't work properly, on some games,like forza,ryse,metal gear,I can't hear the dialogue,while games like assassin's creed unity have
 distant dialogue and others sounds with very low volume.</p>
<p>I really would like some help here,using stereo,while it is playable,seems like a waste,since I have a 5.1 system and the Xbox sound processor can handle hundreds of different sound assets at the same time.</p>
<p>Sorry for any mistakes,English is not my 1st language and I am posting on a phone,don't worry,I can perfectly read English.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the dump files that you've provided, we've identified that <strong>rzmpos.sys</strong> is causing the blue screen error. This file is associated with Razer. A blue screen error
<span>can be caused by both hardware and software issues. This can also occur due to memory or driver incompatibility. For us to isolate your concern, we'd like to know if you've made any changes prior to the issue. In the meantime,

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using bluescreenviewer I also saw that Driver Verifier was citing Razer's drivers, upon deleting them all I haven't crashed since! Shame I can't use the intended software though, as it has some nice calibration options, so its certainly the razer drivers.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Metal Slug Series for Xbox One System is flawed, Local Coop is not possible, anyone has better luck in this&#63;</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>I remember playing this game back in the day in the original Xbox console with my older brother. So i have purchase few Metal Slug games in order to have the coop fun with my kids.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then i realize Metal Slug series for Xbox One system is having glitch that no possible to add in second player. I have already uninstalled and reinstalled Metal Slug X and Metal Slug 3 for multiple times.. Attempted to connect second controller on local
 coop mode but it didn't work at all regardless of any buttons i press on second controller. Local Coop mode is broken for these series.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you check the reviews under any Metal Slug series, you will find out plenty of negative reviews regarding to the unsupported local coop mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help if you know any way to get this fixed, or we need a patch from game developer?</p>

    <title>Why does Microsoft falsely claim that Windows is a service to justify - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> delicieuxz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Microsoft falsely claim that Windows is a service to justify abusing Windows owners&#39; rights&#63;</h2>
                    <p>"Service" vs "product" are two separate legal entities, with separate legal requirements to their advertising, what is exchanged in a point-of-sale, and the rights that come with each classification. The format of Windows 10, and what is offered in a point-of-sale
 exchange is in no way legally a "service", and is absolutely a product. Windows 10 is definitively a product that is able to connect to services out of the box. Windows Update, OneDrive, Microsoft Store, are all services, but Windows 10 itself is most definitely
 a product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the European Union's highest court has ruled and which no country's highest court has ever ruled to the contrary of, people own the software that they buy licenses for. They don't own the software Intellectual Property, but they do own the non-reproduceable
 instance for which their license is, and they alone possess all property and decision-making rights over that non-reproduceable instance of software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation with software licenses is identical to purchasing a car, where you don't purchase the vehicle's IP, its brand name, its patented technology - you purchase a license to use all of those things in a non-reproduceable instance of those things.
 Buying physical retail goods and buying perpetual software licenses is an identical process, and the rights held by the purchaser over what they've bought, with either physical goods or software licenses, is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/eu-court-when-you-buy-software-you-own-it</p>
<p>https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d1ff4369-afcc-4879-97fa-7a8afd8b3380</p>
<p>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120703/11345519566/eu-court-says-yes-you-can-resell-your-software-even-if-software-company-says-you-cant.shtml</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, not a single country's highest court has ever ruled contrary to the European Union's highest court. So, there is no basis for Microsoft or any other company in the world to suggest anything different than what the EU's top court has ruled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of these are true, and represent what is the case with perpetual software licenses (the kind that everybody with Windows 10 Home or Pro have):</p>
<p>
</p><p>This software (IP) is licensed, not sold</p>
<p>This software (license / instance) is sold, not leased</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>People with Windows 10 licenses own their Windows 10 software - not Microsoft. Microsoft must submit to its legal obligations and stop unilaterally messing with people's Windows 10 settings without permission or authorization. Microsoft is violating the
 law (and in many respects, as various EU privacy investigation authorities have been reporting) by resetting people's settings, and it must stop.<br />
<br />
So, please, let us know how can we permanently disable Windows Update in our Windows 10 operating systems, which we, not Microsoft, own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is NOT a service, and it never has been. It is a product that is presented and sold as a product, to be engaged as a product - one which is able to connect to services and has access to various services integrated into it, but while being, itself,
 a product nonetheless.<br />

<p>Thanks Andre. I hope that I will receive an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is advertised as "Windows as a service" by Microsoft because Microsoft wants to emulate the online free services of Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others, all of whom are in the business of collecting personal user data and then selling
 it for profit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not legal for someone to walk into somebody else's property, take their things, and then sell them, and so it is not legal for Microsoft or another software company to take the personal and personally-identifiable data that it generated by people's
 owned hardware, software, electricity, housing, time, etc, and then sell it for Microsoft's profit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft seeks to get around this distinction between product (something a person buys and owns, and is responsible for) and service (something people engage with, but which is hosted, run, and managed by an outside source) by insincerely referring to Windows
 as a "service" - except that Microsoft doesn't mean that Windows is literally a service, and Windows is literally not a service but is a product: Legally, tangibly, acquisition-wise, and as presented in its EULA. So, Microsoft calling Windows a "service" is
 Microsoft lying, and breaking the law.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Entirely separate frameworks of law apply to products and services. Windows is entirely encompassed within the legal framework of a product and is sold as a product, and sold Windows instances undergo a transfer of ownership at the point of their sale -
 that means, Microsoft no longer holds any rights over people's individual Windows OSes after Microsoft has sold the licenses for those instances. The same applies to "free upgrades" that Microsoft offered for Windows 7 and 8 licenses - nothing about the "free
 upgrade" altered the identity of the license / instance of Windows from being a product that is owned exclusively by the license holder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To facilitate people's understanding, here is the distinction between a service and a product:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A service is a desired transient activity that serves as a bridge between states.<br />
<br />
Some examples of services are:<br />
<br />
Windows Update<br />
Vehicle rentals<br />
Food making or delivery<br />
Subscription-access to a 3rd-party's servers<br />
Online programs and games resellers such as Steam, Origin, Uplay, Microsoft Store<br />
<br />
<br />
A product is an identifiable tangible item and state of an item.<br />
<br />
Some examples of products are:<br />
<br />
Windows OS as a whole, and each distinct build of the Windows OS<br />
Vehicles<br />
Food<br />
Any software sold via perpetual licenses, each of which represents a non-reproduceable instance of its software IP<br />
The programs and games purchased through digital retailers such as Steam, Origin, Uplay, Microsoft Store<br />
<br />
<br />
A product is something that you own, while a service is something that you access. Windows instances are sold as products via perpetual licenses which undergo a transfer of ownership upon the point of sale. Once a person owns an instance of Windows, they possess
 full property rights and decision-making authority over that non-reproduceable instance of Windows. As has been ruled by the European Union's top court and has not been contradicted by any other court of similar stature, people own the software that they buy.<br />

<p>
</p><p>It is exactly the same situation with perpetual software licenses as it is with any physical product:&nbsp; Despite not owning the IP for your software, your TV, your clothes, etc., since you were not sold the IP for those things but a license for usage of the
 IP represented by your non-reproduceable instance of it, you were in-fact sold that non-reproduceable instance of those things, and you are the sole and exclusive owner of those instances, and possess full decision-making authority over those instances:<br />
<br />
You don't own your car (IP); You own your car (instance / license).<br />
You don't own your clothes (IP); You own your clothes (instance / license).<br />
You don't own your software (IP); You own your software (instance / license). </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another truth that people who buy software should be aware of is that software EULAs are not laws, and corporations do not possess any law-making authority. EULA's (including Microsoft's) frequently contain clauses that don't count for anything because they're
 overruled by national law. An example in Microsoft's Windows 10 EULA is the restriction that anybody from the USA wanting to sue Microsoft can only bring a case against Microsoft in the state of California. Various states of the USA have laws that explicitly
 prohibit such restrictions as they violate consumer protection laws. But companies like Microsoft sometimes write these things in their EULAs in order to ward off potential challenges from customers. After all, if the public thinks they can't do something,
 they are less likely to attempt to do that thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EULAs aren't laws and are more like publisher opinions and wishes - they are only enforceable to the extent that they submit to and acknowledge the law, and to which they can be considered reasonable by the legal realms' Reasonable Person example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Historically, and still today, absurd and non-enforceable claims are made in EULAs by large companies, including Microsoft. A couple of formerly popular but non-legal EULA clauses that used to appear in many EULAs until they became widespread understood
 to not possibly be enforceable, and to instead risk invalidating the entire EULA by their presence in an EULA include these:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- by using this software you waive any right to sue the developer or publisher</p>
<p>
</p><p>- you may not reverse-engineer this software</p>
<p>
</p><p>These clauses and others like them used to be copy and pasted into perpetual license EULAs by developers, publishers, and companies just because they sounded good and protecting of the company and polarizing the distribution of power and control in favour
 of the company, but you don't see these clauses in EULAs written by informed legal experts these days because they were asinine and made-up out of thin air at a time when software companies hadn't yet realized that they don't possess powers to arbitrarily
 overrule national law.&nbsp;It’s possible that you might still spot one of these ancient and inadmissible clauses in an EULA put together by a rookie or independent developer, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a violation of consumer protection laws and citizen rights to deny an individual their right to legal protection and recourse against damages and unfair practices. So, a company cannot claim that its customers waive their legal rights by buying or
 using the company's products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it is not legally permissible to deny a person their decision-making authority (including the right to open up, modify, and repair) in regards to their personal property - which the software they own via perpetual licenses is. So, a company can't tell
 a person that they cannot choose to reverse-engineer their software any more than they can sell a toaster that says that the purchaser is not allowed to open it up to repair it - or any more than a GPU manufacturer can put a sticker on the GPU cooler claiming
 that if the sticker is removed the product's warranty will be invalidated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Getting back to how all of this relates to Microsoft:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft seek to entitle themselves to people's personally-owned personal data generated by their own hardware, software, electricity, housing, time, activity, so that Microsoft can sell that personal data for profit and be in the same business as Amazon,
 Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are all services with the back-ends for those services being hosted, controlled, electricity-provided, and maintained by their IP holders. And these companies don't sell their service software via perpetual
 licenses, but instead they use subscriptions to grant people access to those services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Microsoft's Windows is an entirely distinct situation, where the software is actually sold as instances via perpetual licenses, and the software is then hosted on people's private PC hardware, using people's paid-for electricity, housing, and all else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Microsoft Windows is legally, and in all ways, a product: One that can connects to extraneous services out of the box, with those services not being a part of the perpetual Windows OS license - but legally a product all the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, it is corporate propaganda and an outright lie for Microsoft to call Windows 10 a "service", and Microsoft has no rights over the individual instances of Windows 10 that have been sold or "upgraded" to for free - since those "upgrades" are to
 perpetual licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also therefore, Microsoft is not allowed to access or take people's personal data, or to sell it, without the voluntary will of the people who own the Windows instances that the data is being taken from. So, what Microsoft is currently doing is theft, and
 unjust enrichment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just as California has recently passed legislation (which Microsoft lobbied against) that takes effect on January 2020, requiring software publishers to provide people the free choice to not have their data collected or sold, so is the default natural legal
 requirement for all products. And I believe we will see more and more states and countries pass the same law.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I call upon Microsoft to not wait until that point to stop stealing personal and personally-identifiable user data from Windows owners, or to wait until that point to stop resetting people's Windows settings (including Windows Update settings - which is
 paramount to vandalism), and to respect the law and Windows owners' rights here and now, and going forward.</p>

<p>I think that the rationale for why Microsoft is violating consumer and property laws while falsely presenting its product as a service for the sake of effectively-stealing personal and personally-identifiable user data would be an important thing to be addressed
 by Microsoft to&nbsp;Windows owners.</p>
<p>

 an innocent and harmless claim, it's one which is judged by laws which determine Windows to be a product and not a service - which completely invalidates some of the actions that Microsoft are doing with Windows.</p>
<p>

<p>If it were a product you could purchase Windows just the way you purchased your computer. But you cannot. What you do is purchase a License to use Windows under specific rules and regulations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are spelled out in the End User License Agreement that you agree to when you install Windows for the first time. You can find a copy on your hard drive by typing Winver in your Cortana/Search Window (select the first option that appears) then click

<p>Hi UltraViolet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link to Microsoft's 'Windows as a service' documentation. I'll address it at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, you absolutely can purchase Windows just like the way you purchase your computer or computer components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A license is a right to make use of something that is proprietary of someone else. All of your computer hardware is a license to ownership of an instance of their Intellectual Property, with the IP being owned by the developer or manufacturer, such as Nvidia,
 AMD, Intel, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both your computer hardware and software are licensed off of their Intellectual Property, which belongs to the IP holder. in fact, every single physical mass-produced product that you purchase is a licensed instance of an Intellectual Property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in both the case of your computer hardware and your software you are not purchasing the IP, but a right to an instance of the IP - which, in the case of computer hardware is your specific physical instance of the hardware IP, and in the case of the software
 is your specific non-reproduceable instance of the software IP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you buy a physical product, the IP holder doesn't really need to make you aware that you aren't allowed to mass-produce and sell their IP, since that's not an easy thing to do with physical products, anyway. However, there are still copyright symbols
 and legal wording in the packaging of many, maybe practically-all physical products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 EULA itself shows that you own your specific instance of the software IP just as you own the specific instances of your clothes, your computer hardware, your car, your TV, etc. See this excerpt from the Windows 10 EULA for demonstration:</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Installation and Use Rights.<br />
<br />
a. License. The software is licensed, not sold. Under this agreement, we grant you the right to install and run one instance of the software on your device (the licensed device), for use by one person at a time, so long as you comply with all the terms of this
 agreement. Updating or upgrading from non-genuine software with software from Microsoft or authorized sources does not make your original version or the updated/upgraded version genuine, and in that situation, you do not have a license to use the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Notice the specific usage of "the software": Microsoft's EULA grant the purchaser the *right* to an *instance* *of* "the software", and therefore the instance is not "the software" itself which the EULA refers to, despite the instance itself also being software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a matter of semantics:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This software (Intellectual Property) is licensed, not sold<br />
This software (license / instance) is sold, not licensed or leased</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instance in Microsoft's EULA phrasing is *of* the Windows I.P., and so therefore "the software" in Microsoft's phrasing is the Windows I.P.. And Microsoft's EULA states that the owner of the license has the right to one (software)
 instance of "the software", which is the I.P..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nowhere does the EULA claim that people don't own their (software) instance of "the software". Instead, the EULA says that the purchaser of the license / instance has a right to that instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is an EULA for a "perpetual license", which means that it never expires. The license represents a permanent instance of Windows, which the purchaser holds BY RIGHT - as acknowledged in Microsoft's EULA.<br />
<br />
In other words, the owner of a Windows license owns a non-exhaustible, non-reproduceable, all-encompassing instance of Windows.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft or any other individual, company, or corporation ever claimed that people don't own their non-reproduceable instance of the software they've purchased, that claim would be false and invalid - because no individual, company,
 or corporation possess the power to claim that people don't own the software that they've purchased licenses for. Such a claim would suggest the IP-holder was a thief for selling but not delivering, and the claim could risk invalidating an entire EULA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The situation is the same with people's clothes, their TV, etc. When they purchase those things they aren't buying the I.P. for them - so they don't own their clothes (IP), their TV (IP), their computer (IP). But they do purchase instances of those things,
 and so they&nbsp; do own their clothes (instance), their TV (instance), their computer (instance), just as they own their software (instances).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Software companies like to use the vague "this software" term to refer to the software I.P. because it confuses and misleads their customers into oftentimes assuming that they don't own their software (instance), and in doing so potentially wards off problems
 and challenges arising for the publisher. However, the phrasing of the EULA, the first-sale doctrine, and consumer and property laws, as well as the EU's top court ruling on the matter all make explicitly clear that people do own the software that they purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's own Windows EULA is written to acknowledge this, and never once refers to the Windows license (right to an instance of the IP), or the owned Windows instance (a product), as a service. "Windows as a service" doesn't refer to the licenses Microsoft
 is selling, and so doesn't refer to the instance of software that those licenses represent. "Windows as a service" is a business philosophy and ideology that doesn't and cannot influence Windows owners' rights over their own Windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, when people on these forums ask why Microsoft is over-riding their custom configuration of their personally-owned OS, 'because Windows is a service' is not an applicable answer, because the legal identity of people's Windows licenses and instances is
 as a product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link to Microsoft's 'Windows as a service' documentation. It appears to not mean that Windows instances are a service (and they're not, they're products), but that Microsoft has a build work and release flow that it
 views as service-like. So, Microsoft's internal philosophy does not answer why people are being frustrated by Microsoft in their efforts to configure their Windows products / instances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's internal work and release flow of Windows builds doesn't grant Microsoft any rights over people's owned Windows software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Microsoft resetting people's settings and effectively-stealing their personal and personally-identifiable user data is not rationalized or justified by anything. And those support assistants here responding to questions with
 'because Windows is a service' are not using Microsoft's own definition of 'Windows as a service'. The Windows people buy is not a service - only Microsoft's internal work-and-release schedule is a service, for Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Completely disable The Taskbar Thumbnail Previews in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Completely disable The Taskbar Thumbnail Previews in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Is there anyway to place an enhancement request to get the ability to completely disable the&nbsp;Taskbar Thumbnail Previews In Windows 10? Or is there some way to truly disable them? I'm aware of the programs and registry hacks, like covered
<a href="http://mywindowshub.com/disable-taskbar-thumbnail-previews-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, to increase the time until they are displayed. But with that they still eventually popup and they drive me insane! They are completely useless to me, take away mouse clicks and a major annoyance. I have never, ever, needed to see a preview of a window
 so they are of no use to me whatsoever. Please, I'm begging, tell me if there is any way I can make this happen. And once again, not the current suggestion(s) floating around about making the time higher, completely disable them so they never appear again.
 I've used Powershell to set the registry entries below. Is there perhaps some super secret entry I can create?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Corrupted&#40;&#63;&#41; download content&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> old 05d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted&#40;&#63;&#41; download content&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp; New Vegas downloads are driving me nuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've downloaded all available expansions,and&nbsp;played them all successsfully, &nbsp;but now, &nbsp;when I power-up the console, it informs me that some of the download data is corrupt.&nbsp; The download expansion games will not load, even when selected to load initially
 from saved games the console acknowledges are there, the console simply loads the last non-expansion save.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've re-downloaded all of the expansions several times, and, immediately after doing so, they play O.K., but, when I save and shut-down the console, the next time I power-up, it's back to the old 'corrupted data' story.</p>
<p>&nbsp; When I go on-line to XBOX Live, and log in, then start New Vegas, it works perfectly, expansions and all, even though I haven't re-re-re-re-downloaded them, and even if I go off-line by the simple expedient of disconnecting the modem.&nbsp; And it keeps working
 fine until I save and power-down again.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Any help will be appreciated!</p>

<p>Hey old</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issue your having. Try deleting the dlc and clear the system cache.</p>
<p>After this download a few free arcade titles, demos or whatever that equal up to the same amount of memory as the dlc.</p>
<p>Next redownload your dlc and see if it works. </p>
<p>Hope this helps. Let us know if it doesn't work and we'll try something else. </p>

<p>&nbsp;I hope you mean I should delete only the DLC that is giving me problems - DLC for other games works fine, which is one of the reasons I'm so frustrated about this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm willing to try your suggested method, but am uncertain what is accomplished by downloading other items as an interim step, and you did not say whether they should then be deleted before re-loading the DLC I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My console's hard drives are not nearly full, anyway, since I play only relatively few games, and have downloaded only those add-ons which apply to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for your assistance!</p>

<p>You know, I just had a crazy idea. &nbsp;DLC requires the game to be updated and it's theoretically possible that the update got damaged somehow. &nbsp;Clearing the cache usually deletes them but not always... if you see a "Title Update" listed in "Fallout New Vegas"
 try deleting that and restarting the game, it should ask you to download a fresh copy automatically.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I actually did that, and deleted and re-downloaded the title update at the same time as the DLC - It's working just now, but I haven't shut the console down today, so won't know whether the problem is solved until tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Sadly, it did. &nbsp;The saved games are still listed, but the download is 'corrupted', and I can't play the DLC saves.</p>
<p>I think I'll just limp down to the local Gamestop and trade-in my original game for the fully-extended version, and screw the download mess - if it's all on the disc, there can't be any unavailable DLC... right?</p>

                    <p>I don't have much space on my SSD, hence I wanted to clean up it and scanned disk. Most highest usage is in "Users/All users/Microsoft/HVSI/" and "ProgramData/<span>Microsoft/HVSI/</span>". I googled it but with no results. Can anybody tell what is it? Can
 it be cleaned somehow? Can it be because of I'm insider because few month ago windows didn't occupied that much space.</p>

<p>Thank you for reply! Turning it off helped somehow, free up only about 500~800 MB space. They still occupy about 29 GB space each. Can it be cleaned somehow? There is only 4.2 GB free space left in my main disk.</p>

<p>Sorry, dont know.&nbsp; Have you fully Restarted your computer...use a command line to restart, maybe it will clean up or right click C drive /. properties run the system Disk Cleanup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shutdown /R /T 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just a few minutes ago enabled the same WDAG here on Enterprise, just because you reminded me to try it :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have local account login and it doesn't show in users here like yours apparently does.</p>
<p>And it wasn't showing at all before install it here - there was no HVSI folder in the ProgramData folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was you I would make system image and delete those folders if nothing else in idea's popup.</p>
