            Hello SwagakaitoYT 
<br />
<br />You can download an official Windows 10 Windows from Technet servers via this site
<br /><a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-scienc...</a>

<br />The site you used before requires certain types of product key, not OEM.
<br />The one I gave you doesn't require any key.

            Hi Swaga.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it's Factory OEM Product Key from the COA sticker on PC, those don't work to get the ISO.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated steps here for doing the best possible install which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows 7 which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-7/0ae269fd-167e-423b-94ef-26133f89e10c">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  
<br />
<br />The media is provided in Step 1.  
<br />
<br />If you haven't yet tried one for Windows 10, you can also follow the Clean Install here which resolves most problems with the inferior Upgrade or Factory Install: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Skype for desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doug oaten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My classic Skype for Desktop was simply uninstalled in the latest Windows 10 update on my PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the setup file from the Skype website, and when I ran it, it directed me to Windows Store for the "new Skype experience".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried running an older setup file, and it goes until a certain point and says there is a problem contacting the server, then directed me to the Windows Store. That's a very irritating trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DON'T LIKE and I DON'T want the "new" Skype version from Windows Store. I don't use the Metro system, I never liked it since it first appeared. I use the Windows desktop, where I have my work icons and shortcuts. Every time the very annoying screen appeared
 suggesting that I try the new Skype, I clicked on "not interested". What does "not interested" mean, after all?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work 12-15 hours every day on my PC and I use Skype professionally. I'm NOT interested in the "new features" - I need to access Skype quickly clicking on the taskbar icon and clicking on the contact and communicating with him/her . Which means that I need
 to find my contacts where they have always been, and not lost somewhere in a "cute" Windows 10 app</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me what do do. The "new" app is not an option. I woulod rather discard Skype and look for an alternative</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the moment, the classic Skype has been removed from the download page because there was an issue with the application installer itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our dedicated team is working&nbsp;to resolve it and the Classic Skype download will be available again as soon as&nbsp;the issue is corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may use <strong><a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Web</a></strong> as an alternative for the meantime if you do not prefer using the Skype app for Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a Microsoft technician, I'm just a Skype user like yourself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, your messages to the community ended up addressed to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is probably happening is that your microphone is not configured correctly in Skype
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what you can do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-Call Echo / Sound Test </p>
<p>2-In the chat window click on the "volume" icon that looks like a set of stairs in the upper right corner</p>
<p>3-That will open a window where you'll find the settings for microphone | speaker | webcam | computer | connection</p>
<p>4-Click on "microphone" - speak and you'll see a volume bar. If nothing shows in it, your microphone is not configured correctly.
</p>
<p>5-Click on the box below "Adjust Microphone Settings" and select the correct device - test each one by talking into your microphone until you see the green bar oscillating in the space below the device selection box</p>
<p>6-That should solve your problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards from Brazil</p>
<p>Doug</p>

                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Hello,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I'm running Windows 10 on an HP Probook 4530s Notebook PC. I ran "SFC /scannow" and got an error saying the System File Checker found errors but couldn't fix them. Afterwards I ran "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" and DISM
 threw the error 0x800f081f saying that the source files could not be found. I then ran "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:H:\Sources\install.wim" to direct DISM to my windows 10 disk, but this also didn't work. I don't know what to do short
 of reinstalling Windows, so any help would be appreciated. I have a screenshot of the outputs:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/45cb4f41-0248-4782-84f5-0583ed0d6463" />I<span>&nbsp;have both the DISM and
 the CBS logs if anyone wants to see them.</span></p>

            What do you mean "What did I run SFC and DISM?" Also, I just reinstalled Windows 10 on my machine and chose the option to "Keep nothing." After the install, I ran SFC /Scannow and it said that there were file corruptions that it could not fix....I'm at
 a complete loss.

<h2>            I did not receive game code &#38;quot&#59;tokens&#38;quot&#59; inside my new Assassin&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Creed Xbox One bundle. </h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>just like the title reads, I just purchased a new Xbox One Assassin's Creed bundle with Kinect off of Amazon Prime (fulfilled by Amazon). I ordered it on Thursday and received it today in the mail. I opened the Assassin's Creed branded box, which was still
 factory sealed of course, only to find there was no game redemption codes inside it. The only redemption code inside the box was for a free 14 day trial of Xbox Live Gold membership.
</p>
<p><br />
I contacted support, the only way I know how... Via online chat. I was met by an extremely unhelpful agent (Louie Anthony), who refused to take any responsibility for the codes missing from the package. He insisted the codes must have been removed from the
 unopened box by an apparent ninja working for Amazon. He insisted, I contact Amazon for the codes and then told me the package I was speaking of does not exist with "all those games" I was speaking of. I sent him a link to the Official Xbox Store of the exact
 same bundle I had purchased. He then admitted the bundle exists and is in fact sold by Microsoft but still insisted I contact Amazon for the codes.
</p>
<p>While in chat with him, I called Amazon and was told by their fast and effective customer support, that all they could do was to exchange the system. They confirmed they of course never open packages and were absolutely not responsible for the missing codes
 from the inside of a Microsoft packaged bundle. They did however, gladly offer to exchange the item, even though nothing was physically wrong with it and they did nothing wrong. So I'd have to send the entire system back to them (after I just spent the last
 two hours installing and setting it up) and wait for them to send me a completely new system. Amazon, as always, has excellent customer support, but this option is just ludicrous.
</p>
<p>After having the conversation with the Amazon representative (while still in chat with the Xbox "support" guy), I let Louie know I had contacted Amazon like he REQUIRED I do, before attempting to help me. I let him know Amazon of course never opens new packaging
 before sending the item out. I let him know that they had nothing to do with the codes and that they are listed as being inside the box. Louie said he understands and would see what he can do on his end (something he probably should have done a half hour prior).</p>
<p>After several minutes, he came back and again verified I had purchased the item directly from Amazon -- which I had already specifically told him several times. He then asked me to check inside my "limited edition packaging", and other unrelated areas for
 the codes. I informed him again, I had already checked every single piece of packaging and even taken the box completely apart and flattened it in case the paper got stuck somewhere. Then he responded with a demand for a list of things including a proof of
 purchase, photo of the contents of the package, retailer contact number used, and the name and position of the person I talked to at Amazon, and an email response of Amazon declining the item replacement. Which again verifies the fact that the guy has listened
 to nothing I've said the past two hours as I had already told him twice that Amazon was willing to exchange the system even though they had done nothing wrong.
</p>
<p><br />
So Louie responds with:</p>
<p>"I totally understand that you would not likely pay for a shipping to send back your console to the retailer. However, we really need to have the email stating came from the retailer. Best thing that we can do here is to ask for an email regarding on that
 then attach that on the email that we will send for us to receive it"</p>
<p>Which to be honest, I have no idea what he was trying to say in his broken English ... I am not willing to send the whole system back to Amazon for two game codes. That's ludicrous. I asked Louie to please escalate my issue without an email from Amazon saying
 they would gladly exchange my system with a different one. Louie then demanded I email Amazon support about this issue even though I had already spoke with them over the phone. He refused to escalate the issue without an email response from Amazon. So I guess
 I have no choice but to bother Amazon again with an issue that isn't there fault just to hopefully get this issue resolved.
</p>
<p><br />
This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced with any company in my entire life. And I am confident this issue will never get resolved. But time will tell.

<h2>            Brand new laptop, haunted by BSOD events</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I got my new laptop (hardly 6 months ago), I`ve been randomly getting BSOD events. It`s a HP EliteBook G3 that comes shipped with Win7 Pro OEM on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It`s often hard to reproduce, but the only time it happened systematically was in January when I had a PDF document that I tried to get fullscreen in Adobe Acrobat.<br />
Yesterday it crashed when just browsing webpages in FireFox58 (no multimedia, just a page with fancy CSS and images) with BAD_POOL_HEADER. I believe I`ve also seen IRQ_LESS_OR_EQUAL in the past. I didn't have Adobe Acrobat open in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I already had MDSCHED perform a memory test in extended mode (all possible tests available), but it came out with no found problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently downloading the debugging toolkit from Microsoft SDK to see if there is anything to see in the dump files, but I'm going into unknown territory here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before going on a wild goose chase, I was wondering if someone could give my extra pointers on where to look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Presumably it's under guarantee and so as it's OEM, under the terms of their OEM agreement with Microsoft, HP have to sort it out. They'll probably take control of your laptop to do it, s they did with mine Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only change since then is that I posted on their Community and a Moderator there escalated it to their Tech team. Nowadays you'll have to follow the instructions on their website&nbsp;<a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's still worth the hassle though. Hoping this helps.</p>

</p><p>However, after several days (&gt;a week by now) without email notifications, I checked in and HP has deleted my topic. Not even a direct message from a moderator with an explanation.</p>

</p><p>You need to upload some crash dump files for analysis but at least one of your messages says:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for Netwsw04.sys"</span><br />
<span>"*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for Netwsw04.sys"</span><br />
<span>"Probably caused by : Netwsw04.sys ( Netwsw04+52a22 )"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That is a network driver so before&nbsp;making any adjustments create a manual System Restore point to you have an easy way to undo any adjustments</span><span>&nbsp;if needed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system used to work fine it could be that you allowed Windows Update to install some out of date drivers on your system (not a good idea).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then hop out to the HP support page, enter your serial number, navigate to the the network/Ethernet drivers section and download/install the network driver they recommend, restart your system and see how things look.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then do this so we can know more about your system and if there are more crashes upload some recent crash dump files for analysis:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Desktop right click Computer, Properties, Advanced system settings and make it look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1846c190-a123-4853-a2b2-6cc724851ae1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b2e3a85-8647-48d8-952b-ed1397d27600" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need to create the Minidump folder as Windows will create one if it needs to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click OK enough times to close all the dialog boxes and restart your system for the changes to take effect.&nbsp; After rebooting you can go back and check the settings again to be sure the adjustments "stick".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your next reply you can supply more information that will reduce the number of question asking message cycles if you will do this:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If your system is HP what is the serial number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Describe your antivirus/antimalware environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you make the system crash at will - if there is something in particular you do that makes the system crash like watching videos, listening to music, etc. tell us what that something is that causes the system to crash every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.</p>
<p><br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.</p>
<p><br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then do whatever you have to do get the system to crash again and you should have a crash dump file to upload for analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes more than one crash dump is needed to pinpoint the cause so send some of the most recent ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the directions in the following link to upload a few of your most recent crash dump files:</p>

<h2>            Limit searched in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>How do I get File Explorer to find only folders of a specific type, such as an Excel folder/workbook? &nbsp;Example, the folder name contains "vendor". &nbsp;I do not see a place where to specify it is an excel folder. &nbsp;Windows then lists all the files in which there
 is a premedieval references somewhere in the hidden tags that has 'vendor; in them, and takes ages to find the folder I am actually looking for. &nbsp;If I dare put something more generic as my search parameter, such as '2016' - I do not think FE will get to the

    <title>How can I determine if a certain KB&#40;Windows Update&#41;, or those - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erwin john publico  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I determine if a certain KB&#40;Windows Update&#41;, or those that superseded it is already installed programatically&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Our install scenario requires a certain KB(Windows Update) to be installed. The problem is, there are packages that supersede that specific update, making the registry search for that specific KB useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I need to determine if the computer has KB-X. KB-X is superseded by KB-Y. In effect, there could be a computer that only has KB-Y because it doesn't need those it superseded.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When there is a new KB-Z that would supersede Y, it would also supersede X, which is why having a static list of those who supersede is not effective because that list would have to be updated from time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My scenario is for now, I have KB-Y. How can I determine that I don't need KB-X anymore because I have KB-Y?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>-using wuAPI, but it doesn't tell me what the installed updates have superseded.</p>
<p>-using wmic qfe but it also doesn't tell me what the installed updates have superseded</p>
<p>-using registry search but it only works if you install the KB and not those that supersede it</p>
<p>- using powershell get -wmiobject and get -hotfix but it cannot tell me what the installed updates have superseded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for my installation to determine if I have a certain KB or those that supersede it is already installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer an answer that doesn't need to update the installer from time to time.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think you are asking for the impossible. For a script to tell you that an installed update has been superseded implies that the script can extract an expiry date from the update. AFAIK there is such thing. You could achieve your aim only by maintaining
 your own central database that the script can examine.</p>

<h2>            Windows backup creates new backup everytime</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows backup </p>
<p>I am looking for clarification on windows backup.&nbsp; I recently purchased a WD mybook for backup of my system files and also files kept on another external hard drive.&nbsp; I am having trouble setting the mybook up to backup both my PC and the added drive, and
 i am not real crazy about a live backup program running all the time, so i figured i would just disable the WD smartware software and use the windows backup.&nbsp; From what i am reading, and this is confusing me, it seems like windows creates a new backup file
 every time it performs a backup.&nbsp; Now to me, i am interpreting ke what is being said is that windows copies your current files again and adds that copy every time it backs up- so if i start with 200G of data, after 3 backups, i would have 600 G or three copies.&nbsp;
 Does anyone know if this is actually how the windows backup works?&nbsp; Because if it is, i don;t think i am wild about that either.&nbsp; Any help or opinions on the easiest way to achieve backup would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

            thanks for your help - i guess i wasn't clear that i am not actually having this problem, just trying to do some research prior to settling on a backup method, and am reading that what i described and what the thread you ref'ed above provides a fix for,
 seems to be a persistent condition.&nbsp; I wanted to clarify if that was normal operation for windows backup.&nbsp; It seems that, based on the idea that there is a fix for it, that that is not the case, so i feel more comfortable using windows backup.&nbsp; I suppose if
 it happens to me, i have the fix and kind of know how to manage around it.&nbsp; Thanks a lot for your help!<br />

            <p>It's time you looked at the whole process of doing a Back-up, again.</p>
<p>READ it through, very thoroughly.</p>
<p>Especially the options.</p>
<p>Don't believe me, read it.</p>
<p>It gives you the OPTION to................................OVER-RIDE the Back-up, so that you ONLY get the ONE copy. (The LATEST, the GREATEST...every time!)</p>
<p>Personally, I do not use it (the back-up process) why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;You get ONE wrong file, the Back-up process WILL keep installing it time and time again. And, it WILL drive you nuts....trying to figure out what's causing the problem.</p>
<p>My solution to this, is,.........to 'burn everything to a DVD'. It's a whole lot safer! Properly marked, it's also much easier to use!</p>

            ok - thanks - not sure if the dvd solution would really work based on the size of all the files i am backing up- but thanks.&nbsp; what do you mean by a wrong file?&nbsp; i realize that the options are there - i am just seeing an awful lot of issues with the backup
 re -copying files and building up the backup size.&nbsp; i am wondering if it is an idiosyncratic glitch that these people are experiencing, or if this is the way the backup was designed to work.<br />

            It is not specific to any file, program etc.&nbsp; I didn't change anything other than download the Windows 10 "upgrade".&nbsp; This began immediately after the download so whatever is causing this was done during the download.&nbsp; After reading other posts with the
 same problem it appears that the only answers anyone has is tech support 101 handbook answers.&nbsp; The problem was caused by the download.&nbsp; I doubt everyone downloaded windows 10 and then decided to change all their settings, permissions, access etc..

    <title>Can Windows 8 be used to make and receive calls&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Windows 8 be used to make and receive calls&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is&nbsp;Windows 8 capable&nbsp;of talking to a mobile SIM for incoming and outgoing calls making it effectively a PHABLET? I realise this has been accomplished on Android and probably will never be allowed on iOS devices - but does anyone know the actual limitations
 in Windows 8?&nbsp; If it is a definite NO then at least I can look at other alternatives...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you had for example an ACER Iconia W511 which claims to have;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>WCDMA/HSDPA/HSUPA/HSPA+ at 850/900/1700 /1900/2100 MHz</li><li>GSM/GPRS/EDGE at 850/900/1800/1900 MHz
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there the ability within Win8 or a third party app to make this effectively a phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to carry a Win8 tablet with me instead of a 2nd phone and ipad. (My primary phone is Win8 and so is my PC so would be nice to get a Win8 tablet too).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone who has done any research into this that can point me in the right direction please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h3> davidwolf64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 keeps randomly restarting &#38; type cover stops working.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I5 256gb model. Keeps restarting on its own every time I turn it on.&nbsp; When it finally comes back on the Type cover no longer works and is not listed in the device manager. (it is listed in device manager when I first turn it on) Turn it off for a day or
 two and it will work again for a few minutes till it dose this stupid restart.&nbsp; I've installed all updates and it says their no new&nbsp;updates to install yet it keeps restarting and the type cover stops working.&nbsp; I've refreshed it and done the reinstall&nbsp; restart
 like its new a couple times then spend hours re updating and still getting the same problems.&nbsp;The only thing I have installed is Office 365 but it was doing the same thing before I installs it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If its out of WiFi range not connected to the internet it will
 work fine for a much longer period of time but eventually it will restart on its own and the type cover will stop working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting the drivers and letting windows find and reinstall the latest version</p>
<p>I've tried setting it to never sleep or shutdown and to never check for or update and still it shuts down and restarts shortly after turning it on. And lately when it comes back on it tells me windows didn't load properly&nbsp;and goes into trouble shoot mode.
 I've tried everything it recommends each time&nbsp; but I'm getting nowhere..&nbsp; </p>
<p>It will do the restart thing&nbsp;with or with out the type cover and with or with out being plugged in (power brick), connected to WiFi or not.</p>
<p>Oh and when it dose this restart thing on its own it can take a few minutes to hours before it will come back on, on its own. And nothing I do will get it to restart again till it&nbsp;does it itself&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it restarting?</p>
<p>Why does the type cover stop working?</p>
<p>How do I get this thing fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this matters or not but I bought this at BestBuy and 8 weeks ago when I tried to return it and the type cover a couple weeks later I was told by bestbuys geek squad that&nbsp;BestBuy does not warranty anything unless&nbsp;you buy their extended warranty.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I thought these things came with a one year warranty?</p>

<div>The one year warranty is the Microsoft "we will replace with a refurbished</div>
<div>device" one via Assisted Surface Support.</div>
<div><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us</a> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As I see it, you have a few (limited) options. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do a RESET (not&nbsp; refresh) or try the downloadable Recovery USB</div>
<div><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/usbrecovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/usbrecovery</a></div>
<div>(the downloadable recovery USB apparently has been updated with newer drivers</div>
<div>that what is on the recovery partition) - and extract to a FAT32 formatted USB</div>
<div>stick. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are near a physical Microsoft Retail Store, go there with everything,</div>
<div>Surface, Type cover, Pen, Powr supply, all receipts, etc. and see if you can get</div>
<div>them to exchange for a NEW (rather than a refurb) device. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have to go the online support route, you'll receive a refurbished device</div>
<div>and the experience others have posted here is not wonderful..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also try asking for the Best Buy Store Manager or even the District</div>
<div>Manager AT the store. They MAY let you swap out. </div>

            <p>hi barb</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply </p>
<p>I had all ready tried the reset, In Fact&nbsp;the last time (3rd time) I tried it I downloaded the reset files to a thumb drive and reformatted the HD with no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However </p>
<p>I finally got a day off work and was able to take the long drive to&nbsp;a Microsoft store&nbsp; They turned it on and with in a few seconds it did the random shutdown thing and would not come back on then it came back on 10 minutes later and just as quickly shut
 down showing them exactly what&nbsp;it has bin doing to me.&nbsp; They said it was undoubtedly a defective unit and
</p>
<p>After showing them my receipt they gave me a replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't ask if it was new or refurbished one as at this point a working surface even a refurbished one is better than the useless pile of junk I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you Barb and&nbsp;to the people at the Microsoft store who replaced it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And to Microsoft&nbsp; All this hype about how good these surface pro 3 models are. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How bout next time try spending your money on making a product that works&nbsp;and is reliable instead of on false advertising.
</p>
<p>Yes I said False advertising as all the post about problems on here&nbsp; and the huge pile of returns stacked on the floor ( from just one afternoon)&nbsp;at the Microsoft store indicated that I am not the only one having problems with your product.&nbsp;&nbsp; While you may
 look good on TV the word of mouth reviews from people having problems paints a much different story.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> psych13  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the fastest way to upload a video so that I can share it with another user&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Periodically, I take videos of my clinical sessions (I work as a psychologist) and I need to upload them (securely) to the internet so that my supervisor can access them to view. I used to use the programe Picture Motion Browser until my computer crashed-I
 lost the progamme but have since managed to figure out that all I need to do is&nbsp;connect my Sony camcorder to my laptop using the cable that came with the video camera (not the USB cable-the other one-I forget what it is called) and I can view the videos using
 Windows Media Player. </p>
<p>I have also tried to upload the videos to Youtube (using their Private setting) but a video as short as 5 mins. took about an hour to upload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I upload the video so that my supervisor can view it? I have a programme called Dropbox-it allows the sharing of files-I haven't tried this one yet for videos but wonder if anyone knows whether it would be better than Youtube, or whether you have
 any other ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Disconnect Microsoft Account from Windows 10 laptop&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshua barnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disconnect Microsoft Account from Windows 10 laptop&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I have a question. So, back in August I received a school laptop to use. I connected my Microsoft account to it, and now I have to turn in the laptop. How do I disconnect my Microsoft account? I tried going to Accounts in Settings, but I don't see
 any option anywhere to disconnect the account, only disable sync for it. This is important to remove the account. I don't know the administrative account details, if that matters. Please help, I have to turn in the laptop tomorrow. And no, I'm not allowed
 to delete the actual account on the computer, even if I was able to get by the admin lock to do so.

<p>How did you set up your account in the 1st place as new accounts need admin rights to be created?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all you did was change an existing account from local to MA then you just need to reverse the process in the Settings, Accounts. Then log in as that local user and delete all the files in your profile.</p>

            I connected it to an existing account in the settings menu, I forget exactly how I did it, but it was pretty simple. No Windows Key + R needed to set it up.

<p>Then Switching it back to a local account disconnects it from the MA services. The option is where I said.</p>

            <p>What version of Defender definitions do you have? If you look in Defender [HOME] tab what version is shown?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just updated mine and its at 1.217.1535.0. If yours is at the same level or higher&nbsp;( or at least above ....1490... ) then you have nothing to worry about, as you don't need to install every definition file, just the latest one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you are above ...1490... then there is nothing to worry about. If you are below ...1490.. and it will not update to or above it, then see if you can manually download the latest version from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; and manually install it. Get the right one for your PC ( W8.1 and 32 or 64 bit as required etc ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Defender for W7 was an antispyware product only and could exist with some Antivirus programs, but not all. Defender on W8 is a full AV program in its own right, and you should not need two full AV programs installed and running at the same time. But McAfee
 or your ISP should be able to confirm this. IF you decide to remove McAfee to use Defender, then obtain a copy of McAfee's removal tool from their web site and run that.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern about system recovery can be due to the configuration of your device. The specified external hard drive may have issues registering to the computer. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're prompted with the message as shown on the screenshot below.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3af4f06-4670-4859-a31a-626edd44adbb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3af4f06-4670-4859-a31a-626edd44adbb" /></a></li><li>If the external hard drive is detected by your device. You can launch File Explorer and it will be posted as a removable drive.</li><li>If you're using a USB port to connect the hard drive.<br />
</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If your external hard drive could not be detected in File Explorer, we'd recommend running the Windows troubleshooter to find and fix problems with devices and hardware. To do this, you can perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search and launch Control Panel using Cortana.</li><li>In the Search Control Panel box, type Troubleshooting.</li><li>Click on Troubleshooting.</li><li>Click on Hardware and Sound.</li><li>Click on Hardware and Devices.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If the external hard drive could not be detected, this can be due to a hardware (port or hard disk) and/or software (device drivers) issue. When using an external drive, users usually just need to click on the Refresh button to have the computer detect
 it.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87ee5bd1-b2e9-422a-bed8-ed68de842fad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87ee5bd1-b2e9-422a-bed8-ed68de842fad" /></a></p>
<p>

<p>Hello<br />
Thanks for your swift response. I have answered the questions listed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>⦁&nbsp;If you're prompted with the message as shown on the screenshot below.<br />
Yes<br />
</p>
<p>⦁&nbsp;If the external hard drive is detected by your device. You can launch File Explorer and it will be posted as a removable drive.<br />
Yes it is listed in file explorer when searching for drivers.<br />
</p>
<p>⦁&nbsp;If you're using a USB port to connect<br />
Yes both 2.0 and 3.0 - neither show the drive<br />
</p>
<p>⦁&nbsp;The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this ⦁&nbsp;link.<br />
Windows 10 Pro<br />
Version 1703<br />
Build 15063.0</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>⦁&nbsp;If your external hard drive could not be detected in File Explorer, we'd recommend running the Windows troubleshooter to find and fix problems with devices and hardware. To do this, you can perform the following<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried this and it does not resolve the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>⦁&nbsp;Note: If the external hard drive could not be detected, this can be due to a hardware (port or hard disk) and/or software (device drivers) issue. When using an external drive, users usually just need to click on the Refresh button to have the computer
 detect it.<br />
</p>
<p>It remains the same.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am unsure if I need to load some drivers for the SATA HD something like an SCHCI controller. Also, if the USB 3.0 drivers are required in order to see the drive.<br />
Do you know if this is required?</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. The detection of the system image usually doesn't rely on the type of USB port that the user is using. This is dependent on how the system recognize the device that you're using and is mostly affected by the configuration of
 the computer and the external hard drive. To further isolate your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're able to transfer the system image file to another USB device.</li><li>If the file is stored on a folder within the root folder. See example below.<br />
Root folder - E:\system recovery image file<br />
An extension folder - E:\(root folder)\Simon's recovery image(extension folder)\system recovery file</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend performing the following to check the external hard drive's partition on your device:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search and launch <strong>Command Prompt</strong> using Cortana.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>On the pop-up window, type <strong>diskpart</strong>.</li><li>After <strong>DISKPART&gt;</strong>, type <strong>list volume</strong>.</li><li>Check if the external hard drive is listed and the letter assigned to it.<br />

<p>We'd also like to request for a screenshot of your view after performing the list volume command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Using a different USB device will isolate hardware and driver issues related to the external hard drive. Using the DiskPart command will provide us a better view of the status of the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update on your concern.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with the image, It is not detecting any Hard Drives conneceted to the machine because the drivers have not been loaded into the bios configuration. From my understanding Access through the Windows system is permitted at the stage where
 the systems drives are accessible in order to obtain relevant drivers for the bios to use during the installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to select the relevant set up files but receive the error that these particular files are not relevant to any drives connected to the machine. Perhaps Microsoft is not able to answer this problem and I should approach ASUS as they have a
 better understanding of this process.</p>
