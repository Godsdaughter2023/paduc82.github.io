<h2>            Rudll32.exe and additional problems</h2>
                    <p>I am very sure I have the rudll32.exe problem and some others. I can't access anything, do a factory reset, or open any UIs. It is absolute hell and my computer could be more useful as scrap metal right now. I also can't run safe mode either ;-;. I am also
 on Windows 10 and a Toshiba with a touch screen.</p>

<p>Your subject line says "pong.exe" and your message body says "ping.exe". Both files are viruses (worms) and your computer needs to be cleaned immediately.</p>
<p>Go through these general malware removal steps systematically:<br />

            For immediate relief - If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1****
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Uninstall will happen without internet.
<br />
<br />But to block this, you will have to wait for internet. Since, you are not having internet, hence this update will not flow in till you have internet.

    <title>Bluetooth headphones connected but I can&#39;t hear anything - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wei han low  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth headphones connected but I can&#39;t hear anything</h2>
                    I have an Asus K501U on Windows 10 and usually I can pair my Apple AirPods with my laptop and listen to music. However today after I connected it (with the bloop sound) I couldn't hear any of my music. I troubleshooted and it said that it couldn't find
 any problems. According to Sounds, it says that it is playing music (green bar moving indicating that there's sound) but I could not hear it at all. I tried shifting the volume from 20% to 100% and I still couldn't hear anything. At this point I'm lost...
 Any advice/help?

            Hi Wei.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are frequent reports of this but no one solution, so I'll give you everything that works for both bluetooth and headphones:
<br />
<br />First HEADSET:
<br />
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page.  While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.

<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

    <title>Clean Install Failed, Lost Windows OS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Clean Install Failed, Lost Windows OS</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I chose to perform a clean install of my windows 10 pro OS and upon the installing it became stuck at 39%. I then received a message on a black screen stating that there no longer is an OS detected and the clean install effectively ceased. I have
 since downloaded the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool to a USB flashdrive, but I cannot get anywhere because the same problem is occurring. I am receiving the message that Windows 10 is not installed. When I attempt to install to a partition, it states that
 my drives are MBR and not GPT, and that Windows can only be installed to a GPT drive/partition. I obviously cannot repair because there is no OS to repair anymore. I also cannot choose system restore because there is nothing to choose from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I lost my OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, is there any way to get it back without purchasing a new one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this computer with the OS pre-installed and I do not have the product key, nor a windows 10 original installation CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Do not remember email address for Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thejoelawson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do not remember email address for Microsoft account</h2>
                    
<p>Firstly, Xbox, you need to get your system sorted - in terms of ease of access and clarification. So much of my time has been wasted sifting through endless amounts of crap in order to find something that is mine!</p>
<p>Problem 1. I recently purchased 12 months of Xbox Live (stupidly) and cannot redeem the code. I cannot connect to the internet if I try to sign in with my profile. If all are signed out then the internet connects perfectly, but as soon as I try to connect
 with my profile the box with the terrifying red cross appears and sweetly says 'Do you want to exit this session and waste hours trying to get back online?' with error code 800704DC. Googled it, and nothing, just endless
<strong>[Mod Removed - Language]&nbsp;</strong>about trying this and that - tried it all and got<strong> [Mod Removed - Language]</strong>. So a quick solution would be sweetly appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
Problem 2. Years ago I set up a seperate Microsoft account to use on the Xbox. Don't know the email address. Can't find it ANYWHERE. Xbox's useless 'Support' answers do eff all. And thus I cannot redeem a code on the Xbox website either.</p>

<p>Why make everything so <strong>[Mod Removed - Language]</strong>&nbsp;difficult?</p>

<p>1)</p>
<p>The error code that you received is because you are unable to download your profile from the servers. To sort this you could try resetting your router to see if you have a connection issue or use a different Ethernet cable to see if it is a cable problem
 instead.</p>
<p>2)</p>
<p>If you can sort out problem one you will very easily be able to find the email used for that account on the 360 dashboard under account management and you can then change the email if need be.</p>

<p>@ THEjoelawson</p>
<p>Is the account in question still auto-signed in on your console? There is a way to find out what your email is if it's still in there.</p>
<p>Simply go to Settings &gt; Account &gt; And then scroll to the panel on the right that says: "Your Information" under it is Billing Information. Open that and you'll see what your Microsoft Account is</p>
<p>@ FeelingName8941</p>
<p>If your password works on your laptop and you can sign in perfectly on both Xbox.com and account.live.com, then I believe you've accidentally activated your account's Two Step Verification or your proofs (that's your alternate email address and alternate
 phone number) haven't been updated yet.</p>
<p>You can fix this by going to <a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a>. Sign in and then click on Security Info</p>
<p>If the Two Step is on (it usually says: "Turn Off Two Step" if it's enabled) DO NOT TURN IT OFF; simply scroll down to the bottom of the page and find the part that says " Create / Get an App Password". This should not be confused with the Authenticator
 app or the recovery code. Once you have the code, go back to your console and do the following:</p>
<p>1. Clear your system cache 3 consecutive times</p>
<p>2. Delete your profile on the console (choose Delete Profile Only)</p>
<p>3. Restart the console</p>
<p>4. Download your profile from Xbox Live using your usual email and your NEW APP PASSWORD as your password</p>
<p>This should do the trick and allow you to sign in. Once you're able to sign in, just go back to account.live.com and turn off the Two Step.</p>
<p>Let me know if this works or not. Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm attempting to install Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC on my new Windows 7 system. The procedure is not working.</p>
<p>When I clicked the button to download XP Mode, I got a dialog which said, "Windows validation required," and went on to instruct me to download and run some "Windows validation components."
</p>
<p>I did this. After a few seconds I got a message that validation was successful, and I should click Continue to proceed with the download.</p>
<p>I did this. The dialog closed. Nothing else happened. I've tried this three times; each time the software validates my Windows installation, then does nothing.</p>

<p><span>Hi Dixiedoo35,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Vista Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Sometimes this problem is caused by two Windows registry entries that have become corrupted. To fix the problem, you have to use Registry Editor to delete the corrupted Registry entries.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, follow the steps as in the KB Article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To delete the corrupted registry entries, follow these steps:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Follow the steps as below only after you have backed up the registry.</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, in the start search box, type regedit, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
 Allow.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the navigation pane, locate and then click the following registry subkey:</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the right pane, click UpperFilters. </span></p>
<p><span>Note: You may also see an UpperFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry. Click
 UpperFilters only. If you do not see the UpperFilters registry entry, you still might have to remove the LowerFilters registry entry. To do this, go to step 8.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Edit menu, click Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</span></p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the right pane, click LowerFilters.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If you do not see the LowerFilters registry entry, unfortunately this content cannot help you
 any further. Go to the "Next Steps" section for information about how you can find more solutions or more help on the Microsoft Web site.</span></p>
<p><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Edit menu, click Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</span></p>
<p><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Exit Registry Editor.</span></p>
<p><span>10.<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            How to create virtual server on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I have a desktop with Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64bit on it, and would like to create a virtual server on it, which would coexist with the desktop OS.&nbsp; On this virtual server, I need to have Windows Server, SQL Server, and other server-based software.&nbsp;
 Is this possible, and if so, what are the correct products and steps for this?

<p>Your options include using a third party virtual machine solution such as Oracle Virtual Box or VMWare Workstation which supports Windows Server:</p>
<p>You can also use these programs to create multiple virtual machine instances. As long as you have the additional licenses, it should not be a problem. Please note, you will need to have enough memory run both the Host and Virtual machine, also, hardware
 assisted virtualization is also recommended for such scenarios.</p>

<p>Windows 7 and WMP 12 do not play several types of files out of the box, you need extra configuration. :(</p>
<p>Careful if you got this message from a ".wmv" file, which should not require any extra codec (COder-DECoder,) this kind of codec will most likely install viruses on your computer. You can see the file extension in Windows Explorer, either in the file name
 if you configured it via the "Tools|Folder options|View" menu to do so, or in the Details view, the "Type" column should display something like "WMV file", or in that case, "Windows Media Audio/Video file".</p>
<p>If it's a genuine file, for instance a Flash (".flv"), or ".mkv" file, or a Blu-Ray DVD, you need to either play it from a third party player such as VLC, or get the appropriate codec. There's a bunch of them packaged in a safe installation on shark007(dot)net,
 and for Blu-Ray, your computer probably came with a DVD playing software that should do the trick, although the codec that ships with it may not be compatible with WMP.</p>

<p>Hello Gerard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same problem as kw4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I had some problems where my computer wouldn't shut down. I decided it was time to reinstall Windows 8.1 from the installation disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I erased all my data, but when the configuration asked me to connec t to my Microsoft account, it switched automatically to a local account, because the services could not be joined at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I tried Parameters&gt;Account&gt; Connect to a Microsoft account but I keep getting the error message about network issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- yes, i'd like to connect to my Microsoft account and not a local account</p>
<p>- I was indeed able to join my account using Mozilla Firefox on www.microsoft.com</p>
<p>- I am the only one with an account on this computer, and I am an administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before reinstalling the operating system, I already had my Microsoft account linked to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting the computer after installing all the missing drivers didn't fix the problem.</p>

<p>7. Checked internet on my android phone...Result..Failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi IndraneelD, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the steps that you have tried to resolve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What happens when you search for the network in phone? If it is getting detected, do you find any signal strength after it is connected?
</p>
<p>2. Have you try to connect a different device to the Hotspot network? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally when you create a Hotspot, you should be able to detect the wifi network in the phone when you search for it. Since you have mentioned, you have tried to share the network using multiple operating systems, it looks like there could be some problem
 with the mobile device that you are using. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to connect a different android phone or any other wifi capability device and check the results. If you are able to connect to the Hotspot network, you may have to contact the Phone Manufacturer&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

            <p>the problem with win8.1 is that it is the worst version of windows. i have a problem that when i create hotspot using netsh command, the hotspot is working and on laptop both the adapters (ethernet and hotspot) are showing internet access.</p>
<p>but the hotspot adapter is not receiving packets inspite of showing internet access and also other devices, not only android but also another laptop that i want to connect to that hotspot is also not connecting.</p>
<p>the problem is with windows 8.1 only and it is the worst ever version of windows again i will say</p>
<p>such kind of issue i have not seen in win7.</p>
<p>U asked to change the device to connect to hotspot of win 8.1, that is also not working.</p>
<p>also when i use "netsh start hostednetwork" command it shows that wireless network adapter is powered down and cannot execute this command.</p>
<p>searched in device manager to check whether the driver is disabled or not. it was enabled but still not working</p>
<p>REALLY REALLY WINDOWS 8.1 is the problem in itself only.</p>
<p>if u have any solutions u can share that to me on *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

            <p>i mean to say that the laptop (win8.1) i can create hotspot connection and that hotspot adapter shows internet access. But when i connect other devices including other win 8.1 laptop to that connection they get connected but they can't access internet as
 because the hosted network itself is not receiving packets from the LAN port. Even i have tried to change the devices to connect to this hotspot.</p>
<p>If u have any solutions, especially the Microsoft team here, share it to me @ dobwal_adi at @ rediffmail.com</p>
<p>WIN 8.1 IS WORST.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info. &nbsp;I had already tried Google, but there was no info.</p>
<p>The problem corrected itself when I logged in today.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">What I think happened is that yesterday, Chrome was logging me into my.yahoo.com account as usual, BUT for some reason did it too many times automatically. I believe that Yahoo has an account access
 algorithm that prevented me from logging in from this computer with Chrome and put forth the “too many redirects” message back to me.&nbsp; All I needed to do is wait for several hours (maybe as many as 12) and then I could log in directly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that this helps others.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Xbox One and Media Center</h2>
                    
<p>Will the new TV functionality of the Xbox One work with TV tuners working through Windows Media Center? I invested in a Ceton tuner and I'm currently using Media Center to stream to 4 Xbox 360's throughout my house. Will I be able to do the same through
 Xbox One?</p>

<p>I am very interested in the same question. We run an OTA antennae to our windows 8 computer and use WMC app on two Xbox 360's. Works fantastic. Hope they still have an app on Xbox One.
</p>
<p>Also, please allow us to pin the WMC app. It gets annoying to have to dig a few menu layers down each time to get to it. Or at least allow it to be in the recent section.
</p>
<p>But most of all, please keep the functionality of being able to DVR my OTA programs.

<p>agreed, i'm in same situation, use Media Center Extender extensively across my two 360's to get to my dedicated media center with a ceton tuner. &nbsp;I've also set up a buddy of mine as with the same set up at his house.</p>

<p>While I hope the answer is yes to the Xbox one having the Media Center Extender functionality, at least I have a back up plan. Major Nelson did say that you can run pretty much any device into the input on the One. Including your current 360 or a HTPC.</p>

<p>What I'm hoping for is to be able to use the extender capability (or the HDMI pass-thru), along with the same features that were demonstrated at E3. It would be nice to be able to control everything with voice and gestures, while not having to have a separate
 cable-box hooked up. I already have my CableCard running through my Media Center PC and XBox 360, so to have it more integrated with the XBox One would be great.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree, I would also be okay with HDMI Passthrough with my WMC PC, as long as we can take advantage of the overlay features as well.</p>

<p>As a casual gamer, the extender capabilities are a must if I am to pick up a One. &nbsp;I have 4 360s running WMC and the system works great. &nbsp;The idea of hooking up a 360 or a HTPC to the One is way more trouble than it is worth. &nbsp;If that is the case I can pick
 up a GoogleTV box and do the same thing today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The silence on this issue isn't encouraging, I think MS is hoping to abandon WMC and have cable companies flock to them to use the One as an all in one cable box. &nbsp;</p>

<p>WMC capabilities are kind of a go/no-go for me. WMC feels like Zune though. As awesome as it is, it's the neglected child.</p>

<p>Someone set a policy on your machine to enforce certain rules about passwords. Best to ask this person to modify these rules for you. Alternatively you can run gpedit.msc, then follow this path to change them yourself: Local Computer Policy / Computer Configuration
 / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Account Policy / Password Policy.</p>
<p>Note also this:<br />
- You cannot delete the inbuilt Administrator account.<br />
- Having administrator accounts with a blank password is a big security risk.</p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(76, 81, 86, 1)">Hi,&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(76, 81, 86, 1)">I was given as a gift, while ago, MS Flight Simulator X Gold Edition. I wasn't a fan so I played maybe a few times, it
 was too hard to play with keyboard and mouse, so I put it back. I have found it 2 days ago and since I have a proper controller now I thought I would give it a try. Unfortunately there was no booklet and a product key inside, therefore I cannot activate the
 game. I am not going to download any illegal cracks on my system, I keep it 100% clean, but I do not know what to do, if there is any chance for me to activate the game. I called the activation line, but it's automated and even though I provided the ID, it
 seems they automate cannot help me. I know it's a very old game (I think it's about 5 years old or even older) but apparently it works on my PC. I still don't know if I like it or not, but the training missions seem to be entertaining enough to play longer.
 Any advice?</span>

            <p>I'm an old FSX user and love it tremendously - more so because it allows me to carry out many functions that are not dissimilar to what real world pilots perform. &nbsp; Why I say this, is that it can be played as a game (i.e. to whizz around, crash into buildings,
 etc.), but it was developed primarily to satisfy the desires of those who are keenly interested in aeronautics and to then play out their inner desires, or even to whet the appetite of those who may have a simple interest in flying and help them to proceed
 further in their knowledge and enjoyment. &nbsp; Hope it will be the same for you. &nbsp;By the way, it was released in 2006 and still enjoyed by many, even though we were disappointed when Microsoft no longer wanted to develop it further. &nbsp; Microsoft Flight, its successor
 was ultimately a failure - a much simpler version of FSX and was published as a free download; &nbsp;you may still be able to download it, though several hundred Mb's in size. &nbsp; No registration needed for this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to your problem: &nbsp;if your disks are genuine and out of the box, there should be a Product Key stuck onto the inside DVD cover. &nbsp; But obviously not in your case as you didn't get a booklet either. &nbsp; The fact that you can download the Sim and use it, albeit
 for a short time before it stops working, is noteworthy. &nbsp; Sadly, without registering the Sim, it is not possible to get the full potential from it - you will be constrained to its time limit (half an hour I think). &nbsp; Not having tried this, though my only
 suggestion is that you <strong>save</strong> the flight you're on (particularly if you know of the approaching time limit), let the Sim stall, exit it and then reload it. &nbsp;Then reload the saved flight and continue on. &nbsp; Not ideal by any means, but I'm afraid
 that's all you can do.</p>

            Now I'm saving the game, but I have the addon (acceleration) which I cannot install because of the game not being activated. And agreed on the MS Flight opinion. That game is not the best, I have played it a while ago, it was pre-installed on my PC but
 free missions are not satisfactory at all.&nbsp;

            <p>MS Flight was not only lacking in choices (in aircraft, regions of the world, missions, etc.), but also in aircraft aerodynamics. &nbsp; FSX was far superior in my opinion and it gives the flexibility of both aircraft and other general tweaking to bring it to
 better standards and personal preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have FSX Deluxe (not the Gold edition as you have). &nbsp; As you probably know, the essential difference is that you don't need to download the Service Packs (1 &amp; 2) as optional, since the Gold Edit. has them included; &nbsp;Gold Edit. also has other aircraft,
 scenery, etc. which I don't have. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In your situation, with not having the product key for activation, you say that you are unable to use the Acceleration addon. &nbsp; Not knowing about this aspect, is it possible to keep FSX as is on your drive (i.e. without Accel.) and download SP1 (208 Mb)
 and see if it installs? &nbsp; You can read about the service packs prior to installing: &nbsp;both SP1 and SP2 are important but SP2 (166 Mb) mainly deals with Multiplayer issues. &nbsp;This still does not give you a solution for your unactivated FSX and its limited use
 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, and probably the best option, is to follow the instructions on this MS Support Link (particularly the section on 'How to replace a damaged or lost product key', which seems to apply to your situation):</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/973457</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope something helps - would be sad to see a potential FSX user miss out on a great flying experience!!</p>

<h2>            Upgraded from Windows 7 to windows 10 now my wifi can not turn on because of airplane mode</h2>
                    I have a HP pavilion dv6-6c35dx entertainment PC Laptop. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
After upgrading from Windows&nbsp;7 to Windows 10, my Wi-Fi will not turn on.&nbsp;The problem is my f12 key is my&nbsp;toggle for Wi-Fi off and on when I had windows&nbsp;7 now in windows 10 it is for toggling airplane mode on and off. I can toggle the switch for airplane mode
 but will not allow me turn on Wi-Fi. I have also attempted to turn it on from desktop shows loading like it's going to turn on and just stay off.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;I have reinstalled windows 10 multiple times. I have done recovery, restore, and all the troubleshooting&nbsp;my
 computer and windows 10 has to offer. I have tried&nbsp;r</span>einstalling the wireless network adapter driver did not resolve the problem, and there doesn’t appear to be any problem with the wireless adapter or its driver.</span> I have updated all drivers uninstalled
 and reinstalled and still no Wi-Fi. I have even gone online forums looking for solutions and none of them have worked. Please help I am ready to just through this laptop away. It's not useful If it can not have Wi-Fi access.

            <p>You're saying all the right things, it should be working.</p>
<p>Often when someone has that problem the fix usually is&nbsp;simply uninstall the wifi adapter in device manager, followed by a restart - and windows will automatically&nbsp;install the drivers correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model number of your Wi-Fi card.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>About how old is the laptop ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't throw your laptop out, but maybe upgade its Wi-Fi card to AC or something.&nbsp; Might be surprised at how easy it is to do that and quite&nbsp;inexpensive a newer card too if shopped for carefully.</p>

            <p>Not quite the same issue, but on my Surface pro 4, a recent update, I am not sure which, has reversed the sense of Airplane mode. Now, when it is highlighted as 'on' it is off and vice versa. The same is true of my Surface pro 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very perplexing, but the fact of it having arisen on both machines at broadly the same time does suggest a consistent error with an update. However, my Windows phone does not seem to have the same issue.</p>
