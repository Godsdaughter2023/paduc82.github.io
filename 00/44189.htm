            <p>Yaqub,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to read your reply twice. I couldn't believe that this is actually a "thought" out "design". WHY?? This has to be the most annoying part of any software I have ever used. Every time I am using Edge to do anything on the Internet the scroll disappears
 and I have to fumble with my mouse to get it to appear again. This is so "STUPID". Software should be designed to make my life easier and more efficient!!! Period.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you please explain to me and as I have Googled "millions of other people" why you would have this annoying scroll do the disappearing act. Please throw me a bone and give me an explanation and more important a WORKAROUND.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I so don't want to go back to using Firefox because Edge is fully integrated into Win 10 but for the time being I am going to have to jump ship on Microsoft's new and dazzling Edge. Please repair this ASAP.</p>

            Generally, I had trouble with using the scroll bar as well, and that was from the start.&nbsp; A single click on the scroll bar would register as two clicks and bring the page two screens up or down, making it hard to navigate without using the scroll wheel,
 which is hard for me to follow.&nbsp; So what is the workaround?&nbsp; Where is the setting to stop the auto-hide?&nbsp; Why doesn't Microsoft make this part of&nbsp;the accessibility page or make the settings more user-friendly?&nbsp; That is the main concern I have at this point.&nbsp;
 I am using a laptop, not a pad.&nbsp; I also need to widen the scroll bar to make it more accessible.&nbsp; This is a simple fix, and not a big project for Microsoft.&nbsp; MANY people did not upgrade to Windows 8.1 (And I was part of the beta trial and used it for a time
 until I got sick and tired of moving left to right and back right to left just to navigate).&nbsp; Because of this failing of Microsoft to sell the touch-screen,&nbsp;it &nbsp;had too&nbsp

            <p>Okay Mr. Yaqub Khan, enough is enough. Why haven't you replied to mine our anybody else's complaint about this situation. Really??? Is this the way Microsoft is operating now? It is your job and your duty to respond to your customers and the Microsoft community
 at large. I can't even fathom how many millions of people right now are fishing with there mouse to get the scroll bar to reappear. Lets just say that every&nbsp;person spends 2 seconds to fondle their mouse and let's multiply that by 300,000,000 people. That works
 out to 166,000 hours WE are having to deal with a&nbsp;Microsoft idiocy. And, you don't have the decency or respect to pop on this page and say "Hey, I'm here and we hear you". &nbsp;Shame on you and Shame on Microsoft.

<p>I have defended Microsoft and Windows for 30 years. I love Windows. Always have and always will. No Apple guy here but this puts my faith and loyalty for Microsoft in question. Please stand up and explain.

            <p>Mr. Khan &amp; Microsoft Support:</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, we are still awaiting your reply.&nbsp; This is an ACCESSIBILITY problem.&nbsp; We do not need a zoom feature, this is simple.&nbsp; On prior editions of Windows 7 and before, there were settings that went to the user interface to the point the user could
 mess it up and have to backtrack.&nbsp; I am sure that, unless the kernels are falling off the cob, that you have the same base code.&nbsp; I am not a software engineer, but I was using windows and the Internet when we had rudimentary browsers and no voice over the
 Internet for the common user, circa 1996, because of bandwidth.&nbsp; Now we have VOIP and can't get rid of a webcam that is operational staring into our faces whenever it is active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make the feature, here it is:&nbsp;&nbsp;give the option of making the scrollbar twice as wide and turn off the auto-hide.&nbsp; I don't have to rant to make my point and I took my time and effort to give you my opinion.&nbsp; I don't think I am asking too much.&nbsp; I have bought
 numerous versions of Windows as a student and as a consumer, and I am sitting here with both a problem with my hand and my eyes and this effort on your part WILL give a lot of man-hours to all of us, including your tech support; which was very good now, BTW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are the only game in town for MANY of us.&nbsp; Please don't abuse that concession.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for YOUR time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Always, Dano</p>

            <p>A very well constructed piece of criticism O-Friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't really think I need to say a great deal more than you already have BUT I WILL put my 2 cents worth in anyways....because this issue is bugging me to put it quite nicely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I have just left to right and vice versa touch-padded 32 times just to view this thread on my new AlienWare which I thought I would also install this....erm....latest and greatest new MS OS on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could take the opportunity to voice one more concern&nbsp;besides:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) the disappearing scroll bar </p>
<p>b) the tiny, tiny arrows to navigate said scrollbar up and down&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) that I have also experienced the skipping issue where my place on the page is totally lost and I then have to play make the mystical disappearing scroll bar appear again just so I can get back to where I was</p>
<p>
</p><p>.... it would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) the quite handy little shortcut back to the Desktop in the bottom right hand corner of the taskbar which I became fond of in Windows 7 is also now miniscule, as it also was in Windows 8.1 before I went the 10 upgrade path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please attend to these issues MS&nbsp;- because if you listen to&nbsp;your customers (or in my case user because I took a free upgrade) and fix them you have a beautiful OS&nbsp;at hand - you have the money and the resources so get to it!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 30 day waiting period is so that only the owner can cancel it, normally you would only not be able to access the account at all, but I have seen it to where it wont let you sign in to account.live.com only and it will let you sign in to you xbox, just
 keep in mind that if on your xbox it asks you to verify your security info you will not be able to, the way around this is to turn the xbox off and try again and again and again until it goes in, but there is the chance that you will be unable to access your
 account at all for 30 days.</p>

<p>you still can update your billing info on your 360, this 30d security lockout is not affecting your</p>

<p>I just changed my account phone number. &nbsp;The system now tells me my account has limited access for a mandatory 30 DAYS!! &nbsp;Hard to comprehend. &nbsp;I am unable to purchase and download games for 30 days (I tried). &nbsp;<strong>Why does Microsoft punish customers
 who attempt to keep account information up to date? &nbsp;All I wanted to do was buy Witcher 3. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I was stupid to give Microsoft another try. I am excited to buy a Playstation and forget I ever heard of Microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yes, I tried to use Microsoft support chat. &nbsp;It gave me a wait time of less than one minutes. &nbsp;After waiting 10 minutes I gave up.</p>
<p>30 days for a phone number update. &nbsp;I can only reason that Microsoft is intentionally punishing paying customers as some sort of experiment.. &nbsp;I just want out. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I just updated my number after signing in on my new iPod, then got limited access for 90 days. I tried to play some Black Ops and got denied! I cannot view the Xbox Store or anything. I talked with the Support Chat, and after a lengthy conversation he was
 unable to do anything(because HACKERS) but he "understands" how I feel. -_- There is no way to expedite the 30-day lock out, nor is there a number to call to verify your account. I ended up getting a free One Month trail.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In most cases if the games are removed from the computer its files will still remain on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest that you search for the game files in the system32 folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click
<strong>on Start menu</strong> later click on <strong>run</strong> and type
<strong>c:\\windows\system32</strong> in the following window search for the games file like for free cell. If you get the files in the system32 folder later copy the file to the c:\\program files\start menu\ later in the game folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step fails you may try a system restore to the point when games were available on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Notepad dissapears unless full screen</h2>
                    Not sure where the right forum for this question is,&nbsp;so giving this a try.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using windows xp (sp 3)&nbsp;in a large company environment where the company has a specific, custom Windows&nbsp;build for all employees.&nbsp; I am a programmer so I use notepad a lot.&nbsp;
 I used Intel Graphics to change which one of my monitors was left and right.&nbsp;&nbsp; After I did that when I opened notepad it didn't appear on any screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way I can see the notepad is to find the notepad session I opened in the task bar and select maximize.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 If I select the option of moving to the smaller window from the maximized window, notepad appears nowhere on any monitor, just on the task bar.&nbsp; Any way to get notepad working in the minimized mode again?

Now use the arrow keys to get it in the screen. Close all other windows except

            Hi AnonymousPirate
<br />
<br />Try a Startup Repair to see if that will resolve this, if not, the best option may be to roll back that update . . .
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />If not, go back into the Recovery Environment:
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows

            Hi Kiley, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />You want use Blu Ray player as a DVD drive purely, or are you trying to output to your monitor? If you meant the latter then you would need two video inputs on your monitor (not related to your PC).
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have issue with drivers try follow this solutions:
<br />
<br />Reinstall a device that appears in Device Manager with an exclamation mark:
<br />
<br />	1. Open Device Manager and plug in the drive.
<br />	2. Locate "DVD/CD-ROM Drives". Click on the “&gt;” next to it.
<br />	3. Right-click on the device with the exclamation mark next to it and click ‘Disable Device’ to turn it off.
<br />	4. Right-click on it again and click ‘Properties’.
<br />	5. In the window that pops up, click on the ‘Driver’ tab.
<br />	6. Click on ‘Uninstall Device’, and then follow the instructions carefully to ensure that you uninstall the drivers (IMPORTANT: you may need to click on a checkbox to confirm that you want to uninstall the drivers).
<br />	7. Unplug the external drive from the USB ports.
<br />	8. Shut down your computer (be sure to shut it down fully, don’t just restart it).
<br />	9. With the computer powered off, plug in the external drive to the USB ports.
<br />	10. Restart the computer and let it boot up.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Reinstall a device incorrectly identified by Device Manager:
<br />
<br />	1.  Open Device Manager and plug in the drive.
<br />	2. If “Intio Combo Device Class” appears in the Device Manager go to the next step. If "Intio Combo Device Class" does not appear, check the next possible solution.
<br />	3. Click on the “&gt;” next to it, and you should see something called “Initio Default Controller” appear underneath.
<br />	4. Right-click on “Initio Default Controller” and click ‘Disable Device’ to turn it off.
<br />	5. Right-click on it again and click ‘Properties’.
<br />	6. In the window that pops up click on the ‘Driver’ tab.
<br />	7. Click on ‘Uninstall’, and then follow the instructions carefully to ensure that you do uninstall the drivers (IMPORTANT: you may need to click on a checkbox to confirm that you want to uninstall the drivers).
<br />	8. Unplug the external drive from the USB ports.
<br />	9. Shut down your computer (be sure to shut it down fully, don’t just restart it).
<br />	10. With the computer powered off, plug in the external drive to the USB ports.
<br />	11. Restart the computer and let it boot up.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Manually repair corrupted registry entries
<br />
<br />WARNING!  Editing the registry may cause your system to become unstable or unable to boot. Before you use this method, it is highly recommended that you make a full back-up of your registry first. In case something goes wrong, you can simply restore the registry to its original form.  
<br />
<br />	1. Press WIN+R at the same time to invoke a Run command.
<br />	2. Type in regedit and press Enter. 
<br />	3. Follow the path 
<br />	4. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\ {4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
<br />Look for UpperFilters and LowerFilters strings on the right side panel. Right click them and choose Delete.

<p>As mentioned it is connected via HDMI ports.</p>
<p>The HDMI cable is good as I have used it successfully to connect the BluRay player to a TV</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that DVD/CD-ROM is not shown in Device Manager.</p>

    <title>Gametype Idea - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessefoderingham thompson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gametype Idea</h2>
                    
<p>Of course, this would be for BF3 not BC2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is pretty much war from COD, but I've always wondered why battlefield never has it, because it seems perfectly suited to the game. Please, when you picture this, picture a map like Atacama Desert from BC2.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&gt;There are five flags on the map, as well as each teams bases. <br />
<br />
&gt;Flags are placed in a rough line following the map layout.<br />
<br />
&gt;Each team starts with no flags, and can only capture the next flag from their base, then the next flag after that (etc A, Then B then C or, if it was the other team E then D then C)<br />
<br />
&gt;A team wins by capturing all the flags on the map, then capturing the enemy base, cue final cut scene. (of course the enemy would have a safe spawn area behind their base)<br />
<br />
The fastest way to win would be to destroy the enemy base, but of course, the game could go on forever, so....<br />
<br />
&gt; The team with most flags slowly drains the enemy teams health, faster with more flags of course, and depleting the enemy teams health would be a win. Team health would have nothing to do with spawning, or the game would dissolve into a very long game of TDM.<br />
<br />
&gt;Additional momentum could be given to the team with the highest kills per minuet (separately as momentum from capturing flags) I'm not sure about this idea though.<br />
<br />
I hope i was concise enough, and that doesn't sound overcomplicated, i tried to make it a simple as possible. Basically i think this mode would be perfectly suited to consoles (with less players) especially, as it would force both teams to meet in battle head
 on, and there would be a lot of action. What do you think?</p>

<p>sounds pretty conquest like.. </p>
<p>the problem with that is, that the enemy is ALWAYS attacking form one side.. they cant corner you, or flank you. and that is just the thing i like in Battlefield games.</p>

<p>I would say it is like Onslaught only adjusted for multiplayer. Saying "COD" is kind of taboo around these parts.</p>
<p>Otherwise, yeah. War on COD3 was the most fun I have ever had on a COD game. Awesome game mode.</p>

<p>@ Dusty Arne That was the idea i was going for. You have to face the other team head on. Anyway i think its more rush like than conquest like. You could still do plenty of flanking as long as the maps are open enough though.
</p>
<p>@AssyrianWarfare Agreed, war on COD WAW was actually pretty good. However much we hate it, COD has had a handful of really good ideas. I'm just really surprised DICE never put war in other BF game, it just seems so perfect......</p>

    <title>Unresponsive Kinect followed by frozen Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryantrem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unresponsive Kinect followed by frozen Xbox</h2>
                    
<p>I think this question belongs here as it is about a system error related to the Kinect and not Kinect usage... anyway, yesterday while using my Xbox One my Kinect stopped responding to voice commands. I went to Settings and selected Kinect and I believe
 there was an option I selected that said something like "my Kinect can't hear me." This launched a page that wanted to calibrate the Kinect microphone, and my Xbox One hung on this screen. I tried turning the Xbox One off and then back on, and it just showed
 a white rectangle border in the middle of a black screen and that's it. I turned it back off, unplugged the power supply, waited 30 seconds, plugged it back in, and turned it on. It turned back on and then the Kinect started working again, but my audio didn't
 work initially. It was all garbled for about 2 minutes and then suddenly started working normally. I'm not sure if these are two unrelated issues or not, but I wanted to know whether this/these are known issues, or if others have run into this problem...</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />
Ryan</p>

<p>I've literally just suffered a similar issue.</p>
<p>Launched Xbox Fitness and it asked for me to plug in the Kinect, even though it already was, for literally 4-5 seconds before launching the Xbox Fitness screen. After that, Kinect would not respond.</p>
<p>Used the controller to browse programs and tried to launch one, then the machine froze.</p>
<p>It now will not respond to Kinect or the controller. </p>
<p>The wife is doing a workout (which is why we were launching fitness), so I'm leaving it for a while to see if it works after some downtime.</p>
<p>Not good either way.</p>

<p>I had the *exact* same issue as you described to the T. &nbsp;The only thing that got it working finally is the following:</p>
<p>1. Switch the Xbox one off.</p>
<p>2. Unplug the Kinect from the Xbox.</p>
<p>3, Unplug the power chord from the Xbox.</p>
<p>4. Wait 30 seconds.</p>
<p>5. Plug the Kinect back in.</p>
<p>6. Plug the Power back in.</p>
<p>Everything worked fine and dandy after that. &nbsp;Hope that helps. &nbsp;Now I'm afraid of launching Xbox Fitness again :)</p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Ran into pretty much the exact same problem. &nbsp;Kinect commands seemed to be unresponsive, then after I powered it down and tried to power it back on it was stuck on the splash screen with the black Xbox logo. &nbsp;I followed SamiTak and Naxos' advice and it did
 solve the problem, after powering it down and unplugging it waiting 30 seconds and plugging it back in everything seems to back in working order... knock on wood. &nbsp;Things I thought everyone should know, &nbsp;Yesterday I did use the kinect for working out, but
 today all I did was use the CW app and watch TV before it stopped working. Also another thing to note, &nbsp;before it stopped working I noticed that smartglass app wasn't connecting like it should have.</p>
<p>So does anyone from Microsoft have any insight to this? &nbsp;Do I have to worry about my system permanently crashing? What is causing this issue, and will there be an update soon to fix it?</p>

<p>I literally just had the same problem Xbox decided that SmartGlass would no longer communicate voice commands no longer work the controller buttons no longer work and controller no longer works. &nbsp;I did as suggested an 'cycled power' on the x1 as if it were
 my comcast modem. that seems to have fixed the issue. &nbsp;I was using netflix only. upon reaching around the unit to disconnect the power cord, I noticed a fair amount of heat coming from the top right venting panel. &nbsp;I'm hoping this isn't a cooling issue AGAIN
 like we learned about with the 360. you know what's disappointing? I only had the unit on or about two hours (more precisely the time it takes to watch the avengers movie.) &nbsp;an explanation from Microsoft would be warranted. a link to further information would
 be appreciated </p>

<p>Same issue here. &nbsp;I started Kinect Fitness and the screen wouldn't load. &nbsp;I went back to home to close the app and restart and that's when the controller became unresponsive. &nbsp;The kinect light was still on but voice commands would not work. &nbsp;Turned it off
 and could start hitting the home button on the controller but nothing else would register from the controller. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up unplugging the kinect AND unplugging the power cord. &nbsp;Waited about 2 minutes and reconnected and started using the on switch on the console. &nbsp;Powered up and worked just fine after that. &nbsp;Thank god.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I log out or restart my laptop, Windows 10 switches my default browser back to Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty frustrating - has anyone else had this problem or have a fix?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand that you are facing issues with the default apps and I am glad to assist you on this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know which web browser have you set a default before Internet Explorer? Is it Microsoft Edge or other third party web browser?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1: </strong>To ensure that you have set the particular web browser as default, cross check it once again.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Enter Default programs, and then tap or click <strong>Default Programs</strong>.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>Set your default programs</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>browser</strong> from the list of programs.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>Set this program </strong>as default, and then tap or click OK.</li></ol>
<p><strong>2: </strong>If the issue persist, you may also check your internet security/anti-virus program. It might be preventing the changes from being saved. You could try turning off your security software, make the changes and close all your browser Windows
 and see if the changes are&nbsp;saved.&nbsp;If yes, turn on your security software and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3: </strong>Also p<span>erform an SFC (System File Checker) scan on your system for any corrupted file settings.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press
<strong>Windows + X</strong> on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<strong>Command prompt admin</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt type “<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>” (no quotes), and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Do
 not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsoft Camera Codec Pack stopped working in Windows 7 Home Premium, reinstall does not solve problem.</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I've been an avid user of the Microsoft Camera Codec Pack, and it has worked great since I installed it - up to this point.<br />
A few days ago I noticed that my RAW / CR2 files weren't being displayed in windows photo viewer (neither were the thumbnails).<br />
<br />
I tired reinstalling the codec pack with no success; the install process works fine, but after reboot the same problem remains (this also applies when I "repair" Camera Codec Pack). I have tired both the x86 version and 64 bit to no avail.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'm at my wits' end, and I would greatly appreciate some help : ) <br />
<br />
Running on Windows 7 Home Premium and my camera is a Canon 5d Mk II. <br />

============================================<br />
If the following codec pack is a newer version <br />
it may be worth a try.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

(Windows 7, Windows Vista Service Pack 2)<br />
Installing this package will allow supported RAW <br />

<br />
Also there is a retail (not freeware) alternative:<br />
(at least there is a 15 day free trial)<br />

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8/8.1 The Product Key on preinstalled Operating Systems (HP, Acer, etc) is embedded in the BIOS in the Motherboard, so that the lost and/or worn C.O.A. Sticker problem is no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reinstall it will pick up the Product Key and activate the system&nbsp;automatically.</p>

<h2>            Spam bots</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've been asked by Xbox support to make a thread about spam bots spamming accounts (to bring it to the enforcement teams attention). Last night, I got similar messages from multiple gamertags banging on&nbsp;about live webcam shows. As kids use this service, these spam bots need dealing with before they become a bigger issue. I have the gamertags&nbsp;and conversations in full, but not sure I can post the gamertags on the forum, as they could be hijacked accounts.</p>

            I'm trying to install this app, it doesn't give me a option to uninstall. It says "Try it again Error, see detail" I have two options after that, I can either retry or hit the X. If I hit the X it will just restart the download. Also it will only get to
 about 1-4gbs and stop with one of these 3 Error Codes: 0x80080207 , 0x80073CF9, and 0x80073CF0. The Error Code 0x80073CF9 is the most&nbsp;often one to pop up. I'm running out of options, here's a list of things I've tried. I have tried: refreshing the store cache,
 cleanboot, adding AUInstaller to C:\Windows, adding AppReadiness to C:\Windows, I have restarted my pc multiple times, I have uninstalled the app when given the option, and I have check for windows error.

<p>With Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to reinstall Windows 8 on your system:</p>
<span>
<p>How to reinstall Windows 8</p>
</span></span>
<p>You have a couple options:</p>
<p>If you would like to reinstall Windows 8, which means removing apps and personal files and settings, you can use reset and refresh. This is equivalent to a clean install.</p>
<p>To do it, do the following:</p>
<p>· Press <b>Windows key + i</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>· Click <b>Settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>Change PC settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>General</b> in the left column</p>
<p>· Under <b>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</b>, click <b>Get started</b></p>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>

<h2>            Recovering a Product Key for Windows 7 from a smudge sticker</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I purchased a separate Windows 7 64-bit installation disk for my new computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5 months ago, I tried the free upgrade to Windows 10, I liked it at first but some of my programs were behaving weirdly, and at the last update, I've been getting registry errors. So I decided to Fresh-Install my Windows 7 again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started installing when I noticed the Product Sticker was slightly smudged, I can't make out the last 5 digits. Is there any way to get the product key from the other information in the sticker?

<p>When you say "I am not allowed to change the power settings ..." I'm not sure what message or error you are getting, but I went into "Help and Support" on mine and searched on "power settings" and found the following which may help:</p>
<p>Why can't I change power settings?</p>
<div>
<p>Your user rights, restrictions imposed by your 
system administrator or your computer's hardware configuration, might limit which settings you can change. If your computer is part of a network at an organization—such as a school or business—your organization's system administrator might have disabled
 or even removed certain settings by using 
Group Policy . If you think that Group Policy is preventing you from changing a setting that you need to change, contact your system administrator.</p>
<p>To change power settings on a computer that you're connected to by using Remote Desktop Connection, you must be logged on as an administrator on the remote computer.</p>
<p>For more information about how to change power plan settings, see Change, create, or delete a power plan (scheme) .</p>

    <title>Update Error&#58; 0x8b050033 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update Error&#58; 0x8b050033</h2>
                    
<p>This update error code reads:</p>
<p>This error means that your Xbox One requires a system update, but the update is not currently available. This error could occur if there’s an issue with the Xbox servers. Try again later.</p>
<p>This error started happening 2 days ago with Call of Duty Ghosts.&nbsp; Could there still be an issue with the Xbox servers?&nbsp; I have troubleshooted my network connection and it works just fine.&nbsp; I also power cycled my device but still I'm getting the same error.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
