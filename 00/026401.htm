    <title>Microsoft phone apps have vanished including settings and phone info - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lorapandora  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft phone apps have vanished including settings and phone info</h2>
                    Hi&nbsp;<br />
No idea what type of Microsoft phone I have (cant remember and the option on phone that usually tells me is no longer there, its possibly a lumina 640 going by google pics) but one minute it was working in my hand fine, the next the majority of all apps (off
 home screen and in "All apps" list) had vanished.&nbsp;<br />
Camera, settings, photos, internet, store, maps etc all gone. I'm basically just left with One note, news and people. I don't even have a make a call option any more to to view my call history or missed calls :( wouldn't even be able to call 999 if needed!
 I'd have to go into "people" and add it as a new contact before calling it!<br />
I've been able to access store on my phone by searching for an app, it saying my phone doesn't have it and bringing up an option to go to the store, then when I click on the app in store it says I already have it?! No option to install, just launch. I'm able
 to open camera by going via that route, but unable to install it or find it on my phone anywhere.&nbsp;<br />
So surely these apps are on my phone, but not showing up?&nbsp;<br />
Helppppp please. I hate this phone so much and I'm kind of glad it's finally had it, but I can't get a new one for at least a few weeks and I have no idea if I've been missing calls and opening the camera via store is still pointless because I still can't actually
 do anything with them or access the photos anywhere (I'm hoping I can list enough stuff on ebay to get a new phone faster, but knocked at the first hurdle by being unable to take and use pics)&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<h2>            the converter failed to save the file</h2>
                    
<p>This morning when I tried to download a few MS Office (Excel) files from my work's collaborative site, the file downloads and kicks back this error in a dialogue box "the converter failed to save the file". I googled this and it appears to be a common issue,
 but I can't find the fix...</p>
<p>Excel was working fine yesterday opening these same files, and I haven't ran any updates or changes (to my knowledge)...I use MS Office 2010 on Windows 7.</p>
<p>I cleared my temporary internet files and restarted, but didn't help...Running out of ideas.</p>

            Now I found that with Office 2007 running on XP or Vista when this error occured.&nbsp; An uninstall/reinstall of office fixed the issue.&nbsp; Whether or not this is viable solution for you would be up to you, just thought I'd let you know.

<p>
</p><p>This is a disturbing problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open task manager at the same time I get an operator message, this screen appears. It doesn't go unless I restart my phone. Itâ€™s a kind of stuck in a loop. I have seen this
 error earlier. I'm not very sure what causes the error. When you touch the Windows logo, it gives me the vibration feedback. So the system is functional, but it is stuck somewhere.</p>

            I tried a soft reset. But the problem is still there. This time, I take it out of my pocket, I got the same screen as in the screenshot. This is getting really annoying...! It might have gone to the error screen when I put it in my pocket.

<p>I watched TV movie that requires Flash on N900. The movie stream was displayed in jerking motion manner. Could anyone explain to me why and what i need to do to improve the movie watching experience? Any suggestion appreciated.</p>

            from your question I assume this isn't a buffering problem, and may be because you are trying to watch "desktop" grade flash video on the N900, something it currently struggles with. Worth checking out the BBC iplayer threads on Maemo talk eg.
<a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=34173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=34173</a> to see what others have been saying about the flash player capability. If you think it is buffering then let us know what wireless you are using

<p>I am facing similar problem despite the video is buffered far out! Following is my post from 1st Feb 2010. Hope someone reads it and helps............</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wondering if I am the only one facing this problem or if someone has solution to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a couple of problems which I have encountered on my N900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When I play Zoutube/Youtube or videos embeded in web pages, even best of the HD videos seem to be made up of small tiny square boxes. The quality is not good at all. The lines are not smooth and it seems all tiny squares are moving all around. It is not
 even close to my wife's i&amp;#^#% which has supposedly lesser resolution than N900. Do I need any update or upgrade Flash, etc? Pl note that otherwise my mobile is up to date with all the major firmware updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When I play movie online, even when the video is buffered significantly, video is not smooth. I mean it starts stops as in frames.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please help or is everyone facing similar issues? Comments, suggestions or advice would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks .. Jacobsladder for your advice.</p>
<p>I solved my problem of jerking motion by&nbsp;watching the TV movie on N900 near the wireless router. The quality of my WIFI was not good enough, if it is too far a way from the router, even though I may have a big memory cache size defined on my device. The
 quality of WIFI required to serve the web and to watch video is different. My next step is to&nbsp;install a WIFI booster. However, I am still waiting&nbsp;for Flash 10 to watch movie from the HULU site.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>I have been experiencing exactly the same issues as you have been.&nbsp; However I seem to be able to be able to watch Youtube stuff anywhere within my house, upstairs or down.&nbsp; I have a small prog/widget installed which can tell me the quality of my WiFi but
 haven't taken the time out to monitor this yet.&nbsp; My wife's PC is connected upstairs via ethernet as I could not get the pc to work with several wireless lan cards I bought.&nbsp; However my laptop is good for wifi connection anywhere and friends who stay also say
 my wifi connection is good too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think maybe the N900's signal reception may not be as good - I have concluded like as has been stated that this problem is WiFi related.&nbsp; I say that because replay of HD video stuff downloaded onto the N900 is superb.&nbsp; Clarity and sound quality is the
 best I've enjoyed from a handheld device and with no stuttering or sound dropouts&nbsp;into the bargain :smileyhappy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would like to enquire about is the various Internet Connection Settings and also the Browser settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone talk us through what each of the settings mean like for example "power-saving" and the stuff in the browser settings about pausing java etc etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could these be related to this problem somehow?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am toying with the idea of setting up another Router upstairs in my property to act as an acess point, working inline with the one downstairs&nbsp;- imho wifi signal boosting is a waste of time - it's never got me anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would like to know more about WiFi issues and ways to overcome them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this issue :)</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, we suggest that you perform Windows Device Recovery Tool on your phone.&nbsp;Make sure to back up your files to avoid data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by downloading and installing&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(for Windows 10, 8.x and 7).</p>
<p>When the installation has finished, start the application and the main screen will appear:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55cb5806-0d06-49b9-9207-e1cbc80ba30f" /></p>
<p>The procedure to restore your phone using&nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect&nbsp;the phone to your PC (using the USB cable that came with the phone).</li><li>After a few seconds, the PC should find the phone and you'll see the Phone Selection screen. Click your phone in this screen to select it.</li><li>After a few seconds more, the latest available firmware version for your device will be shown. Click the '<strong>Install software</strong>'/'<strong>Reinstall software</strong>'&nbsp;button to flash your phone</li></ol>
<p><span>Windows Device Recovery Tool will then download and install the latest firmware + OS available for your phone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note!</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Your phone will be reset to factory status when using this tool.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

                    <p>Starting this morning, and apparently with the last update,&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials keeps turning itself off.</p>
<p>I am on Windows 7 Pro, and the latest version of the update is 1.289.1521.0</p>
<p>This is very annoying and potentially scary.</p>
<p>Only other spyware running is Malwarebytes.</p>
<p>I even tried to exclude the Malwarebytes files to no avail.</p>
<p>Have rebooted and reinstalled MSE all w, no success.</p>
<p>Many others are having the same problem, so please fix this.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            copy specific columns in a range using criteria</h2>
                    I have a range of data in Excel with 11 columns.&nbsp; I want to copy only 7 of the columns to another location using a criteria (i.e. type = "D").&nbsp; Is there a simple way to do this?&nbsp; I looked at using MS Query, but that seems only to apply to external data.

<p>The advance filter approach is as follows:</p>
<p>Using Advanced Filter to copy data to a different sheet:</p>
<p>Suppose you have data on Sheet1 with the following column titles starting in A1</p>
<p>Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4 Col5 Col6 Col7 Col8 Col9 Col10 Col11</p>
<p>In Col1 one you have letter codes.&nbsp; You want to copy all the rows of data which contain a code of D in column A but only for columns 2, 4, 6, 7 8, 9, and 11</p>
<p>1. Copy the column headings for the columns you want to the destination range, save A1 on Sheet2:<br />
&nbsp; A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G<br />
Col2 Col4 Col6 Col7 Col8 Col9 Col11</p>
<p>2. In cell J1:J2 enter the title from column A on Sheet1 and the value you are interested in "D":<br />
Col1<br />
&nbsp;D</p>
<p>3. Put an entry in cell A2 - what you enter doesn't matter.<br />
4. Place your cursor in A1 of <strong>Sheet2</strong>&nbsp;and choose Data, Advanced<br />
5. Choose Copy to another location<br />
6. Clear the entry from the List range box and then highlight all the data and titles in the source range on Sheet1<br />
7. Click in the Criteria range box and highlight J1:J2 on Sheet2<br />
8. Click in the Copy to box and highlight A1:G1 on Sheet2<br />
9. Click OK.</p>
<p>Note: Excel remembers some of the information you enter into the Advanced Filter box making it easier to repeat the filter later.</p>
<p>Warning: the range you indicate in the Copy to area may be either the titles or the titles and many rows below them.&nbsp; If you only pick the titles, as in the above example, Excel clears all the rows below those titles (1,048,576 rows) even though there may
 be nothing in that area.&nbsp; And it doesn't warn you.&nbsp; If you indicate the number of rows for the output Excel will only clear those and will warn you if there is more data to output.</p>
<p>If you are doing this on the same sheet as the source data then you basically do the process the same way but&nbsp;replace step 4 with</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Place your cursor in&nbsp;any single cell of the data range (not the Copy to range) and choose Data, Advanced&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Duplicate skype account. XXXXX - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> je ra chu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate skype account. XXXXX</h2>
                    I have a Skype account "***246". Yesterday I registered microsoft account with email "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and it auto-generated a Skype account "live:***246". Both are linked to the same username "***246" and the same email "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". Now when I
 go to Skype typing old id "***246", it sign in to new live account instead of the old account. I cannot access the old account anymore. Please remove the new Skype account immediately! I need my old Skype account, many friends, many important things in it.
 Thank you!

                    The pre-installed version of yahoo mail on my 520 keeps removing, not deleting, emails. The only way I can see older emails is by going into yahoo itself. So what's the point of the app? Can't even delete the app. Very frustrating

<h3> mr. john85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook won&#39;t sync with Microsoft Exchange account. How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Exchange email account from my place of work. Well I used to have it on my computer on Outlook along with my personal email. But there was a change at work and I had to take off the account and then put it back on. But now it won't sync
 with Outlook. I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Cannot expand the folder. The set of folders cannot be opened. You must connect to Microsoft Exchange with the current profile before you can synchronize your folders with your Outlook data file (.ost).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on my Surface 3 (non-pro) running Windows 10 and with Microsoft Office 365 Home (2016).</p>
<p>I can access the account via any web browser such as Edge, and I can also sync the account to the Mail app or any mail app on any other device or smartphone. But the one app where I really want and need to sync this account, my Outlook app, is not cooperating.</p>
<p>So far I've tried removing and putting the account back on. I've also reinstalled Office. But nothing has worked so far.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me to get Outlook to work correctly?? Thanks!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I also notice that it says there's a sync error. I clicked on it and it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Task '[email] - Sending and Receiving' reported error (0x8004010F) : 'Outlook data file cannot be accessed.'</strong></p>

Use Cached Exchange Mode</strong> option is selected, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. (Yep, it is)</li><li>In the <strong>
Account Settings</strong> dialog box, click&nbsp;<strong>Close</strong>. (Okay)</li><li>Exit Outlook, and then reopen Outlook (Ditto!)</li></ol>
Synchronize the folders again
<span>After you check these settings, use one of the following methods to synchronize the folders again.
</span>
...
<span>In Outlook 2010 click
</span><strong>Send/Receive</strong><span>, and then click
</span><strong>Send/Receive All</strong><span> to synchronize all offline folders. (Ditto! But no help.)</span>
Create a new .ost file and synchronize the offline folders again
<span>If all folders except the Inbox folder are synchronized, or if you cannot synchronize the folders, you may have a damaged .ost file. To resolve this issue, create a new .ost file and then synchronize the folders again.
</span>
How to create a new .ost file and synchronize the folders
<span>To create a new .ost file, rename the old .ost file, and then synchronize the new .ost file with the computer that is running Microsoft Exchange Server. When you rename the old .ost file, Outlook creates a new file. To do this, follow these steps:
</span>
<ol>
<li>Exit all programs.</li><li>Click <strong>
Start</strong>, point to&nbsp;<strong>Search</strong>, and then click
<strong>For Files or Folders</strong>. (Okay)</li><li>In the search dialog box, click <strong>
All files and folders</strong>. (Got it.)</li><li>In the <strong>
All or part of the file name</strong> tab, type <span>
*.ost </span>. (I did)</li><li>Do not type anything in the <strong>
A word or phrase in the file</strong> box. (I won't)</li><li>Click the hard disk in the <strong>
Look in</strong> list. Then, under the <strong>
More advanced options</strong> option, click to select the <strong>
Include subfolders</strong> check box, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Search</strong><br />
<br />
In the <strong>Name</strong> column, you see the .ost file. The default location for the .ost file is as follows.<br />
<br />
<span>For Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Windows Server 2003</span>
<div>
C:\Documents and Settings\user name\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook</div>
</li><li>Right-click the .ost file, and then click<br />
<strong>Rename</strong>. Rename the file by using a different file name extension, such as an .old file name extension instead of the .ost file name extension. (Yes I did)</li><li>On the <strong>
File</strong> menu, click&nbsp;<strong>Close</strong>. (Okay)</li><li>Start Outlook, point to <strong>
Send/receive</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, and then click
<strong>Send/Receive All</strong>. (Still not working)</li></ol>
Replace damaged Exchange Server support files
<span>If you are still not able to restore synchronization, the Microsoft Exchange Server service support files may be damaged. To replace damaged Exchange Server support files, you must first remove the Exchange Server service support files and then
 replace the deleted files with the originalOutlook files.</span><br />

<p>Here's something else. I tried to get the Microsoft Exchange account to work on my wife's computer with her Outlook app. Well it didn't work their either. So there must be something wrong with the account?? It works on just about everything else including
 the Mail app on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else. When I have the account on my Outlook app (not working of course) and I go to the calender in Outlook I can't get the calender to change months. It's stuck on the current month. Scrolling doesn't change the days. But when I take the account
 back off it works fine again.</p>

                    <p>Other than the email I'm using now to try and get a solution to my problem, I have a very old email address which was my first email account. It has other important website accounts linked with it that I need to reset passwords for but to activate I need
 to sign into my old email address! (booo)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't accessed it in a few years and I cannot remember the password to the account and I've had no luck trying to recover it. I do not care if all the emails have been deleted I would just like to be able to access it and update it as I have other important
 website logins I use on this email. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to log in It doesn't tell me the account doesn't exist it just says 'incorrect password.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the email has been deleted and does not exist any more what happens to my other website accounts under that email?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 updating Contact Group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jgt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 updating Contact Group</h2>
                    
<p>How do I correct an email address in a Contact Group?</p>
<p>I've created a Contact Group in OL 2010 and added several members none of which were in my OL contacts. I had clicked on Add Members &gt; From Outlook Contacts and then in the Members field I pasted my list of contacts in the format of FirstName LastName EmailAddress.
 One of the entries was incorrect, originally I had entered "Mike Jones *** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and the email addres was not correct, e.g. it should be*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I double-clicked on the entry and in the window
 that opened I clicked on "Open Contact" corrected the email address then clicked on "Save &amp; Close".</p>
<p>I expected the corrected email address to now appear in the Contact Group but the old incorrect email address was still present. In the Contact Group window I clicked on the "Update Now" icon in the ribbon, still the incorrect email address is displayed.</p>
<p>If I go to my OL Personal Folder window and enter Jones in the "Find a Contact" field the entry I just added is not there.</p>
<p>If I go back to the Contact Group window and double click the entry the window that opens shows the updated email address. In the Group Contact window if I click on the E-mail icon in the ribbon and then expand the list the incorrect email address is displayed
 for Mike.</p>

<p>I assume you mean a Distribution List. If you want to update a DL you must also remove its entry from your autocompletion cache. Remove individual addresses from the autocompletion cache by highlighting the entry when presented in the suggested names list
 (use your arrow key to migrate to the entry) and then hitting your Delete key before you tab out of the field.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is to be expected since you didn't create contacts, only the Contact Group, formerly known as a distribution list.</p>

As Russ mentioned, this is because of the autocomplete list cache - start typing the group name then select it and press the Del key or use the mouse to click the x to the right of the dl name to remove it from the cache. The next time you use the address it
 will reload the group.

<p>OK so anytime I change a Contact Group I need to delete it from the autocomplete list to ensure the correct address will be displayed when I use it.&nbsp; Is this what Microsoft calls progress and userfriendly?</p>
<p>Perhaps the autocomplete explains another issue I have. Somewhere along the line I've added a contact (let's say&nbsp;Mike)&nbsp;and I've sent Mike emails. Now I receive an email from Alice and she has copied Mike. I know I don't have Alice in my&nbsp;Outlook Contacts&nbsp;so
 I right-click on her address in the email and select add to Outlook Contacts and her entry is added. Now because my memory is not super I don't recall if I have Mike in my&nbsp;Outlook Contacts&nbsp;so I right-click on his entry and select "Look Up Outlook Contact"
 and I'm told "Could not find a contact with this e-mail address". So I then right-click on Mike's email and select add to Outlook Contacts. Then when I attempt to save the entry I'm informed that the entry already exist (the email address in the Outlook Contact
 was the same as it was in the email from Alice). OK so I select the option to update the entry. Now back in the email I again right-click on Mike's email and select "Look Up Outlook Contact" and again I'm informed that the entry does not exist. How can this
 be I just added and updated the entry&nbsp;contact info.</p>
<p>Is it best to turn off the autocomplete list? If so how is this done?</p>

<p>Your problem is not so much with autocompletion as it is with your choice to use DL's. DL's are not robust and have many quirks like this. Many users abandonded them long ago in favor of newer and better ways of grouping recipients, such as Categories.</p>
<p>Whether you use autocompletion or autoresolution is up to you. You can easily turn off autocompletion by unchecking "Suggest Names" in Advanced Options for your Email preferences.</p>
<p>If "Lookup Contacts" fails to return an entry that you are sure you have in your Contacts Folder, then most likely you stored that entry in a Folder you neglected to include in your Outlook Address Book. Check and see.<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;287563&amp;Product=ol2002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;287563&amp;Product=ol2002</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry more questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't mind dropping DL or Contact Groups (the term in OL 2010) and I've used Categories differently than you are suggesting. What do you suggest I read to learn how to use Categories as you suggest? Currently I have about 100 DL/Contact Groups. I teach
 a lot of classes via the internet and have been creating a DL/Contact Group for each class to make it easy to communicate via email.</li><li>I cannot find the "Suggest Names" setting, I clicked File &gt; Options &gt; and then went through all of the "Outlook Options" and could not find "Suggest Names".</li><li>"Look Up Contacts" often fails - I looked at the suggested article and for 2010 and all of my settings are as suggested. I have only one address book and in the suggested article for step one it appears as "<strong>Outlook Address Book".</strong>Steps 2
 &amp; 3 are as suggested.<br />
<br />
When I have my Contacts open in the left nav pane I see "My Contacts" and under that I see<br />
"Contacts" - this appears to be my address book and contains what I think is all of my contacts and DL/Contact Groups<br />
"Collected Contacts"&nbsp; - this view is empty<br />
"Suggested Contacts" - This view looks like a business card, the first several entries have just an email address, the next group has the persons name and email address - some names are contained within a single quote mark<br />
"Business Contact Manager" - Clicking on this does nothing. </li></ol>

<p>I need more information. Why does your profile contain "Business Contact Manager?" Have you expressly installed this program? It is not part of Office 2010.</p>
<p>Contact Lookup only fails if you have not configured your Outlook Address Book Service correctly. The most common reason for this is migrating your Outlook data to a new version incorrectly. I assume that since Outlook 2010 is brand new and you are using
 old data, that you migrated your data to the new version. If so, how did you do so? How did you connect the address service to your data after you did so?</p>

            Oops. You had more questions. The path for turning off autocomplete in Outlook 2010 is easy to find: File &gt; Options &gt; Mail &gt; Use Autocomplete. For the most part, each new version of Outlook just rearranges the furniture to make the new version more difficult
 to use.

Back when BCM was part of Office 2007 I had installed BCM for a short period of time but never did anything with it (no time to learn). During one of my rebuilds with WinXP and Office 2007 I did not reinstall it or I may have uninstalled it prior to a rebuild.
 However at this time this is just a guess. I've been upgrading OL since the first release of OL.</p>
<p>I was forced to perform a clean install when I moved from WinXP to Vista x64&nbsp;(yuck) and I'm not sure how I ported the OL data from the old WinXP (at this time Office 2007) to the new install of Office 2007 under Vista. Most likely I found most of the data
 files on the old system and just copied them over to the new system.</p>
<p>When Win7 x64&nbsp;was released I created a new HD build&nbsp;and again just copied all the Local and Roaming folders from the old system to the new system. For the most part everything seemed to work except I had to recreate my email accounts.</p>
<p>When Office 2010 was released I installed on top of Office 2007 for the most part everything worked except I noticed that in PowerPoint my 1179 slide file would take 50+ minutes to save. This was not good.</p>
<p>I then started a new HD build of Win7 x64 and installed Office 2010 fresh. I now had two hard drives, one with the old build and one with the new build and it was a simple matter of inserting the desired HD in my laptop, the old drive for production work
 and the new drive to continue the build. Prior to the cut-over from the old drive to the new drive I use "Outlook BackRex Outlook Backup" (see<a href="http://backsettings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://backsettings.com/</a>)&nbsp;to backup Outlook, FireFox and IE. I then swap drives
 and on the new drive again using Outlook BackRex I restored Outlook, FireFox and IE. There were several small things in OL that did not transfer correctly but for the most part it seemed to work. After the restore I then used the new drive as my production
 drive.</p>
<p>Also prior to the new drive cut-over I used Acronis TrueImage to backup the old dirve (also the new drive). I can open the TI old drive image to copy almost anything if necessary.</p>
<p>You ask "How did you connect the address service to your data after you did so?" I did not do anything to connect, I just started using OL after the install of Office 2010 on top of Office 2007. It is highly possible that my long history of moves from one
 office version to newer verisons I did it wrong and now it has created a problem. I'm 100% sure that the above long story has left out lots of stuff that might be helpful to resolve the issue but for me it is too much water under the bridge and I cannot remember
 more details at this time.</p>
<p>I'm going to again go through the article you suggested and make sure I did not miss something.</p>

AH! Finally I found the darn option under the "Send messages" section (last item in this group). I also notice a "Empty Autocomplete List" button. Before I turn off the autocomplete I though I'd first give this a try and see if cleaning up the list would help.

<p>Russ - regarding "I'm going to again go through the article you suggested and make sure I did not miss something."</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Install the Outlook Address Book service</strong> - When I click the "Address Books" tab I see only one entry which is "Outlook Address Book"</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Mark your contact folder for use with your address book</strong> - On the<strong>Outlook Address Book</strong> tab, click to select the
<strong>Show this folder as an e-mail address book</strong> check box, type a descriptive name - The option is already checked but it is grayed out. The name of my address book is "Contacts"</p>
Step 3: Look for an e-mail address or a fax number - I can (ops I cannot turn of the bold) open any contact and they appear OK
<p>The issue really seems to present itself when I'm viewing an email and I right-click on an address in the TO or CC field and select "Look Up Contact" and OL tells me that it cannot find the contact (this does not happen for all contacts) but yet when I search
 for the contact I do find him in my address book. I just check one email from "Eric" and it is as I just described. Most likely I added Eric to my address book when I received an email from him, right-clicked on his email address in the preview pane and selected
 "Add to Outlook Contacts"</p>

    <title>Nokia 5800 V 40 update problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akki89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 5800 V 40 update problems</h2>
                    
<p>I am not happy with the V 40 update for my device. The problems faced are,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sometimes cannot accept calls - Error shown is request rejected.<br />
2. Music library get corrupted.<br />
3. Camera doesnot flash on its own in low light.<br />
4. Hangs quite a times.<br />
5. Use OVI maps only to restart your phone.&nbsp;<br />
6. Sensor controls are bad.<br />
7. Installing a few applications gets it slow.<br />
8. Clock doesnot display its time on the home screen.<br />
I am seriously annoyed by this.<br />
First I did the update myself.I then visited a Nokia Care centre and the version was reinstalled. I still have the same problems. I have done it myself through the software updater and OVI suite. Thats means a total of&nbsp;4 updates and still the errors are present.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe you should perform a soft reset and a format of the memorycard and start out fresh? - Get rid of som glitches and cache...</p>

<p>Note that a soft reset (diall *#7370#) will delete everything on phonememory, and a format of the memcard will delete everything on the memcard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have done that, change messagememory to memcard to save space on phonememory. Try also to install apps to memorycard (be aware of that some nokia apps can only install on C, thats ok).</p>

<p>okey, how does the phone behave without the mecard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not a reinstallation of fw nor a soft reset and format could fixe it, I would take it back to where I bought it and make them Swap it for a new one, or take it back to the Nokia care point and tell them that the problems persists even after the reflash.</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect WP8.1 via USB to Windows 7 or 8.1</h2>
                    <p>When I connect my phone via a usb cable to my computer I am unable to access any files etc. on the phone from the PC as it isn't shown in "This PC" (My Computer).&nbsp; It seems that the computer is constantly trying to connect to the phone and then disconnecting
 over and over again, you can even hear the sound played when a device is attached and detached from the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 8.1 x64 going to the Device Manager the list is constantly being refreshed every couple of seconds and occasionally the phone is shown under "Portable Devices" only to disappear again when the list refreshes again.&nbsp; Sometimes I have also found
 an "Unknown USB Device" which has an error "A request for the USB device descriptor failed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly on Windows 7 x64 the Device Manager shows an "Unknown Device" but it isn't trying to refresh all the time.&nbsp; Trying to update the driver following instructions
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2749484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behaviour has been happening for a while now, ever since I installed the WP 8.1 developer preview, and I was hoping that newer releases of of the OS would fix the issue.&nbsp; So far not.&nbsp; As I can't connect my phone to my PC is makes it pretty hard to use
 it actually as a <em>developer</em> preview, i.e. for any development work.&nbsp; I was able to connect the phone without problems prior to installing the 8.1 developer preview.</p>

</p><p>Currently the only way I have to connect my phone is via Bluetooth which only allows limited functions.&nbsp; I'm surprised also as the old Zune app for WP7 used to allow syncing over Wi-Fi but it seems the new WP8 desktop and Win8 apps both only support usb
 connections. It's mostly not a problem as things are synced to OneDrive etc. but even so it seems like things are becoming less functional than they used to be.</p>

            <p>Hi Kuan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the updated information.&nbsp; Given all we've tried, I'm only offering the possibility of talking to Windows Support as another venue for troubleshooting.&nbsp; The last step I can offer&nbsp;is a hard reset of the phone. (<em>this</em><em> will erase everything,
 backup accordingly</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you truly feel the developer preview update caused this issue, you may want to talk to HTC and see about possibly rolling back your phone to a previous update when this issue did not occur.&nbsp; Keep in mind, this is a developer preview, so the manufacturers
 and mobile carriers still need to update the phone's firmware to accommodate the update.&nbsp; Once updated, they then push out a official consumer-side update bundled with a new firmware revision to address feedback from users, or any issues that may arise during
 the preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chanh S.</p>

Is this possible? I've tried paragraph format to be exact.. nothing seems to work.<br />

            Such a good logical step, thank you. I was not stressed on this today, but you have helped me solve it.<br />
Yes, the Melior <b>postscript </b>seemed to be the problem. I have had that and an opentype version on my HD, and never had any problems until using Word.<br />
<br />
Now Word is happy with the Opentype version and the baselines are all alike, and I thank you Bob and Joe for responding.<br />
<br />
Cheers and thanks again.<br />

<h2>            How to subtract dates so I would get the number of months and dates&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to subtract dates and find out the difference in months and days. for ex. 10.01.2012 - 11.06.2012 = 6 months 1 day. countdif function doesn't work: tried all possible variants but it gives me an error.</p>
<p>I have tried something like "year (a3) - year (a2)*12+ month (a3)- month (a2)". It counts months only. How to add days there?</p>
<p>also tried separatel to subtract days only, but it gives a negative number if the day in a3 is bigger than in a2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer should be 5 months not 6 months.&nbsp; Try this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. To get months, use =DATEDIF(A2,A3,"ym").&nbsp; A2 is the beginning date and A3 is the ending date.&nbsp; Also, both entries should be genuine dates.&nbsp; Since dot is not a recognised date seperator, you will have to find for dot and replace with / or -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. To get months , use =A3-EDATE(A2,(DATEDIF(A2,A3,"y")*12)+DATEDIF(A2,A3,"ym")).&nbsp; Answer will be 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For months, in your specific example, you may also use =DATEDIF(a2,A3,"md").&nbsp; Answer here will also be 1.&nbsp; However, the "md" form of usage in DATEDIF() is buggy.&nbsp; To test, it, if your beginnign date in cell A12 is 31/7/2008 and ending date in cell B13 is
 02/03/2009, =DATEDIF(A13,B13,"md") will yield the answer as -1 instead of 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            It depends on what associations are set at the receiver's end -- and it depends on whether you can control that or not.
<div><br />
<div>Typically, a PPS (or PPSX) will always open in slide show view unless the recipient has changed file associations -- in that case, they need to revert the file associations.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This link may help you understand how PPS or PPSX is different from PPT or PPTX:</div>
