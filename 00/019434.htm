            If by "Microsoft Definer" you actually mean "Windows Defender", Windows Mobile does not require any antu-virus software due to the structure of the OS and the way it manages the data access for each app.<br />

    <title>Default link for users with existing access - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Default link for users with existing access</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask why the option "People with existing access" is missing in default link type settings in Admin center? I think that this is most used ever… Usually in SharePoint you have library which by default inherits permissions from the web site.
 Why should I change permissions and set again permissions for all people or specific people. When I do it, it break my permissions and I have individual permissions what is not desirable. It is totally confusing for end users because they do not know that
 they create a link for all employees because usually they just need use the link and instead of they share the file with somebody else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes sense for me in OneDrive but not in SharePoint sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Options:<br />

<p><span>Hi Mirek,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the community forum here. I can understand your willing to make the “people with existing access” link as the default link. If so, people can copy and paste the item link to others easily
 without granting new permissions. And the people who are having existing permissions can click the link to go to the item easily.
</span></p>
<p><span>To address your concern, here’s the UserVoice:

 this is the best way to let us hear your voice and to make our products and services better for you and others.</span></p>

            Hey there, my name is Michael and I am an independent Surface advisor, and a customer, like you!<br /><br />No, Microsoft does not offer a $500 anti malware program. Windows Defender is their only anti-virus software which is free as a part of the Windows operating system.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Michael

<br />
<br />No, they don't. Their antimalware solutions are free, Windows Defender, Microsoft Security Essentials, they're all free. May I ask where you got this information? I would be interested to know. Thanks.

<h2>            How to correct the wrong plan of office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!&nbsp; I just renewed my Office 365 yesterday, but it was the wrong Office 365. I had the Office 365 MidSize Business before. Now it is Office 365 Business Premium.&nbsp; I&nbsp; thought that when i renewed it, it should come with Office 365 MidSize Business. How
 to correct it? Thank in advance.</p>

<p>Hi MinKiongLee,</p>
<p>Your current plan <strong>Office 365 Midsize Business</strong> is no longer available. During renewal, we recommend the plan that is most similar to your current one which is
<strong>Office 365 Business Premium</strong>, but you’ll also have the option to browse other plans to fit your business needs.</p>
<p>For more detailed information, please refer to the article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Renew-Office-365-small-and-midsized-business-subscriptions-afa5dee4-091d-4152-b849-6aef8463ca9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

How does Office 365 Midsize Business compare to Office 365 Business Premium?</a></p>

<p>Hi MinKiong,</p>
<p>Yes, you can. However, Office 365 Enterprise E4 will no longer be sold after June 30, 2016. See our new plan, Office 365 Enterprise E5 for the most comprehensive, most comprehensive, most secure cloud productivity and communication Office 365 offering. If
 you just want to use Microsoft Access, the E3 is enough and 
its price is less than E4.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

    <title>Empty Nokia Phone Browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dj_senseless69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Empty Nokia Phone Browser</h2>
                    I have recently installed Nokia PC Suite v6.86.9.3 for use with my Nokia N95 8GB. I have also updated the firmware on my phone to version 20.0.016 so I should have all the latest versions.<br />
<br />
Everything seemed to install ok and there seems to be a good connection between my phone and pc via the usb cable, however, I can see my received messages on the Nokia PC Suite main screen but when I click on the envelope icon to create or send message it opens
 My Computer and nothing else happens. The same happens when I click on File manager or Contacts.<br />
<br />
I have noticed in My Computer that I now have the Nokia Phone Browser. If I open this I can click on the icons to create a new contact/text message and refresh the folder, but the folder itself is empty.<br />
<br />
I have read in the help files that you should be able to browse not only contact and text messages but also the contents of the phone memory and memory card.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me with this?

            Managed to fix the problem!<br />
<br />
I've been reading through a few posts in the forum. Couldn't find anything specifically for the problem I was having however I noticed a lot of posts mention the same processes. I've listed them below with a few tips:<br />
<br />
1. Uninstall all Nokia Software from Add/Remove programs (inluding PC Connectivity Solution, which doesn't actually mention that it's a Nokia program until you click to uninstall it)<br />
<br />
2. Delete all Application Data (click run on the start menu and type %appdata%. Delete anything related to Nokia i.e. all folders called Nokia, PC Suite or NSeries)<br />
<br />
3. Delete Nokia registry entries (click run on the start menu and type Regedit. Search through the registry and delete entries related to Nokia, PC Suite and NSeries. I only deleted folders called the above names, not single entries in other folders called
 something else. I also didn'd delete anything that looked like it was related to a USB connection)<br />
<br />
4. Download &amp; Run Nokia PCSuite Cleaner (Lots of people mentioned this but didn't say where to get it from so after 15 mins of searching I found it. Here is a link to the Nokia download page:
<a href="https://www.nokiausa.com/A4410030." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.nokiausa.com/A4410030.</a> When i tried clicking download it didn;t work so here's another link:
<a href="http://download.chip.eu/en/Nokia-PC-Suite-Cleaner-3.6_977782.html." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.chip.eu/en/Nokia-PC-Suite-Cleaner-3.6_977782.html.</a> When running this I selected the option called remove files and registry entries. I got an error message after telling me it couldn't find certain things and to restart but still seemed
 to work)<br />
<br />
5. Reinstall PCSuite (I installed the latest version again, this time onto my C:. Not sure if that really made any difference but I wanted to install it to a different location just in case)<br />
<br />
That has solved the problem. I can now view my messages and contacts and browse all files (Phone Memory &amp; Mass Memory).<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help when others get the same problem, and I wouldn't be surprised if it fixed other problems too.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            <p>Hi Sam8754, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would advise patience in waiting for the update. The only officially supported way to update is to wait until the phone notifies you that an update is ready. If you try to do the disconnect method of forcing the update it may or may not work, but it still
 uses the official update process. I would advise against other methods as they are not supported and may have adverse effects on your phone.

<h2>            Using control-Q to mark a message read goes back to unread when moving to trash</h2>
                    <p>When I mark an item in my inbox as read using the keyboard shortcut key cntl-Q (this is an IMAP account) it changes from bold type to normal type like it has changed the state to "read". However, I then delete the message using the keyboard shortcut cntl-d
 which moves it to my Trash folder. Now the message appears as unread as the line in the trash folder is bold again. This is clearly a bug as all previous versions of Outlook (and I've used Outlook for more than 15 years) did not do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do this ALL THE TIME as I see messages, usually ads, or have any number of reasons to not open up the message to read it. If I do open the message and delete it, it moves to trash and stays as read. I do not have a reading pain turned on.</p>

            <p>Nope. Pretty sure it's a bug in Outlook. Created a new profile with only the one IMAP account and had the same results. In addition, I have Outlook 365 on my Windows 7 machine and it does the same thing there. So the problem shows up on Windows 7 and Windows
 8.1. Never had these issues before upgrading to Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you should also know about my configuration. I have the reading pane turned off in both my inbox and trash. I also have the message preview off in both folders. Hope that helps.</p>

            One more note of interest. Using the same Cntl-q followed by a Cntl-d from my Spam folder (this is a Gmail account) does the right thing. i.e. the message stays marked as "read". (No bold type in the Subject, size, from, etc.) in the Trash folder.

            <p>Some more information on this problem. It appears to be a timing issue. If I wait 2-3 seconds between hitting the control-Q and then the control-D keys the message shows up as "read" in my trash. If I do this too quickly, as one would normally do, then the
 message shows up as "not read" in my trash. I never had this problem with Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2010 and I'm using the same IMAP account which has not changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs on both my Win-8.1 laptop and my Win7 desktop. So it is clearly a bug in Outlook 2013/365.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it goes along with the general slowness I see with all Microsoft cloud services. As reported in other threads OneDrive is unacceptably slow to update my other devices. I have dropbox and SugarSync on these same machines and see almost instantaneous
 updates with small files (&lt;100kb) but not so with OneDrive, but I digress. . .</p>

    <title>Disable Access 2010 security messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian d. hart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Access 2010 security messages</h2>
                    <p>I need to know how to disable all Access 2010 macro/security warnings for all users, and for both Access runtime and the full version</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of our many users have any use for Access except to run the in-house application I develop. I have several small in-house Access 2003 MDB or MDE applications that users have been running for years. I just deployed ten new computers, replete l with Office
 Pro (i.e. Access 2010), and users are now getting annying popup messages. In addition, newer computers having Access 2010 runtime are getting a new flavor of warning message (i.e. different from the Access 2003 macro warnings).</p>
<p>With Access 2003 runtime, there was the standad macro security warning, which I disabled at the all users level with this registry entry:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Access\Security]<br />
"Level"=dword:00000001</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, on 64-bit Windows 7 having 32-bit Access:</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Access\Security]<br />
"Level"=dword:00000001</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried doing the parallel entry for Access 2010, but to no avail:</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access\Security]</p>
<p>"Level"=dword:00000001</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two separate messages:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access 2010 runtime: "A potential security concern has been identified...blah, blah, blah"&nbsp;I think this can be disabled PER USER by setting trusted locations, but this is ridiculous inside our LAN. Of course, I want the entire LAN to be trusted for all users
 of the computer so I can stick to programming instead of babysitting the fallout from changes in the development platform. I can handle a single registry entry to be applied to each new computer, but I am simply not prepared to have to re-implement a change
 for ever subsequent user of that computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access 2010 full version: Startup macro halts, and I have to click Stop All Macros, then Enable Content, then Do you want to make this file a trusted document. If I answer in the affirmative after going through the first two arcane steps, I can successfully
 open the file without all the arcane notices the next time--but only for the current user. The steps must be repeated for the next user.</p>
<p>Having to explain all to users that my application is being held hostage to the latest &amp; greatest security "protection" makes me look like an idiot; however, I am also the network administrator and really need to find a way to make all of this transparent
 to all users before they hit any of the messages above--whether on Access 2010 runtime or full version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Access runtime message, there is this "fix"; however, it falls far short of the mark in that it applies only to the current user, and applying it to the cognate node in HKLM has no effect:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access\Security] </p>
<p>"VBAWarnings"=dword:00000001</p>

            Request your IT server group supports to add the folder as Trusted Locations using the Group Policy Manager. This will apply across the board. As you also found out that you need to disable the VBA warning in question, you need to disable VBA Warning thru
 Group Policy Manger as well.<br />

            <p>Your assumption that there is an IT server group, like much of Microsoft's recent design structures,&nbsp;belies the assumption that this is a large company, with all the specialized IT resources to manage group policies. This is, indeed, the direction I have
 seen MS go with many things (Windows 7, Office 2010, etc): it is relatively easy to manage for very small peer-to-peer networks of perhaps one to four computers where I can just explain to each user what to do. This approach is unworkable when there are 10
 computers because it takes too much time to explain it to the individual users; however, it is likewise a fair amount of work to configure Group Policies. With a network of a hundred computers, it is entirely a different matter.&nbsp;While I will stop short of
 accusing MS of&nbsp;ignoring the small man here, I can say that small- to mid-size networks fall in between the ease of individual-based networks and the ease of Group Policy-based networks having specialized server-side staff. For sure, every time there is an
 upgrade, there are complex issues far beyond the scope of either programming or small-systems management that I must research and implement.</p>
<p>I will take a look at Group Policies; however, here is the full picture: I am the entire IT group, supporting several small networks (servers, PCs, network/routing,&nbsp;and phones) for companies of different sizes--none of which are interested in hiring server-specific
 IT groups to manage policies, etc. I also do Access programming for several of them. Some of them are domain-based, some are not. I will also have to look at the impact of distributing Group Policies in mixed environments: Windows XP and 7 with Office/Access
 full and runtime 2003, 2007, and 2010 on various computers in the same network. I have not used Group Policies for this before, and I suspect that mixed environment may not fit into Group Policies as easily as it may seem.</p>
<p>In the past, it was relatively easy, once I found the appropriate registry entry, to create the setting on one computer, then simply export the .reg file and run it once when installing Access.</p>
<p>Now, instead of just programming and managing infrastructure, I am spending more and more time explaining to people why they get these messages and how to get past them. This pretty much makes me look like an idiot to the end user, so I am just trying&nbsp;to
 find creative ways to avoid spending all this extra time explaining the issue and tinkering with group policies (for domain-based clients).&nbsp; Besides that, I have to charge my client for all this setup time, and then they want to know what took so long.</p>
<p>There....that is my opportunity to vent for the day...</p>

            <p>Hi, Tom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find the HKLM registry location, and I exported the HKCU entry, then modified it to be placed in the cognate position under HKLM and imported it there, but I still received the warnings until I added it to HKCU.</p>
<p>Do you know how to set a Trusted Location for the entire machine? I will do some more searching on that topic; however, this will involve not just Access, but Excel as well.</p>
<p>I have many users that just want to do their work; they do not need to be bothered with having to deal with security warnings, and I do not need to be bothered explaining the process over and over as new users connect to the computers.</p>
<p>The increasing complexities of managing all of this continues to creep beyond the scope of the small-system application developer, and it&nbsp;just becomes a little frustrating at times.</p>

            <p>I am with the originator why make this so complicated.&nbsp; I too am looking for a registry setting to set HKLM so all users have specific Trusted Locations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This can be done using the Office customization tool when modifying an Office 2010 installation package to be distributed to desktops.&nbsp; Again by large companies with IT staff available for custom packaging of Office 2010.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If this can be modified during packaging it must be some registry key that I have yet to find.&nbsp; I also thought to export the appropriate HKCU keys modify to HKLM with no avail.&nbsp; If there is anyone that can help with this I am sure it would be appreciated
 by many.</p>

            It is nice to know I am not the only one facing these issues. With Access 2003, I had just a little .reg file to turn off the macro security warnings at the machine level, and I would just run it along with every Access Runtime or Office Pro installation.
 Not so for Access 2010.

            <p>When you created this key in your local machine hive, what was the exact path of the key you were trying to set?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you just modified the current user path and pointed it to a local machine path (basically substituting HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_CURRENT_USER), this most likely won’t work if you are on a 64 bit OS and using the 32 bit version of Access 2010.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are using a 64 bit OS and the 32 bit version of Access, you will need to use the key within the Wow6432Node.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access\Security\Trusted Locations\Location9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you have a working key within the current user hive, you can export it and modify this .reg file, but when doing so just make sure the key begins with: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are on a 32 bit OS or you are using the 64 bit version of Office, then just modifying substituting HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_CURRENT_USER should work.</p>

            <p>This problem does not seem to go away. The suggested registry setting change did not resolve the issue on our test machines. (XP SP3 and Windows 7.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The environment is:
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Service Pack 1 for Microsoft Access Runtime 2010 installed on XP SP3 or Windows 7 machines with office 2007 or 2003 already installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access 2010 created ACCDB or MDB when launched always shows the “Microsoft Access Security Notice” message.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Access 2010 created databases are web deployed to many end users. The end users have limited skills sets and won’t use the database due
 to the “Microsoft Access Security Notice” message.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you Nathan. I had everything working with HKEY_Local_Machine but then had to switch from 64-bit to 32-bit. When I did, I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. It was exactly as you said.</p>

<p>I'd be interested to know the complexities of file versioning for the varied platform, varied product support you are implementing there... Do you ever have issues where users in Office 11 (2003) open files from say Office 14 (2010)&nbsp;and any embedded VBA
 modules cease to function or reference libraries refuse to play nice?</p>

<h2>            Device disappeared from My Devices list</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a Nokia Lumia 820 phone but lost it recently last weekend. The battery was very low so when I realized that I lost the phone the battery must have been flat so I couldn't locate it with the Find My Phone tool. I got a replacement phone (MS Lumia 650),
 and until recently both phones were listed under My Devices, but when I now tried to locate my lost phone (hoping someone picked it up and charged the battery), it doesn't show up under My Devices any more - why is that? I didn't remove it, so why did it drop
 off the list??</p>

            <p>reset is resetting the phone - pretty much reinstalling it.</p>
<p>Whenever a phone is reset, it is removed from the previously used account, otherwise you'd be able to spy on people after you sold/gave your device away.</p>

<p>None of the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have Outlook 2010 on a WIN 8.1 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am already using Credenza -- an add in -- with OL 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am NOT reporting issues with this setup. &nbsp;I am NOT getting error messages with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am interesting in upgrading OL to 2013 or, even more so, 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Credenza is no longer supported. When support ended, the FAQ for it did not list OL 2016 as &nbsp;being supported. My guess is that the program's maker didn't spend any money on making sure it work with OL 2016 because it had already decided to pull the plug
 when OFF 2016 was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So, what I want to known, is what I asked: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Have users had compatibility problems with add-ins that worked OK with OL 2010 after upgrading to OL 2016? Or even 2013?"</span></p>
<p>Either no one uses add-ins, no one has had problems in OL 2016 with add-ins that worked with OL 2010, or there have been problems. That's what I want to hear about. Not how to enable add-ins in
 OL 2016. Not about issues I have had. Not error messages I haven't even received since I don't have OL 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know what I have asked because I don't want to &nbsp;buy OL 2016 and find out that a critical add-in now being used won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would, of course, be particularly interested if anyone has had experience trying to use Credenza as an add-in with OL 2016. &nbsp;I can't ask the company that made Credenza &nbsp;because it stopped all support.</span></p>

<p>Either no one uses add-ins, no one has had problems in OL 2016 with add-ins that worked with OL 2010, or there have been problems. That's what I want to hear about. Not how to enable add-ins in OL 2016. Not about issues I have had. Not error messages I haven't
 even received since I don't have OL 2016.</p>

<p>
</p><p>#1 - There's no "one size fits all" answer to your question - depends on the addin</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Short of someone having direct experience with Credenza and responding here (which I doubt would happen given the generic nature of the &lt;thread subject line&gt;) - the quickest way to find out is to test it with '2016 via the one month free trial</p>

<p>It's critical to you and there is no support anymore, that combination would actually trigger me to find an alternative solution as soon as possible even when I'm not migrating to a new version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Karl Timmermans already noted, you can use the trial to find out yourself whether it still works but there is no promise that it will remain so. There could be security updates and other updates (not just Office, but also Windows or any other technology
 this add-in relies on) which could render the add-in useless when it is relying on deprecated methods which get disabled or removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could look at Office 365 Business Premium as it also includes Outlook Customer Manager which could be an alternative to your Credenza add-in;</p>

<p>Credenza is ***almost*** critical. It will remain so for about 2 more years. If I had to, I go do without it. I don't need to get rid of OL 2010 and Credenza works with it, so there's no need to get rid of Credenza. I'll just stick with OL 2010 if Credenza
 will not work with OL 2016. OL 2010 works fine and, now that I have installed OL 2016 on a different system, IMHO OL 2010 &nbsp;perhaps even better than OL 2016. &nbsp;I'm not at all impressed with OL 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at alternatives to Credenza. I looked before I initially posted. I didn't need to state that because I asked specific questions that did not need for me to state that I had already looked for alternatives. I wouldn't have posted if I hadn't
 already checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the alternatives wanting in several respects. Plus, I would have to learn a new program and hope that it worked on OL 2013 and OL 2016. Alternatives are at this time a dead end that needs no further discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I have installed OL 2016 on a different system and run Credenza's setup file. In OL 2016, I don't see Credenza. In the Add-In manager, I don't even see how it could be enabled. There's mostly
 just stuff about getting add-ins from MS Store which obviously is not a solution.</span></span></p>
<p>Some sites refer to using an add-in's MANIFEST files. If these were used with an add-in that works in OL 2010, NO ONE who has replied has mentioned using an add-in's MANIFEST
 files or whether they would even be found in an older add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As far as trying Outlook Customer Manager, that's a no go. First, getting 365 Premium costs more than what I am now paying for 365. Second, C/M is not designed specifically for the the type of work for
 which it would be used. Credenza is. Third, I'm not going to risk getting OL C/M after the stunts MS has pulled with Bus. Contact Manager. After finally getting BCM customized to work fairly well for my business, MS pulled the plug on it. Not going to risk
 it again with C/M. Fourth, I continue to use BCM with OL 2010 for old matters that were set up on it. About every other time I load OL 2010, BCM fails to load and causes a need to restart OL 2010. &nbsp;No. I'm not trusting MS with C/M. If I had to replace Credenza,
 I would go to a third party's comparable program that is known to work with WIN 10 + OL 2016.</span></p>
<p>This issue now boils down to the following. Does anyone know how to get a third-party add-in that worked with OL 2010 to work with OL 2016? Is there a site that describes a process that works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please no more unresponsive answers about replacing Credenza, getting OL 2016 trial, or trying 365 Prm's C/M.</p>

<p>Outlook 2016 won't work with Credenza or most "old" add-ins.&nbsp; The so-called experts, at least those with respect to Outlook,&nbsp; should have know this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Credenza announced several years ago that it had been updated to work with Outlook 2013. I can't find the news release anymore.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Couldn't agree more with your question and is exactly what I wrote in my post in this thread on May 17, 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing you should keep in mind is that it's <strong>only</strong> the vendor of the product who has the source code to the addin along with the install package so if something needs to be changed in either one or both of those, there is absolutely

            It's theoretically possible that a registry hack or setting change might solve the problem. This is what I am hoping for. I'm not asking for Microsoft to do anything.

<h3> pmholln  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete calendar present is Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Years ago, I got different calendars, which I no longer needed. So they have been removed a while ago via outlook using "Delete Calendar".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when syncing using Windows 10 Mobile, I see these calendars. Login into Office365 and looking, which calendars I have online, none of them are present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove these "dead" calendars that do not really exist anymore? My Windows 10 Mobile (Lumia 950) tries to sync with these and I do not have an option to remove them, nor can I see them via office 365 (online).</p>

            <p><span>Hi PMHolln,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As Aaron mentioned above, the most possible cause of the issue may be a sync delay. In addition, after we delete a personal calendar, it is moved to the Deleted Items folder. ActiveSync
 will still sync calendars in Deleted Items folder, the issue may be caused by this as well. So please try the steps below to check whether it can be solved:<br />
1. Open your Outlook client.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click more options (<strong>…</strong>) in the navigate bar &gt;
<strong>Folders</strong> as the picture shows below.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d083f831-90e4-4e0b-97ca-a635a439fc05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d083f831-90e4-4e0b-97ca-a635a439fc05" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Expand the
<strong>Deleted Items</strong> folder to check whether the deleted calendars are there. If yes, right-click on the calendars and then click
<strong>Delete Calendar</strong> to remove them from the folder.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Force sync your Windows 10 mobile and then check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists or you cannot see the deleted calendars in the folder, let’s confirm some information below to move on troubleshooting it:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Are these calendars created by yourself or shared from others? If it’s created by yourself, where and how you created them?<br />
2. Login to OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) &gt; right-click on the
<strong>Deleted Items </strong>folder &gt; click <strong>Empty folder</strong> &gt; click
<strong>Ok</strong> when it prompt the confirm window, and then check if the deleted calendars still present in your Windows 10 mobile phone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Larry</span></p>

<h2>            Office 365 continuously reverting version</h2>
                    <p>This problem has been frustrating me for weeks now, and I'm at my wits end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Office 365 installed version continuously reverts from 1810/1811 (monthly or insiders) to 1803 (semi-annual)</li><li>Running Microsoft's script to force new stream works, until the next time Office checks for updates, and it reverts</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Office 365 ProPlus was installed via Click-to-Run XML script</li><li>Licensing for Office 365 ProPlus is via E3</li><li>XML script is set to the 'Insiders' channel specifically</li><li>Office 365 Admin center shows that I am authorized for pre-release targeted version</li><li>No GPO's exist that would force a user to the annual or semi-annual channel</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What could possibly be causing this? Why does it keep rolling back?</p>

<p>Unfortunately its required by the enterprise environment I support. We want to pilot the monthly insiders channel to select users.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Are you certain that its Sophos? Office detects the roll back as an “update”, and runs through the entire process of downloading it and installing. It doesn’t just “snap” back on a reboot. It’s a deliberate Microsoft update process.</p>

            Since this is a test and deploy scenario, is it possible for you to attempt a dry run without Sophos just isolate? If it turns out to be Sophos, I would then look into options to contact them find out what be a solution.

            I will try it with Sophos protection disabled and get back to you. Seems Office won't even launch at all right now, despite me doing a clean reinstall yesterday. The fact that it keeps detecting the roll back as an 'update' makes me seriously doubt it's
 Sophos related.

<h3> wendycutler  say:</h3>
<h2>            TOC sorted by content&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a songbook, with songs positioned in the book not in alphabetical order. So it's hard to find the tunes from the table of contents unless that is in order by tune name. I'm not sure if I'm even using the right feature, but I want something that looks
 like a table of contents, but is in alpha order by Heading 1 text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this by copying the TOC into notepad, then back to the document (I see F9 would do the same) and then sorting. But I lose the hyperlinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some <em><strong>easy </strong></em>way to get list of tunes at the beginning in alpha order with the hyperlinks? That's updatable via Update Field?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. I'm not sure what version of Word I'm using, can't figure out where to find that, but I'm assuming there is not much difference in how this might work.&nbsp;</p>

            The only way to have a TOC list items in a particular order is to have the headings in that order in the document. Perhaps you need an Index - but they don't hyperlink.

<p>Nothing in an index is linked. Bear in mind, too, that TOC entries are linked to a specific heading; an index entry wouldn't have anything other than an INDEX field for a potential 'link'. And, as for linking to a particular page; that isn't how hyperlinks
 work and, furthermore, simply opening the document on a different computer could have the indexed entry being on a different page than the hypothetical hyperlink might point to.</p>

http://word.uservoice.com/</a>.<br />
Do be aware, though, that MS is unlikely to change a 'by design' behaviour that: has&nbsp;been around for decades; is familiar to many experienced Word users; is probably how most users expect the program to work; and could&nbsp;make the documents&nbsp;incompatible with existing

                    After updating to Powerpoint 16.16 on my MacBook Pro, any graphics intensive builds or transitions cause the display to flicker and the computer eventually freezes up entirely so that the only way to get out is a hard reboot. &nbsp;This did not happen in the

<p>Hi Daniellem917,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tested with two macs OS version 10.12.6 and 10.13.6 and I don’t see the same behavior when using your PPT. In fact, I added more slides and graphics in your PPT for test purpose but still couldn’t reproduce the issue. I am sending the updated PPT
 in a private message for your reference. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Given the situation, I’ll suggest you remove the custom add-in to make sure if it isn’t creating the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists after removing the add-in, then the next step, I’ll recommend creating a new user account and then test PowerPoint.
</span>A new user account can help us determine if the issue is with PowerPoint application or your mac profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The new user system does not have anything added and PowerPoint runs from scratch. Here’s an

    <title>An email draft in my Draft Folder disappeared within minutes after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathylandry  say:</h3>
<h2>            An email draft in my Draft Folder disappeared within minutes after working on it&#33;</h2>
                    I had a very important draft in my draft folder that is hard to reconstruct&nbsp;that had been in the folder for several months.&nbsp; I add text to it several times a week.&nbsp; Had just edited it, then worked on another draft.&nbsp; Within minutes I went back to that draft
 and it was gone!&nbsp; Checked my 'deleted folder'.&nbsp; Not there. Tried the 'recover deleted emails' link until it said there were no more to recover.&nbsp; My draft did not recover.&nbsp; I've done advance search in all folders/inbox using key words, and nothing!&nbsp; I didn't
 do anything I'm aware of to delete it.&nbsp; I work with draft emails almost daily and am very careful about clicking 'save draft' after editing.&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of times, &nbsp;I think I've accidentally clicked the little trashcan 'delete' icon near the subject line when
 trying to open a draft, but when I check my Delete folder, it has been there and I simply move it back to Drafts.&nbsp; I realized this draft was gone within 5 or 1

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me assist you with your concern. We understand that you want to recover saved email in Drafts folder. It seems that you accidentally deleted that saved email.&nbsp;I regret to inform you that there is no way to see that specific message once again since you've
 mentioned that you already tried to recover emails. <span><font color="#000000">If you don't see the deleted messages that you wanted, it means that they are permanently lost.
</font></span>The best way you can do is to type in the message again and be careful to click something or somewhere else for you not to lost the mesage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">If you have any additional concern, please let us know so we can assist you further.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
