    <title>BitLocker Recovery &#47; lock out reason - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajeesh.john  say:</h3>
<h2>            BitLocker Recovery &#47; lock out reason</h2>
                    <p>We manage BitLocker using McAfee MNE through McAfee ePO. There are systems which go onto recovery mode due to various reasons. We found a Microsoft article (https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/tip_of_the_day/2016/08/09/tip-of-the-day-what-could-cause-bitlocker-to-start-in-recovery-mode/)
 which in general talks about all the possible reasons for recovery /lock out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However how can we find the exact reason for the Bitlocker recovery screen /lock out on a particular machine (probably through PowerShell commands /Event logs). Mainly trying to figure out a way to identify the reason from local machine itself after the
 unlocked /recovered.</p>

            <p>The easiest way I've found to do this is to temporarily copy the images in the album you want to upload to a new folder and then go to the shutterfly website and upload that folder. &nbsp;To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the Photo App click "select" (near the upper right)</li><li>Select the photos you want to upload, either individually or there is a select all that will appear in the upper left.</li><li>Click on "copy" in the upper right or ctrl+c to copy</li><li>In file explorer create a new folder&nbsp;</li><li>Paste the images into this folder</li><li>On Shutterfly: click upload folders</li><li>Select the folder you just created and hit upload</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After you're done you can remove the temporary folder.</p>

<p>The Xbox Online Service Center will not accept the serial number of the Xbox Elite Controller.</p>

My kids lost some paddles and I wanted to order replacements. I was told to go the Xbox Online Service Center, but it wont let me add the Elite Controller serial number.</p>

<p>How do I order replacement paddles?</p>

<p>You will need to register the Xbox One console's serial number first, then add an accessory to that console. There is an option to add an Elite Controller there. It took me forever to figure that out!</p>

    <title>Windows mobile device center is not supported in Windows 8. What is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob11529  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows mobile device center is not supported in Windows 8. What is the replacement program for it&#63; I need to communicate with my Allegro CX handheld device.</h2>
                    I could connect my Allegro CX with a 9 pin com cable and click the PC link icon on the Allegro which would open the Windows Mobile Device Center. The File system would come up on my desktop and I could transfer files to and from the unit. Before Windows
 7 it would connect with ActiveSync but with Windows 7 it changed to the Mobile Device Center. Now...?? It's a handheld data collector used in the land surveying industry. Now I have no way to connect&nbsp;and I haven't found a substitute program yet. Any help would
 be appreciated. Thanks.

    <title>Cannot sign in with domain account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jligman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot sign in with domain account</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a new PC form HP. I am running Windows 10 Pro with all the latest updates. I also have a Windows 2008 R2 domain controller. I am able to join the domain, however, I cannot log in to the Windows 10 PC with any of my domain accounts. I am
 told that the user name or password is incorrect which is definitely not the case as I use these credentials to log into several PCs daily. I am able to log in using a local admin account. Strangely, I needed to provide domain admin credentials in order to
 join the PC to the domain and that worked fine. I have done this several times before and my other PCs can authenticate properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using multiple user accounts.</p>
<p>Changing my account password.</p>
<p>Syncing the time with the domain using NET TIME</p>
<p>Unjoining and rejoining the domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be appreciated. I do the administration for the Active Directory account and I have full privileges for both the PC and the DC so I am able to make any changes that would be necessary. Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Timon,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I realize the issue you are facing with the fonts and icons which appears to be blurry on the screen. I will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer the below questions to assist you better.</span></p>
<p><span>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Have you made any changes in the settings of the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Is the issue specific to fonts and icons?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In <strong>Windows 10</strong>, you can now set
<strong>DPI (Dots per Inch) scaling</strong> to make text and other items, such as icons, fonts, and windows, to display larger or&nbsp; smaller for all displays or per-display.<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows 10</strong> DPI scaling improvements are primarily focused on:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Optimizing the usability and&nbsp;readability of high-DPI displays</span></li><li><span>Providing a uniform experience&nbsp;multi-display systems</span></li><li><span>Empowering developers to&nbsp;optimize app-specific scaling based on display DPI</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are running a screen resolution of 1366x768 on a tablet, chances are that UI will look good at 100% DPI settings. But what about when you connect that tablet to an external high resolution display? In
 Windows 8 you can choose either 100% to optimize the UI on the tablet display or up to 150% to optimize the UI on the external display. You have to compromise.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows&nbsp;10</span></strong><span> takes care of this issue by supporting
<strong>per-display DPI scaling </strong>to address. By default, Windows 8.1 will choose the optimum DPI scaling value for each display based on the value chosen for overall scaling in the control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>You can change Modern UI text size by following the steps provided below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>System</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Display</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Now change the font size &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; according to your choice.</span></li></ul>

</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist I suggest you to Uninstall the display drivers and then reinstall from the manufacturer website and check if it helps. Please follow the below steps for the same.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the search bar type â<strong>Device Manager.</strong>â</span></li><li><span>On the left pane locate â<strong>Display adapter</strong>â and expand by clicking on it.</span></li><li><span>Right on the â<strong>Display Adapterâ</strong> option and click â<strong>Uninstall</strong>â.</span></li><li><span>Download the latest Network adapter driver setup file from the
<strong>manufacturerâs website</strong> and install it.</span></li></ol>

<p>as you can see from the 4 screenshots 2 are from computer running windows 8.1 and 2 are from it running windows 10. And clearly the fonts in windows 10 are blurry especially the full screen start in windows 10. the windows 10 I installed is the latest version
 and all drivers are up to date.</p>

            I had stated earlier the drivers are up to date, and Yes they are specifically for windows 10. I had installed drivers for the display adapter from Dell Website, and also tried the Intel drivers from the Intel website but the problem still persists. if
 could you could kindly look back on my screenshot post i think it is a Bug in windows 10. when the start is in full screen the texts become blurry in the metro shortcuts. I suggest you view the screenshots in full screen to see what am saying.

    <title>Skype Mobile keeps changing my Skype Desktop status - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> envy661  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Mobile keeps changing my Skype Desktop status</h2>
                    <p>I'm about to pull my hair out. To make matters worse, Skype's "Customer Support" is an endless loop of "Getting in touch with someone" through means of a virtual person that redirects you to a contact page that redirects you to the virtual customer service
 page again. I'm <strong>REALLY STARTING TO GET ANNOYED.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ANYWAY,&nbsp;</strong>the problem I'm having has existed for ages for me. Every time, and I do mean EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I open the skype app on my phone, it resets my Desktop Skype status to "Available" from "Do not Disturb". To make matters worse, I
 have found no conceivable way to stop this from happening. Turning off all notifications on skype mobile does nothing. There is also not visible way to change skype statues on mobile. As a result, every time I try to use it, it sets me to Available on Desktop
 and all notifications start playing through all three linked devices I have (Desktop, Laptop, and Mobile).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To Clarify:&nbsp;</strong>I recently got a brand new phone and am running the latest version of the skype mobile app. Please note: IF YOUR SOLUTION IS TO ROLL BACK THE VERSION, I might as well just uninstall it at that point.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">IT TAKES LESS EFFORT TO UNINSTALL SKYPE THAN IT DOES TO ROLL IT BACK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I literally just want to stay Do Not Disturb. I am always DND on Skype, and I do not want to be set to available. Another "Solution" That isn't a solution is muting every chat individually. That is a lot of effort to go through for something that should
 be a <strong>SIMPLE FREAKING FIX!&nbsp;</strong>Not to mention, it defeats the entire purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, for the love of GOD, solve my problem. I am inches away from just saying "Eff it" and uninstalling skype and only using Discord from now on, instead of both.</p>

    <title>Freeing disk space from deleted Windows.old files and folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grass2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freeing disk space from deleted Windows.old files and folders</h2>
                    
<p>A few months back I upgraded from XP to 7.&nbsp; As part of the installation a Windows.old folder was created.&nbsp; The change to 7 went well, but today I needed to free up some disk space on the C: drive to install some software so I thought I would delete Windows.old.&nbsp;
 Without knowing better I just right clicked on the folder icon and clicked DELETE.&nbsp; It disappeared but no disk space was freed up. The properties of the C: drive tell me there is 55 GB on the disk but the total of the contents of C: show only 35 GB so I'm
 missing 20 GB that I need - there is less than 5 GB left on the disk.</p>
<p>I've tried Disk Clean Up (including sytem file clean up) according to instructions but does not work. Is there any way of finding and delete these "invisible" files.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Actually you didn't. An upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7 is not<br />
possible. What you did was a clean installation of Windows 7.</p>

<p>That's fine; there's nothing wrong with doing it that way. When you<br />

<p>That's perfectly normal. See below.</p>

<p>Disk Cleanup has nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>"Deleting" a file (or folder) doesn't actually delete it; it just<br />
marks the space as available to be used. If you want it gone, just go<br />
to the Recycle Bin and empty it.</p>

<h2>            Lost all of my Saved Game Progression&#63; On XBOX 360. Storage some how was erased&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently went to go play some games on my xbox 360, I have not played it in a few months and now all of my saved games are gone? I know that they were saved last time I played on the xbox. One weird thing is that all of my achievements are still there.</p>
<p>Is it a storage problem? I tried re downloading my account but nothing changed. Is there a way to get my saved game progression back? I have a new Xbox 360 slime with a 500 GB Hard Drive, bought it this year. The reason why it is new is because my 6 year
 old xbox 360 broke beginning of the year, the tray would no longer open or close properly. Also I believe that 250 GB hard drive became corrupt because it says its unformatted. Although when I re downloaded my account onto the new xbox 360 I know for a fact
 it did still have it's saved games I played. But just a few months of not playing it, and going back for some reason all of my saved games progression is gone.</p>
<p>Is there a way to fix this? Please if there is I'd like to play all of my games once more~!</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;When you got the new console and hard drive did you get an official Xbox transfer cable and transfer all the content from the original hard drive to the new one? &nbsp;If you did not then that would be the reason why you no longer have access to your game saves.</p>
<p>If the 250GB hard drive became corrupt before you were able to transfer the content then I'm afraid that there is no way to access them again.</p>

                    I am having hp e001ax it has AMD A10 5750m APU which has AMD Radeon HD 8600M graphic card and also it has AMD Radeon HD 8650G dedicated graphic card. On Sunday I upgraded to windows 10 now I am not able to find drivers for graphic card drivers. I tried
 updating it from device manager it updated but windows says its not compatible. I also tried catalyst suite but no help I also tried AMDs auto detect utility which detects the system and downloads the appropriate driver but that is not able to connect to internet(computer
 is connected to internet). The problem I am facing due too this is that I cant change screen brightness, my computer is producing too much heat(in fact there was a thermal shutdown due to this!). What should I do to solve the problem.

            <p>Kudos! for understanding the question and just pointing out the thermal shutdown part. Let me rephrase what I said, I upgraded to windows 10 due to some reason windows 10 is not supporting display drivers which windows 8.1 was supporting fine. as there is
 no drivers graphic performance is very low and hence the GPU is over working and producing a good amount of heat this heat became so high once that there was a thermal shutdown. In short the thermal shutdown happened due to the fact that there is no proper
 software driver for the graphic card.</p>

Yes - you can reinstall OEM on a replacement hard drive in the same computer.<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Urgent -- Windows RT Surface is in Preparing Automatic Repair Loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Urgent -- Windows RT Surface is in Preparing Automatic Repair Loop</h2>
                    Hello MS Team,<br />
<br />
I have been using my Windows 8 RT Surfact Tablet from few days. I'm not sure what went wrong, my Surface Tablet is not able to login.<br />
Restarted/Reset/Refresh all operations starts with "Preparing Automatic Repair" and fails with below error message with "Shut down" and "Advanced options":<br />
Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC<br />
Press "Advanced options" to try other options to repair your PC or "Shut down" to turn off your PC.<br />
Log file: C:\windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt<br />
<br />
But, could not find any such file in c:\windows\system32\logfiles folder. Not even "Srt" folder is available.<br />
On selection Automatic Repair from From Advanced Options --&gt; Troubleshoot --&gt;Advanced options, tablet will show "Diagnosing your PC" with spinning dots, and then shows the same above error message.<br />
<br />
Also, tried all the options that are available in Advanced option, except, "Use a USB device, network connection or Windows recovery DVD" as I don't have Windows Recovery&nbsp; DVD with me.<br />
<br />
I'm badly stuck with my work, please help me out in resolving this issue. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
-Iqbal<br />

Thank you posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is normal for chargers for devices like the Surface to get warm to the touch. It is not normal for them to get as very hot though. If it is hot, I would consider it to be faulty and a possible fire risk and would contact Microsoft Surface support with a
 view to getting it replaced. Please see:</span></p>

    <title>Custom Start Tiles Disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Custom Start Tiles Disappeared</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm not sure when or which update did this, but when I clicked on start menu last week, all my custom tiles are gone. My custom tiles are very intricately set up and I'd rather not redo the whole process. On top of that, my Microsoft EDGE browser disappeared
 completely in my system. I can no longer search on it in START. I don't use EDGE but I'm just wary that it might have also mess up other programs as well. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Numerous Errors in Event Viewer Custom Views&#47;Server Roles&#47;Web Server&#47;Admin Events</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have a new installation of win10 on a new hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enable IIS but it won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for a reason I found all kinds of errors in the Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Listing numbers like 1500, 1508, 5002 and quoting things like corrupt registry,&nbsp; corrupt database, unable to load app and so on..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need another installation of win10, I guess?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From where? Which?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask because, for instance, I get advice such as this from: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-</p>
<p>update-winpc/reinstalling-windows-10-over-a-corrupted/34c3adc0-632b-43a6-99e8-b4638ff77366</p>
<p>
</p><p>which is two years old and it mentions going to a page to download a win10 ISO&nbsp; but when I get there such a simple option is no longer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just updates and whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm currently doing the update.&nbsp; Despite my install having been freshly done only two days ago and spending hours 'updating' it told me my current version was out of date by some 100 version numbers or something....&nbsp;&nbsp; so I'm doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather know exactly what I'm doing and where I will be at and a good start in that direction would be to have a current ISO to hand that I could trust.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Arthur,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, since your operating system is unstable we recommend that you perform an in-place upgrade using an ISO file to repair any broken system file while keeping your personal files, settings and installed applications. To do this, follow the
 steps provided by Andre Da Costa in this </span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">article</span></strong></a><strong><span>.
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, performing an in-place upgrade would be your best approach to resolve your concern and it will make your system works on its full functionality again.

<p>thanks for your help.&nbsp; it's good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had some excellent help from microsoft today - kinda chat thing with a guy who remotely operated my pc and organised the download of an iso to fix things the way&nbsp; you're talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately i had to leave to pick up my children from school before the operation was complete and I had broken the telephone connection with him, by agreement, in order that my cordless phone would not go flat battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I couldn't tell him that I had to go..</p>
<p>
</p><p>the chat thing was still open so I wrote it in that - i was able to do that - but I got no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I got home it was still there and no activity.&nbsp; the iso was downloaded.&nbsp; I saw from the timestamp that my message had not gone to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he had not rung my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote more on the chat but apparently there was no one at the other end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw from the event log that he'd tried a reboot and it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I burned the iso and put it in the player and I rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the machine went into a new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seemed fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I need your help again - it has hung on a page where it says 'how would you like to set up?'&nbsp; and has nothing but two little icons at the bottom, one on the left, one on the right.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one on the right is a loudspeaker and allows setting the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one on the left says something like 'easy setup'&nbsp; and gives a sidebar of options and a recorded voice tells you about them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there is a 'button' or something saying 'next'.&nbsp; But clicking it does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stuck there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do?</p>

<p>In this case, to help us determine the appropriate step to take, we'd like to verify the version of the ISO that you're installing. For instance, if you're trying to do an in-place upgrade using Windows 10 Pro ISO file, this should be matched to the previous
 installation on your PC. Can you send us a screenshot of the exact process where you are stuck at the moment?</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't see it until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I eventually was able to get into the computer enough to be able to go to Microsoft support and eventually get onto their chat thing where I met a very nice lady and we recorded a 'Case Number' which I hadn't done the previous day...&nbsp; and we got
 into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What luck.&nbsp; Twice in two days talking face to face, so to speak, with MS technicians about my little problem.&nbsp; Individual attention in a world where millions (400 million, they claim) of people are using the software with many experiencing problems and looking
 for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't believe my luck.&nbsp; I still can't. But it happened.&nbsp; Never my experience in the past.&nbsp; One to one within minutes of asking...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beautiful.&nbsp; But, unfortunately not successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same thing again.&nbsp; Remote access.&nbsp; Look around in the logs.&nbsp; Run some diagnostic.&nbsp; See there's really a problem, I wasn't complaining for nothing.&nbsp; So remotely download a new version and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked for a 100% working version and an ISO on the HDD so's I can burn it for future use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She gave me a 'repair' install - i.e. leaves data and apps intact.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps that was a mistake.&nbsp; Because it is not working.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't get a chance to try it until today and it is down in the house there now...&nbsp; sluggishly going through it's mysterious paces...&nbsp; log in screen wouldn't even accept input from the keyboard
 for minutes....&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>then threw up a Contacam text file so maybe Contacam is doing something bad..&nbsp; when I can get in there I'll root it out and see how I go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if there is a downloaded ISO there.&nbsp; I hope so.&nbsp; And I hope it will allow making a totally new install because that's what I plan to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wipe the hard drive and make a new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which will take me back to last week and where I was then.&nbsp; When I bought a new drive and made a new install - which mysteriously presented on windows explorer as being an install with an 'old windows' install in the root directory, too...&nbsp; how on earth
 could that be?&nbsp; Do install disks sometimes abort and restart perhaps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do new drives come with an intall on them?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; Nonsense.&nbsp; But that's what I saw there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That disk is still the one in there.&nbsp; It now has two 'old windows' dirs in the root because yesterday's attempts made another one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll show you when I can get in there.&nbsp; I'll post a screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone mad and now believe in ghosts and spirits.&nbsp; I think some evil spirit is haunting that location in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been fighting to get a properly working install there for six months - or more - yep, true...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ghost hunters around?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Printing fails</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 10 last Friday. I believe I printed fine on Monday and Tuesday so&nbsp;all seemed to go well however&nbsp;today I cannot print. When in any application, if I hit the print button, the system starts spinning or not responsive.

<p>Hi Salvador,</p>
<p>
</p><p>User files are being stored only on the specific local accounts who created it in the first place. Having multiple accounts is one of the many features of Windows 10. This feature was created for privacy purposes and to restrict other people from accessing
 their own files. If you want to get the file from the other user account, you need to have an access to their login credentials or permission to copy it to your own user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need more help.</p>

<p>Hi Johann, Thanks for your reply, I started to reply to you but had to interrupt it and I'm not sure if I submitted it or not.</p>
<p>Just in case let me say that my problem seems to be little more complex. I'm not trying to access other user files, what happens is that my user files are stored under a folder under the "USERS" folder but with a name that happens to be the 5 first letters
 of my Microsoft Account but is different than the "Current User" so if I try to access any of my files using the "current user" variable in my programs it wont find them. Also there is no folder in the "Users " folder with the "current user" name.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>â¦&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press <strong>
Windows + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run </strong>window. Type <em>winver </em>
and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.<br />
<br />
â¦&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are the recent changes made on your user profile?<br />
â¦&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How many user profiles registered on your computer?<br />
â¦&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you send us a screenshot of your folders?<br />
â¦&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you using a local account or Microsoft account?<br />
</p>

<p>Hi, thanks again.</p>
<p>The&nbsp; problem seems to be the way windows 10 handles the "Users" files. In this case I don't know why but windows arbitrarily assigned the first 5 letters of my Microsoft account (Email address forced by Microsoft) as my user folder and no matter how sign
 on, that is the user folder that it recognizes as mine But when I try to access the User Name system variable from a program which I need since the files accessed by the program will be the "Current User files" then it uses a user name that looks like a user
 Id that I may have used at some prior time; but for which doesn't even exists any folder.</p>
<p>I went as far as creating a folder for with that name under "Users"&nbsp; and when I try to access the files under that folder which coincides with the "system Current User"&nbsp; it comes back with "NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS" error.</p>
<p>It really looks like Microsoft has a big problem in windows 10 or I don't know anything about computers after writing programs (now called Apps) for over 30 years and using windows for more that 25.......</p>
<p>Thanks again, I hope you can figure this one out.</p>
