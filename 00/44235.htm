<h2>            No Notification to safely remove hardware</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 Pro version and I do not get a Safely to Remove&nbsp; hardware notification - visual or sound.<br />
If I have multiple flash drives attached, after the first attempt to safely remove a drive the "flash drive: icon is no longer active.<br />
I have to use File Explorer to verify the flash drive has been released or just power down to ensure drives (USB ports) are not active.</p>
<p>Settings &gt;&gt; Notifications &amp; actions : Does not have a setting for USB.</p>
<p>Settings &gt;&gt; Devices &gt;&gt; USB :&nbsp; is set to Notify me if there are issues connecting USB devices.<br />
What setting provides the visual and sound notification to safely remove a hardware device?</p>

            Hello, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />For safe eject notification missing:
<br />• Press keyboard&nbsp;"win + R"
<br />• Type "regedit"
<br />• Search the value "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Settings\Microsoft.Explorer.Notification.{...}"
<br />• If you REG_DWORD 0x00000001(0) set "0" you can double click on value. Set the value&nbsp;data to "1"
<br />• Click "OK"
<br />I hope this helps.

<p>Virginia, Thanks for the response.<br />
I tried the search&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Settings\Microsoft.Explorer.Notification.{...}</span></p>
<p>and being not sure about "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.{...}", part of the search
<br />
I navigated the registry up to the point of "Settings" and did not find the next level "</span><span>\Microsoft.Explorer.Notification.".</span><br />
see pic attached.&nbsp; Now I am wondering how many entries I am missing, at the "Setting" level.<br />

            Here's mine.
<br />It looks as though your missing this key, I don't know whether creating it from my image will work though.
<br />You could always try an in-place upgrade repair:

            Now, I am baffled. <br />
I checked several other PCs (Home Edition, which do not have a notification problem) and
<br />
their entries look very similar (almost identical) to the Pro edition.<br />
They also do not show the Explorer entry. &nbsp; <br />
Also. I see you have Two(2) Explorer entries.&nbsp; (??)<br />
I am the Local Administrator for all the PCs and the Pro version is 1803.<br />
What version of Windows 10 are you using?

            Windows 10 Pro 1803 fully upto date.
<br />The entry has always been there for me, I have noticed on various forums when helping others with the same issue that they too don’t have the entry which has me baffled too.
<br />I sign in with a Microsoft account rather than a local account. I wonder if that is the difference,
<br />I’m not having problems but it is strange re the two explorer entries.

<p>Don't know what Quiet Time has to do with USB&nbsp; Removal notification.<br />
Found this on MSFT site for explaining Notification:</p>
<p><span><br />
Windows&nbsp;7 introduces the concept of "quiet time". Quiet time is defined as the first hour after a new user logs into his or her account either for the first time or for the first time after an operating system upgrade or clean installation. This time is set
 aside to allow the user to explore and familiarize themselves with the new environment without the distraction of notifications. During this time, most notifications should not be sent or shown. Exceptions include feedback that the user would expect to see
 in response to a user action, such as when he or she plugs in a USB device or prints a document.
<br />
<br />
Again, I have the flash drive icon in the notification area of the task bar, I just don't get notification after selecting a device to be ejected/removed.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps before you buy Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Microsoft no longer sells 8/8.1.</p>
<p>Try amazon.com, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Check to see if your Computer/Laptop Manufacturer has Windows 8.1 Drivers available for your Model.</p>
<p>If not available, Windows 8.1 will not install and work correctly for you.</p>

<p>I had to reinstall my operating system. I had lost everything in my device manager. After reinstallation my font is too small. The games that I play online are now too small. What do I need to do to fix this? Even my e-mail and my aol toolbar are small!!</p>

    <title>About reinstalling Windows 7 to factory default settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rumpled103  say:</h3>
<h2>            About reinstalling Windows 7 to factory default settings</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I have an Acer computer that came pre-installed with Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. And it's now Service Pack 1. I have Mcafee Anti-Virus and when I try to click on Real Time Scanning or Firewall, they turn themselves back off. Now this may have something
 to do with the services like Base Filtering Engine because when I go to it in Services and try to turn it on, it says "Access is denied". Ok, well, then I tried going to Windows Firewall and clicked on "Use recommended settings" and I get an error "Windows
 Firewall can't change some of your settings. Error code 0x8007042c." Ok, well, maybe it has something to do with viruses, I don't know.<br />
<br />
I tried contacting Mcafee and they wanted me to pay for 1 yr techincal support in order to get rid of the viruses that are probably causing Mcafee (and possibly the Base Filtering Engine) to not work. Of course, I didn't agree to it.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now, I am thinking about trying the Mcafee 1 yr technical support again, but of course I'd have to get permission from my father since it's his computer. But I don't know if
 it'll even be worth it. I don't know if Mcafee will be able to remove all the viruses, trojans, malwares, ect. from the computer and have everything working again. That includes the Real Time Scanning, the Firewall, Base Filtering Engine, Windows Firewall,
 HomeGroup, ect. There was one thing I didn't mention. I've been having problems with my HomeGroup. Now I was just able to get the Homegroup computers connected. When you open Windows Explorer and click on HomeGroup, o</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ne
 of the computers will show up. It will display the computer name. However, if I were to go to the other computer and check Homegroup, I wouldn't see my father's computer on it. I'm not quite sure why this is. It could be because my father's computer is on
 Network 5 and the other computer is on Network 15. I have already tried "Set up a Connection or Network" &gt; "Set Up a Network", but it just says "It might take up to 90 seconds for unconfigured devices on your network to appear." But they never appear. So I
 just close it out.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now I have tried looking for solutions online, but I just can't find the right one. My only options right now are to either reinstall Windows 7 (and it'll most likely have
 to be through factory reset). Or try to find out if there are any viruses, trojans, malware, ect. that are causing the issues.</span></p>
<div><br />
</div>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'd like to figure how to reinstall and activate Windows 7 again, because maybe it will get rid of these viruses that are probably messing it up. Now, I have a COA Product Key, it's on the computer case, but due to something called System Locked Preinstallation,
 that product key will most likely not work when I try to enter the product key. I looked in the System Properties and my Product ID, the 2nd block, has OEM in it, indicating that it's an OEM. So knowing that, I will just probably be told to just not enter
 a product key and continue. So after that, what is the best way to activate Windows? Will Windows be automatically activated because it's an OEM or do I need to activate over the phone and explain my situation?</p>

            <p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>

            <p>A factory restore is about the absolute last resort option when problem solving and involves a lot of work...&nbsp; Making a backup that you can count on to restore properly, hoping the factory restore actually works, getting back on the Internet (maybe), reinstalling
 all the Windows Service Packs and Updates, reinstalling and activating all your third party applications then restoring your backup and hope that it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you should think about what you are going to do if the factory restore doesn't work at all and you are left with a system that will not boot and you have no Windows installation media - what are you going to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some folks consider McAfee itself to be a virus and malware...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are considering performing a factory restore which will restore your system to the state it was in when it left the factory why not consider uninstalling McAfee first to see how things look?&nbsp; You can always reinstall it again, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many antivirus/antimalware applications have their own special instructions and removal tools and so does McAfee so you need to be sure to follow their directions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://service.mcafee.com/webcenter/portal/cp/home/articleview;jsessionid=kf-hu67wS37wuxLditzwlyD-w3OxMFhnUTqNmIxK-4bz9V20OJr6!1727552898!-2020148959?articleId=TS101331&amp;_afrLoop=2359114582334964#!%40%40%3F_afrLoop%3D2359114582334964%26articleId%3DTS101331%26centerWidth%3D100%2525%26leftWidth%3D0%2525%26rightWidth%3D0%2525%26showFooter%3Dfalse%26showHeader%3Dfalse%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dv0e8bmmtw_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">McAfee
 Consumer Product Removal tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Replace McAfee with Microsoft Security Essentials which you can get for the low, low price of free:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if you think your system might be afflicted with malicious software install, update and scan with the free version of Malwarebytes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many folks like the free version of Malwarebytes that you can download from here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/dl-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/dl-confirm/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Towards the end of the installation you should be sure to uncheck this box:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/447df14b-cbd7-4d4c-8c63-beb2fc40b6ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/447df14b-cbd7-4d4c-8c63-beb2fc40b6ca" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then launch/run MBAM, update the definitions and at least run the Threat Scan to see what it detects and consider letting it remove anything it finds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you clear your temporary internet files, the scan will take less time (that is up to you).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The free version does not install any startup items (if you uncheck that box) so it will not interfere with other programs and if for some reason you decide you don't like it you can uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is usually not recommended to run more than one AV program that has realtime protections at the same time on the same system since they might conflict with each other and cause performance problems - again, that is up to you to decide.</p>
<p>

    <title>Why The Heck Did They Go Third Person FFS&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neomorph wth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why The Heck Did They Go Third Person FFS&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Seriously, I have loved the Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six series since they began... mainly because they nailed the first person genre. So now they decide to go THIRD PERSON? Haters gonna hate, and yes, I'm a third person hater. I've only just found this out
 because I wanted to miss out on any spoilers... looks like the first GR title I will not be getting on pre-order.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>It's the same as Red Faction... RF1 and 2 were first person shooters but then on console they made it third person and wasn't half as much fun.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>One of the main reason I hate third person is that the camera pretty much always screws up. Go near a wall and the view shoots all over the damned place. The second and more important reason I hate third person is that your body blocks the view and hides
 the enemy from you. OK it can look cool but I don't want to look at my back all the damned time. If god had meant us to play third person he would have stuck our eyeballs on stalks behind our head.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Third and last reason I hate third person is that it ruins immersion... as in totally ruins it. It's like having an out of body experience. Third person is OK in RPGs but is hopeless in shooters.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>God, I'm peed off now... looks like a rent only and hope that the next COD will do the Future Soldier thing better... at least it's not IW there to eff it up and it actually IS a first person shooter. Third Person Shooters can rot in hell for all I care.</p>

<p>You're only 8 years late - the Ghost Recon games have been 3rd person view since GR2 which released in 2004 (though GRAW and GRAW 2 both allowed full first person view on the PC).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>At least this one does offer a down the barrel view that wasn't present in either GRAW console title (they only offered a FP view with no visible weapon similar to the original Ghost Recon).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If Call of Duty looks like more your kind of game chances are that GRFS wasn't going to be your cup of tea anyway.</p>

<p>Only reason I brought COD into it is because it is a FPS and not a (spit) third person piece of doodoo. But up to now COD is crap too because it is just a prettied up Quake engine it seems (ie can't give your team orders, open doors/windows, can't even change
 the damned firing rate of your gun). It's just that Treyarch are better than IW (hell, anyone is better than IW) and maybe they will just pull a rabbit out of the hat.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>It's not that I truly hate third person either... I loved Splinter Cell Conviction. But for a straight up shooter you need to see everything in front of you. Like for when a grenade is thrown in front of you... if it lands in the area you can't see then
 tough luck. Hell, consoles are screwed with poor FOV anyway... having your body in the way is just adding insult to injury.</p>

<p>Sorry but I had to check this and you are wrong. I just loaded up GRAW2 on my 360 and guess what... FIRST PERSON.</p>
<p>I had to check in the options menu to make it go to "Over the Shoulder" view.</p>
<p>So 8 years late... nope... I'm just hoping that GRFS allows you to view in first person as well...</p>

<p>At least this one does offer a down the barrel view that wasn't present in either GRAW console title (<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>they only offered a FP view with no visible weapon similar to the original Ghost Recon</strong></span>).</p>

<p>I think it actually started the downward trend from GR2 when players thought the title was just too hard to play. I remember it being hard to get into at first but then loved it.</p>
<p>It's a shame that the Operation Flashpoint series was really buggy because otherwise I found it a really good combat simulator. Unfortunately too many franchises are going away from first person viewpoints for some reason. I still don't know the reason why
 this is.</p>
<p>I've decided to not cancel my Future Soldier pre-order and see what it is like before really ***... but I still hate third person in a shooter... Perhaps I'll just run around in aim-down-the-barrel mode heh.</p>

            <p>The effect you mention sounds like a shift key is stuck. &nbsp;Because holding shift+tab is how you go backwards, and also how to highlight a bunch of items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already tried another keyboard, my thoughts are that either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) &nbsp;Your computer plug has a broken pin or wire that is causing it to think that your shift key is stuck</p>
<p>&nbsp; or</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) &nbsp;You have some kind of accessibility setting that turns on shift-lock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To make sure it's not #2, do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Start menu, and type sticky in the search box.</li><li>Choose "Change how your keyboard works"</li><li>Uncheck all boxes and click OK on this screen:<br />

    <title>Account Locked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captain spud 01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Locked</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My three year old inadvertently purchased a Xbox live gold family pack on 10/28 for $99.99 with the card on my file. I had called in immediately after that happened and was told that my account was locked and nothing could be done and it would be sent to
 another department. I called back on 11/1 because I had not received any notification that the account was unlocked and they said that it was still in the same status. I called in again today 11/8 because the bill has hit the credit card on file. Talking with
 the representative, the account was unlocked on 10/29 and apparently relocked again for some reason. I did not authorize the purchase of the family gold pack purchase and I want it removed from my account. Please let me know when this is resolved so I can
 call back in and remove the card on file and remove this unauthorized purchase.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Dennis</p>

<p>The billings department through the phone support are the only people who can sort this out.</p>
<p>We on the forums have no power to fix these things, and we are just gamers ourselves and don't have access to any information in regards to your situation.</p>
<p>There are some Official Xbox Support agents who come on these forums, but I don't know how much they can do in the situation.</p>

<p>As Jameser78 said, your best bet here is to contact Xbox Support via Phone. I understand that having to contact several times is frustrating however nobody on this forum can help you and I do not believe the Official Xbox Support agents on the forums will
 be able to help in this situation as it'll require to be a more direct conversation. You'll just have to keep trying with agents and eventually one will be able to assist you. If your account was locked you'd want to firstly know why it was locked, when it's
 unlocked you can then contact them about the removal of the Family Gold Pack however I don't believe much can be done as it was a purchase which was made by family, even though it wasn't you. Although please do not quote me on that as you may be able to contact
 Xbox Support via the phone and they may be able to resolve your issue.</p>

"Faulty hardware, a buggy system service, antivirus software, and a corrupted NTFS volume can all generate this type of error."<br />

Run chkdsk on the system drive where paging file .<br />

Most probably check the ram.. if the problem persists change rams and isolate the problem<br />

<p>The following is applicable to Windows 7&nbsp;and Windows Vista .<br />
<br />
1. Download AccessChk (Sysinternals).&nbsp; This tool allows you to evaluate the access level of specific users or groups of resources including files, directories, Registry keys, global objects and Windows services.&nbsp; Here's the link to download the tool:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb664922.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb664922.aspx</a><br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;Save the zip file on your desktop, and extract the file:<br />
- Right click on the file, and select Extract All...<br />
- Click Next when prompted for the Destination.<br />
<br />
As a result, you should see a folder called AccessChk&nbsp; on your desktop.<br />
<br />
3. Open the folder AccessChk&nbsp; <br />
<br />
4. Hold the shift-key and right click in the window.&nbsp; Select "Open Command Prompt Here"<br />
<br />
5. A command prompt window should open with a similar prompt:<br />
C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt;\Desktop\accesschk&gt;<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp; Type the following command, and press Enter:<br />
accesschk.exe -s -n "nt service\trustedinstaller" -k "hklm\software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing" &gt;accesskchk.txt<br />
Tip: You should be able to copy and paste the command into the command prompt.<br />
<br />
7. Close the Command Prompt Window.&nbsp; Open the Accesschk folder on yoru desktop (if it has been closed).<br />
<br />
8. Double click on Accesschk.txt (the text file), this should open Notepad.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp; Copy and Paste your results with a new question on the Windows Update forum.&nbsp; (Make sure you write 0x80070005 in the subject line).<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

            <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to apologize for the delayed response on this thread.<span>&nbsp; </span>
All the results (logs) that you have all posted in the thread are helpful. <span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Based on the various results, it’s evident that the problem has a common cause.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Here’s a little <b>background</b> on the problem that you are experiencing:</p>
<p>When you use Windows Update to install updates for Windows Vista and Windows 7, the process relies on the Windows Module Installer (trustedinstaller.exe).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The <i>TrustedInstaller</i> is the online interface to the servicing stack.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To keep things simple, it’s one of the most important components when you install updates.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This method also allows Windows to be serviced (to install updates) without the need of an administrator.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In fact, when the components of Windows are being updated, it’s the <i>TrustedInstaller</i> that is used to update the operating system files.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, when you look at the security settings of certain servicing components of Windows, you would notice that the
<i>TrustedInstaller </i>is the only item listed under the User Name and Groups with full permissions.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is only true if the respective folder or registry key is kept at its default state.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In other words, changes to these security settings would cause the ACCESS DENIED (0x80070005).<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s difficult to associate a culprit to the unwanted changes.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
A possible cause that was previously mentioned is malware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Awhile ago, I asked the community to run a Sysinternal Tool known as Access Check to capture the details of the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The output of the tool would list all of the servicing components where the security permissions restricted the
<i>TrustedInstaller</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>As a result, when you try to install updates for Windows, you would obtain the error 0x80070005 – also known as ACCESS DENIED.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In summary, it is the TrustedInstaller that has been denied of access to a component that it should have access to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the output:</p>
<p><span>HKLM\software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Retry Agent</span></p>
<p><span>HKLM\software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Sqm</span></p>
<p><span>HKLM\software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Sqm\VistaSP1-KB936330~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~6.0.1.18000</span></p>
<p><span>HKLM\software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Sqm\VistaSP1-KB936330~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~6.0.1.18000\InstallCounter</span></p>
<p>As you can see from the above, there are four registry keys with unexpected security settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>...The Solution...</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To correct the problem, you can try the steps below.<span>&nbsp; </span>Keep in mind that these steps are still experimental.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

            That depends on the video player you're using and the properties of the video. What player are you using and is the video a DVD or something else?

            Hi janmuccio 
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail . . .
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Are you trying to play a video file, which has closed captions either in that file or in a separate file?
<br />
<br />If so, open the Films and TV App, open that video, then at the bottom left is an icon that looks like a square speech bubble from there you can choose the subtitle stream or file
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Or do you want to add closed captions to a video you are creating?
<br />

            I have a video in word that I'd like to add closed captions because I do not have speakers to listen to the video.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The number of apps that you can use on 1 monitor depends on the size of the monitor and the screen resolution you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can Snap up to 4 running apps on 1 monitor.</p>

    <title>camera not working on new windows update for windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            camera not working on new windows update for windows 10</h2>
                    Hello I need some help. Since my windows 10 updated again on my mobile my camera hasn't been working anymore. It asks me to give the app permission to use my camera and microphone. When I go into my privacy settings the camera doesn't exist. I turn on
 the privacy for all the other apps and it's still not working and there is no way that I can fix it by myself.

<br />If you want a shortcut to your Printer on your Desktop:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel - Devices and Printers
<br />
<br />Drag your printer onto the Desktop - that will create the shortcut
<br />
<br />That's It!

<h2>            Audio Playback device keeps getting replicated</h2>
                    <p>I have Dell computer with Windows 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have an Insignia amplifier plugged into the HDMI output on the Dell computer.&nbsp; It works great.&nbsp; The sound is awesome.&nbsp; I use youtube, Pandora, itunes, netflix.&nbsp; They all work and sound great.&nbsp; The problem is that
 the amplifier keeps getting replicated on the list of playback devices.&nbsp; I installed this version of Windows on Dec 7, 2017.&nbsp; And now I have 11 instances of the amp on my playback list and it keeps growing.&nbsp; I have no idea how to get rid of them.&nbsp; I can "uninstall"
 the device in the device manager and then it won't show up there but it does up in the list of playback devices.&nbsp; This issue is not the end of the world, it's just annoying.&nbsp; I would really like to know how to stop the HDMI device from being replicated and
 how to get rid of the many versions I have already.&nbsp; I've checked that the drivers are up to date!</p>

<p>I reached out the company that makes the audio receiver and they told me that no driver is required.&nbsp; When I go into Device Management to investigate what is currently listed under the driver section it tells me that Microsoft 10.016299.15 is being used.&nbsp;
 Then if I click in the Driver Details icon it says there are no details or files associated with this driver as no driver is required for this device.&nbsp; This seems to confirm what the manufacturer told me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that Microsoft 10.016299.15 is the Microsoft Media Creation Tool although I'm not sure how that helps me with my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - the troubleshooting thing doesn't help at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to try next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There usually isn't a SideBar Icon on the desktop. Start - type in Search box -&gt; SideBar<br />
Find at top and double click on it.<br />
<br />
Also :<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs - Accessories - Windows SideBar<br />
<br />
If you want to put one on the DeskTop then Right Click on one of those and COPY then<br />
go to the Desktop and PASTE.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

<h2>            PES 2012 Language options</h2>
                    
<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I'm from England but live in Portugal and I got PES 2012 bought for me in England as an Xmas present.</p>
<p>When I put it in my Xbox360 (which is 'registered?' in Portugal) the only language options are Spanish / Portuguese?</p>
<p>My console settings are all in English but it just won't give me the option. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>HELP! :(&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there Bravo! Is your account region Portugal or UK? You can also edit the console language by looking under the
<em>Settings Hub &gt; System &gt; Console Settings &gt; Language and Locale</em>. Let me know about the region and if that setting helps, thanks!</p>

<p>Hey Mister Gwyther. Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>My account was originally setup when I lived in Ireland, so I suppose my account region is there?</p>
<p>When I moved to Portugual I had to temporarily create a new account to buy some online content as microsoft assumes that once you've bought an Xbox you will never move country or region with it. But... I always use my original (Irish) account on the Xbox
 to play etc.</p>
<p>As for changing the console settings / languages locale, I've always had the language on English and I tried changing the locale to England but it didn't change anything...</p>
<p>I had an online chat with an Xbox rep yesterday who told me that English isn't supported in Portugal, but my question still remains; Why is it only PES 2012 that is giving me this problem? Other games, new and old all allow me to play in English? :(</p>

<p>Hey Bravo, I believe different games take their language cues from different places. Some games allow you to change the settings in the game menu, others default to the LIVE region they're being played on. If you're only having issues with PES, I highly
 recommending reach out to their <a href="http://www.konami.com/supports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">official support channel</a>, to see if they can offer a solution or provide any more insight.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 64Bit&nbsp; with a DirectX12 GPU (Geforce GTX 1060 6GB). When I try to run the game "Crysis3", I get an error report saying that I need DirectX 11 to run the game.&nbsp; How can I solve this?</p>

<p><em>"I guess it is the Geforce GTX 1060 that is causing the problem"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Nah ! Not if you are able to run other system intensive games, and the system is obviously new enough not to
</p>
<p>have any compatibility issues with 1803. If the 1060 did have issues with 1803 it wouldn't be with only one DX11 game.
</p>
<p>- However, have you tried running the game on your Intel HD graphics ? If you can load the game on the Intel HD</p>
<p>the Nvidia driver install may be corrupt, or there is some other software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"after trying some of the proposed solutions, my pc started acting strange and I had to reset it to a previous date."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- What fixes led to the 'strangeness' ? By 'reset' what method are you referring to, a System Restore or another form</p>
<p>or repairing Windows ? Was the restore successful in sorting out the strangeness ?</p>
<p>- Where are you at with the game atm ? You mentioned trying both disc and download versions. Have you run Origins</p>
<p>repair tool (R/click on games title in Origin) since restoring Windows and reinstalling the Nvidia drivers ?</p>
<p>- Did you migrate your Crysis3 profile/save folder from your previous Win10 machine to the new one ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When you reinstalled the drivers did you run <em>Display Driver Uninstaller</em> after uninstalling the drivers via
<em>Programs and Features</em></p>
<p>to clean up any left over Nvidia graphics drivers files (a few registry keys too) ?
</p>
<p>If you don't use DDU or Driver Fusion with Win10 it generally reinstalls a gpu driver from it's hidden driver cache while the machine is
</p>
<p>rebooting after you uninstall the drivers (Win10 stashed a driver I used in '16 for this task).
</p>
<p>This happens quickly and can be easy to missed. You can tell if this has happened because the Nvidia Control Panel shortcut</p>
<p>will be on the desktop R/click context menu, but the drivers will not be listed in Programs and Features.
</p>
<p>- I also go off line prior to Nvidia driver updates as a precaution against Windows Updates starting a driver install after rebooting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Display Driver Uninstaller Download version 14.1.0.0</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Have you also checked with ASUS for newer chipset, etc drivers, including Realtek audio, and BIOS update&nbsp;
</p>
<p>for your mobo since you built the machine ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Long shot # ....</p>
<p>- If a DX11 file used by the game has been corrupted (possibly by the game when it reinstalled DX ) it would not have been fixed
</p>
<p>by the DX Web Installer. </p>
<p>For this you need to either run the <em>DXSETUP.exe</em> from the&nbsp; <em>_Installer\directx\redist&nbsp;</em> folder, or download the</p>
<p><em>DirectX Redist (June 2010)</em> installer package.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A question. Is it necessary or desirable to uninstall&nbsp;<span>Skype version 12.1815.209.0 before installing version 7.41/0.101?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Secondly will Windows 10 not try to reinstall&nbsp;version 12 once one uninstalls v12?</span></p>
<p>

<p><span><span>You don't need to uninstall the 12.1815.209.0 version. The classic Skype version and Microsoft Skype for Windows Desktop can be installed side by side on the same computer. However,
 you will only be able to use one application at a time. To avoid&nbsp;any conflict, sign out of the 12.X version and sign in to the classic Skype.</span></span></p>
