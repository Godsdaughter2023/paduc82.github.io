<h2>            How to fix ERROR 0x8007045d in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday and today I bought a new TOSHIBA external HDD. My main HDD is partitioned in two, one I use for the system and essential program files and a second one that I use for other programs, I like to keep the system drive clean.
 I have been trying to copy/cut several folders, programs, files, etc, of all sorts, movies, isos etc, to the new HDD, and I am getting this error. An I/O error called&nbsp;0x8007045d.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read ALL relevant information on how to fix this from other threads and other sources online, and nothing has worked. Specifically, I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run checkdisk, through windows (tried dos mode and it stuck at 15%, had to hard reboot)</p>
<p>2. Downloaded and installed a registry fixer and a registry cleaner.</p>
<p>3. Stopped/exited my Kaspersky antivirus</p>
<p>4. Tried selective startup through msconfig, but I can't find any I/O related software on the startup list.</p>
<p>5. Reformatted the new drive to efat and back to ntfs (default allocation).</p>
<p>6. Danced the rain dance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these steps have helped. I really need to move several things, and this is getting annoying. I had that problem with Windows 7 that I had before as well, it isn't fresh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise with something that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<br />

</p><p>To answer your initial assumption, no, I don't have a Windows 10 ISO, I upgraded my Windows 7, as I said before. I will try to download this from the link you suggested, if it can be stored directly into my new HDD.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;Hi,</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>I understand the inconvenience you're going through. I suggest you to perform an&nbsp;Startup repair using the Windows 10 installation media. You will have ISO of Windows 10. You may refer to the following link on download
 and create Windows 10 installation media:</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Once you create the installation media, perform Automatic repair on Windows 10 computer, follow these steps:</span><br />
<span>a. Insert the media such as (USB or DVD) and restart your computer.</span><br />
<span>b. Press F12 key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.</span><br />
<span>c. Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:</span><br />
<span>d. Click next and select Repair your computer.</span><br />
<span>e. You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option Troubleshoot and select advanced options.</span><br />
<span>f. You may choose Startup Repair from Advanced boot option.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;Keep us posted if you face any issues on Windows in future. We will be glad to help you.&nbsp;</span><br />

                    <p>Original Title:&nbsp; Just the drivers... not all the rest!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have lost the CD that goes with my Mobile Action MA-800 USB Memory Card Reader 25 in 1.</p>
<p>I have tried looking over at the manifacturer website who don't offer it or even point elsewhere for the drivers.&nbsp; I have looked on the internet for drivers and am burried under companies that want to install what I see as lots of unwanted 'free' software
 to check my performance which I am worried about as I don't trust any of them and don't want checkers and performance reviews on my system as it is working really well at the moment (and if it ain't broke and working well then I don't like fiddling!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where can I get the basic software/drivers&nbsp;needed safely without any other hassle?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have windows 7 (64-bit) Sony Vaio</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the advice from the very clever person who will probably know in a second where to go!! :o)</p>

<h3> empraptor  say:</h3>
<h2>            VPN connection shows it&#39;s &#34;Connecting&#34; for a long time.  I cannot stop the process and cannot navigate list of available networks.</h2>
                    OS: Windows 8 Pro 64 bit
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sometimes when I try to connect to a VPN, the "Connecting" status shows for VPN for a long time. &nbsp;I don't know if it will eventually time out, but currently it has been going on for twenty minutes or so.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While the VPN adapter icon in "Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network Connections" window shows that it's "Connecting", the "Connect/Disconnect" option on the right-click context menu is disabled.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And I cannot navigate the list of available networks. &nbsp;So I can neither disconnect nor connect to networks through the available network list GUI while this is happening.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: I have now waited for 45+ minutes and VPN still says it's "Connecting" and the problem persists.<br />
<br />
Also, I made a thread a few weeks ago about the symptoms of this issue before I noticed VPN connection was causing the problem -&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/in-windows-8-list-of-available-networks-does-not/93fc91d4-b18a-43f2-87e2-72f57ec48c0f">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/in-windows-8-list-of-available-networks-does-not/93fc91d4-b18a-43f2-87e2-72f57ec48c0f</a></div>

<p>It would help if you could let us know if the computer is connected to a domain.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you perform a Clean boot and then try to create a system image.

            <p>I have just bought a new pc which had windows 8 installed on it and have just updated to 8.1 today.&nbsp; I created a system image dvd backup on windows 8 no problem but when i updated and wanted to do system image back up onto dvd for 8.1 i too have this error
 message appear (An error occurred, Class not registered (0x080040154), Close Windows Backup and try again) stopping me from creating a backup.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't understand how it worked fine in 8.0 but not 8.1.&nbsp; The only software i have is what was bundled with my pc and a chrome browser.&nbsp; I have updated nero 12 which came with the pc which i thought may help since im burning a disc but the error message
 still appears so i'm thinking it may be a Microsoft software conflict as my computer is new and hasn't much software on it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I haven't tried a clean boot as mentioned as im not confident messing around with the settings. I just want to turn it on and for things to work.&nbsp; The computer is for home use only and not connected to a network/domain or anything.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Will Microsoft be issuing a fix for this error message?</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I assume this is a result of the additionally created partitions by the Windows 8.1 "Update". I'd rather call it an on top installation, like installing Win 7 over XP. I usually avoid this. Because I thought it (Windows 8.1 update) is a service pack, I made
 this on top installation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I "updated" four PCs:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. PC had and has only one partition (Boot, Page File, ...) = Operating System (OS)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. PC had and has two partitions: Windows Disk Management says now, that the former Recovery Partition is "System Reserved". This means probably, that this partition is useless, because Win 8.1 doesn't recognize it as a Recovery Partition any more. 2nd Partition
 is OS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. PC (UEFI) had and has three partitions: Recovery, EFI System Partition, OS. Windows 7 Backup or Microsoft Windows Backup, how it is called in Win 8.1 says that backup is not possible because of insufficient space. The Update reduced the size of the Recovery
 Partition from 350 MB to 300 MB. The necessary additional 50 MB for the Volume Shadow Copy are not available&nbsp;(any more).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. PC (UEFI Tablet) had four partitions: 350 MB Recovery Partition, 8 GB Asus Recovery Partition, 100 MB EFI System Partition, OS. The Update created a fifth 300 MB Recovery Partition.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For PC number 4 (Tablet), which I bought quite recently, I experience the same problems as Kevin_eightyone described. In the
<a href="http://www.surfaceforums.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.surfaceforums.net</a>&nbsp;I read about similar problems (<a href="http://www.surfaceforums.net/forum/windows-8-forum/5254-question-about-volumes-recovery-partitions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfaceforums.net/forum/windows-8-forum/5254-question-about-volumes-recovery-partitions.html</a>)&nbsp;and
 somebody even deleted the "unnecessary" partitions (<a href="http://www.surfaceforums.net/forum/microsoft-surface-pro/5273-windows-8-1-recovery-partitions-bootable-usb-sticks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfaceforums.net/forum/microsoft-surface-pro/5273-windows-8-1-recovery-partitions-bootable-usb-sticks.html</a>),
 rendering the Manufacturer Recovery Partition useless, in the end.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi , thanks for that , but there is no way I am going to go and change partitions, On Disk management it shows 3 partitions and in Easus Partition manager it shows 5. I never created these Windows did.</p>
<p>I do not know what to do or why there is the difference.</p>

Every console function was immediately accessible and there was very minimal advertising.<br />

How is that 'terrible' compared to what we have now. Sure I'd miss my Avatar but pure function wise the blades beats every following incarnation of the dashboard.</p>

<p>I just want the dashboard we have right now for 360. It was perfect. Why they change it to this windows 8 &nbsp;wanna try hard look is silly and not user friendly, EG mums and dads and 7 yr old sisters who only just got the feel for 360. &nbsp;It is beyond me why
 they created this dashboard look. If it's not broke don't try to fix it. I am used to the dashboard and it is simple but it's taking up heaps of memory and CPU cycles not to mention the other useless system overheads that are forcing 720p rubbish game resolutions
 and *** FPS. &nbsp;Kill konnect. Kill fast startup. Kill the other bs going on with the OS and then xbox will run better. Microsoft, you crazy hatters, it's a game console not a pc. &nbsp;I still like it but it's has crabs bigtimel.</p>

<p>I'd LOVE to have the old Blades dash back...then, I could hunt down my console which is in a cupboard somewhere (and has been since the day after the NXE update stopped 99% of my games from working) and actually use it!</p>
<p>In fact, it's been so long since I played it, I have no idea where it is...not that it matters because nothing works on it now...</p>

<h2>            Just renewed my gold membership but can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t access xbox live content</h2>
                    My connection to Xbox live is valid. I've done the network troubleshooting and there's no problem. I'm playing dead space 3 and it won't let me access the ea servers or access co-op game play. It tells me my profile doesn't have access to this Xbox live
 content. Anyone else experience this?

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>If the gold subscription does show up under subscriptions on the link mentioned,&nbsp; try to clear the consoles cache and reboot the console that often speeds up the process that the console will recognize a change in the subscription:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sometimes can take some time before the change of subscription is available on all systems</p>

<p>RACAFLA1981- It's best to create your own thread instead of bumping one from a year ago. If you added the gold via the website there is a delay before the console will recognize it. Try testing your connection to speed up the process.</p>

<h2>            I think I broke my Xbox and I don&#39;t know how to fix it.</h2>
                    <p>I was downloading Batman: Arkham Origins and when it was at about 78% I clicked it to bring me to the Xbox store but then after about 5 minutes, the Xbox crashed. I tried restarting it and it greeted me saying the usual Hi but the rest was black and the only thing you could do was bring it to the page by holding down the Xbox button on the controller which gave you three options to shut the console off, shut the controller of or report a problem(doesn't work.) I&nbsp;took the disc out, but that didn't do anything either. Can someone please help?</p>

    <title>USB Ethernet on Windows RT using Trendnet TU2-ET100 &#40;Cisco - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> damazta  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Ethernet on Windows RT using Trendnet TU2-ET100 &#40;Cisco USB300M&#63;&#41; with AX 88x72A chipset -&#62; unsupported, but WORKS&#33;</h2>
                    <p>today, I received my usb-ethernet adapter trendnet TU2-ET100 (H/W:V4.0R) - purchased due to "community compatible" votes on the Windows RT compatibility website. NOT plug-n-play. it was recognized, but not installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>on top, the chipset manufacturer ASIX was apparently "asked" to remove the driver from their website. :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>since the web never forgets nor looses anything, a simple search for the original driver package "AX88772B_772A_772_WinRT_Driver_v3.16.0.1807.zip"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>turned up this result:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=36763259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=36763259</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where, in post #19 you can directly download and install the driver&nbsp;from inside the device manager using the exact same method as you would in x86 windows 8. not sure why everyone claims users cant&nbsp;install drivers, but this one definitely WORKS - as I am
 typing into this forum via CAT5 cable right now. of course, you need to be an "administrator" on your RT tablet. ;-)</p>
<p>btw, I have an unmodified (unhacked) surface RT with ALL the current updates installed via windows update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@Microsoft: everywhere I go, people comment on all the things my surface RT CAN do, and marvel at how limited their ipads and androids are... :-p (I used to be&nbsp;a fervent android power-user / hacker myself, but got fed up with it)</p>
<p>Please allow others to choose whether to&nbsp;install this unsupported driver and DO NOT REMOVE this post. :-)</p>
<p>ideally, please add official support for some "universal" devices like the AX 88x72A chipset ASAP!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't work for Microsoft, I am just a normal user - like you. trying to get the most from my RT tablet.</p>
<p>I paid 20 EUR for the trendnet USB-Ethernet adapter hardware. which - IMHO is a very modest price for something most other tablets cant do at all.</p>
<p>the driver software on xda-developers is a free download and I installed It myself in 5 minutes. (you may need to register with xda-developers, but that is free too)</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Upgrading to RT 8.1 broke this driver - windows doesn't recognize the driver signature anymore and refuses to start the device, although it is still detected and installed properly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Until a new driver turns up, or a work-around or hack has been found: don't upgrade to RT 8.1 if you need wired Ethernet!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'll post back if I find a solution.</p>

            <p>AFAIK, asix is not to blame - as they had "leaked" the windows 8 driver originally. but even back then Microsoft asked them&nbsp;to remove the drvier from their site and it hasn't returned since.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>why Microsoft refuses to allow (much less support) a generic USB-Ethernet device on windows RT is beyond me, too....</p>

<p>How quickly does it take effect on enemy players in VS?</p>

<p>I hardly see them change into zombies, like I have only had it happened roughly 2 times... so is it even worth it to use on players or should I stick to making a swarm of crimson heads?</p>



<p>I, myself have never been shot by it so I have no clue... </p>

<p>Its a nice ability. It forces players to drop what they're doing a look for health and get an anti viral. You just have to remember that when a person becomes infected they wont turn until they run out of health.</p>

    <title>windows 10 create system image problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barryward5  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 create system image problem</h2>
                    <p>Recently reinstalled windows 10 for the 3rd time and happily my system hasn't crashed for a week, unlike half a dozens times a day on previous occasions. As it seems stable I have been racking my brains trying to crate a system image onto a usb hard drive.
 On windows 8.1 I would use </p>
<p>control panel &gt; System and Security &gt; File History &gt; System Image Backup ( bottom of left pane)&nbsp;&gt; create system image ( left pane) &gt; select my&nbsp;USB Hard Drive &gt; click next &gt; select what I want to include and follow the rest of the wizard without issues. Windows
 10 presents a rather annoying problem, it has pre-selected both my C: and D: drive and I cannot deselect my D: drive as is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c404acd-5bbc-40ae-b3e2-c4e61e17e741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c404acd-5bbc-40ae-b3e2-c4e61e17e741" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to back up my D: drive it as it is simple for installing games and if it ever fails I can easily install them from disk or re-download them using Steam or GoG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to stop windows 10 preselecting D: so I can just back up C: as I have done with previous version without issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for suggestions</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will assist you with this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>From the screenshot we are able to see that D: drive contains system files in it, hence as mentioned in the screen shot the drive will be included as default.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>A system image is an exact copy of a drive. By default, a system image includes the drives required for Windows to run. It also includes Windows and your system settings, programs, and files. You can use a system image to restore the contents of your computer
 if your hard disk or computer ever stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to make the system image again and see if you are able to do so.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply but that doesn't answer my question</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to stop windows 10 preselecting D: so I can just back up C: as I have done with previous version without issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already&nbsp;suspected the&nbsp;(system) status of the D: drive was the culprit. I have no idea why it has&nbsp;SYSTEM status as it shouldn't and didn't last time I created a windows 8.1 image in November 2015 using the same process. I have tried manually removing
 SYSTEM status by</p>
<p>
</p><p>D: drive's properties &gt;&nbsp;security &gt; Edit button &gt; selecting SYSTEM &gt; Remove without any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I would love to know how and why my D: drive&nbsp;has system files on it when it should not along with how to remove them and/or the system flag. After a good nights sleep I have found my own work around.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Manager &gt; Disk Drives &gt; ST1000DM003-1ER162&nbsp;(D: drive) &gt; Driver &gt; Disable &gt; Ok &gt; Reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>D: no longer shows, Computer works without any issues as windows is solely on C: (480 GB SSD)&nbsp;allowing me to create a system image&nbsp;of C:&nbsp;to the 500GB USB drive I bought solely for this purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is clear Windows does not need my D: drive, can anyway suggest how I go about permanently removing this status? or the so called windows system files that I can not seem to find?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Barry</p>

            <p>I've got the exact same problem: The Create System Image backup program *thinks* that my 2TB storage drive is somehow a "system" drive, when it isn't. The issue is twofold:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Why does the backup program see this drive as a system drive; and</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How do I fix this bug.</p>
<p>

            <p>Rohit Chettri suggested I turn off my Antivirus to see if that was conflicting but as I had found my own workaround I never tested it so can't say if that was the problem or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Have no idea as I never figured it out</p>
<p>2) My own workaround is quite simple goto</p>

</p><p>Device Manager &gt; Disk Drives &gt; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (D: drive) &gt; Driver &gt; Disable &gt; Ok &gt; Reboot</p>

</p><p>Your D: drive won't show anymore. Create your system image then repeat process above to enable instead of disable&nbsp;drive.</p>

            Hello Skidoo1991,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that you reinstall World of Warcraft on you computer to replace the missing file.&nbsp; When it asks if you would like to install Direct X 9, please let it.&nbsp;
<br />
If you would like to try to replace just the file without having to reinstall the game, I have a link below to the direct download of Direct X 9c.<br />

    <title>Windows10 Version 1809 - Not Allowing Login After Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soaringhigh2061  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows10 Version 1809 - Not Allowing Login After Installation</h2>
                    <p>Ever since Windows 10 Version 1809 was first released I've had the same issue after it installs. I can not login to my computer whatsoever. It boots to the login screen but then when switching from the clock page to where the password box should come up
 it doesn't. It totally 100% freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has constantly occured since Windows 10 Version 1809 first came out and every time I have had to roll back to Windows 10 Version 1803. Then and only then am i able to reaccess my computer and actully login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now today is the fourth time this annoying Feature Update has appeared automatically downloads and installed. This time it was labeled as Windows 10 Version 1809 amd64 2019-03. Since it had a different name I was 100% hoping Microsoft had fixed this annoying
 problem but <strong>NO THEY DIDN'T!&nbsp;</strong>Yet again for the fourth time ever dealing with this Feature Update its the exact same problem! Yet again i cannot login to my computer at all. All I can do is forcibly restart my computer by holding the Power Button
 down and rebooting it; then from already doing that for three times now and still not being able to login to my computer I know that once again I have to revert back to Windows 10 Version 1803 for that 100% works and allows logging into my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet again Microsoft has broken Windows 10 and won't admit to it whatsoever. I've already talked to a Microsoft Technician about this the kast three times this has happened and get this: "<strong>THEY KNOW NOTHING!"&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Now as I've stated I'm forced to rollback my Computer from the 100% unworking; 100% unreliable; and thus 100% trash Operating System known as Windows 10 Version 1809 and back to the 100% working and 100% reliable Windows 10 Version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now how do I fix this other than rolling back all the time? I've tried everything posible in Safe Mode (which is the only thing able to ever be logged into) and it 100% doesn't help to loggin normally!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC that was originally using Windows 7 Home Premium before upgrading to Windows 10 when it first came out abd then I was constantly dealing with the "Start Menu and Cortana Aren't Working Error". Back when my
 HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC was still using Windows 7 Home Premium HP stopped releasing BIOS Updates for it about two years before upgrading to Windows 10. I know this because I'm always checking for updates from HP and Windows Update and my Intel Processor.
 Also given the age of the HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC, HP never tested it with Windows 10 and don't support it being upgraded to Windows 10 even though Microsoft stated it can support and run Windows 10.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">Stop your lying because I NEVER said that I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 Version 1809. I said I want it to work after and NOTHING you've said works to do that. I've already attempted installing a downloaded version from
 the Microsoft website and it still had the same exact problem. What part of that don't you get and don't comprehend? I don't want to repeat doing something that's already been attempted and 100% didn't work and resulted in the same problem.</span></p>

 is installed; either by Windows Update or manually when downloaded from the website (from the same link you provided before) it ALWAYS results in this exact same problem. Obviously you aren't comprehending this! What part of this don't you get?</div>

<p>You are mistaken or don't understand what I am saying. I am NOT HAVING A SYSTEM CRASH whatsoever. The system after installing Windows 10 Version 1809 amd64 2019-03 and the version that was originally named Windows 10 Version 1809 WITHOUT the addition of
 the text: amd64 2019-03.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Windows Update Crash at all and that shouldn't even be the Problem's title for this post at all for I never wrote that part; this system when writing my post's title put that in and honestly I never caught it. The problem should be titled: "Windows
 10 Version 1809 Not Allowing Login After Installation"; in fact that is what I originally titled it so it seems someone changed it that is monitoring these forms and their change makes my problem look different. The fact is it has nothing whatsoever to do
 with a Crash or Windows Update; it has to deal with the Feature Update:&nbsp;<span>Windows 10 Version 1809 amd64 2019-03 not allowing me to login to my computer at the Login Screen and freezes there before bringing up the Password Dialogue Box to type
 my password and then the only way to get back into my computer as in Logging In is to revert back to Windows 10 Version 1803 which 100% perfectly fine on my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC and for your information I have talked to HP and they have stated
 that my computer (Laptop) model is tested for Windows 10 and is known to work fine on Windows 10 and they just don't have Drivers for it anymore because Microsoft has stated that they are the ones now supplying Driver Updates for Windows 10 Computers via Windows
 Update. Plus HP stated they didn't make any new BIOS Update for the HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC since 2013 yet in the folder/hard drive partion for the BIOS there is a folder labeled "BIOS Update" and its last dated file is: 9/29/2017 but no part of
 Windows Update says a BIOS Update was installed; the folder that says: BIOS/Current reads: 7/3/2013.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Again; there isn't a System Crash whatsoever going on here. The computer works perfectly fine with Windows 10 Version 1803 and Version 1809 installs perfectly fine; heck its even still listed under installed updates after being removed. Version 1809 installs
 with no a single problem or a crash. The only problem is AFTER Windows 10 Version 1809 (and Windows 10 Version 1809 amd64 2019-03) will not allow me that I can't login to my User Account on my Computer after it installs. I am only able to boot into Safe Mode
 where Windows 10 Version 1809 then works fine. Since I don't constantly want to boot into Safe Mode I roll back to Windows 10 Version 1803 where I am able to Login to my User Account perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every three (3) months then ever since Windows 10 Version 1809 first was released the Feature Update reappears in the Available Updates and then it starts downloading and installing again. Then the same old problem of not being able to login to my User Account
 starts all over again. When this Feature Update&nbsp; appeared again this time with the name:&nbsp;<span>Windows 10 Version 1809 amd64 2019-03 I assumed that Microsoft/Windows fixed this problem since I reported on the Feedback App and also noticed other users
 had also reported it and then once it was fully installed and attempted to login to my computer again at the User Account Login Screen I yet again like the many other times since this first started with using Windows 10 Version 1809 still wouldn't work to
 Login.</span></p>
<p><span>As I stated, this also happens downloading and installing Windows 10 Version 1809 from the Download Link that was previously provided. Thus it 100% doesn't matter if its downloaded and installed from Windows Update or the Website Link it still
 results in not being able to login.</span></p>
<p><span>When booted into Safe Mode I have seen a possible culprit for this problem that isn't included in Windows 10 Version 1803 and I haven't seen on some computers running Windows 10 Version 1809 but is apparently included in the one that gets
 installed on my computer and its not removal. On one time being able to login and then not being able to ever again on Windows 10 Version 1809 I was able to get these screenshots of the possible offending program and it isn't part of Windows 10 Version 1803,
 the only other program at the time I wasn't using in Windows 10 Version 1809 that I wasn't using but downloaded on Version 1803 as a Test was/is: "Your Phone" so I know this isn't the culprit either. I've also did what was unrecommended and disabled my Anti-Virus
 (Norton Internet Security) and that too didn't stop the problem of not being able to login.</span></p>

<p>You aren't listening whatsoever and as such you are getting very annoying. I have ALREADY TALKED TO HP and they have tested my model of computer for Windows 10! They don't have it on the list because they aren't listing their OLDER COMPTUER MODELS to force
 Computer Purchasers to REPLACE their HP machines but when I told them I have a financial situation that prevents me from buying any NEW computer they told me the truth that the HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PCs do work with Windows 10 and have been extensively
 tested. I will take the WORD OF A SUPERVIOSR AT HP over what their website pages say and over what you want to believe on a website page that isn't 100% accurate. I am PAYING money to HP for their Extend Warranty Protection Plan and was APPROVED BY HP to Upgrade
 to Windows 10 on my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC because they did test and approve it for Windows 10; in fact HP ran remote Diagnostics on my computer (since they are the ONLY people I trust to do so since a Microsoft Technician left Spyware on my computer
 and a virus after remotely controlling it) and it is in 100% working order; and the day I took those screenshots that I posted was the day that HP did that diagnostic. That day I had prevented that screenshotted program from RUNNING at all on startup Windows
 10 in Safe Mode through setting it up in Clean Boot and then I was able to boot into my computer normally and login to it perfectly NORMAL as in that is the OFFENDING PROGRAM! Thus I don't need to Perform a Clean Boot again because I've ALREADY DONE IT AND
 KNOW THE PROBLEM AND WHAT PROGRAM IS CAUSING IT and THUS KNOW THAT IS THE PROGRAM THAT NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM WINDOWS 10. And I'm not the only Windows 10 User that has had this issue with Version 1809 (and it isn't just on HP computers).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">THUS THIS PROBLEM IS 100% ON MICROSOFT'S END AND NOT HP AND NOT LIMITED TO THE HP PAVILION G7-1310US NOTEBOOK PC!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore I HAVE ALREADY REMOVED Windows 10 Version 1809 amd64 2019-03 from my computer the day of my initial post; in fact as I was writing that post on my iPad Windows 10 Version 1809 was in the process of being REMOVED and being restored to the Far
 Superior and Working Windows 10 Version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The FACT is I know all about computers and how to fix them; I wouldn't be posting here if it wasn't for Microsoft/Windows Stupidity in keeping a program in Windows 10 that is preventing users from logging into their User Accounts and as I have stated the
 Feedback Hub (App) shows that this is happening to many people, and I also am not the only one who has posted screenshots of that program that doesn't even have a "REAL NAME" and is totally 100% un-removable by the Computer User/Owner and as a result THEY
 HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM because Microsoft is too stupid to remove it. Countless people have reported the problem and what is causing it but we've been IGNORED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Now sorry if that is rude or anything but you need to LISTEN and COMPREHEND!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have already stated this once and I will say it again: this has NOTHING to do with the Anti-Virus Software, in fact I have proof to that, I did uninstalled my Norton Internet Security when it first occurred when Windows 10 Version 1809 was first released
 and IT DIDN'T WORK. I still wasn't able to login to my Microsoft Account and then I had to waste more valuable time reinstalling my Norton Internet Security after rolling back to Windows 10 Version 1803 and re-setup its modified settings and PREVENT it from
 destroying many of my installed games for it gives false positives to their .exe files being viruses because they are games that can be modded and I am a game Modder and also use a major altered version of these games that have a special created .exe that
 uses hooks into the original .exe. Removing my Anti-Virus and then reinstalling it required restoring twenty (20) .exe files that were for different modded games and hours of fighting Norton to ignore those files and the drives those games are installed on.
<strong>I WILL NOT REMOVE MY ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAM AGAIN EVER WHEN I 100% KNOW THAT IT ISN'T THE PROBLEM.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>PLUS YOU STATE THAT YOUR DAD'S COMPUTER IS USING AVAST ANTI-VIRUS AND THAT IS ACTUALLY KNOWN TO HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH WINDOWS 10; NO MATTER WHAT VERSION. IT ISN'T REALLY TRULY COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 10. I HAVE FIXED MANY PEOPLE'S COMUTERS RUNNING WINDOWS
 10 BY REMOVING THEIR AVAST ANTI-VIRUS AND THEN INSTALLING A NORTON VIRUS PROTECTION TRIAL PROGRAM THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT TO THEIR AVAST VERSION AND ALL OF THEIR PROBLEMS STOPPED. THIS IS BECAUSE NORTON IS MORE COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 10 THAN AVAST. I HAVE
 DONE THIS ON COMPUTERS EVEN WITH THIS ISSUE AND THEY HAVE WORKED; THE CATCHER HERE IS THESE COMPUTERS DON'T HAVE THE PROGRAM I HAVE INCLUDED IN THE SCREENSHOTS; HENCE THAT IS FURTHER PROOF THAT THAT IS THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>THE PROBLEM IS 100% THE PROGRAM I HAVE SHOWN IN THE SCREENSHOTS FOR THE MOMENT THAT WAS DISABLED (AS IN PREVENTED FROM LOADING ON STARTUP) I WAS 100% ABLE TO LOGIN TO MY COMPUTER. YET AS SOON AS MICROSOFT WINDOWS UPDATE INSTALLED NEW UPDATES THAT
 SAME DAY FOR WINDOWS 10 VERSION 1809 THAT DAMN PROGRAM WAS ACTIVE AGAIN AND UP TO ITS TRICK OF PREVENTING LOGIN.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The major fact here is that not all version of Windows 10 Version 1809 have that program (with not name) on it. I have seen this first hand on a few desktop computers, Netbooks and some other laptops. It has been on other computers and those that have it
 are having this problem. Disabling it stops the login problems until Windows Update has NEW updates; after the restart process to install those updates that program is running again. To stop the hassle of constantly having to disable it in Safe Mode the best
 100% solution is to remove Windows 10 Version 1809 and to rollback to Windows 10 Version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work as a Computer Technician and have confirmed that this is 100% the problem and not any Anti-Virus Software. And as stated I have also confirmed that Avast CAN cause this but Smart Computer Users don't use Avast.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 is only booting after memory diagnostic tool. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erick ftg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 is only booting after memory diagnostic tool.</h2>
                    <p>Recently I bought a SD hard drive and installed windows 7 there. It worked great for about 7 days. Then I was playing and listening music while suddenly everything froze. I turned off my PC. After that, it would try to start, but everything would stop at
 the black screen with the windows logo saying "Starting Windows". I started in safe mode and it loaded really fast. I tried again in normal mode, but failed again.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then I decided I would reinstall windows again (I still had all the backups over my desk, so why not). But the windows 7 installed did the same that the installed OS. It would hang forever at the black Windows screen, and wouldn´t pass of it.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After that I tried the memory diagnostic tool. I had never used it before, and didn't know what for it was (now I know that it test the ram memory). I went afk because it said the test could take a while, and that it would notify me if there was any errors
 after I logged on (if it even logged on). When I came back, I was surprised and relieved to see the windows desktop. I didn't see any error message though, if there was any, I must had missed it.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Later, I notice that there were 3 new updates to install. I decide to install them, and they required a restart. I restarted my PC thinking everything would be fine now. But everything repeated. I even tried to load another windows 7 that is installed on
 a normal hard drive, but happened exact same thing: my pc would only get to the black starting windows. And while I was using the installed windows 7 in the old hard drive I had other problems, but never that one.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, I run again the memory diagnostic tool. This time I stayed to see what happened. It didn't took as long as I thought. After the test finished, I try to run windows again, and this time succeeds, and apparently there was no errors.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My PC specs:<br />
</p>
<p>MB brand: Asus<br />
</p>
<p>Ram: 8gb<br />
</p>
<p>2 disks: One SD drive of 120 gb with windows 7 installed; and a HD of 1 TB with window 7 installed too.<br />
</p>
<p>OS: windows 7 64 bit.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The PC was built by myself. I never had any problems until 6 months ago. Back then I didn't have still a SSD, and the first windows I installed started to degenerate gradually (at least that's how it looked to me). I would get the same freezing problem I
 got today. Sometimes I would have to turn it off, and other times it would recover, but then I would have to turn it off anyway because it would lag. I thought that perhaps after 3 years of use some files in windows 7 had become corrupt, and that's why it
 would freeze sometimes. However, since this happened again, and caused that issue in which windows wouldn't go past the black screen, makes me thing this is something more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be the problem?</p>

            <p>I scoured the internet looking for a solution to this issue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can only boot into windows 7 x64 Pro if:</p>
<p>1)press F8 </p>
<p>2)then repair computer </p>
<p>3)then run memory diagnostic </p>
<p>4)then exit memory diagnostics after only 1-2% complete.</p>
<p>5)windows boots successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diagnosis: Rootkit in boot record found by using hit man Pro</p>
<p>Solution: Run hitman pro and reboot using ABOVE BOOT PROCEDURE. Hit man pro cleans infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Easy fix! Just couldn't find this info anywhere.</p>

            Thank you, I know what the issue was. It was my 8GB Thumb drive that i put in and turned on ReadyBoost on all 8GB. On top of that, it was older and slower. Thank you soo much.

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Failed auto-update for graphics drivers removed drivers and getting error message &#34;No AMD graphics driver is installed, or the AMD driver is not functioning properly&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: failed auto-update for graphics drivers removed drivers and other errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, i tried with AMD support but i couldn't manage my way around so here i am. earlier today there was an Auto-update for my graphics card (AMD Radeon HD 8750M) and it was working fine up until my laptop suddenly restarted. i thought the update required
 it (since it was running in the background so i didnt know), as such i didnt think much of it. later on when i checked, turns out the update removed my drivers. Now if i try to install the correct drivers, or uninstall the corrupt ones so that i can install
 the new ones, on the AMD install manager it shows, after picking custom or express installation/uninstallation, "loading lists" and then my laptop restarts. every single time it's doing this. this is the error it shows if i try to open the catalyst centre
 from my task bar.</p>
<p>can anyone help?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to update the latest driver for display adapter in the Device Manager and check if display driver is working properly or not.<br />
