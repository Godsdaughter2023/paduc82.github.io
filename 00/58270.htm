            Hello,
<br />
<br />If you're on Microsoft account, you can try changing its password online using another device and try login using new password on original device.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Hi LauraParamo, &nbsp;
<br />
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor And I'm here to help you!!
<br />
<br />How you doing today?
<br />
<br />
<br />To start the PC in Safe Mode we will have to press any key or combination of them depending on the operating system version that we have installed on the computer. For example, to start this mode in Windows 7, Vista and XP it is necessary to successively press the F8, F5 key in some versions, while the PC starts.
<br /> 
<br />Once the system has been started in Safe Mode, you will access the Windows menu where you can see the user or regular users and a new one, Administrator, which is the one that must be selected to access the system configuration that allows recover the Windows password.
<br /> 
<br />When entering as Administrator, a user that will not require a password, the system will perform some tests in order to continue, which is called Error-proof mode and where you must select Yes to the first notification that is displayed, which will be to continue to proof of errors, then accessing a black background desktop.
<br /> 
<br />From that same desktop you should go to the Control Panel&gt; User Accounts&gt; Change Password, where you can write the new password to later restart the system in normal mode and reuse the PC as if nothing had happened.
<br /> 
<br />I hope it helps you, have a nice day!!!

            If you use a Microsoft Account:
<br />
<br />Regarding this concern, we’d like to confirm also if you’ve already tried resetting your password. If you haven’t done it yet, click this&nbsp;link&nbsp;for the steps. <a href="https://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx</a>
<br />In case that resetting of password will be unsuccessful, we suggest that you use theaccount recovery form&nbsp;as the last option to get you back and access your account. <a href="https://account.live.com/ACSR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/ACSR</a>
<br />
<br />If you are not using a Microsoft Account, you will need to reinstall Windows 10 using a custom install and recover your files from the Windows.old folder.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer.
<br />
<br />What you should do, is first download the ISO file using Media Creation Tool, then use another tool such as Rufus to make a bootable copy. Here is how you do that:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />Image
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Exception: you can double click the ISO (or right click it, choose Open with &gt; Fiel Explorer), mount it and start the upgrade in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />MAKING A BOOTABLE COPY USING RUFUS:
<br />
<br />You can download Rufus, for free.
<br /><a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading Rufus, connect your thumb drive, launch Rufus application, click in the Device list box then choose your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click in the list box then choose your partition scheme. If you select the ISO, Rufus will automatically select the appropriate options for you. Next, click in the File system list box, then choose FAT32. If your thumb drive is larger than 32 GBs, choose exFAT.
<br />
<br />Leave the default Cluster size then enter a label for your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click the choose disk image icon, browse to where the ISO file is located, select it then click Open.
<br />
<br />Click Start to copy the files to the thumb drive.
<br />
<br />If you have any files on the thumb drive, they will be deleted.
<br />
<br />Wait while the files are copied to your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Close when complete
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer, then launch setup to begin the installation. 
<br />
<br />STILL NOT ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE ISO FILE?
<br />
<br />Download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart and reboot into setup again.
<br />

<br />
<br />Windows will check if there is an active Internet connection. If it does not find one, you will be presented with the following screen.
<br />
<br />Create a Local Account and click Next
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows finalizes your settings
<br />

<h2>            Reputation Dropped From Good To Avoid Me Overnight</h2>
                    <p>Hi My gamertag is Johny B Goode. I play a lot of competative overwatch. I recently just got back from a comms ban of two weeks ending February 2, 2017 and at that point my reputation was good both on my xbox and on xbox live enforcement.com. This morning my repuation was down to avoid me. Last night I played over 50 competative matches of overwatch, never left a single one, got in each game in under a minute. This morning I cant play, at all. How did this happen? How has my reputation changed so quickly without any kind of change on enforcement.com. Even now it shows as green. Last night 0 problem, good rep, this morning able to play nothing and have a avoid me rep. I need help&nbsp;</p>

That means ive played with 500-1000 ballpark people in the last month alone. yet slightly over 50 false reports from limited sourced cause an immediate drop from green to red rep. yet you claim that kind of abuse of the system isnt possible</p>

            Hi Alan
<br />
<br />The Skype App in Windows allows you to send SMS text messages
<br />
<br />If you are in the USA, you can now also receive SMS texts with Skype, this new functionality of being able to also receive SMS will be rolled out to the rest of the World shortly . .

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I admit this is off-topic, but I have not been able to post my own questions under this account and a separate account and the submission button gets deactivated with nothing happening after, meaning it's impossible to to even get help from Microsoft on
 this very issue. If this message gets through, I would appreciate some advice, other than chatting with the virtual robot. Better still, would be being able to communicate via direct mail as it's not been possible to post anything via microsoft answers since
 2nd March, including a a post on this issue 15 minutes ago in a new post, as the submission button gets deactivated on submission and the page posts nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>This message has actually gone through, so why can't I make my own posts under 2 different accounts?????`?<br />
Moreover for one account i have used since 2012, after making a support request on 2nd March, I got 2 responses I responded to, but then all of a sudden, the thread seems to have been deleted + almost all my posts in profile, except 2 made in 2015.</p>
<p>Please if you read this, help me ... if I try to make new posts, the submission button gets deactivated making it impossible to post anything. I was surprised this functioned.<br />
I need someone I ca directly communicated with to explain the problem in detail without having to make a new post. I just want to be able to post again and access my old posts + have the submission button working and not seeming to freeze, ... happened with
 2 different accounts/PCs/networks.</p>

                    <p>Question is, why can't I get this package?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to this site:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980731/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980731/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It says the KB is for windows 7,&nbsp;2008 etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But whenever I get the email with a link, the file is ONLY for windows 6.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link I get for the file that's supposed to be for win7 x64:</p>
<p><a href="http://hotfixv4.microsoft.com/Windows%207/WindowsServer%202008%20R2/sp1/Fix313012/7600/free/410859_intl_x64_zip.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://hotfixv4.microsoft.com/Windows%207/WindowsServer%202008%20R2/sp1/Fix313012/7600/free/410859_intl_x64_zip.exe</a><br />

<h3> lespivnic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t remove  old software for an Epson R390 printer from Programs and Features</h2>
                    <p>In my "Programs &amp; Features" at Control Panel I have tried to remove old software for an Epson R390 printer that I don't have anymore.&nbsp; I get a box which asks if I want to remove the applicable software (R390 Version 6.24E) and I click YES!&nbsp; The next box
 indicates that it has been successfully removed BUT the printer software is still listed in Programs &amp; Features when I restart my PC!&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also interfering in the successful working of my Epson V700 scanner and I believe that the old R390 software is
 causing the problem.</p>
<p>How do I get the R390 software removed from the Windows 7 registry?</p>

 - and clicking on Epson Printer Software which is still listed - a box comes up which says - Please wait until the current program is finished uninstalling!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This message has now appeared for several hours!&nbsp; I don't know how long I have to wait?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>First of all, you posted your issue in the Windows XP forums and there there is no "Programs &amp; Features" in Add/Remove Programs for Windows XP but there is in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running Windows 7, you should be posting in the Windows 7 forums which are here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7?tab=Threads">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7?tab=Threads</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Second of all, editing the registry is not the way to remove programs.&nbsp; If Programs and Features (or Add/Remove Programs) does not work, you have some other problem to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third of all, since you did not get instructions or advice to backup your registry before you started messing with it, instead of things getting better, things may now be getting worse, hence your new message:&nbsp; Please wait until the current program is finished
 uninstalling (or being changed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, you can stop looking for a Registry Hive called HKEY_LOCAL_USERS for there is no such thing in Windows 7 or Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is HKEY_<strong>CURRENT</strong>_USER but editing the registry it not the way to remove programs.</p>

    <title>KB4074588 continually required reboot. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steven kiernan  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4074588 continually required reboot.</h2>
                    <p>After installing cumulative update KB4074588 and rebooting, the windows update list continued to say reboot was required. I rebooted another 2 times but despite the fact that my Toshiba laptop (Windows 10 Pro) was showing that the OS build had been updated
 to 1709.16299.248, meaning that the update had been installed, it was still showng "required reboot" in the updates list in the Windows Update setting and in the Action Centre notifications..</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event log "system" log there was no entry that showed it had been "succesfully installed" (event log id 19). But there was,an entry in event/log/setup showing that-&nbsp; "Package KB4074588 was successfully changed to the Installed state" (id number 2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually decided, after about 45 minutes, to uninstall the update again and I had some dificulty, I had to try three times. Eventually it successfully reinstalled and showed correctly in the Windows Update list after the reboot and no more "reboot required"
 message in Action Centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also almost had the same problem with my other, ASUS Laptop, (Windows 10 Home) when it rebooted after installing the update it showed awaiting reboot for a short while (on the Windows Update setting main page) but it did change and clear the message with
 a "successful" update appearing in the updates list</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions: Did I need to reinstall KB407588? If I hadn't reinstalled it would I have had problems with future cumulative updates? Would it eventually have changed to showing a successful update in the update list?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice on this as I am a bit worried about future update problems. I also think this should be made known tothe appropriate managers as I suspect I am far from the only one who has had this or other problems.&nbsp; Steven Kiernan</p>

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Updates are necessary to keep your system up-to-date and secure from any threats. However, there are inevitable issues that might occur right after installing a new update which we cannot prevent. This is why we are committed to providing excellent
 customer service and support and are always working as quickly as we can to address customer questions like what you currently have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you encounter any issues with Windows Updates or with Microsoft and its products in the future, we advise that you let us know here in the Community so that we can address them right away. For future reference, you can use this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update troubleshooter</a></strong> as an initial troubleshooting step in resolving Windows Update issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this helps. Don't hesitate to post back if you have any other questions.</p>

<p>This answer , does not answer the questions. I should perhaps have mentioned that I did use the troubleshooter and as usual after I ran it 3 times it had cured certain things but on the next run it had cured them again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem caused and is causing me some anxiety about future problems and it also cost me 3 hours to get the update uninstalled and reinstalled, eventually and thankfully, showing a successful installation. Did I really have to do that? I ask again- it
 seems that it was actually installed an probably would not prevent future&nbsp; updates, but what do I know thats why I asked.!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I intend now to post the original question on feedback so at least the engineers will know about it.</p>

Thank you, but this does not seem to be the same problem that I had. My problem was that although the installation seemed to be successful, it was not recording the fact in the Settings/ Windows Update list correctly.

            <p>Hi Astman,</p>
<p>When you say your keyboard has you locked out, can you give more details?</p>
<p>Can you not type anything at all?</p>
<p>Do you have an external keyboard that you can try to connect and test typing?</p>
<p>It's possible that your laptop has a hardware issue preventing you from typing.&nbsp; If that's the case, I would suggest going through Toshiba support as well for possible hardware diagnostics:</p>

            Hi Astmann,<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft community. As per the issue description, I understood that you have an issue with keyboard functionality after installing Windows Update. I would request you to send us more information about the issue as listed below.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. Do you face the same issue in safe mode?</div>
<div>3. Are you able&nbsp; to use Touchpad without any issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try these methods and check the issue status.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can try to perform the method 1 and method 2, if you are able to use Touchpad.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            &#34;wifi doesn&#39;t have a valid ip configuration&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to connect to the internet with my (brand new) Cyberpower PC, running Windows 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten a lot of different "reasons" from the diagnosis why I can't connect, reset the router at least three times, but this one is what's popping up now. At the MOMENT, it claims I am connected to the internet, but no pages will load, Steam won't connect,
 etcetera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mom's Mac and my iPhone are having no problems at all, so this is obviously a problem with the Microsoft based computer itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not computer savvy enough to know where to go from here. Microsoft people, please don't let me down. I've been a "PC" all my life, and I really do to want that to change. I've seen asks with similar problems, but the "solutions" always go over my head.
 I need help I'll be able to comprehend. I'm a writer and an English major, not a computer whiz.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer these questions in order to understand the issue better.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you try connecting the Computer using wired network and check if it gets connected?</span></li><li><span>Which antivirus program is installed on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry, to know that you are facing this issue. Internet connection problems are most commonly caused by disconnected cables or by corrupted network card drivers. Follow these methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps from this link:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Why can't I connect to the Internet?</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/cant-connect-to-internet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/cant-connect-to-internet</strong></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If issue persists, follow the troubleshooting steps from this link and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Wired and wireless network problems</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: </span></strong><span>Also I would suggest you to flush DNS by performing the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + X, Click on Command Prompt (Admin). </span>
</li><li><span>Type: <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> and press enter.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> command provides you with a means to flush and reset the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contents of the DNS client resolver cache. During DNS troubleshooting, if&nbsp;necessary, you can use this procedure to discard negative cache
 entries&nbsp;from the cache, as well as, any other dynamically added entries. </span>
</li><li><span>Resetting the cache does not eliminate entries that are preloaded from the local Hosts file. To eliminate those entries from the cache, remove them from this file.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</span></p>

<p>I use my computer with American English, It is what I learned since back when I was a kid.</p>
<p>I live and work in Beligum, I am not Belgium, American or a citizen of the UK.</p>
<p>My computer's country is set-up to Belgium because this is the truth.</p>
<p>My default language in "Region and Language" is English(United States)</p>

<p>The checkbox with "Recognize non-native accents for this language" is checked/marked.</p>
<p>Text to speech voice is set to "Microsoft Susan Mobile"</p>
<p>Speed progressbar is at half.</p>
<p>I did set-up the Microphone that is used from my Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000</p>
<p>"Peter prefers..." - Your microphone is now set-up - Finish</p>
<p>Afer the setup - "Ask Cortana" taskbar item disappeared and now it looks like a button with a search icon.</p>
<p>When I click it, it shows me:</p>
<p>"Welcome back! Let's pick-up where you left off."</p>
<p>What do you mean left off ? Isn't everything already set ?</p>

<h2>            Sleep mode does not disable on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title:- Sleep mode, screen "saver" and suspended mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is with the Sleep Mode in Windows 10. In the Power and Sleep option in System,&nbsp;I changed the settings for Screen and Sleep to Never. However, my PC still "goes to sleep" in a few minutes once I am not active.&nbsp;This is very inconvenient because
 sometimes I may be working on a document and take a two-minute bathroom break and I have to sign in again and re-open the web sites I was using. (I get a message that the computer was&nbsp;put in suspended mode). How can this problem be resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>My letter to Phil Spencer and microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bumbleboo  say:</h3>
<h2>            My letter to Phil Spencer and microsoft</h2>
                    
<p>IV been with Xbox since day 1 had Xbox live since the beginning over 2 accounts. I jumped on Xbox when it came out because it brought a lot to the table. Better graphics. Great games, hard drives etc.&nbsp; I bought the 360 day one and went though 2 red rings.
 360 is still one of my most favorite consoles in history. The way&nbsp; the user interface worked and the great games. You can tell Microsoft cared about the project. I bought an Xbox one with Kinect day 1. I like that you fixed the hardware issues 360 had. System
 is quiet and I like the bigness of it. I like the fact that this new generation of systems&nbsp; is all about multi tasking and doing more. You guys expanded so many things and have added cool features. I love that. My problem Microsoft is that I have owned every
 console since Atari and have never had to do a hard reset on my console as much as on Xbox one. Sometimes the system will just sit on the log in screen. Sometimes apps freeze the system. God forbids I go in and out of apps to fast as the system will freeze
 up.i thought the new experience would fix this and it has fixed some. I shouldn't have to turn on my system and wonder if it will just freeze for no reason, will the controllers connect?, or just wonder if it will come on at all. I know this isn't the fault
 of Phil Spencer. Im sure if he was in charge from the start we wouldn't have any of these problems and the one would be the better console. Aa much as I like my one I have to say&nbsp; this is Microsoft's worst console and I am very disappointed&nbsp; in you guys.if
 I didn't have such a big library Of games I'd jump ship. Please do better next time. We gamers just want a powerful console that runs smoothly. Keep that in mind for Xbox 2. Good luck Phil Spencer. This is just a letter from an upset Xbox fan. I hope</p>

<p>I have not had any of those issues. &nbsp;I can go from app to app and game to game without any freezes or crashes. &nbsp;In fact, I haven't had to do the hard reset in 3 months.<br />
<br />
One of the major factors that causes system instability isn't related to the console itself, it is how users have hooked up their console to the power. &nbsp;Many users (Americans especially) insist on hooking their console to the power via a surge protector. &nbsp;Problem
 is, the Xbox One already has a surge protector built in to the power supply brick. &nbsp;Any further surge protection causes power issues. &nbsp;These can manifest in several ways, but many are just like the ones you describe.</p>

<p>I have not had a lot of problems with my Xbox One. There has been times where YouTube would freeze up and I wouldn't be able to re-load it. But otherwise it's been a smooth process.

<p>If your Xbox One is constantly freezing up, it may be a hardware issue. </p>

<p>In certain circles the X1 has come to be refered to as. ¨The Hard Reset Needed One.¨ Why?</p>
<p>With each software update things change to one extent or the other and efused pathways within the hardware is effected. Sometimes even in adverse ways which WILL cause problems such as you discribe. No, surge protectors has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>All they are is a fusable connection that IF your in home electric service experences a surge in power (Ex: Struck by lightening) that fuse in the surge protector will blow before the excess power even reaches your electronic devices. Or if a powerlines
 negative connection drops.. Which in the US happens a lot more than you think because power companies use that line as an ancher. To see that for yourself, just walk outside and visually follow the 3 lines (Two black, and one uncoated and follow the uncoated
 line to the power co pole. It will be tied to the pole and if it were to break and leave the others unharmed. Say goodbye to everything electronic in your home, including your freg as they will get fried.)</p>
<p>CEO's get paid a lot of money mainly because they take the hit if anything, as was the case after X1's launch, from reflecting back on the company, products, or services. And a new face (CEO etc) then enters the picture and with a few policy changes and/or
 well thought out speaches. ¨we listened to our customers.¨ helps to further redirect attention away from corporate. When in reality all they really listened to is corporates bottom line.</p>

<p>Why not jump ship? I know people that had large libraries of V.H.S. tapes that replaced them with D.V.D.s. Personally replacing my D.V.D.s with Blu-ray. Gave a bunch of D.V.D.s to my friends and donated the rest to Goodwill. Disposable income keeps the economy

<p>i only have to reset my X1 about once a month, but i seem to recall having to reset older game consoles (like NES, SNES and TurboGraphx-16) several times to get games to work.</p>
<p>as for the next Xbox, i wouldn't hold my breath unless MS decides that Xbox is just doing much stuff and removes all the bells and whistles.</p>

<p>Obsessive Power is correct, MS state on this site somewhere that the One should not be used with another surge protector for the very reasons stated.</p>

<p>Your Xbox One power supply is equipped with internal surge protection. Plug the power supply directly into a wall outlet. Some surge protectors can cause the power supply to not work as designed. This can affect performance.

The quick check for administrative privilege is to right-click on "Start".&nbsp; If "Open All Users" is one of the options that pops up in the window, then you do have administrative privilege.<br />

<p>froze again this morning a few times and i had to manually turn in off via holding the power button off for a few seconds.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it also froze a few times and&nbsp; then stopped freezing with a message on the taskbar that "AMD display driver has stopped responding and has recovered"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what should i do next please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p><span>Update the drivers.&nbsp; Do not depend on Microsoft for ANY of your non-Microsoft hardware.</span></p>
<p><span>[<em>Some further explanation of what I mean.</em>]</span></p>
<p><span>I realize before that you stated, "has all the latest drivers and windows 7 professional updates" - but to different people that means different things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people&nbsp;are&nbsp;satisfied&nbsp;that Windows has checked for updates, found some updates including hardware
 drivers, and&nbsp;they have installed those and it has found no more - done.&nbsp; Others people are&nbsp;satisfied when&nbsp;they&nbsp;visit the manufacturer's web site for the system (in your case HP) and&nbsp;utilized the support page for the model of their system (you'd need to be
 more specific than "Pavilion DV7" with the model) to download the hardware device drivers and install them from there.&nbsp; Other people (category I fall in) want the latest/greatest from the actual hardware manufacturers whenever possible: motherboard chipset,
 video, network and audio chipset drivers are those that are usually more easily obtained this way - which are the heart and soul of your computer in many ways.&nbsp; These people seek out the actual manufacturer drivers for each individual component.&nbsp; This is what
 I am about to suggest:</span></p>
<p><span>Visit ATI (AMD's) web page and download/install this driver &amp; software:<br />
<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonmob_win7-64.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonmob_win7-64.aspx</a><br />
(11.7 released on 7/27/2011.)</span></p>
<p><span>Visit the Intel web page and use their driver scanner utility to scan for/locate and download (then you install) the latest drivers for your chipset, built-in video and etc.:<br />
<a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect</a><br />
(Check your system for the latest updates, install the "Husdawg, LLC" stuff, etc., expand the lists, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span>Being a laptop - and specifically one that *will* run hot - make sure you do
<strong><u>not</u></strong> set it on pillows/soft tops and keep it on a flat/hard surface during use.&nbsp; You may even need/want to purchase some sort of laptop cooler base for it to sit on when you want to utilize it in more 'relaxing' spots.</span></p>
<p><span>What you are doing is eliminating the software issues and the obvious hardware possibility; if the drivers and the heat dissipation doesn't help - the symptoms point to existing&nbsp;hardware issues, not software ones.&nbsp; Defective (probably from heat damage)
 video display device is the most likely suspect.&nbsp; That will lead you to here: <a href="http://www8.hp.com/nz/en/support-drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www8.hp.com/nz/en/support-drivers.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>Hope that helps, somewhat!</span></p>

            Sounds like there may be a common issue with the video chipset chosen for the line?&nbsp; Dell had that one time and they replaced the motherboard/video chipset of anyone who called in.

</p>
<p>thanks for that.</p>
<p>I have already updated all drivers from the manufacturers website eg intel, amd etc had no effect.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>btw will restoring to defaults like you told me to do remove the latest drivers i installed? (should do right?)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ever since i got the laptop i place high on steps when im using it so that there is sufficient airflow and never use it in hot areas etc (because i had similar problems with one of my old satellite Toshiba laptop that used to overheat)</p>

            <p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>just been doing some research about pavilion laptops and there are a countless amount of people with exactly the same problem on the hp support forums that relate to dv6, dv7, dv9 etc and some of the problems even go way back to 2007. why has HP not come
 up with a solution?</p>
<p>http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Lockups-Freezes-Hangs/bd-p/Laptop-Freeze</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>also have a watch of this video</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhTIVtUTD4A</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>do you guys think that i would be able to register my laptop online with hp US since it has warranty and then send it into HP NZ for repairs?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p><br />

            <p>I have exact the same ''freezing screen'' probs with my laptop pavillion (beats audio) from hp that i brought new, for a half year ago. And i really tried everything to fix the freezing screen, without success. I think i take that pice of **** back to the
 store and ask for my money or a new one, that maybe is even more worse than my actuall laptop from HP. I think Hp just produces cheep low quality notebooks, but i don't know, maybe windows 8 is too a pice of ****. I never buy again a HP notebook or HP desktop-PC
 in my life. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my bad english, im from switzerland, i hope you can understand the most of this ;-)</p>

<h2>            windows 10 has been downloading for 5 hours</h2>
                    received a notification and began downloading windows 10 to my windows 8.1 over 5 hours ago. It keeps saying it is downloading. Is there another step for me to do? It should be done downloading by now.

            went to microsoft support and requested that they call me call me, which they did later that day, maybe 2 or three hours later. Support took over the operation and download was complete that night. The next step is the computer is "checking for downloads".
 After about an hour it is at 15%.

<p>Finally after 21hours and 10minutes. My windows 10 has downloaded,I suggest people not to worry if it takes longer as I have a friend and it took 28 hours. I am only a novice with computers so I was a bit worried about how long it was taking,I've just had
 a quick browse and it seems a little better. Whew!!</p>

            Glad to hear you got&nbsp;your update&nbsp;installed. Apparently, Microsoft has been overwhelmed with problem installs. Unfortunately, today is my 5th day. After contacting Tech support yesterday AM, I finally received a call back very late last night (almost quieting
 time) I was told I was missing some window 8 updates, my printer was interfering as well as my anti virus software. So on day 5 I still don't have windows 10 - no printer &amp; no&nbsp;anti virus software, at this point I give up! I'll be happy with Windows 8.

            Thanks okennyMitchell I was under the impression that all connected devices have to be disconnected and you have to be updated to the latest 8.1. This is what I did anyway,I hope this can help someone else. Having browsed windows 10 I don't think it's
 all that. I have a Acer laptop by the way. Let's hope they get the bugs out.

    <title>How to change toast notifications position&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change toast notifications position&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For some reason after the last Windows update the toast notification is popping up right in the middle of my screen as I am working. I didn't mind it popping up on the bottom right and disappearing but now for some reason it is popping up dead center of
 my screen. I have to stop working each time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to find how to change the location of the toast notification with no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this issue and if so do you know how to change the location back to the bottom right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I have had to disable notification so that I can work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bug that Windows needs to fix.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Brandon,
<br />
<br />You can disable the Windows 10 notifications and change to the old balloon messages, it requires a registry fix
<br />
<br />Click this link for a step-by step on how to do that:

<p>Hi Dave,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to disable it as you mentioned in the initial message. My question is can you move the toast notification from the middle of the screen to the bottom right of the screen.&nbsp;</p>

                    Hello community.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have my Surface RT in Norway and original language was Norwegian.</div>
<div>I've downloaded English (US) language pack and successfully applied it.</div>
<div>Now English is my main language in the system and all the UI is in English except for log in screen.</div>
<div>Log in screen where I pick a user to log in is still in Norwegian.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know how to enable English for log in screen?&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thank you in advance.</div>

            Hi Iuri,<br />
<div><br />
This issue might occur if welcome screen language settings are change.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to check the welcome screen user language settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
a. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search. (If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.)<br />
b. Type Control Panel in the search box.<br />
c. Select the option language and click on Advance settings.<br />
d. Check the Apply language settings of Login screen.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information is helpful.<br />

<p>Btw people keep saying you need to download the bing bar but so far that isn't true for me. I just type Bing into Google(lol I know) and then sign in with Windowsliveid. It tallies my points and seem to be working fine but I haven't tried to redeem any points
 yet.</p>

<p>i just started casually this week, so i haven't been able to redeem any bing points for msp yet. i'm at 346 credits as of today so i'm getting there but it's slow since you can only get 12 points a day guaranteed. at least i know i'm getting 200 msp for
 having signed up.</p>

<div><span>d. Click Repair your computer.</span></div>
<div><span>e. Click the Windows 7 installation that you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></div>

Welcome to Microsoft Answers CommunityForum!<br />
</span><span><br />
Since the device is not working in the secondary slot, check in device manager if you would see any yellow exclamation mark or question mark against display adapters. Incase if nothing is highlighted, I would suggest you to first create system restore point
 and try to uninstall and reinstall graphic adapter from the device manager and check if it works.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<br />
</span></span><span><br />
Also, I would suggest you to check if your graphic card is compatible with Windows 7. Alternately, you may visit the manufacturers website and try to download the latest driver which is compatible with Windows 7 and verify if it is working fine.&nbsp;<br />
</span><span><br />
Hope this helps resolve your issue!<br />
