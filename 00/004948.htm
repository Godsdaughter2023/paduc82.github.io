<h2>            What is updated_at field in Yammer group export</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am new to the Yammer admin management and I need some help on the the updated_at field in Yammer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we do an Export data, we will get a Groups.csv file. In that file there is a field by name "updated_at".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had queries whether that field is referring to the last updated date of group settings or is it referring to last conversation in the group? Basically I would like to get the clarity on the last activity date of the Yammer group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me if anyone has any idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>SB.</p>

            <p>Hello SB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Updated_at"&nbsp;column in the group.csv file from the yammer export data, refers to any changes made to the group.</p>
<p>For example: if you change the group name this field gets updated.</p>

    <title>Heart Rate Question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cesantos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Heart Rate Question</h2>
                    <p>I'm interested in getting a Band to track my Heart Rate not necessarily while exercising or sleeping but&nbsp;throughout the day no matter what I'm doing.</p>
<p>From what I read, I assume the band will give me the current HR and the Health App will give me the rate over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What period of time is displayed? Is that selectable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How often is a sample taken and uploaded to the App to be displayed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help with this,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Charlie, </p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us on the community forum. </p>
<p>When engaged in exercise modes (runs and workouts), the Microsoft Band samples your heart rate every second.&nbsp; When sleep tracking is engaged, the Microsoft band samples your heart rate for two minutes, rests for 8 minutes, and repeats the cycle.&nbsp; At all
 other times, the Microsoft Band optimizes battery life by sampling your heart rate for one minute, resting for nine minutes, and repeating the cycle.&nbsp; Users can manually check their heart rate at any time by clicking on the me tile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Clare</p>

<p>You don't have much time...I guess you should download the ISO I posted and get on with it before your system is locked out.</p>
<p>You did not ask but here was my Registry for 14905 to compare:</p>
<p>All numbers { } must be the same:</p>

<h2>            WP7 Update&#58; Zune Software Error 8000FFFF.</h2>
                    Until today, whenever I connected my phone to my computer, and run the 'update' from the phone settings menu in the Zune software, I would get a message that basically said there are no updates available. Right now, I am greeted by an old friend from the
 Vista days: Error 8000FFFF. Why is this happening?<br />

<h2>            Outlook is not showing message correctly, looks like encrypted messages</h2>
                    <p>As you can see in the images, email headers are not showing in the emails list pane. also the Reading pane is showing the raw email content, headers and encrypted message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>other email clients are showing the same email correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -uninstall/re-install of Office 2010, 2013, 2016 none has worked, all of them show the same problem. even cleaned Registry after the uninstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -repair pst, create a new pst file, all have the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -disabled McAfee , removed McAfee, installed AVG nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>none of the above worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the conclusion I came to is, there might be a setting somewhere that is telling outlook not to parse the email, and only to view a raw message .. but I searched many forums for a solution with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the office is installed on windows 10.<br />

<p>Hi Karen,<br />
<br />
The error that you are getting is usually caused by a corrupted .exe file that is attributed to Outlook desktop applications and not the online version (Outlook.com).<br />
<br />
Can you confirm if you are using an Outlook desktop application? If yes, which version are you using (Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2016)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the desktop version of Outlook (Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2016), you can refer to this
 your Office application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to response.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Youtube , video not available</h2>
                    <p>Me being a complete 'Dummy' , on computers , I have restarted my Acer Aspire e15 , since installing windows 10 , but this has not helped the problem of being able to watch the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb
 &nbsp;Also&nbsp;as people are stating , you need to plug in headphones .</p>
<p>My question is ; why does windows assume everyone wants to listen through headphones and why did they do this ?</p>
<p>My favourite videos are not playing (unavailable at the moment ) , and when /if they are viewable , they are not playing , keep 'freezing'.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were ok on Windows 8.1 and are STILL ok when viewed via my Samsung S3 .</p>
<p>I , do live in the country side , but have never really had a problem !&nbsp;&nbsp; It is frustrating and if I can not rectify this , I am considering going back to 8.1 , as youtube IS very important to me .&nbsp; Although , this its self will be a major task for me .
 LOL.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that I do not understand any technical wording,&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank you for your help .
</p>
<p>Sorry , but I don't even understand the questions below , ie. Category , internet Explorer Version and windows version !</p>
<p>It was windows 8'1 but now running on W 10 , if that makes sense !</p>

<h3> benjamin prieto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t renew office 365 home premium subscription as trial has ended</h2>
                    <p>Got a Surface Pro, with the trial of office 365. When the trial was over I tried to subscribe,&nbsp;but I'm now in a ridiculus neverending loop that will not allow me to renew the subscription</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start at:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/pc/buy-microsoft-office-and-microsoft-office-365-FX102907679.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/pc/buy-microsoft-office-and-microsoft-office-365-FX102907679.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When selecting the anual subscription I'm taken to an error page saying:</p>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You already have a subscription.</div>
</div>
<div>We’ll take you to your account page where you can install Office or manage your subscription. All you need to do is click Continue.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then press the continue button and it takes me to my office account page. A big error is displayed on top:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This subscription has expired.Renew now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selecting Renew now will just take me to the start....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curious thing, the account page shows also:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install Information</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>

<div>
<div>You haven’t used any installs.</div>

            After a long chat with a live representative, I may have found a solution (kind of). I am an American living in Taiwan. My US bank card is assigned to a Taiwanese address, so I couldn't order through the US page, as its country is locked to USA for ordering.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I tried to order through the Taiwan page, which is how I got stuck in that loop of three pages. Apparently I got stuck because I wasn't ordering through the USA page, and each Microsoft account is locked to its country of origin. So in order to buy Office
 I have to actually apply for a new account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know if it helps you guys, but it worked for me and Microsoft hasn't done anything in the last week to help.&nbsp;</div>

            Having the same problem. Tells me my trial period is ending but can't renew as it says that I already have a subscription and keep looping back. Can't find anything on their support page that deals with this issue and to be frank their help pages of FAQ
 is terrible. I guess I just won't bother renewing. If their support is this bad then I am glad I did not buy their product. Classic FAIL Microsoft.

http://commerce.microsoft.com</a> .</p>
<p>You need to make sure all Personal and Business Accounts on that page have the profile filled out 1st.</p>
<p>To change it you need to select the Personal Account or Business Account on the top right.</p>
<p>Once that's done you should be able to click on the 'Set up an auto-renew subscription' link on
<a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.com/myaccount</a> to purchase a yearly or monthly subscription.(the month is in fine print under the yearly)</p>

            <p>No No No...Microsoft are back in the Stone Age on this one as far as I can see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I am having is that I had signed up&nbsp;with the Trial in Ireland on a newly purchased Laptop due to my original Laptop crashing. My&nbsp;Visa Card is from Australia, when I try and purchase the Subscription I keep getting "SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG, CANNOT
 PROCEED WITH PURCHASE" (or something to that effect)&nbsp;with no further explanation to what has gone wrong by the way (useless if you ask me).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as far as I can see, my account is locked in Ireland. When I try and change it to Australia and make the purchase, it comes up that NO NO NO I am locked to Ireland. I am due back in Oz in 2 months, so, I cannot get Office 13 until I am there, on a new
 account. Or I can apply for a new Visa Card in Ireland with a new bank inc fees,&nbsp;transfer fees etc... FAIL!!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Syncing ringtones to Windows 8 phone with Salling MediaSync on Mac&#63; &#40;&#34;Windows Phone&#34; app does not work&#41;</h2>
                    I just got a new Lumia and I'm having trouble syncing my ringtones with Salling Media Sync.They're under 30 seconds, in .mp3 format and the genre is "ringtone." I have Salling because I used to use it to sync my android phone, and it automatically synced
 up my music and photos with no problem when I connected the windows phone. When I downloaded Windows Phone from the app store it opened up ok but won't recognize my device at all (even though Salling recognizes it just fine). Can i sync ringtones with Salling,
 or do I need to use Windows Phone? And if I do, how do I get the darn app to recognize my phone?

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>I changed my settings on my hotmail account because I was receiving a lot of junk mail etc I changed the settings so that I would only receive mail from people that I know. I now want to change the settings to allow anyone to email me without it
 going directly to junk. Can anyone help or give me some advice on how to change the settings so that I receive all mails that are sent to me?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>The system changed to outlook just after I made the changes under the hotmail system. Now I can't seem to change it back.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have looked in the settings section of the new outlook but I can't seem to be able tho change the settings so that I receive mail from anybody. I hadn't made any setting changes pr this last change so basically I just want to revert back to the normal
 system. I just happened that fte changing the settings as hotmail the outlook system took over.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hello SeanCollicott,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community. I'd be happy to assist you with your concern on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I understand you would like to change your account's filter settings to receive emails from anybody but you are unable to do so after your account was upgraded to Outlook.com. If so, what you can do to solve this issue is change your junk filter
 settings level from <strong>Exclusive</strong>&nbsp;to <strong>Standard</strong>. Here are the steps on how to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>From your <strong>Inbox</strong>, click the <strong>gear icon</strong> on the upper right corner of the page beside your name.
</li><li>Go to <strong>More mail settings</strong>. </li><li>Under <strong>Preventing junk email</strong>, click <strong>Filters and reporting</strong>.
</li><li>Choose <strong>Standard</strong> where most junk email is sent to the junk email folder.
</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hello. Have you tried clicking the .exe when navigating to them via file explorer? Maybe a bad shortcut? What device and carrier do you have? Do you have the option to return the device?<br />
<br />
You can reflash the ROM (Windows Mobile operating system) but you would have to get either the original or upgrade ROM available from the phone manufacturer or wireless carrier. I'd just return it 'cuz it shouldn'r do after 3-4 days. A hard reset should have
 cleared it up. Also, unless the program shows up in the add/remove area, you can't reinstall it without reflashing the ROM.

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed updates.</p>
<p>As you can receive emails in OWA normally and it works fine on another computer that works, they indicate that our Office 365 server side is working fine and this should be a specific Outlook client issue. In this case, we recommend you try the following
 steps and check if they help fix the issue:<br />
1. Firstly, you can refer to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>&nbsp;to run <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>.<br />
2. Please try to uninstall the Outlook client and re-install it, check if it works then.<br />
3. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d?CorrelationId=c78af9b8-22ac-45a4-ae9c-7c3fe4c857a5&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a new profile</a>&nbsp;and set up your Office 365 account in the new profile.<br />
4. I notice your Outlook client is not latest up to date, please update your Outlook client to the latest version. To update the Outlook client:<br />
a. Click <strong>File</strong>&gt; <strong>Office Account</strong>.<br />
b. Click <strong>Update Options</strong> in the right panel and then click <strong>
Update Now</strong>.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after all these, we would suggest you also log the problem in our dedicated
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook client support forum</a>&nbsp;for further troubleshooting steps. Thanks for your understanding. Experts there would like to hear from you.</p>
<p>Your time and efforts will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Sam</p>

            That's DRM at its finest for you. It stands for "Digital Rights Management" but I prefer to call it "Digital Restrictions Management".<br />
<br />
When you download programmes via the iPlayer you receive a licence to view those programmes
<u>on your phone</u>. You cannot connect your phone to a TV set and view them there.

            i bet there's more compresion used on the mobile iplayer than the standard player, so the quality of the playback from the phone onto the telly might of looked a bit on the rough side anyway?

It even looks pretty rough on the phone's screen... At roughly 200 kbit/s total bitrate you can't expect miracles :(

<p>Sorry, but this was not the question. I know, that I can leave a group like&nbsp;you described&nbsp;if I´m already&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the group. But the question was: how can I delete a pending&nbsp;group request. If the owner of the group doesn´t answer, the request stays, and
 the group I´m not part of, appears in the grouplist. It is not possible to delete a pending group request?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for additional help.</p>

<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
A quick question before proceeding: <br />
<br />
Do you have multiple instance of Excel files open?<br />
<br />
If the above is true, this is an expected behavior as Excel will only show the <strong>
<span>Average</span></strong>/ <strong>

As you're changing focus of the mouse by going to the workbook in second monitor, the result of the first monitor changes as it goes in active. There is no option to change this behavior.<br />

            Our office just switched to 2013, and this among a few other reasons is why I absolutely HATE MS Office 2013. I work with money all day and this feature in 2010 was extremely useful for me, the fact that it was removed is just stupid.

<h2>            Command line prompts to print a mail merge document</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have some documents which are set up to print automatically for the business each day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the current text I have in a .bat file</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE" "C:\Access\Birthday_Letter.docx" /mFilePrintDefault /mfileexit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this prints the letter I want out, however what I want it to print the mail merge document automatically not just the first person of the merge. I would also like to print it to a different printer instead of the Default one out there. Can any guru's
 change the code to work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can do this inside the file but the idea of this is to come in and just have it done on the printer and ready to go.</p>

<p>I have seen several people write in with a similar problem, but I haven't seen any responses back that solve the problem. My issue is this:</p>
<p>I installed and used Office 2010 Beta version and all of the applications worked fine I then purchased and installed the released version of Office 2010 Professional MS Word no longer is able to open except in safe mode.&nbsp; I was using&nbsp;Windows XP.&nbsp; I read
 somewhere that Office 2010 did not support XP so I updated my operating system to Vista Ultimate.&nbsp; No help.&nbsp; Here is the message that I receive when I try&nbsp;to start Word:</p>

<p>I found the problem..</p>
<p>I'm not saying&nbsp;that everyone had the same problem as me.</p>
<p>My issue was that everytime i openned MS Word 2010 &gt; I started typing &gt; made an attempt to "SAVE" &gt; it crashed.</p>
<p>Have bought recomended software/spyware to clean computer and still had that problem.&nbsp; Aftre browsing non stop the net, all posts states " there are numerous problem that may cause the crash" and one of the problem on the list (especially me and MS Word
 2010) was to uninstall ENDNOTE (its an add-in to Word2010), somehow ( i dont know how) it crashes.</p>
<p>Have uninstalled ENDNOTE and it was a sucess. Word 2010 works fine now.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

                    I am on Build 10130 and have four updates that require a restart to finish installing, but no amount of restarting fixes the problem. They are referred to with following KB numbers: KB3069069, KB3070641, KB3070675 and KB3070677. Any answers as to what

            <p>They are installed, but a bug causes the message that they aren't. If you go into "view update history", and click the "uninstall updates" at the top of the panel, it opens the panel in the control panel in which you can select one and uninstall it. If the
 one you uninstall is one that required a restart of the computer, it will, again, require a restart to complete the uninstall. Following the reboot, if you check for updates, it will find the one you uninstalled, and install it, requiring a restart, with the
 same bug mistakenly indicating that it didn't finish installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A good clue that an update did, in fact, install, is that it is no longer offered up in the check for updates as being available.</p>

<h2>            Mailboxes disappearing from Outlook Folder Pane</h2>
                    <p>So I had a user report to me that the Mailboxes that she had been given access to thru the exchange keep disappearing from her Outlook 2016. This behavior started yesterday.&nbsp; When she fully closes Outlook and restarts it all the Mailboxes that had been auto-mapped
 to her appear. But than after a few seconds several of them just vanish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked to make sure she still had the proper permissions in exchange and nothing has changed there. I'm at a loss as to why this is happening and could use some help on figuring this one out.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 defender</h2>
                    I am on a laptop running windows 10 and have been for some time. I use only Defender in the hope that it is as good as AVG etc. I have twice experienced corruption that Defender did not picked up automatically. I went into the defender screen and forced
 a full scan at which time it has found a gremlin on each occasion. The most recent one it found a Trojan:Win32/skelyah.Airfn. It was then able to&nbsp;removed this. This seems to have solved another problem that was luring in my machine telling me that the bootmanager
 was missing. But, why did defender not pick it up automatically? When I checked, the defender files were already current and up to date. Has anyone else experienced these problems with Defender?&nbsp; I have been told by other users that defender is not as good
 as AVG etc. Is this true?

            I do not deliberately go to sites that may produce Malware. Anyway, I think this is a virus rather than Malware. I still do not see why Defender could find it on a full scan and&nbsp;did not on its normal daily/live&nbsp;scan scan??!!

            OK so a Virus is Malware... what ever you say. It does not answer my question. Why did Defender NOT pick up the Virus/Malware in its automatic scan, but did when I did a FULL scan??? If&nbsp;I activates any other anti-virus software, Defender goes to sleep.
 Is that the only solution?

            <p>Could you please provide the complete path to the object that Defender identified with this detection?&nbsp; This would be found at the bottom of the log entry for the item in the Defender History tab within the All detected items log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My generic answer to this would be that the item detected was created in a place that Defender's&nbsp;Real-time protection&nbsp;doesn't normally monitor, since there are many unsuccessful attacks that occur which are blocked by&nbsp;the operating system itself, which since
 they never reach a location of true risk will never be detected via Real-time protection.&nbsp; If Defender detected and alerted to these unsuccessful attack attempts you'd be receiving additional notifications for which there is no real concern, simply adding
 to the noise and aggravation without providing any true increase in protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference with a Full scan is that it scans all files found on the machine, regardless of context or location.&nbsp; What this means, for example, is that an item which was delivered via an infected web page might be successfully placed in the Temporary
 Internet Files folder, but then the exploit(s) it contains are blocked by the security within&nbsp;Internet Explorer or another browser itself.&nbsp; However, the temporary file left behind, if not automatically deleted by the browser could still be detected during
 a later Full scan, since this doesn't differentiate between an infection truly installed and operating as a quick scan does, or one that is currently performing an initial attack using either&nbsp;exploits or a file dropped into a more critical download folder
 such as Downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the confusion that often results from using a Full scan and why Microsoft only recommends using this once an infection is already suspected, since in that case it is best to try and determine whether any other undetected malware might also be present
 on a system.&nbsp; Using the Full scan&nbsp;outside this situation or without&nbsp;understanding the ramifications mentioned above typically only creates confusion for those unskilled in the knowledge of how security applications actually work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can understand some of your explanation, but would ask why Defender does not do a full scan automatically perhaps once in a certain period, say once a week, and if such a serious detection is made, alert the user accordingly?</p>

            <p>Unfortunately you've still only provided what we already knew, though you got the spelling of the detection correct this time, but&nbsp;I'd figured out the misspellings on my own.&nbsp; The Microsoft Encyclopedia entry for this detection provides little real information,
 even within the Technical Information tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Trojan%3aWin32%2fSkeeyah.A%21rfn&amp;wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Trojan%3aWin32%2fSkeeyah.A%21rfn&amp;wa=wsignin1.0</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the following excerpt does indicate that the detection was automatically analyzed, meaning the detection wasn't signature based but rather performed via behavioral analysis and/or emulation.&nbsp; Though these detections are generally accurate, they
 are potentially less certain than those based on well known&nbsp;signatures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We've&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;analyzed&nbsp;this threat, determined that it's a Trojan&nbsp;because of&nbsp;what it does when it gets on a PC, and blocked and removed it from your PC."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we actually need from you is the final line(s) from the detection providing both the path and file name if any of the actual item detected.&nbsp; In some cases this is slightly off the bottom of the log screen, so you'd need to use the scroll bar on the
 right to make it visible on screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Defender does normally perform a Quick scan via system maintenance occasionally, though&nbsp;this wouldn't have found this item if it weren't located in an area that is known to contain active malware.&nbsp; As I already mentioned, Microsoft doesn't recommend
 using the Full scan on a regular basis, since it simply tends to confuse and scare non-technical PC owners who have no point of reference as to what is truly dangerous and what's just sitting in various temporary file locations left over from a past failed
 attempt to attack a system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until we see what exact file and path were involved in the detection you received, we can't tell you whether it's truly important or just one of these leftover temporary files of no true concern.</p>

            <p>Yes, that's quite clearly indicating that the file was located in your G: drive file history, so possibly a file you'd already deleted from its original location on the C: system drive sometime in the past.&nbsp; If not, then the issue is due to the fact that
 the file was found out of context by the behavioral detection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual file appears to be something called Windows Security Manager, apparently&nbsp;created by Microsoft back in 2012, though I've personally never heard of this application myself.&nbsp; If it's truly the same file that others have detected with&nbsp;various security
 programs&nbsp;and submitted to VirusTotal in the past, this is a portion of the file's properties and a link to one example of a&nbsp;complete submission report.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note that since any of this&nbsp;FileVersionInfo properties&nbsp;information could be faked, it's possible this might really be malware, though it could just as easily be a false positive detection of an actual old Microsoft file as well.&nbsp; At the time of the above
 report on May 19, 2016 only 13 of 57&nbsp;antivirus applications detected it as typically some form of Trojan, with Microsoft itself not yet among them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the file is outdated and unless you are certain of its purpose and origin, I'd simply forget about it and let it automatically delete from the Defender logs.&nbsp; Since you haven't recently had this detected in your personal folder on C: drive, it's either
 already gone from there or not considered a threat.&nbsp; In either case I'd probably delete it if you aren't certain what it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Defender won't scan folders in your file history drive using a Quick scan, since you don't run applications from there, so that's why it was only found with a Full scan.&nbsp; If you'd recovered these files or folders to your C: drive, then Real-time protection
 would have detected it if it's truly considered malware.</p>

            <p>My understanding from HERE's announcement was that the HERE apps would disappear from the store on 29th March for W10M users only, and they would still be available for WP8.1 users until June.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked using my WP8.1 phone and they still appear to be in the store now.

            <p>Sorry, yes, you're right garym123, I misremembered:&nbsp; June is when HERE apps should stop working on W10M devices, but continue to work on WP8.1 devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OP, I don't understand why you say <em>"What remains is store is NOT "HERE" &nbsp;but like so many look alike, Here is GONE"
</em></p>
<p>The HERE Maps and HERE Drive+ apps which I can see right now in the WP8.1 store are published by HERE Apps LLC and my phone identifies them as the apps which are currently installed on my phone.&nbsp; What makes you imagine they are not?</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 programs Not Responding - Build 14383</h2>
                    Is anyone else having this issue. After a little while of use each of the MS Office 2010 programs: OneNote, Excel, Access have frozen&nbsp; with "Not Responding" (haven't yet tried Word). This has happened each time I've used a program and after reboots as
 well. This has not happened with any previous Insider builds and they all always worked okay on my main Windows 10 system. This is very worrying so near to release. I have reported this in a number of Feedbacks.

Can you post a link to your Feedback as I can't find anything with build 14383 so that I can upvote.

            <p>Obviously I can't comment on your computer Colin, but I am using Microsoft Office 2010 on my tower pc with Insider&nbsp;build 14383 both 64 bit &amp; 32 bit and with Windows 10 RTM 64 bit &amp; 32 bit with no problems.</p>
<p>So could it be your installation? Either the program or Windows that is the problem?</p>
<p>Just asking...</p>

            I haven't used Office 2010 for awhile. However I believe this is an option under programs and features that allows you to repair Office 2010. See if that works.

            Thanks for the reply. Yes it could well be this particular installation. As I said, Office 2010 works perfectly on my v1511 Build 10586.420 and up to now Office 2010 has always worked perfectly with all the previous Insider builds. The installation seemed
 to go ok -&nbsp;it&nbsp;took about the usual 40 minutes, as have the last few builds. All other programs seem to work ok in this build. I'll probably wait for the next build rather than reinstall.

            <p>Well that's interesting. I can see my last two Feedbacks regarding Mail and my older ones regarding earlier builds but not the ones regarding this current issue (curious!). I certainly submitted them and I was advise that they were submitted. I'll re-submit
 later when I have time.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I'm running Office 2007 without problems.&nbsp; I'd uninstall/reinstall Office or maybe do a clean install of 10 in a new partition.&nbsp; But are you aware of the new Office Online extension in Edge?&nbsp; It's user interface is a little quirky, but it works as well
 as the purchased versions for me.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>I, too, am running Office 2007, but I am keeping Build 10586, instead of upgrading to the New Build on my computer, because it has an Acer AL1912 Square Monitor and with the new Build starting with Build 14328, the columns are wider for Excel and you lose
 Columns from View. And when you have existing Spreadsheets, it is a big idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft made a change affecting Excel in Build 14328 and they haven't fixed it.</p>

            Interestingly, I logged in today and still had these issues, including Word. I closed down and used my main Windows 10 for some work and then rebooted into Windows 10 Insider (dual boot) to see if I could get build&nbsp;14385 but noticed an Office 2010 update
 flash by. On investigation I saw that on the 10 July, which is when I updated to build 14383, I had numerous failed Office 2010 updates (in total 30 with retries). Today I had 47 Office 2010 updates (including SP2 ??, which I had previously on 12 April 2016),
 none of which were duplicated (anyway not that I could see) and&nbsp;low and behold my Office 2010 seems to be working correctly - I say seems because I don't want to tempt fate too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've done a few&nbsp;Excel and Word file updates and all worked correctly with
 no "Not Responding" messages and freezing. I don't know how any corruption occurred but obviously during the Build 14383 update - but fingers crossed all is well. Thanks to those who responded to my original que
