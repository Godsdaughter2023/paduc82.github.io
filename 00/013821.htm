<p>Hi, our Office365 admin is no longer with the company. &nbsp;We tried resetting the account but could only get past the office phone number verification step since the email and other number belong to the admin. &nbsp;How can we get in?</p>

<p>Hi Olga,<br />
<br />
If there is another Global admin in your organization, please ask him to reset the password.<br />
<br />
If not, for further investigation, I’d like to collect your tenant account via private message. You can access it via the link below:<br />

<p>Hi Olga,</p>
<p>When you get past this my advice is to always have a global admin account that your admin team has that isn't associated to a user, and one or two associated to the user. Then use the customized admin accounts for all of your other administrators using the
 theory of least priviledge.</p>

            <p>I tend to believe Bob Jones at the end of this thread provided a correct answer - but that answer involved me downloading a binary file that I was not sure to be either secure (i.e. not a nasty file) or applicable - the file was for a beta product - might
 work on final release.&nbsp; Might not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to go to locate a local Office 2016 user and copy the AutoUpdate.app file from that PC to my wife's.&nbsp; It might work.&nbsp; It might not.&nbsp; If it did not work, I was just going to un-install Office 2016 and re-install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it turned out, the file I got from another Mac installation solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did mark Bob's comment as Helpful, but cause it was.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I am concerned my problem is now resolved and this thread can be closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all who read it and especially those who contributed.</p>

    <title>MSN Live&#33; on WM6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt n_  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSN Live&#33; on WM6</h2>
                    
<p>Just updated my HTC P4000 (TITA100) to Windows Mobile 6, so far I love it, more stable, and seems to run quite a bit faster than the WM5.&nbsp; One small hiccup however, is MSN, which the first time I log in,
 will open MSN, and show my online MSN Contacts, once I sign out, if I try to sign back in, it shows ALL contacts as offline.&nbsp; On my&nbsp;friends MSN, it shows me as online, and they can message me, and once they message me, I can chat, but everyone shows as offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can go into the options, and "Sign is as..." and reset it again, but the whole importing of the message list, and contacts makes this a lengthy, and painful process.&nbsp; Any idea how to get MSN to properly update
 the Online/Offline list?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, every time I sign in to MSN, even if I have my WiFi turned on, it trys to connect using my Cellular Data line, rather than the WiFi connection.</p>

<p>I just replied to a similar issue and the issue was resolved. Open windows Live and click Menu - Account options. Click Switch Account and follow on-screens instructions. If that what you are doing when you say that
 you "Sign in as...?"</p>

<p>Regarding the wifi issue, I don't know why it's doing this but I usually switch off GPRS when using wifi.</p>

<p>I cannot simply "turn off" my data connection, without shutting off the cellular antenna completely, no phone, no data ;-)</p>
<p>I shut down my data connection, but MSN tries to reactivate it to gain network access, regardless of my WiFi being active at the time, I can cancel the "dialing" to the cellular data line, and MSN will THEN use my WiFi, it's just bothersome
 is all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks as though a great deal of people are having the same problem with the contacts not showing up, I'll have to be patient I suppose.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">The answer provided by you is to go to "History Settings" and choose from forever, 3 months, 1 month, 2 weeks or no history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">But, I cannot find such settings in the new Skype version.</span></p>
<p>I have exported the chat history on 8 Jan 2018 and all of them are saved in local disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOWEVER, most of my chat records AFTER 8 Jan are missing now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to export again but cannot find chat records in the same folder of local disk.</p>

    <title>Powerpoint 2010 extremely unstable when using math equations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pverswyvelen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint 2010 extremely unstable when using math equations</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to use PowerPoint 2010 for making my 2D vector math slides for my lectures at school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although regarding features PP2010 is really great, it is giving me the worst experience I had from any Microsoft product regarding stability, it is almost driving me insane. To be honest, I switched from Word2010 to PP2010 because a 10 page document in
 Word became impossibly slow to edit on my new quad 3GHz Xeon machine, so Word didn't work that well either.</p>
<p>Furthermore most of the bugs and crashes I encounter are easily&nbsp;reproducible.</p>
<p>Almost all the bugs are related to the mathematical equation editor (being a math teacher, I have those a lot)</p>
<p>For example, often when pasting part of one math equ into another target equation, the fonts of the latter become a lot larger. Hitting undo cause the complete slide to become corrupt. After that redo is not available anymore... I lost hours of work because
 of this bug... Sometimes I can't even save the document, I got &nbsp;an error "unable to save since your document is corrupt" or something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a software developer myself, I have no idea how this software got through QA...</p>
<p>However, I tried a couple of alternatives, and PP2010 is still the best software I could find for my job (which includes a lot of animations)</p>
<p>I can't seem to find hotfixes related to math equ in PP2010 (and Word2010). Are any available?</p>
<p>Anyway else having these experiences with math equations? I'm having these problems on many different PCs, so it's not an installation issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Peter&nbsp;</p>

I've been using PowerPoint 2007 - 2013 and one really massive problem kept bugging me and other colleagues in my office from time to time:<br />
<br />
When inserting long equations into a powerpoint slide, at some point the slide suddenly starts reacting extremely slowly and eventually there is a time delay of 5 - 10 seconds between me pressing a key and the letter appearing on the screen.<br />
<br />
This is extremely annoying and at some point makes it really impossible to add more characters to the slide, as the formula basically "blocked" the slide and rendered it useless.<br />
<br />
I have seen this problem in many different configurations, so it is not a one-off, and the same formula, when created in Word 2013 works just fine.
<br />
<br />
My computer is definitely fast enough for Powerpoint 2013 - see my configuration here:<br />
<br />
PowerPoint 2013 (15.0.4454.1002) 64-bit<br />
Windows 7 Ultimate x64<br />
<br />
Machine (just to show that this is fast enough):<br />
Intel i7 3610QM <br />
8GB Ram<br />
256GB SSD<br />
<br />
<br />
I uploaded an example file to demonstrate the problem here: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1449329/example_slow_powerpoint_equation_slides.pptx<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Please find a solution to this insane bug quickly, as it is driving me nuts. I am the last one in my office who still stays loyal to office, while more and more colleagues go back to LaTeX.
<br />
<br />
Please help me - I don't really want to retreat back to Latex, but at the moment there is no other way (e.g. for the slides that I'll have to present tomorrow).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            Thanks for providing a downloadable example. &nbsp;I tried editing the equations in PPT 2010/32-bit under Windows 4/64-bit. &nbsp;It's noticeably slower than editing plain text, but I'm getting nothing like the kind of delays you're having.
<div><br />
<div>I also tried editing your file in PPT 2013/64-bit and again, experienced some delay when entering characters but nothing as disruptively slow as what you're seeing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>There are various problems and incompatibilities between PPT 64-bit and some functions; do you have access to a 32-bit version of PowerPoint? &nbsp;Try editing the file in that to see if there's an improvement.</div>

            Just to back up Steve's post. I can also edit at a useable (only slightly slower than text edits) speed and this is on an old slowish laptop with 32 bit 2010. Seems fine on 2013 too.<br />

            Other people make fun of my caution, but side-by-side installs is something I only do under duress and cover of night. &nbsp;And the end-user license agreement for 2013 is a LOT more limiting than previous versions. &nbsp;You get one install and one only; no second

            Thanks for your replies.
<div><br />
<div>I have been looking around work at various different computers of colleagues of mine. As you said the issue is behaving weirdly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some computers with really fancy new hardware like mine display these problems rather strongly (a colleague of mine had an about 30 second delay between typing "\alpha" and the characters appearing on the screen and it got even worse when deleting this
 again).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Other crappy old core 2 duo systems run "ok-ish", i.e. still rather slow and not really pleasant and I still wouldn't consider it a "working solution" but at least you can edit the equation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway this must be a coding problem. I found it on both 32bit and 64bit systems/installations of office, so this definitely is a nuisance and not a one-off error of a combination of factors on my machine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thus I'd ask the programmers to have a closer look and speed this up. Eventually your goal will have to be to provide a real alternative to Latex, which should give real new customers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers,</div>

            I've been having the same problem on an Asus UX31. I used to have this problem with MS Word and equations too but that's gotten much better (not totally fixed, but better). I don't know when they'll figure out what the issue is in powerpoint and optimize
 better.

            Hey Darin_939,<br />
<br />
thanks for yours comment!<br />
<br />
I can't really "measure" whether the problem has gotten better, but I keep doing formulas from time to time in Powerpoint and e.g. yesterday I again had huge trouble with it.<br />
<br />
The equations look fine and the editor has large capabilities nowadays, but it simply keeps getting slower as formulas get longer until at some point it is not really usable any more.<br />
<br />
Please help us, Microsoft team!<br />
<br />
Michael<br />

 it works fine, but when I use COUNTIF(<i>definedname,3</i>), it returns a #VALUE!.&nbsp; Can a defined name range be utilized in this manor?<br />

<h2>            Adding Merge Data to Word Fillable Forms Breaks Form</h2>
                    My employer has Word fillable forms (also available in&nbsp;PDF format) and I am researching how to auto-fill portions of the forms from Excel or Access. I am able to add the merge fields, etc, to bring the data over from Excel, but I cannot&nbsp;then restore the
 Word form to a fillable format for the remaining fields.&nbsp; Basically, the mailing information and a few other key pieces of information are available in a spreadsheet, and the rest are not and must be added manually. My employer is adamant that the non-form
 fields be locked so that key wording cannot be changed. Is this possible in Word or PDF with Excel or Access? Thank you.

            <p>My MergeTools Add-in contains utilities that allow the use of Mail Merge with a Mail Merge main document that contains either Content Controls or Legacy Formfields.&nbsp; In the case of the latter, you must use the Protect Legacy FormFields utility in the Add-in
 to apply the necessary protection to the document as it is not possible to otherwise apply the protection to a mail merge main document.</p>

In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box of "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />

In Windows 8 and 8.1, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box of

<h2>            Fonts Not Included in Office</h2>
                    <p>I am using a PC with the latest version of Windows 10 and Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having problems with one style for one font in particular. &nbsp;It is Aleo Light. &nbsp;I have installed a lot of fonts on my PC, and they work correctly. &nbsp;I've installed multiple versions of fonts in the same family (e.g. Lato Light, Lato Heavy, etc) for other
 font families with no issues. But Aleo Light will not work. &nbsp;I've downloaded it from different font providers, I've removed and replaced it, rebooted, made sure again that all of my Microsoft software is up to date. &nbsp;I have this problem on two different machines,
 both are fully up to date (and neither machine has any other font problems). &nbsp;But Aleo Light will not show up in any of my MS Office packages (it does show u in C:\Windows\Fonts grouped in the same way other font families appear).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see a lot of comments for Mac about clearing font cache, but don't think they apply to PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions of other things I can try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>A version or three back, Office stopped supporting Type1/PostScript fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Aleo family are OTF (OpenType Format) fonts.&nbsp; OTF fonts can contain either TrueType font data or PostScript font data ... Aleo contains PostScript font data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that the "no go" applies to PostScript in OTF as well as regular PostScript fonts. Unfortunately, I haven't found anything specific one way or the other about this from MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, you might want to find a replacement font that's either TrueType or OpenType containing TrueType data.</p>

<h2>            Possible Problem for US N95 User Upgrading to Firmware 12.0.013</h2>
                    On July 19, 2007 the new firmware version 12.0.013 for Nokia N95 became available through Nokia Software Updater for US product coded N95s. I installed it and only within 1-2 hours my phone messed up. It is now almost unusable. I am trying to figure out
 whether this problem stems from the new firmware or from another source that occurred by chance immediately after the installation of the firmware. I posted 2 videos on youtube showing the issues.<br />

I would like to hear what you think, especially whether you have ever seen or heard the same problem in any firmware version.<br />

I do not recall seeing a reinstall option with the NSU on version 12 but you might just want to try that or else it's the Nokia Service Center for you.

            The idiot customer service representative of Nokiausa asked me whether I had issues before the firmware update. I replied him no. Then he said me I shouldn't have upgraded to the new firmware, because new firmwares are for the users who already have some
 issues with their devices. I told him that firmwares not only fix bugs, but also brings some improvements, and in order to benefit from these improvements one should upgrade it. I gave A-GPS vs. GPS as an example and told him that A-GPS is offered with the
 new firmware update. He insisted on saying the same thing, although neither the Nokia Software Updater nor any Nokia website warns you not to install a new firmware if you are happy with your current one.<br />
<br />
I accept the fact that even new firmwares may bring bugs. I consider this natural. And we upgrade by assuming such risk. This is how better firmwares are developed. However my situation cannot be acceptable. My phone is messed up!<br />
<br />
Unless I see otherwise on a official Nokia website, I cannot accept the claim that I shouldn't have installed the new firmware if I didn't have any issues with my previous one.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately mobile telephony is still in its childhood or adolescence in the U.S. (not primitive), and Nokia is fairly new to this market. May be it is very normal that they have so idiot customer service representatives.

            No. As I have indicated, I reinstalled the new firmware several times. It doesn't matter whether you install something or not. In fact it is not easy to install an application. I installed an application which shows free RAM etc to see whether this problem
 eats up from the memory, and believe me, it was very hard to install with that screen. Anyway, it doesn't effect the RAM.

            As you can see from the title of this topic, this may be related exclusively for the U.S. N95s with v12 firmware. I am aware that Europeans don't have this problem, as I am reading your remarks as to pros and cons of the new firmware, and a problem similar
 to mine is not mentioned by anyone.<br />
<br />
I don't know whether there are other US N95 users who already updated to the new firmware, but if there is, their comments would be more appreciated.

            Hi Please read this link as I had exactly the same problem and this is the way i went about solving it. The phone became totally useless and i even got an error code when starting it up. This does work. Tried to link but couldn't get it to work.<br />
<br />
Hi All.<br />
<br />
On two different N95 when i upgraded the phones these are the problems i experienced and how i solved it. Just to inform you the two phone were set up totally different with totally different software on it but both were upgraded from v10<br />
<br />
First of all i made backups onto the memory cards as suggested by Nokia. Don't do this!!!! backup to PC and restore from there.<br />
<br />
I then ran the update with no Problems and restored from the memory card. Big problems started. First of all the main screen lost all it's functions and there where no standby shortcuts on the phones. I could get into the menus by pressing the menu keys but
 even trying to setup the phone from here gave me no results. The standby shortcuts could not be restored at all and i think the problem has to do with the Active standby apps. or Standby mode. Even the two shortcut keys at the bottom of the phone were gone.
 After which i rebooted the phone. Even worse things happened then the phone then said "Failed to load or Phone load failure. Contact your Phone Retailer"<br />
<br />
The way to fix this is to press and hold the ( 3 * and the green answer key ) and then switch the phone on hold these three key until it asks for the country you live in. This formats the phone. Enter all the data asked for that is country, time and date.<br />
<br />
Then restore from your memory card and straight away go into your phone settings using the menu key. Go to General setting and load the Factory Settings. After this re-customize your phone and everything works like a charm.<br />
<br />
I have had no more problems from then on. Oh and the phone is a lot quicker.<br />
<br />
The only problem i've had with the phone from v10 and still in v12 is that i can't choose a ring tone from the memory card. The card holds about 900 songs (2 gig card). The only choice i have is to select no ring tone or to download on. The way i get to choose
 my ring tone is to copy the song or ring tone to the phones memory remove the mem card select the tune from the phone once i've done this i re insert the mem card and carry on from there.<br />
<br />
Hope this is helpful.<br />
<br />
Best to you all.<br />
The N95 is a great phone though.

            Could you please explain how can I and how should I press the 3 * and green button? Should I press them in an order respectively or at the same time? I tried either way but they didn't work. In fact only thing that happaned was, naturally, the phone started
 to dial 3* or *3.

<h2>            Office plugins - no reaction when clicking save as -&#62; browse, unable to save</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently working on an assignment which I am writing in Word, and to which I would like to add references using Endnote 9X. However, whenever the Endnote Word Plugin in activated, I am unable to save my document. That is, when I go to save as and click
 browse, nothing happens, the button is simply highlighted. If I click 'X' to close Word and get the dialog option to save unsaved changes, nothing happens when I click save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I deactivate the Endnote plugin and restart Word the problem goes away. It comes back immediately if I activate the plugin again. If I uninstall Endnote, the problem also goes away. I should note that the exact same problem occurs with the Foxit PDF Reader
 Word Plugin, so it is not specific to Endnote 9X and seems to be a general problem with Word handling plugins. However, I have done most of my testing with Endnote as I need it to finish this assignment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The setups I have tested are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Education (fully updated)<br />
Office 365 (fully updated)</p>
<p>Endnote 9X (I also tested this setup using Endnote 8X)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Window 10 Home (fully updated)</p>
<p>Office 365 (fully updated)</p>
<p>Endnote 9X and Endnote 8X</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home (fully updated)</p>
<p>Office 2016 (not updated, and also tested after updating)</p>
<p>Endnote 9X and Endnote 8X</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home (fully updated, but fresh install with no settings changed whatsoever)</p>
<p>Office 365 (fully updated)</p>
<p>Endnote 9X and Endnote 8X</p>
<p>
</p><p>On all of these systems the problem persists. As Microsoft will not allow creation of Media Installation Tool without all Windows updates I cannot test whether it is a Windows Update that causes it.</p>
<p>The testing has also been done on both completely fresh and older installations of Office</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I also just now tested 32-bit versions of Office and the problem is not related to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Dennis</p>
<p />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to fix the issue with a few hints from the Endnote technical support team (though I still had to do a lot of troubleshooting to get there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out the fix was changing my keyboard language. Previously the language was set to English (Denmark) as I am using a Danish keyboard, but my system language is English (United States). This must have been causing issues for Word, as changing the keyboard
 language to either English (United States) or Danish solved all problems. I guess it has something to do with using the mixed settings for keyboard language. Thank you for your support, and I hope you are able to implement a fix for this issue in the coming
 Windows Updates!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Dennis</p>

<h2>            NOKIA 5800 Xpress Music - How to remove SMS in sim Memory</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was saving SMS in memory CARD and its full so by default the sms memory option got changed to Phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, When I try to change the option to &nbsp;memory card to store SMS, it says UNABLE to SAVE MEESAGES in memory card and coming back to main screen. Please help me how to avoid this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Else tell me how I can clear the SMS in Memory card so that I can again start using the SMS in memory card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Hari</p>

            the easisst way would be to delete all your sms all together.<br />
<br />
<br />
i will have to waiit until this after noot to get ahold of my 5800 to see if there is a menu option for deleting all inforamtion on the sim.<br />
<br />
you wont hurt anything just searching all your menu options to find it.<br />

    <title>Online clip art displays blank boxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> love2create  say:</h3>
<h2>            Online clip art displays blank boxes</h2>
                    Because Windows XP is no longer supported, we just got a new computer with Windows 7 and Office 2013.&nbsp; When I search for clip art&nbsp;Insert Online Pictures in Word 2013, all I get is a box with blank boxes inside (i.e.,&nbsp;I searched for "onion" and the result
 was a box that told me 25 results for onion were found but all 25 boxes and the word "insert"&nbsp;at the bottom of the box were grayed out.&nbsp; The only thing I could do was click cancel.&nbsp; I have tried the fixes listed in some of the Q&amp;As on the "support.microsoft.com"
 website, but note of them worked for my situation.&nbsp; Can you tell me how to fix this problem?

            <p>There have been numerous complaints here, off and on, about the Office.com clip art site either being unreachable or having many fewer items than in the past, but I haven't seen anything like what you describe. I just now tried your search, and it succeeded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43559379-67a6-46b5-8861-e70295836944" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>That suggests either that you connected to a server that has a problem, or that something may be wrong at your end of the connection. Try the search again after rebooting your PC, and see whether it goes better.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists, go to the Programs &amp; Features page in the Windows Control Panel and run a Repair of Office 2013. Then try the search again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another alternative is to use the Bing search in the same dialog.</p>

            <p>As Jay pointed out, many other people have had issues with clip art.&nbsp; MS has "improved" the site and getting access to it is spotty.&nbsp; Many people can no longer directly access it from within Word.&nbsp; But, if you copy one of the links to the clipart site from
 the following articles and paste it into your browser, you can change the search term and then copy the clipart from your browser and paste it into your document.</p>

            I just had this exact problem and found it was my internet filtering service, opendns.&nbsp; Apparently the site it was trying to get the images from (bing.net) was in a blacklisted category I had set up called "video search engines".&nbsp; I added bing.net to my
 general white list and it works fine.

            <p>I'm sorry, but there is no longer any other choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any definite information about why this change was made, but I suspect that Microsoft doesn't want to continue to spend money to license and maintain a clip art collection separate from what's on the Internet. From a financial point of view,
 it doesn't make sense to keep the clip art as it was, especially when many (most?) users were searching the Internet for art anyway.</p>

                    <p>Note: I posted this yesterday in the wrong category so I am reposting it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed SquadWatch on my Microsoft Lumia 640 windows phone 8.1. I have been unable to complete the set up process and use the app as I keep getting this message:..."We could not verify the phone number you provided. Please come back later."...whenever
 I enter my number, as required, as press the "continue" arrow. I have unistalled and reinstalled the app. I have tried while in several different locations (work, home, outside, inside). I have tried with wifi, with no wifi but LTE or 4G, and I have tried
 with "Internet Sharing" on and off as well. Nothing seems to work. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know what to do? Or is there another way I can verify my number? </p>
<p>

<p>Is this perhaps a Paypal issue?</p>

            In my Windows 8 system it is also greyed out and it is set to "Automatic (Trigger start)". However I think something like Antivirus should not delay start.<br />
<br />
Experimented and found a resolution, guess it will work:<br />
<br />
<b><i>You must disconnect internet before proceeding further, if required take a printout of instructions or open this page in another device but not connect your PC to internet.</i></b><u><b><br />
</b></u><br />
<b>1. Turn off Windows Defender.</b><br />
Open <b>MSE</b> --&gt; <b>Settings</b> tab --&gt; <b>Administrator</b> --&gt; Uncheck "<b>Turn on Windows Defender</b>" --&gt; Click on "<b>Save Changes</b>".<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fb4pksw.dm1.livefilestore.com%2fy2pLsaIIb6WuUz8V6MgJJCak97qozaXJN7rposloCJpSc5ech0V1v5r1JiRWNoW_uEobc8U-gE7HaI5Yiazprf87gOxFwB0o6UCKtrENYGMlkY%2fdgh.png%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
2. Press <b>Win key + R</b>. This will open <b>Run</b> dialog. Type "<b>services.msc</b>" and hit
<b>enter</b>.<br />
In the bottom of list of services you will find "<b>Windows Defender Service</b>" with
<b>Startup Type</b> "<b>Manual (Delayed Start)</b>" or something like that. Minimize this windows.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fb4nj1w.dm1.livefilestore.com%2fy2pNbjGNYcA_llfa5XJQva1T4RlWUX43X6VfSc9_jMwkdAyHxhBgVIq9DJ5MPfpxmWPbWSbqKNh2qdicTGn5rDqWRVYY8nISW6Hr5gg3Z5OciM%2fehth.png%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
3. Press <b>Win key + R</b>. Type "<b>regedit</b>" and hit <b>enter</b>. This will open
<b>Registry Editor</b>. Navigate to <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinDefend</b>. First right click on it and select
<b>Export</b>. Select desired name and place and save it [It is a backup of that registry key, if something
<i>bad</i> happens then you can use this key to revert back]. Now change "<b>DelayedAutoStart</b>" value to "<b>0</b>"
<i>OR</i> <b>delete</b> that key.<br />

4. Maximize <b>services.msc</b>, <b>right click</b> on "<b>Windows Defender Service</b>" and click on

<br />
<b>5. Turn Windows Defender back on.</b><br />
In taskbar you will see Action Center messages. Just click on "<b>Turn on Virus Protection</b>" to get Windows Defender working.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Note:</b> I have tried this method many times with many services and in many computers, first time I have done it with Windows Defender in Windows 8. I tested this in my PC and it is working but I can't say anything about yours! [I think it will work,
 its just a daunting method of removing "Delayed Start" settings.]</i><br />

    <title>Syncing from Windows Vista to Windows Mobile Phone to WindowsXP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daffygirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing from Windows Vista to Windows Mobile Phone to WindowsXP</h2>
                    
<p>There have been answers in this forum for this problem, but they are from mid-2009, I am hopeful that since then Windows or a developer has a better answer that I found there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done everything I know to get my Windows Mobile Phone to sync between my home Vista pc and my work XP pc (without using Exchange Server).&nbsp; No matter what I do, I have to waste an incredible amount of time deleting active sync on my device, or deleting
 Windows Mobile from my Vista pc.&nbsp; Also, many times when I sync, old items (tasks especially) return that are from 2 years ago and have been deleted many, many times.&nbsp; My contacts and sometimes my calendar items duplicate, and sometimes appointments/contacts/tasks
 are removed randomly, and then I have to deal with removing the extraneous info - another time waster - even when I use software for doing so.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have missed appointments and deadlines because of this, and these issues have been both an embarrassment
 and a serious work issue.&nbsp; I have searched for software other than Windows Mobile that will assist me to sync without problems (I used Key Suite to sync when I had a Palm, and it managed these problems flawlessly).&nbsp; Is there something out there that I can
 use?&nbsp; Why doesn't Windows program Windows Mobile to work with both operating systems, as other cell phone OSes do, or are they working on it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really need a simple resolution to this problem, and what I have been doing is not simple at all.</p>

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Uninstall IE 8 <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Reinstall SP3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Reinstall IE 8 and test it<br />

<p>I have the same problem. Approx. a month ago it occurred. Suddenly it worked again, but now it's back. I was working in ms-access in the web app and - when I saved something - it suddenly refused. After I closed Access, I get the message when I try to open
 ms-access with the app. I have full admin rights on the sitecollection. Two of the admins don't work, a third one still does (sp1_farm and spadmin2013 don't and sp_admin still does). The log gives some rights errors on SP Foundation, nothing on access services.</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>

</p>
<p>Have you done anything before the error comes back? </p>
<p>What if you create another Access app under a different site where you have “full control” permissions to? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope to see more details from you, and then we can move on based on that.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>April</p>
