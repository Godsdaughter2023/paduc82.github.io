I was having the same problem and had tried the same troubleshooting as the original poster.&nbsp; The InPrivate window as suggested above worked for me.&nbsp; Thank you for the suggestion. &nbsp;

<h2>            Lumia 640XL battery issues</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my lumia 640XL to windows 10 and facing very serious battery issue. Even after 3- 4 hrs of charging, it charged only to 50% and the full charge is lasting only to 3 hrs though am not using phone. Also within 5 mins of usage, phone becomes
 too hot.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">On what was an excellent phone with windows 8.1 it has now turned into an unusable phone. &nbsp;I would like to use my phone again as before without reverting it back to 8.1. Microsoft any idea or suggestion
 for this?</span></p>

<h2>            &#40;Array&#63;&#41; Formula to get values in one list not in another</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a master list of Products (say, <strong>ProductsMaster</strong>), and a subset of that list (say,
<strong>ProductsCust</strong>) that a Customer purchases regularly. </p>
<p>I would like to create a list of Products the Customer <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
doesn't</span> purchase, so that if they wish to start purchasing them, I can select that product from a list of Products available but not currently sold (say,
<strong>ProductsAvailable</strong>).</p>
<p>I'm thinking it will probably need an array formula, and I need to populate a worksheet dropdown (Forms 2.0 control) with the list.
</p>
<p>Any suggestions are appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Paul</p>

<p>Currently I'm working from different locations on one document:</p>
<p>

<p>I use a <strong>public PC</strong> and I am able to logon with my university account after which I switch to my private Microsoft office account to access the document on OneDrive. After logging off the computer starts up as a fresh copy of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">On the way: (Windows 10 with Office 2016 (365))</p>
<p>I use my <strong>laptop</strong> to review my document and make minor changes.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I have added a new source in the Source Manager I need to use it when I'm working on it at my university. If I haven't used the source in my document yet. I'm not able to add this reference. I need to either search for the source again or

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I didn't notice that someone had replied to my post. That is why I haven't replied until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use my own computer or laptop I use OneDrive in explorer or choose the document from the recent list in Microsoft Word (File &gt; Open &gt; Recent Documents). When I want to use my document on a public computer at the university I first start up Microsoft
 Word and switch accounts with the login option at the top right. I then use the file tab to access my recent documents (File &gt; Open &gt; Recent Documents).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the source manager I can see the "<em>master list" </em>and the "<em>current list</em>". But the master list is different at my university then at home. So what I'm trying to say is that sometimes I am missing a source in the current list of
 the document but I know I have it in my masters list at home.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I need to either search for the source again or wait until I'm home to add it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I only use the source manager with Microsoft Word 2013/2016. The content of the document syncs properly unless I left the document open at home without saving it (but that is not the issue here).</p>

<h2>            Excel VBA code to create a new worksheet and copy a table to it</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm writing code to create a new sheet, copy an existing table named All Data to the newly created sheet, and rename the copied table. Here's the code I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub CopySheets()<br />
<br />
Worksheets.Add(After:=Worksheets(2)).Name = "NewSheet"<br />
Range("AllData[#All]").Copy Destination:=Worksheets("NewSheet").Range("A1")<br />
</p>
<p>Rename the table?</p>
<p>
</p><p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first line to create the table works fine but the second line errors out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also trying to figure out the syntax to rename the copy of the table: can I do it in the Copy statement or do I have to use Rename after the copy operation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, a general question--I'm not finding much info on the web about handling Excel tables in VBA, does anyone know of a good source?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>

            <p>I actually prefer the following code where the source worksheet is referenced by name and assigned to a variable rather than rely on it being the ActiveSheet. The following code can be run when any sheet in the workbook is the ActiveSheet and it still references
 the correct worksheet as the source&nbsp;containing the original table to be copied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By assigning the new sheet to a worksheet variable, it can then be given a new name. AFAIK it is not possible to assign the new worksheet to a variable and name it in the one line. These 2 commands must be separated.</p>

            <p>The reason that the Copy and Paste does not work is because when a new worksheet is added then the new worksheet becomes the ActiveSheet and the "Range("AllData[#All]").Copy "&nbsp; code is referencing the ActiveSheet (which is "NewSheet" and of course&nbsp;AllData
 is not on that sheet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by assigning the ActiveSheet to a worksheet variable and then use the worksheet variable to reference the original ActiveSheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To rename the table then&nbsp;reference the table from any cell which is known to be within the table. Cell A1 is&nbsp;the best choice because that is where you are pasting the table so it must be part of the new table. The new sheet can now be referenced as the ActiveSheet
 or see my alternative commented out code by referencing it by its name.</p>

                    <p>Ok,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have seen how ctrl-f9 lets you add INCLUDEPICTURE, and that we add the folder or the column to that for a mail merge. I can get the first image to populate but when in the document that merges all information&nbsp;before printing, I have had zero luck with
 ctrl-a&nbsp;then f9 to update all the fields and get nothing.&nbsp; All my images are on a web server that would be too much to download and have locally.&nbsp; Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response when I try this I just get a fail altogether.&nbsp; Word does not like the IF statement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using KuTools I had had success but If I change the place holder picture(size and position only), then they don't&nbsp;update in the merge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>KuTools does use the IF TRUE code, but once I have the placeholder picture any changes to it make&nbsp;it so in the merged document all the pictures are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only wanting to wash the image out and place behind the text.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>IE takes A MINUTE to load &#40;any&#33;&#41; pages after it starts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m&#246;rre noseshine  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE takes A MINUTE to load &#40;any&#33;&#41; pages after it starts</h2>
                    <p>IE Edge, Windows 10, standard setup, default firewall settings, default Defender as antivirus, direct Internet connection and both Firefox as well as (my standard browser) Chrome load all pages
<em>Immediately</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally I start IE because on some sites I have a second login and I use IE if I want that second login. Each time I start IE I have the same problem:
<strong>For a minute or more after I start IE Edge ALL pages, to any website at all, take don't load anything at all!</strong> After over a minute they all load (all open tabs, my setting is to keep the tabs from last time and open them again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, but I guess that's just normal IE - it is <strong>FAR</strong> slower, very
<strong>sluggish</strong>, for major websites such as Youtube compared to both Firefox and Chrome (adblocker "uBlock Origin" is active so pages are not further slowed down by any ads). Why does Microsoft not give up and throw away its garbage browser? As a
 programmer I understand that the developers have done some amazing jobs on many fronts like the JS runtime, but none of that matters when the overall product experience is SOOOOOOO much worse than any of the (free) competitors.<br />
<br />
I have only one extension: uBlock Origin (which if anything speeds things up by removing all those crazy ads)</p>

<p>The reply shows that you did not even READ my post. I mention my setup in the first sentence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your first question is not applicable - it has ALWAYS been that way. Guess why people (and me too) use other browsers as defaults rather than IE - here's one reason. The whole thing is slooooowwwwww as hell even after that initial wait is over. It takes
 several seconds for a Youtube video page to load and render - something that Chrome and Firefox do in less than a second on the same system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, everything is pristine - I don't like adding <em>any </em>unnecessary fluff to any of my systems - and up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message comes from ME - saying "this is slow!". IE and/or Windows don't care about it, for IE and/opr Windows being sloooooooooooooooowwwww is not an error.</p>

<p>Hi Dave B,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not feasible to change the Group privacy settings in Admin Portal, we recommend you to change it in Outlook on the web page as the article indicates. Please check the following screenshot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39583c7c-4dc1-4f36-9d9c-7b15b7c87c9b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39583c7c-4dc1-4f36-9d9c-7b15b7c87c9b" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After navigating to Outlook on the web, you can follow the instructions in the article to ac</span><span>complish the configuration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<h3> russ c0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype &#38; LinkedIn Contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have similar problem to many I have seen here.&nbsp; There are contacts from both Skype and LinkedIn appearing in my contacts list that I no longer want.&nbsp; It isn't that I mind the accounts being linked, so much as that when I delete a person from my
 LinkedIn or Skype contacts I can still see them in my Outlook.com contacts, why are they not removed the People list, they are still there months later?&nbsp; This is most infuriating!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also people in the list I don't remember ever having been in my contacts (not anywhere in any contacts), ther's no indication as to where they came from and I cannot delete them!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The list of contacts I actually want to keep are those in my Outlook application contacts list, those currently in my Skype and LinkedIn, the rest MUST go!&nbsp; I can freely delete all those I want to keep, but the old remnants&nbsp; from Skype, LinkedIn and god
 knows where that I want rid of I cannot delete and it's frustrating to say the least!&nbsp; Using the browser (OWA) I can see a delete button at the top of my contacts list, but when I try to select/remove the people who are not actually in my Outlook (the Office
 Programme), my Skype contacts, or my LinkedIn contacts, the delete button on the menu vanishes?&nbsp; If I try to highlight these same contacts and press the delete key, a pop-up tells me I cannot delete this contact?&nbsp; It feels as though I am not in command of
 my own account, what is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

<p>Hello Russ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the same email is used to access Outlook.com (e.g. not from a merge), the contacts for both will automatically sync. The only contacts that you can remove in Outlook.com are the ones that are manually added. You can turn off the automatically adding of
 contacts/friends from Skype to Outlook. You can refer to this link for information: (<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34568/why-am-i-seeing-new-people-in-my-contact-list-in-skype-for-outlook-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to provide feedback or suggestions regarding control and managing accounts with Outlook.com, we highly encourage that you have it posted on the
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook.com UserVoice page</a> for our engineers and development team to consider in future updates of Outlook.com's service.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response, not sure what you mean "(e.g. not from a merge)"?&nbsp; I have turned off the automatic adding of people a long time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The items that I cannot delete are mostly ones that I added, but I added them to via LinkedIn or Skype. &nbsp; And, even though I have since deleted them from both Skype and LinkedIn, they are still showing up in my Contacts list at Outlook.com?&nbsp; They are no
 longer visible on Skype or LinkedIn, and I have a feeling it is because they are NOT being synced properly that this is happening?&nbsp; If they were syncing properly, then Outlook.com would see they have been removed from Skype or LinkedIn and delete them from
 my joint Contacts list, wouldn't it?</p>

            <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really really recommend doing a hard reset, as I had the same issue of my Nokia Lumia 930, and I absolutely hated it. After realizing that I didn't have anything to lose after backing up, I performed a full hard reset and the battery issue when back
 to really stable! I can now go a full day and a half(good for a win 10 build) without needing to charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't, really do, and you might be pleasantly surprised.</p>

            Hi, Optimist93
<br />
<br />Since your computer is a MAC, I recommend you contact Microsoft technical support, they will put you in touch with an agent specialized in office 365

<p>I contacted technical support. &nbsp;They gave the usual - Try it, you'll like it approach. &nbsp;They wanted me to uninstall/reinstall Office on my MAC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that it is never necessary to do anything that drastic on a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked them to add an option to say NO (no I do not want to share data) and they just said they will make a note of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I update my MacOS, sometimes there is a pop-up asking me if I want to share data. &nbsp;There is always an option to say no. &nbsp;I am asked the question once and then I never see that question again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like I either have to leave Word and Excel open all the time or just have to close that annoying pop up every time I open Word and Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to find a solution.</p>

<h2>            Grey screen in excel documents</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>A grey screen keeps coming up when I open excel documents. The document opens and when I scroll down the screen turns grey.</p>
<p>I have done a repair of MS office, moved the file to a local drive, disabled protected view and tried to hide/unhide the document.</p>
<p>I am running a new version of excel.&nbsp; No other versions are on this computer.</p>
<p>Help - this is very frustrating.</p>

<div>Hi Andrea,</div>
<div><br />
<div>For better assistance, I'd like to learn more about this matter. Please answer the following:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you mentioned that you are using a new version of Excel, kindly classify if you are using the latest version of Windows 10 as well? If not, here's the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027667/windows-10-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>for the procedure on how to install Windows Update.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is the issue also happening to your other files?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could you please provide us a sample video of what exactly happening to the application when you are trying to work on your worksheet? Please send this information to the private message that we've sent to you. To get into your inbox, click your profile
 name on this page and select <strong>View private messages</strong>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have you tried opening the application in safe mode? If not, please follow the steps below:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>and <strong>R </strong>key on your keyboard to open the
<em>Run command</em>.&nbsp;</li><li>Type <strong>excel /safe</strong> (include space between <em>excel </em>and <em>
/</em>) and then click <strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Once the application opens in safe mode, try to open the file and check if the issue persists.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>If the above steps don't work, I suggest that you enable Dynamic Data Exchange in your Excel Advanced Options. Here are the steps:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>Open your <em>Excel</em>, click on <strong>File </strong>and select <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Advanced </strong>and in the <em>General </em>group, check the
<strong>Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) </strong>option.&nbsp;</li><li>Select <strong>OK </strong>to save changes.&nbsp;</li><li>Relaunch the application and open your workbook to see if the issue will resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div>Please reply to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</div>

<h3> martini bianco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snap Shortcuts don&#39;t work in tablet mode in Build 10240</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop with touch screen, that I use mostly in tablet mode because the touch screen is rather useless in desktop mode. I&nbsp;really think the touch features should always work and to have tablet and desktop mode is redundant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, my problem is, that Win+Left and Win+Right, to show to Windows next to each other doesn't work anymore in tablet mode. This has worked before in an earlier build. So I'm not sure, if this problem is a general bug or if something has been configured
 wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me, what the problem is here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this will be fixed by the time Windows 10 is released.</p>

<p>Looks like old effect from picture viewer, but copy them back and they are fine in 7. and it only does it with older pictures, newer ones from my camera are fine....</p>

    <title>Windows 10 updates, UUP and Catch 22&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgeogden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 updates, UUP and Catch 22&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>When the release of Insider build 16215 to the “Fast Ring” caused my test PC running 16199 to fail to update (and even clean install using that or any subsequent build) I discovered that the underlying reason appeared to be missing (corrupted?) drivers
 for its aging motherboard (c.2007) – and probably those for other components, NIC, graphics etc. but there’s no way to tell without a basic install. Either way, the PC has stopped dead in its tracks as far as Windows 10 was concerned. Annoyingly rolling back
 to 16193 doesn’t stop the updates being attempted again and again and again although the graphics driver for a newer card (c.2016) were updated without a problem. (I’m running the 64 bit version and, yes, the 32 bit version runs 16241 just fine so the problem
 is only with 64bit drivers or perhaps changes to WOW64 but this is only tangential to the main topic I’m discussing here.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This got me to thinking…. Windows is now employing a SAS model and is no longer a “stand alone” OS platform on which to run 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup></span><span> party applications. So, how on earth could Windows not only continue to
 deliver enhanced OS features and extend functionality while, at the same time, continuing to support the underlying hardware components and the drivers necessary for them to function… adequately if at all?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The new features and functions of Windows 10 are to be lauded and, if not all, most will be appreciated by Windows 10 users but naturally, over time, this will place increasing demands on the hardware to a point where the PCs performance becomes unacceptably
 slow. (It’s then probably time to upgrade the PC and I’ve no problem with that.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In parallel, the number of hardware components, motherboards, CPUs, NICs, storage devices and graphics cards to name only the more obvious ones, will grow in ever increasing numbers to a point when maintaining the drivers will become unsustainable
 both in terms of complexity and the cost of doing so – that point has probably already been and gone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, it would be unreasonable to expect Microsoft, and OEMs, to maintain and update hardware drivers in perpetuity – particularly as new hardware typically delivers new features and enhanced performance that the OS could employ. But dropping support
 for a driver should not render a PC totally useless – it should, at worst, as in the past halt progression to newer versions of the OS. I’d suggest that today with the SAS model and UUP future features and functionality updates that are independent of the
 underlying hardware could still be delivered. More importantly, what about the security updates? Even if a newer build can no longer support a legacy drivers, why shouldn’t they continue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With Windows versions prior to 10 hardware driver compatibility was clearly obvious – the component just didn’t work properly… if at all. However, to some extent the line between delivering Windows updates, features and functionality, and hardware
 drivers was blurred when Windows 7 started to take on the responsibility of delivery of some of these drivers. This was no bad thing for the vast majority of Windows users who, in the past, had never even thought to update hardware drivers either because they
 didn’t know that they could, should, or if they did simply didn’t have the knowledge of how to do it themselves.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Now, to the crux of the matter</strong>… <span>&nbsp;</span>I’d not be unhappy if, at some stage in the future, support for my hardware ceased but I would still like it to function even if I knew that there would be no further updates to the
 hardware drivers and, consequently, I could, <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">potentially</span></em>, miss out on future enhancements in Windows 10.
<strong>I don’t believe that’s an unreasonable expectation!&nbsp;</strong><span> </span>
</span></span><span>However, dropping drivers without any warning is totally unacceptable.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Employing the car analogy used elsewhere in this forum about driver updates… My car worked when I drove it out of the saleroom and, even though Ford have released newer models, I still expect to wake up in the morning, start my 10-year-old Ford and
 drive it from A to B with the same passengers and luggage on board – I’m also pretty certain that if I asked Ford to upgrade or install a new improved digital radio or satnav they’d be only too willing to do so and take my money. My car shouldn’t cease to
 function simply because the model is no longer in production or spare parts are no longer available from the OEM.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I said at the start, my test PC was running Windows 10 64bit right up to build 16199 without a problem and, if I understand it correctly, UUP played a part in that by migrating the motherboard’s hardware drivers along with others but why that ceased
 with build 16215 and subsequent builds I have no idea. Perhaps a bug or possibly an intentional decision not to support the drivers going forward – I don’t know as Microsoft have not responded nor made any public statement (that I can find) either way.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean install, on a bare drive, has been possible up to an including 16193 but impossible with builds 16215 and above - 16199 might also work but I have no ISO to test it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, what will happen in the future when Windows 10 drops support for the motherboard drivers that were used to install Windows 10 in the first place? This makes the need to have an off-line recovery option ,with the latest drivers included, an absolute
 necessity.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As it may be already, or possibly soon will be, impossible to include ALL drivers in an ISO the migration to on-line installation of drivers and their updates makes sense BUT
<strong>without the OEM's motherboard drivers available off-line there’s no way to clean install Windows 10 on a bare drive – Catch 22!</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>If you read this far I’d appreciate your comments – just keep them clean (pun intended) :) :)</span></strong></span></p>

            &nbsp;Nothing lasts forever.&nbsp; I've got two 8 year old desktops that have run every build since 10/1/2014, and still going just fine.&nbsp; I hope that continues, but they've already lasted a whole lot longer than PCs did back in the '90s, so I feel like I already
 well gotten my money's worth out of them.&nbsp; They've gotten a lot cheaper than in the old days too.&nbsp; I paid close to $3000 for a PS/2 model 55, but my 4 year old Dell desktop and 1.5 year old Dell laptop, both with I5 CPUs, cost around $500.

            You are not alone. My 5 year old desktop worked fine up until the Creator's Update which failed at many varied attempts, including a clean install. I wiped the drive and went back to version 14393 and that too now failed in exactly the same way. I even
 tried reverting to Windows 7 and although that installed , no graphics driver would work.. So, I am stuck with a non functioning desktop machine that a couple of months ago was working admirably but now is just a brick. That is not the way it should be. I
 agree that you should be able to stay with a working OS and accept that you will forgo any feature updates

<p>Hi Hula_Baloo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Nothing last for ever"... I totally agree with you and, if you've read my post in full, you'd have seen that I fully understood, accepted and acknowledged that unalterable fact of life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is that, at some time in the future, Windows users will be <strong>forced to install an update
</strong>that fails, whether that's due to changes in the OS, the hardware drivers' EoL or both.... and it would seem that you have no issues with that - I, and many other Windows 10 users, do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, with Windows 10 updates that fail, it's a hard stop, no warning, no notification as to why beyond some cryptic error code which the average Windows user won't understand AND, if the roll back fails - which it has in my experience - there's
 no way to perform a clean install (without reverting to a build that's no longer supported) and/or the potential result of a PC that no longer boots. As you know, there's also another million and one reasons which could cause the failure of a PC to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll accept that a repair might be possible BUT ONLY IF booting from a DVD or USB is possible AND the motherboard drivers are available during that process - the OEM's don't appear to be offer them as downloads for Windows 10 although I can still get most
 of them for XP, 7, 8 and 8.1!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what Microsoft's or the OEM's policies are when it comes to maintaining and updating drivers but, given that many Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 users were enticed into upgrading to Windows 10, surely it's not unreasonable to expect that the drivers that
 enabled them to do so should remain available for more than two years?</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, maybe not, but this is not just about the upgraders of 2015, <strong>this will be a recurring problem
</strong>for Windows 10 users in the years to come...When will they know? How will they be told? and, if they want to continue using there aged PC, how will they achieve that until they can afford a new PC?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said, if my experience with the motherboard drivers on my test PC is anything to go by, the Fall update will be a Fail update for way too many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Silverpulser,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear of your problems and, regrettably, you're very likely to be a good example of the problem I see with Windows 10 and its future with updates to the OS and the EoL of drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, first of all, if you were able to install 14393 I don't quite understand why that's no longer possible unless you don't have an ISO of that build to perform a clean install. Despite the problems I've had with a 10 year old motherboard I can still clean
 install every build for which I have an ISO right up to 16199 and all the drivers seem to be available and work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One potential cause of the failure could have been with peripherals attached via USB...... only the bare minimum should be attached - keyboard and mouse - beyond that there could be problems with both a clean install or an upgrade / update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could post the specs of your PC, motherboard, CPU, RAM, GPU, HDD etc. I'll have a look to see if I can identify why - although I don't hold out much hope without having it to hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            &nbsp;The solution to the sudden failure of a Windows update is to make full system backups to an external hard drive, as any
<em>experienced</em> computer should know (and most do).&nbsp; Those who don't make backups have only themselves to blame.&nbsp; They will have to learn from more experienced people or unfortunately the school of hard knocks.

<p>The problem is your settings and your assumptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<p>The only reason your system is continually trying to install FAST RELEASE PREVIEWS is you have actively set your computer set to seek to install FAST RELEASE PREVIEWS knowing it cannot. Change your settings and it will immediately stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>
<p>You are equating your experience in a computer you set to receive FAST RELEASE PREVIEWS meant for people who demonstrate more skill than you are displaying in how you have set your PC's settings as if this is how it will work for people only on public releases
 using ordinary settings. IF Windows 10 gets locked in a never ending loop of automatically seeking to download and install a public release that cannot be installed on ancient and unsupported hardware with no clear, guided and easy way for an average or basic
 user to stop this , then you have a problem, but not till then.</p>

<p>Hi IanRG,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<p>I'm fully aware of the fact that I can change the settings to stop FAST RELEASE PREVIEWS and prevent further updates on the Fast ring either joining the Slow ring or waiting until the next public release. So your solution for an Insider on the Fast ring,
 experiencing a failed update, is to quit the Insider program and cease further testing. That'll certainly be of no help to Microsoft in meeting its objectives for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>
<p>FAST RELEASE PREVIEW updates are, as far as I'm aware, intended to be just that, previews of what will subsequently lead to a build that will be delivered to the Slow ring and, ultimately, to the public. If these preview updates are provided using a different
 delivery mechanism, and do not simulate the end deliverable, then the Insider program has omitted a crucial element of its stated objectives. The update process is no less important than a few bugs in the OS - in fact it's more important particularly when
 it comes to the public release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp;As for demonstrations... your unwarranted insults pertaining to my skills clearly indicates ignorance or, perhaps more likely, arrogance. You choose!</p>

</p><p>You know that it will not install on your set up. It is not going to miraculously install by you allowing it to keep on running the same process on the same release on the same system. Yes, we are here to test but we are not here to re-run the same failed
 test all the time knowing full well it will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I respectfully suggest that instead of allowing your system to do this all the time, that you briefly change back to a setting that does not lock you in the loop and periodically test if the issue is resolved following each new release. This is what I have
 had to do on occasion. This way will be far less frustrating for you and you will still be providing feedback to MS on your issue so it is (hopefully) resolved before the public releases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS That solution may well be that for public releases the update process will advise that the PC is not able to install the upgrade earlier in the process stating clearly why it will not install (E.g. The manufacture of the display/system hardware no longer
 supports this hardware for this or future version of Windows. Replacement of this hardware should be considered)</p>

            &nbsp;You're predicting things that may or may not happen with the fall release.&nbsp; And in any event, EVERY computer user is going to have to learn one way or the other to make backups.&nbsp; If they don't learn it from experienced users or classes they might take,
 they'll simply have to learn it the hard way.&nbsp; That's nothing new, it's always been that way.&nbsp; You can't change that, so I don't know what you expect to accomplish here in a forum that's supposed to be populated by people who "<em>know their way around a PC
 and don’t mind frequent updates with significant changes" </em>as Microsoft tells all insiders.

<p>hi abhilashs,</p>
<p>to answer your questions:</p>
<p>1.<strong><em>what happens when we run this command on the existing folders?</em></strong><br />
if you hide <strong>all users and everyone</strong> from people picker using sharepoint online management shell, it means you
<strong>can't select</strong> the hided groups when you share the folder via clicking
<strong>invite people</strong>. for the detailed screenshots, you can refer to them in this
<a href="https://mikesnotebook.wordpress.com/2015/06/09/prevent-users-from-sharing-content-with-everyone-in-sharepoint-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p>2.<em><strong>will those still be shared with all users / everyone?</strong></em><br />
yes. the commands you referred to are used to restrict people from selecting specific groups, but the folders are still shared with them. in addition, to disable
<strong>sharing with the specific group/user</strong> in onedrive for business, you can simply click the
<strong>stop sharing</strong> option next to the group/user on the <strong>share window</strong>.here is a screenshot for your reference.</p>

    <title>Will the VBA password be encrypted too when saving a Workbook with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irishapple  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will the VBA password be encrypted too when saving a Workbook with encryption &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created an Excel 2013 Workbook with:</p>
<p>- password protected Sheets,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;password protected VBA Modules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When saving this Workbook as follows:</p>
<p>&lt; File / Info / Protect Workbook / Encrypt with Password &nbsp;and then &nbsp;Save As &gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>=&gt; 1-1 will the VBA password be encrypted too ?</p>
<p>=&gt; 1-2 will it be more difficult for a third party to "crack" the VBA password ?</p>
<p>=&gt; 1-3 is the&nbsp;VBA password protection similar or different in Excel 2016 versus Excel 2013 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>=&gt; 2- will the Sheet and Structure VBA passwords be encrypted too (Excel 2013) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
