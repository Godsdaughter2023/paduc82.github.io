<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade to 17618 error 0xc1900101</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm running into this error while upgrading windows 10 insider skip ahead to 17618 from 17604.</p>
<p>My rig is an Asrock B85 Pro4, i5-4460, GTX 970, 500GB SSD and i'm using kaspersky as my anti-virus software (i also have steelseries and razer peripheral), it's a dual boot with ubuntu with grub as bootloader (running the latest (beta?) version available)(didn't
 have any issue with it before)(I've clean install windows 10 last december) .</p>
<p>All my drivers seems to be up to date.</p>
<p>I've run "dism" and "sfc" command after the first install error.</p>
<p>My disk had 100GB free but since i freed up more (180 GB free).</p>
<p>My anti-virus software seems to be up to date (18.0.0.405).</p>
<p>I already tried to upgrade it 5 times and i'm still running into the same error,during the second boot phase.</p>
<p>I didn't try to delete upgrade folder (unsure how to safely do it).</p>
<p>What should i try ?</p>

<p>Did that and it did not work still.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also it looks like there might be a page limitation? If I insert the PDF into OneNote and have it as 2x2 then all the pages show up. I run into an issue if a PDF has greater than&nbsp;390 pages. I tried with different pdfs
 and if they have more than 390 pages then everything after&nbsp;390 will not render.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: &nbsp;I Installed OneNote 2013 on the same computer and the issue was not there. Could this be a bug?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Two-Factor Authentication problems</h2>
                    We recently activated two-factor authentication for our organization. About two-thirds of our users are having to authenticate multiple times a day, in the middle of work and projects, which is causing an uproar. Other users report no problems, that authentication
 is being appropriately saved on devices and accounts not being logged out.

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
Please follow these steps and check if there is any improvement:<br />
<br />
1. Make sure you have enabled "Allow users to remember multi-factor authentication on devices they trust Days before a device must re-authenticate (1-60):" under multi-factor authentication &gt; service settings for the affected users.<br />
2. When you type the app password in the application, make sure "Remember my credentials" in the sign in box is selected.<br />
3. Go to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-Office-365-users-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
multi-factor authentication settings</a> for one of the affected user &gt; Manage user settings &gt; tick "Delete all existing app passwords generated by the selected users" &gt; Save. Let the user

create an app password</a> again.<br />
<br />
If the issue remains, may I confirm <br />
1. On which application(s) will you encounter this issue?<br />
2. Is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sign sign-on</a> enabled in your organization?<br />
<br />

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>

</p><p>If this is the first time you've noticed that Internet Explorer has stopped responding, the problem might be temporary. Incase&nbsp;Internet Explorer stops responding on a regular basis, common causes include the presence of spyware, an add-on, a computer virus,
 or a corrupted file that Internet Explorer is trying to access. Take the following actions to help ensure that it is not one of these problems:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Install the latest Windows Updates to keep your PC up to date</span>( <strong>
Highly</strong> <strong>Recommended</strong>)&nbsp;</li><li><span>Ensure your device running with Compatible drivers&nbsp;</span>(<strong>Recommended</strong>)&nbsp;</li><li><span>Check for solutions to the problem</span></li><li><span>Run antispyware programs on a regular basis using Windows Defender (<strong>Recommended</strong>)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Update your antivirus software</span></li><li><span>Check for suspicious Internet Explorer add-ons </span>(<strong>Recommended</strong>)&nbsp;</li><li><span>Delete temporary Internet files</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If everything seems good with the above mentioned, but still the problem persist, then boot your PC into Clean boot state to test the issue.
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to turn on 5 services at a time which are disabled before, reboot and then see if the problem reappears, keep repeating this until you find a group of 5 services, which are causing this issue, then check the one

<h2>            How do I change the name from my outlook account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My email account transferred from hotmail to outlook and it is now displaying my sons name in the sent messages and when I sign in. My son used my hotmail account to set up his xbox live but I have since changed the name on the Microsoft account, and his
 xbox account which both now show my name but Outlook still shows my profile as his name, and it is sent with every email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I change this. I have tried changing it in Microsoft account but no difference.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>No Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julianclayton  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Build 14936 installed then failed on reboot. I discovered this was due to the graphics problem, so I tried installing from a previous insider DVD namely 14931. This gave the same result, so I tried a standard Windows 10 DVD which I had made for my wife on
 March 8th 2016. This also failed for the same reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting the graphics driver (after another attempt with the 14931 DVD), which gave me Windows running for 15 minutes ~ and then again with a fresh Nvidia download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope, nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now running Ubuntu 16.04 which I have had no problems with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully Microsoft will come up with a solution soon.</p>

<p>I assume you could reboot and run (for 15 mins.) from the 14931 install. Did you initiate the Nvidia download or did it come from an (automatic)&nbsp;Windows Update run?</p>
<p>What Nvidia card/graphics chip have you installed?</p>

            Hi AlanPayne 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There is no such option Tools /Options in new Skype to delete a chat. To delete a chat in new Skype -
<br />
<br />1. Individual delete is possible only for chats sent by you where you can right click &gt; Remove
<br />
<br />2. If you want to delete the received chats - It will not be possible to delete received chats individually through Skype application. But you can delete the entire conversation by right clicking on left pane &gt; Delete conversation. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>That's what I have found out myself by searching...I also wanted to delete my call history, in a 'oner' if possible and all the junk calls that seem to come in from overseas scams.</p>
<p>I used to use Skype regularly in the past when I did a lot of overseas travel with my job.</p>
<p>However, I seem to only keep the account as a backup which I've never needed up to now.</p>
<p>I find I use the application WhatsApp for overseas holiday bookings and chats with the family.</p>
<p>If Skype was to do a similar application I would use it, as I am a great fan of Bill Gates and the complete windows and microsoft empire and family software history.</p>
<p>I use the 'other' operating system as well only because forced to through market pressure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have gone through the verification form, here are some tips that might help improve your chances of successfully using the Account Recovery form to regain access to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.
</li><li>Also it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</li><li>Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.</li><li>You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that you know apply to your account. Note: While most responses will come within a few minutes, it can take up to 24 hours for a response to be received.</li></ul>

<p>1. Chromebooks are not very limited. With the addition of the Google Play Store to ChromeOS it is possible to completely replace a traditional laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. However, Microsoft is purposefully not supporting Microsoft Office on the Acer Chromebook R11. They did for many months and then stopped. I had an Acer Chromebook R11 running Word, PowerPoint, and Excel without issue. Then Microsoft did an update to disable
 them. It was and is very frustrating.</p>

            Unfortunately, Microsoft purposefully stopped supporting the Acer Chromebook R11. I bought one because it was able to run Android apps including Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. They worked just fine on my Chromebook for a few months. However, Microsoft did
 an update where they disable them. There is no good reason, but Microsoft refuses to do anything about it.

            This is completely false. Microsoft Office was working great on my Acer Chromebook R11 until Microsoft decided to disable it. After several calls they promised to re-enable it in the future, but that was several months ago. This is nothing more than Microsoft
 going back on its promise. Chromebooks are NOT VERY LIMITED.

            This is a known issue since build 14915. &nbsp;It is a bug in the build. &nbsp;There is much discussion in other threads about "network discovery" broken. &nbsp;Linux-based devices are not properly detected.

            The danger with rolling back to any previous Insider Build is that they are about to expire soon.&nbsp; Better to hang on to 14926, if you can, until a newer one arrives.&nbsp; Otherwise clean-install the public build for version 1607.

<p>And you do mean "any." &nbsp;I saw the Oct 1 expiration notice today in 14915. When MS referred to "really old" builds in their latest blog post, I didn't have one from this month in mind.</p>

            Build 14926 has an expiration of May1st, 2017.&nbsp; There is an explanation of this in the blog in the Feedback Hub.&nbsp; It appears that going forward no build will expire before the release of Redstone 2.

            Yes, but the post made no mention of newer builds, like the last one, also expiring. I think it's a mistake that it's happening.

            I don't care but apparently too many users get behind.&nbsp; We both know what such insiders should do but this is not a coulda, woulda, shoulda thing but just an adjustment to allow for human nature.&nbsp; It does reveal what probably will be the release date for
 Redstone 2.

    <title>outlook.com calendar not updating subscribed Internet Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> countrycujo  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook.com calendar not updating subscribed Internet Calendar</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have subscribed to one calendar in .ics format (webcal://xxxxxxx.ics) on my outlook.com. The calendar does show but randomly it isn't there and will magically show back up
 the next day. Also, the outlook.com calendar doesn't show changes when made on the subscribed Internet calendar side and even though there have been changes to the .ics feed. I can't find any way to force an update.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Deleting the calendar and resubscribing to it - is not an answer. So please don't say that. Also, there is NOTHING wrong with the .ics feed calendar - so don't say that either - because it works perfectly with my gmail calendar.<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried both Chrome and Firefox and both browsers do the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My version of outlook.com - says "Outlook Mail" when on the mail section and "Outlook Calendar" when I click on the calendar icon.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that importing an ICS file provides a snapshot of the events in the calendar at the time of import. Your calendar doesn't refresh the imported events automatically - even if the calendar's owner makes an update. This is a good way to add
 events to your existing calendar that aren't going to change, like tide tables, or phases of the moon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subscribing to an iCal online calendar connects it to your calendar. Whenever the owner of an iCal you've subscribed to makes changes to the events, Outlook.com or Outlook on the web updates your calendar. This is a good way to track events that change frequently,
 like movie times, or a school calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get better clarity on the same please refer to the Microsoft help article below:</p>

            <p>Ok thank you for clarification on the differences, but that doesn't answer why the webcal://xxxxx.ics calendar would disappear certain times on outlook.com calendar and then show up again hours later. &nbsp;I just checked my Outlook.com calendar this morning
 and that ics calendar is not showing up again for any of the days of the month. But if I wait until tonight the calendar will magically show up again. I thought you said a ics calendar was an import into Outlook.com so shouldn't be there all the time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is worth mentioning that ics calendar Is also not showing up on my desktop Outlook program which is part of my office 365 office suite version (Outlook 2016 MSO 16.0.6925.1022) does not show up either. I will be posting this on the desktop forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I know it is not an issue with the calendar because it is working perfectly on my Google calendar, it always is there all the time. As I said it is there now on my google calendar but not on my outlook.com calendar. This seems to be an Outlook.com
 issue handling a subscribed Internet calendar&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Strange DNS Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carrollslemaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange DNS Problem</h2>
                    <p>I suspect that&nbsp;my problem somehow involves the IPv4/IPv6 issue.&nbsp; The symptoms, which were<br />
first encountered a few weeks ago and which continue, are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1. Very long times to open any Web sites.&nbsp; The browser tab will show the rotating wheel and the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement "Waiting for ..."&nbsp; Often it might take 5 minutes or longer for the site to open.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the site does open, however, it behaves normally.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is intermittent - much of the time these same sites pop up immediately.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;2. Very infrequently the system will seem to freeze for from 5 to 10 seconds when I attempt to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch the browser.&nbsp; When it unfreezes, the browser window opens but the "Waiting for ..."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; begins.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;3. The Administrative Events screen in the Event Viewer shows VERY long lists of DNS Client Events<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warnings, Event ID 1014.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;4. A few of the URLs which appear often in these event entries are:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vortex-win.data.microsoft.com,&nbsp;&nbsp; tunnel.cfw.trustedsource.org,&nbsp; crl.microsoft.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;5. While the system was in its cranky state, from a command prompt I issued ping and tracert<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commands on several of these URLs.&nbsp; The result was that after waiting as long as three or four<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; minutes, there was never any response of any kind.&nbsp; I had to ^C the command.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a day later I repeated this experiment and was surprised that the commands worked.&nbsp; Some<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; showed responses from the destinations and others showed time-outs for each packet, but all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commands terminated normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find Web&nbsp;reports that what MAY be the same issue is known and several "fixes" are given.&nbsp; Two or<br />
three weeks ago (before the above experiments) I did disable Teredo as suggested at some site, but<br />
before I disable various other functions I thought I should first get some advice from someone more<br />
knowledgeable than I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 7 Pro on a Dell T1700.&nbsp; Internet access is through a Cisco DPC3825 residential<br />
gateway and connection is by wire, not wireless.&nbsp; My wife has a Lenovo laptop which does access the<br />
DPC3825 by WiFi.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>

            <p>Hi Coral,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you are a knowledgeable internet user, and are using a Pro version of windows. I have some technical questions and suggestions. I think you will be up to it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>First up, please include the full address of any websites you are having problems with your questions... this enables us to visit the sites and to make assessments as&nbsp;to what may be wrong... for instance we can test if the site require IPV6 with a reverse
 dns lookup... we can test the sites for compatibility issues with modern web browsers... or we can just plain confirm if a web site is still in business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than just telling you a possible solution I will share with you my method for researching the issue and finding a solution ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the time it took me to write the above words I was able to do a web search that revealed the most likely solution.... given</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The Administrative Events screen in the Event Viewer shows VERY long lists of DNS Client Events<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warnings, Event ID 1014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entered a reasonable search string into the IE Address bar for "dns error EventID 1014"</p>
<p>You can quickly do web searches from</p>
<p>(alt+E) places a ? mark in the address bar and focuses the cursor in the address bar. Start typing (or copy and paste the error codes from the Event Viewer) your search terms next to the ? mark... eg ? dns errors Event ID 1014</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is the query string for Bing</p>
<p>http://www.bing.com/search?q=dns+error+Event+ID+1014&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBLH&amp;pq=dns+error+event+id+1014</p>
<p>
</p><p>(you can copy and paste the above into the address bar or try the instructions above it to use the Search Shortcut using your own default search provider)</p>
<p>
</p><p>as you will see this search yields quite a number of results. I think the following TechNet link provides the best troubleshooting and solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/3336.event-id-1014-microsoft-windows-dns-client.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will leave it to you to view and digest the TechNet wiki above and to trial the offered solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Using the error descriptions and codes from the event viewer and your favourite search engine, troubleshooting computer problems is easy.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, how to determine if your Cisco router is IPv6 capable... (I have to tell you a few years ago, Cisco dumped a warehouse full of modems that weren't IPv6 capable on the market. (in my country (AU)). This was 6 months before the end of life support for
 XP (which isn't IPv6).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using your favourite search provider again, enter the following search terms in the Address bar. (or use the Search shortcut (alt+E) to focus on the Address bar ready to enter your search terms).</p>
<p>
</p><p>determine if modem is IPv6 capable windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>copy and paste the following search url in the address bar...</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.bing.com/search?q=determine+if+modem+is+IPv6+capable+windows+7</p>
<p>
</p><p>the following search results link gives you instructions for enabling and disabling IPv4 and 6 from your networking and sharing Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172319(v=vs.110).aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, a tip from an aging internet dog.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most likely cause of these problems with DNS is not your computer settings, modem, or the particular websites you are visiting, but rather the copper wires that connect you to the internet via your ISP....</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said the problem is intermittent? The copper network is laid underground in trenches... Has it been raining locally or up state?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you discuss your problem with your ISP (Internet service provider eg. Verison) they will be able to run diagnostics from their end to determine the quality of the copper connections and arrange for a technician to trace and repair the connections in the
 trenches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe it or not, a simple 20c piece of resin could be to blame... resin is used to seal the copper wire connections from moisture. Over time these resin connections crack and moisture is able to enter the wire connections and the signal quality degrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: while speaking to your ISP, enquire if they have a more efficient(cheaper and faster)&nbsp;plan. The technology joining homes to the internet has changed in the past ten years... they (the ISP's) won't offer to give you a cheaper and faster plan unless your
 ask for it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I trust that your visit here to Microsoft answers has provided both a solution to your immediate modem problem, but also empowered you yourself with the confidence to in the future, research, troubleshoot and solve computer issues yourself. Its easy... ask
 your search engine.... feed it the error messages from the windows event viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Rob -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me address each of the points that you raise and then offer my analysis of the problem so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You asked for the full addresses of any sites involved.&nbsp; Here are some.&nbsp; Note that they include some servers of organizations which almost certainly are OK:</p>
<p>
</p><p>armmf.adobe.com,&nbsp; clients5.google.com,&nbsp; www.microsoft.com,&nbsp;</p>
<p>vortex-win.data.microsoft.com,&nbsp;tunnel.cfw.trustedsource.org, and <a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.cnn.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You described how to search the Web for other reports of the same issue and possible fixes.&nbsp; That is exactly what I did before posting my original request to this community.&nbsp; I found several reported "fixes" but no one reported exactly the same symptoms
 as I have experienced.&nbsp; Also, these "fixes" all involved some risk of damage and probably lots of time.&nbsp; Finally, I am beginning to suspect that the issue is
<em><strong>not </strong></em>IPv4 or IPv6 after all&nbsp;but something deeper.&nbsp; (See my analysis later.)&nbsp; This is why I thought I had better seek advice from someone much more knowledgeable about these matters than I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You suggested that I check to see if my DPC3825 residential gateway is compatible with IPv6.&nbsp; But the device is DOCSIS 3.0 compliant and I suspect that IP version is not relevant to it.&nbsp; A search of the reference manual for "IPv6" or "IPv4" found nothing.&nbsp;
 Likewise for a Web search for "Cisco DPC3825 IPv6".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the&nbsp;intermittency indicating&nbsp;a wiring problem, all the time while these DNS warnings were posting to the event logs, real-time streaming data was being received by another application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here is my current appraisal:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem affects both Web access (where IP version is relevant) and e-mail access (where SMPT version is relevant).&nbsp; But it only seems to affect the process&nbsp;which
<strong><em>establishes</em></strong> the connection, not the process or processes which
<em><strong>use</strong></em> the connection to transfer the&nbsp;data packets.&nbsp; A mail error appears as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail Error ID 0x800CCC0D,&nbsp; Socket Error 11004</p>
<p>
</p><p>To conclude, the problem source is common to both Web access and e-mail access (a POP3 server), but only to connection establishment, not to&nbsp;the subsequent transfer of data packets.&nbsp; So it almost certainly involves some form of handshaking protocol during
 connection establishment.&nbsp; The cause could be some error or corruption in the initial request from my computer, or failure of my computer to recognize or correctly interpret the response from the DNS (my immediate&nbsp;region is served by three DN servers).&nbsp; If
 I had access to a flowchart which showed the flow of control among the actual Windows code modules which act in internet access, I could probably pinpoint the source, if not the cause, of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much Rob, and I sincerely hope you or some other member of the community can help me diagnose and fix the problem.</p>
<p>

</p><p>FWIW I just had an outage on my Wi-Fi (from DSL), starting up from being unused for a few hours and I saw my first test of a new change I made recently.&nbsp; I am using Hyper-V&nbsp;(on W8.1.2 Pro) which apparently&nbsp;has taken over networking at the lowest level (e.g.
 Ethernet) and&nbsp;annoyingly often&nbsp;had found symptoms such as "invalid IP configuration" (e.g. as reported by the Network troubleshooters) in such circumstances (network waking up from being idle).&nbsp; In the last previous instance I noticed that the connection was
 showing no default gateway address.&nbsp; Well, the default gateway address is the address in my router which does everything:&nbsp; DHCP, DNS relay&nbsp;so if that wasn't being detected that would certainly explain symptoms being reported as problems with the DNS server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Serendipitously earlier that week I had noticed that someone had reported a problem using the Advanced button in IPv4 Properties.&nbsp; I had been unaware of such a dialog but noticed that it was a way to hardcode a default gateway address while still leaving
 the rest of Network Discovery largely unchanged.&nbsp; Anyway, today I used IE's Fix Connection Problems button with much better results than it usually gives me, so I am going to attribute that success to this change.&nbsp; You might want to try such a change too,
 e.g. in case it helps smooth out the timings of recovery from outages the way that I think it is helping me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, I think the troubleshooters just go a bit goofy in what they ask us to do (e.g. power off all PERFECTLY FUNCTIONING comm hardware for at least 10 seconds).&nbsp; And&nbsp;more bad news is that I don't think there will be any improvement in W10 (although
 I am currently stuck at an earlier build with--wait for it--a connectivity problem in the Hyper-V host so maybe they will surprise me.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW this isn't really an IE problem so much as a networking problem with your OS, so you may get more informed help from a forum which has that specialization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

            <p>Have I, perhaps, solved this very annoying problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the related warning events I received yesterday&nbsp;was for my mail client:</p>
<p>&nbsp; (Windows Live Mail Error ID 0x800CCC0D, Socket Error 11004)</p>
<p>Searching for this I found a suggestion that this problem might be&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;corrupted data in the DNS cache&nbsp;and might be cured by flushing that cache.&nbsp; The writer suggested that it might be useful also to reset TCP and gave instructions for both operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did both at about 3:10 PM yesterday afternoon and then restarted my system.&nbsp; Checking the administrative event log sometime later I was dismayed to see a continuation of the DNS Client warnings.&nbsp; Eight miscellaneous errors occurred&nbsp;beginning at&nbsp;3:13:31
 PM and the DNS warnings began at 3:43:37 and continued till 8:43:51 (8 more events) interrupted at 6:47:30 by an RPC warning of a "possible memory leak".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>BUT</em></strong>, there has not been another administrative event of
<em><strong>ANY</strong></em> kind since that one at 8:43:51 last night.&nbsp; If the flush &amp; reset did, in fact, fix the problem, I have no idea why the warnings continued for another 5.5 hours before the F&amp;R&nbsp;took effect.&nbsp; I'm keeping my fingers crossed!</p>

            <p>Hi Carol,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are more informed and&nbsp;knowledgeable than me! (I am but a humble MSMVP... nobody knows everything about all computers or the internet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have one further guess left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Comcast or AOL your ISP? I don't know much about the subject (and I live in Australia), but my understanding is that those ISP's use(d) a NAT4 network (one IP address shared by many users)</p>
<p>
</p><p>see whatismyipaddress.com and whatismyipaddress.com/nat</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Network address translation</strong> (<strong>NAT</strong>) allows a router to modify packets to allow for multiple devices to share a single public
<strong>IP address</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>One feature of IE that we don't consider enough perhaps is that once it has done a DNS lookup it hangs onto it and does not bother doing another one for some period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if you left the IE task open or even if there was still a residual iexplore.exe
 task running that could be enough to still be using an obsolete lookup.&nbsp; Do your problem sites change their IP addresses frequently?&nbsp; That could cause DNS error symptoms until either IE was closed, or its cached lookup expired or the host associated with the
 IP address it had became online again.&nbsp; Etc.</p>

            <p>Thanks Robert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But perhaps you could answer a couple of questions for me.&nbsp; First, is the "DNS cache" that I flushed the repository of the lookup results to which you refer?&nbsp;( I would have thought that such a cache would be more fundamental than that - in other words, would
 serve the needs of <em><strong>any</strong></em> process needing access to the Internet, not just IE.)&nbsp; And if so, then didn't the flush operation clear all previous lookup results from that cache?&nbsp; Finally, if a process attempted to reach an address using&nbsp;an
 obsolete result&nbsp;from the cache, would that still produce the same DNS client warning with ID 1014?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carroll</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS:&nbsp; I don't now recall if IE was left running during that 5.5-hr period or not.</p>

<p>No.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; ipconfig /flushdns&nbsp; only affects&nbsp;new lookups.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp;/displaydns&nbsp; to see its effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm referring to is the fact that once IE has done a lookup that has been used successfully, it stops doing lookups and reuses the IP address it obtained for a period of time.&nbsp; You can see this with this host, answers.microsoft.com if you put a different
 lookup into your HOSTS file after IE has already found one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, if you do an ipconfig /flushdns&nbsp; new lookups will be using your HOSTS file override (or conversely, stop using it when you comment it out again) but for quite a while IE (the running iexplore.exe)
 will continue using the old address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answers is particularly useful for demonstrating this because it displays a "server name" in the HTML comments at the top of the page.&nbsp; Press Ctrl-u to see it (or use the Developer Tools, DOM Explorer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the last 3 lines of my HOSTS file which I use simply by uncommenting one or re-commenting it, saving it and then doing an ipconfig /flushdns to activate the change.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know.&nbsp; What does it say?&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; The page that Rob found for you explains.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is something completely different.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it is probably why IE does try to hang on to its lookups, both as an optimization and as a way of avoiding potential unreliability
 in reaching the user's DNS servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is actually related to that "DNS relay" that I alluded to in describing my workaround to having a missing gateway address.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. the real DNS address is one that the router picked up from my ISP.&nbsp; The only DNS address that the OS knows is the one in
 my router, so if there is a timing problem getting both exchanges done then you would see that symptom.&nbsp; Unfortunately the OS never seems to consider this possibility and treats the timing of all such requests as having "LAN speed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on your modem there may be circumstances when the timing needs to be looser than that assumption implies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it happens what I do is use the second parameter of nslookup to test whether there really is DNS connectivity or whether the router isn't doing its job fast enough to the OS liking.&nbsp; E.g. I can either go into the router's console and get the real DNS
 address(es) that it uses for that (thereby proving BTW the lie that the troubleshooter wants to believe) or I can just be lazy and use Google's public DNS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>nslookup&nbsp; answers.microsoft.com&nbsp; 8.8.8.8</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes just doing that is enough to kick things back into gear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option though is to override the OS DNS server address using a netsh command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g. use </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh in ip dn sh</p>
<p>to see what is in use and if it is a local address or one which is currently not responding you can use a related Set command to change it to something that works better.</p>
<p>

    <title>WD file creation by word 365 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leehartman4  say:</h3>
<h2>            WD file creation by word 365 2016</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Office 365 2016 on 3 computers but have found a problem after installing it on my Windows 7 laptop.&nbsp; What is happening is when I open Word documents directly from "Documents" folder when I wish to save them they say they will be saved
 as a Word 97-2003 Document but change the&nbsp;file namae to a WD00000X file name.&nbsp; If I&nbsp;open&nbsp;the document directly&nbsp;through Word 365 it opens and when I go to save it has the correct file name and still&nbsp;as a Word 97-2003 Document which is OK.&nbsp; When I bring up the
 document&nbsp;from&nbsp;File Explorer it states above the page that it is&nbsp;"Read Only"&nbsp;With a WD00000X file name and the file fills the whole screen.&nbsp; When I bring the same document up through Word is shows up as a normal page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both Office 2010 and Office 365 2016 on this computer.&nbsp; I cannot duplicate this problem with either of my other computers one of which has Office 2010 also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found nothing on the Microsoft website or through Google search.&nbsp; One individual did have this problem in 2014 but did not have a solution.</p>
<p>

            I have found a solution.&nbsp; Someone on the internet had suggested searching for winword.exe file and opening it.&nbsp; I did this and then all documents whether created in Word 2010 or Word 365 opened in Word 2010 format and the WD0000XX and read only&nbsp;were gone.&nbsp;
 I then changed the default format when saving to Word Document and all is well.&nbsp; Thanks for your help as that helped fix part of the problem and winword.exe the rest of it.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />As referred here: Office for Mac is supported on the three most recent versions of macOS. When a new version of macOS is released, the Office for Mac Operating System requirement becomes the then-current three most recent versions: the new version of macOS and the previous versions: <a href="https://products.office.com/en/office-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en/office-system-re...</a>
<br />If you are using an older version, an installation of MS Office won't be possible, sorry, But you can still use MS Office online and create your documents there. 
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Manuela

<p>I got exactly the same message this week. I was trying to download a genuine Windows Office Home and Business 2019. I believe the message was a scam. I think I went onto the wrong site and ended up getting a technican telling me I have a botnet which was
 why it would not load and offered to fix the problem by someone coming to the club. I declined. The next day I way very careful about the website I went onto and it downloaded perfectly&gt;</p>

                    <p>The other&nbsp;morning when I signed in to Hotmail it was Outlook and not Hotmail that appeared on the screen. My saved emails were gone except one of about 20 and my contact list was gone. What appeared in my contact list were old email addresses that were magically
 imported from&nbsp;my old Outlook account that I have not used for a few months now.&nbsp; Is it possible to recover my contact list and my saved email folder? I am told that these may still be on your server at Microsoft.</p>
<p>The forum has not helped.</p>

            <p>Hi JudyHiscock,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry if we missed out the issue about your lost contacts.</p>
<p><br />
If you’ve accidently deleted or lost contacts in your Microsoft account, you can restore them on the Contacts page. Your Microsoft account contacts are shared across Hotmail, SkyDrive, Messenger, and other Microsoft products and services.</p>
<p><br />
Note:<br />
•You can't restore contacts deleted more than 30 days ago.</p>
<p><br />
To restore deleted contacts:</p>
<p><br />
1.Go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=242727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign</a> in page and enter your Microsoft account and password. (If you’re already signed in, you'll go directly to the Contacts page.)</p>
<p>2.In the menu bar, click Manage, and then click Restore deleted contacts.</p>
<p>3.Click Restore next to each contact that you want to be restored, or click Restore all if you want all your deleted contacts to be restored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you added contacts from Facebook, Google, or other services, they won’t appear in the list of contacts to restore. You’ll need to import your contacts from each service before you can restore them to your contact list. To import friends now, go
 to the <a href="https://profile.live.com/P.mvc#!/cid-29045a404a76b4e1/connect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Add</a> people page. <br />

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>hi sounderrajan,</p>
<p>if the archive mailbox is enabled for this user, you can follow the steps below to move 6 month old messages to archive:<br />
1.&nbsp;create a default retention tag.</p>
<ul>
<li>a.&nbsp;sign in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">eac</a>(exchange admin center).
</li><li>b.&nbsp;navigate to <strong>compliance management&gt;retention tag</strong>. </li><li>c.&nbsp;click <strong>+</strong> and choose <strong>applied automatically to entire mailbox(default)</strong>
</li><li><strong><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d30cba80-47bc-47f1-aba7-3c8cec4a334a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd30cba80-47bc-47f1-aba7-3c8cec4a334a" /></a><br />
</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>d.&nbsp;type the tag name. choose move to archive under retention action. enter the retention period. then save.
</li><li><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7c788926-07df-43ab-b85b-e113d5bd17e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7c788926-07df-43ab-b85b-e113d5bd17e3" /></a>
</li></ul>
<p><br />
2.&nbsp;create retention policy includes this retention tag.</p>
<ul>
<li>a.&nbsp;navigate to <strong>retention policies</strong> and click +. </li><li>b.&nbsp;type the name and click <strong>+</strong> under <strong>retention tags</strong>. then add the retention tag created previously. then click ok.
</li><li><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2be8277b-132c-4110-8795-9eed927f45f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2be8277b-132c-4110-8795-9eed927f45f7" /></a>
</li><li>c.&nbsp;a retention policy as follow is created. </li><li><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e1b5932e-0482-421d-aeb9-b7249c9c3e2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de1b5932e-0482-421d-aeb9-b7249c9c3e2e" /></a>
</li></ul>
<p><br />
note that if you only want to move 6 month old messages to archive, this retention policy is applicable. if you have any other requirements, you need to add other corresponding retention tags to this policy. for you reference:<br />

</li></ul>
<p><br />
4.&nbsp;the retention runs automatically one time every seven days for mailboxes that are larger than 10 mb. to force the retention policy takes effect immediately, you can use managed folder assistant.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Try that again later....&#34; When trying to download NEW apps</h2>
                    <p>This is very frustrating. I have not been able to&nbsp;find resolution to&nbsp;this issue after several weeks and multiple posts on multiple forums, so I am reposting and wording as carefully as possible. Phone is Lumia&nbsp;640 LTE, Windows 10 version 10.0.14393.189.
 When trying to "get" new apps I get the message <strong>"Try that again. Something happened on our end. Waiting a bit might help."</strong></p>
<p>I get updates to installed apps and am able to install them.:</p>
<p>I can: Download and install apps previously uninstalled or "owned".</p>
<p>I can: Download and install new apps to my other Lumia 640 LTE, Windows Phone 8.1. I can then download and install the app to my Windows 10 Lumia 640 LTE.</p>
<p>I cannot: Download/install new apps</p>
<p>Actions taken so far: Soft reset, hard reset, resetting time and date, going to my account and confirming that there are two Lumia 640's registered ( though it is not possible to ascertain that each phone is unique), signing in and signing out of App Store,
 scouring Settings to see if I'm missing something such as sync, and scouring the internet to try to find solution.</p>
<p>HELP!</p>
