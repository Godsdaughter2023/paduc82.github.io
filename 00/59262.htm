<h2>            Windows 7 HP Cursor Stalls&#47;Freezes</h2>
                    I am experiencing a mouse cursor freeze usually when opening videos or certain websites online. I just upgraded from Vista 64 to Win7 and have been using the new system for 3 days now. This freezing of the cursor is annoying.&nbsp; I have updated my BIOS &amp;
 drivers directly from Acer's website sites but the problem still persists.&nbsp; I did not have this problem in XP or Vista 64.&nbsp; It should also be noted that the keyboard input is fine and I am using Firefox 3.5.4.<br />
<br />
Current setup:<br />
Acer Aspire Notebook 5535<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium (Upgraded from Vista 64bit Home Premium)<br />
AMD Turion X2 Ultra 64<br />
4 GB Ram<br />
350gb HDD<br />
ATI Radeon 3200

<h2>            Is there a option to Sleep after laptop is unplugged and the lid is closed.</h2>
                    <p>I have this little quirk that has left me with a dead battery a few times since XP. The situation I'm in is when I have a laptop that's hooked up to a External Monitor/KB/Mouse, then I go to leave, unplug the laptop, stow it, later on arrive with a dead
 battery. It arrives dead because it remained on until its in Low/Critical battery state,&nbsp; And its set that way to stay on, when being used as a desktop with lid closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Power Options:</p>
<p>the Lid Closed will do nothing when plugged in (to use as desktop)</p>
<p>Lid is closed on battery will got to Sleep</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Main Question is:</p>
<p>Is there an option to go to sleep (minutes) after laptop has been unplugged and lid is closed</p>

<p>Yes... In Advanced Power Options. You are almost there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power Options:</p>
<p>On Battery: Sleep after X min</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also Hibernate if the laptop supports it.</p>

            Hi Samm.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First confirm you have the Sleep options configured correctly as shown here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change-power-plan-settings-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change...</a>
<br />
<br />Most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager&gt;Display adapter&gt;Driver&gt;Update Driver&gt;Browse&gt;Let me pick.  
<br />
<br />In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />What I do is go into Advanced Power options and set Display and Sleep to 1 minutes, Hibernate to 2 minutes, then after completing each step restart the PC and observe what happens for 3 minutes.  
<br /> 
<br />Also did it previously work?  Do you have a System Restore point from when it did?<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if an Update reinstalls and causes the same problem uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Colors off in Windows 8.1 Blue links are purplish, Red colors are maroonish etc</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">I just bought the Aspire V5 15.6" Laptop - Black (Intel Core i5 4200U / 1TB HDD / 10GB RAM / Windows 8.1) and I plug it via HDMI
 to my Samssung 55 Inch series 8 2011 TV. &nbsp;The colors are perfectly fine in the desktop or playing videos. However when I use Chrome the colors are off. White is bluish white. Blue links are slightly purplish. Red is slightly maroon. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure it's a
 OS thing as I've tried different Windows 8 laptops one with the AMD dedicated graphic card (Acer V5) and the Intel 4000 graphic card(Acer E5) but same color issues.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">This isn't a problem with my TV because I've had a different computer plugged in the same way. I've also plugged my Chromebook into
 it and the colors are perfectly fine.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">What could the problem be? I don't think I should have to do any advanced calibration for something so basic. Any suggestions would
 be most welcome.&nbsp;</span>

</p><p>No the issues is not specific to Chrome. It is certainly more pronounced in Chrome. On the desktop environment colors are reproduced correctly. However I loaded IE and they are washed out there too. But yes, its' more pronounced in Chrome.</p>

            I tried disabling each driver and it did not solve the problem. I have about 4 days to either fix this or take it back to best buy. My only options seem to be Windows 7 or Chromebooks but Windows 7 devices are in short supply. (Unless you have any other
 ideas).

            It certainly sounds as though your motherboard has failed. Since this is a laptop, you can't fix this yourself. Either call the laptop mftr.'s tech support or take it to a reputable local professional (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).

<h2>            Cleaning print cartridges, PSC 1600 series</h2>
                    I need to clean the print carts. on my HP 1600 series all in one printer, anyone have any suggestions? The older versions of Win had a troubleshooting guide for the printers that would do this operation.<br />

            Thank you for your speedy reply, I specified that my printer is a PSC 1600 series printer in the title, specifically a PSC 1610 all in one printer, scanner, FAX machine. I guess you didn't see that portion of the post but a PSC 1600 printer is an inkjet
 printer rather than a laserJet. <br />
<br />
I have tried the HP Print and Scan Doctor twice and it found no faults or errors in the process. I have cleaned the printer nozzles on each cartridge with alcohol and that didn't help. Both cartridges checked good on the computerized ink filling machine where
 I had them refilled and they purged both cartridges and refilled them and ran a print check on them afterward with no errors.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your efforts anyway.<br />
<br />
I am still looking for someone who may have an answer to this problem.<br />

            I might add that I have pretty much ruled out the cartridges as the printing "culprit", everything seems to proceed properly when I try to print,<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>The printer does its preparatory "clicking and jostling and moving about" prior to the paper being drawn in</li><li>The paper does go into&nbsp; the printer</li><li>The printing process <i>sounds</i> like it is OK, that is, the cartridges can be heard moving about and the paper is fed into the printer line by line as expected</li><li>At the end of the process, the sheet of blank paper is ejected from the printer as expected</li><li>In the case of multiple pages, the next page is drawn into the printer and the same procedure happens again</li></ul>
<p>I have been computer literate since the early '80's when I did my work on a Commodore Vic-20 and then on to a great step up (well, it
<i>was</i> a great step back in those days!) to a Commodore 64, so I am not a total illiterate with computers.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But, this problem leads me to believe that, just at the same time that I have both factory HP cartridges filled by a service that has done flawless ink filling for me in the past, I have something go out in the hardware and I have a difficult time making
 my brain absorb all these coincidences happening at once. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Alas, that may be the ire of the age of computers for some of us!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks again for any help anyone can give me on this problem.<br />

            Nithyananda,<br />
<br />
Was that comment meant to be FUNNY????? I don't think you have command enough of the English language to understand what I have said in these three messages that I have posted.<br />
<br />
Let me be quite specific, I needed some help on figuring out why my printer, a PSC 1610 INKJET printer was not printing a document for me. You came on and gave me some very valuable information, I am quite sure, but it was for a 1600 series LASERJET printer,
 two entirely different machines!!<br />
<br />
I went on further to explain in the second message that everything SEEMED to work correctly!! I used the standard "Print" option in Word 2003 as anyone who knows even a little information about using a computer would understand, the paper fed into the printer
 as it SHOULD when the process starts, the printer SOUNDED like it was printing in that it was making the "normal" sounds a printer makes when printing a document, the paper was feeding in one line at a time the way paper SHOULD feed in when printing a document,
 and the paper came out of the printer the way it SHOULD when the printing printing process is done. The only thing that wasn't as it SHOULD be was the fact that nothing was PRINTED ON THE PAPER!!!
<br />
<br />
I mentioned in my third message that I thought I had discounted the ink cartridges as being at fault but, on further troubleshooting, I can't see how everything else could work properly and still not send a signal to the print head to squirt ink when the proper
 pixels are apparent to receive ink. I am not a experienced printing guru, just an older man who&nbsp; is trying to use deductive reasoning to figure out what is wrong with my machine. It IS just a MACHINE, it has no brain, it doesn't guess what is to happen next,
 it merely responds to signals sent to its motherboard and processor of ones and zeros.
<br />
<br />
I still HAVE NOT RECTIFIED THE PROBLEM of not getting a document to print out as it was typed into the Word 2003 program!
<br />
<br />
I have downloaded 3 copies of the complete software and drivers for my machine from the HP website. When the first one crashed in the middle of doing the driver updates, I thought there may have been a glitch in the download so I D/L'ed a second copy and the
 same thing happened! So I downloaded a copy of the "Printer Install Wizard for Windows 7" and ran that program. It concluded that everything on my computer was working properly and it decided to download the very same software and drivers program that I had
 just spent almost&nbsp; an three hours trying to download and get to run!! THAT'S when I pulled the plug and went to the fridge for a cold beer and got back into a really good book I am reading!<br />
<br />
I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME SENSIBLE ASSISTANCE WITH THIS PROBLEM AS I AM GETTING SHORT OF PATIENCE WITH THIS PROBLEM and need some help from someone who understands what the problem involves.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time but I have not been helped by anything you have posted so far.<br />

Let me be quite specific.&nbsp; You have come to a Windows 7 forum apparently trying to get information about a Hewlett Packard product that is nothing to do with MicroSoft at all.&nbsp; You then denegrate and disparage somone who is kindly trying to assist you.&nbsp; As
 I am getting short of patience with you and your so called problem I think we can call this conversation permanently closed.</p>

            And you are the supervisor of which group in Microsoft?? Just curious as to how you come by all your vast help and knowledge of all the products that have been mentioned in my post?? And you apparently think of yourself as quite a powerful person to make
 such judgements all by yourself. I also went elsewhere trying to find out from someone who isn't manning a computer bank in India or some other third world country how to fix this problem.
<br />
<br />
I didn't spend my time in the mid 60's slopping around in some horrible jungle in the backyard of a group of little communist gooks while "smart" guys like&nbsp; you were trying to evade the draft or running like a scared rabbit to Canada just to have you try to
 talk down to me without knowing all of the facts behind my problem with this printer.
<br />
<br />
Instead of trying to exert your self serving image of authority on others, why not try some constructive conversation and help find a solution for me?? Just might make you look good in the end instead of acting like a spoiled child about something that isn't
 any of your business.<br />
<br />
Or maybe try hitting the "Next" button if you don't like what you read from me. I really care about your opinion when it has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Thanks for your very helpful input. Now, run along, I think your mama is calling you.<br />

            This is a late reply, but this is the first time I read your post. &nbsp;I agree with you. I don't understand why people react with such hostility to something so non-threatening. &nbsp;Anyways, I had the same problem as you with a hp printer and it was the ink
 cartridge. I kept running the clean nozzle and align cartridges program and this eventually worked. I do not know for sure, but I think that when we refill our cartridges, at some point they start to break down, like erode for lack of a better term. Each time
 I refill this cartridge it is taking longer and longer for it to start to function properly.
<div>&nbsp; I hope this is helpful to you and by the way, thank you for your sacrifice to me and our country. It is appreciated. Without brave souls like yourself, the above posters would not have the freedom to speak as they did. &nbsp;A little food for thought and
 a reminder to some that a little respect can go a long ways..Thank You</div>

            <p>Hey there guys and gals, I received a notice that this ancient thread is still generating responses and thought I would try to give a positive ending to something that has far outlived its usefulness, to me at least.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate all the good words and support that some of you have chosen to send my way, I guess we all find a solution to our problems one way or another. I hadn't given it a thought about multiple cleaning passes over the cartridges in an attempt to get
 them to work properly. It makes sense to me and I am glad that it helped someone else who had the same problem with their printer. In my case, I wasn't patient enough to wait for an answer that was focused on the original problem nor was I smart enough to
 think things through and take a chance that HP hadn't done their homework well enough to make a single pass or two enough to completely clean a cartridge head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opted to buy another printer, a Canon MG 2120 all-in-one (except for a FAX option which I can't use), and it cost me less for the entire printer and cartridges than the HP carts would have cost to replace them! And, at that point in time, I was not convinced
 that the carts were the problem anyway, now I know that it must have been possible to simply not clean them completely. For what it's worth, the Canon has operated flawlessly since I bought it in 2012. It was the best $29 "investment" I have made for computer
 equipment in many years since that portion of my business does not require the use of my B/W Brother DCP laser printer.

</p><p>I want to apologize to Antony and also to Nithyananda if I came on too strong with my replies to either of you, it was not intentional and I have been told throughout my life that I have a short fuse when it comes to someone talking down to me. I have always
 been a survivor and I have always taken time to do for others before doing for myself so this was a short burst of attempting to "do for myself" and I am not very good at it so I went back to my "old ways" of traveling and helping as I go. It seems like "paying
 forward" is the best for me as I continue along my adventure on this ravaged planet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe one day our paths will cross and you will see that I am sort of a nice old guy to be around.</p>

<p>According to xbox there is a problem with playing Downloaded games or DLC.&nbsp; If this is the case, then why can my son play the exact same Downloaded game on his xbox that runs through the same network as mine.&nbsp; Why would his copy that played the same as mine,
 work now, but none of mine do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done all the advised fixes.&nbsp; Hard reset. Reloaded game. Logged off/on again.&nbsp; Nothing works to play any of the games.</p>

<p>Hi my name is Jaykob and I am apart of the abassador program.</p>
<p>I see you're having issues playing your games.</p>
<p>Have your son log off his account and power off his xbox. Now try it on yours.</p>
<p>If it does still not work please take your current disc out of your xbox, go to settings, Disc &amp; Blu-ray, Blu-ray, Persistent stroage(clear it 3 times)</p>
<p>Then go to network settings, advanced, alternate MAC address, clear. Your console will reset. Also make sure your NAT type is on open</p>

<p>Hello my name is Keith and I am also from the ambassador program. This error only affected random accounts, not all were affected. To my knowledge this has been cleared up. Unfortunately the error code: 0x87e107d0 will not show up in the help page, or through
 our automated assistant. But for future reference it is a Digital Content error. Make sure and keep an eye on Xbox Live status here:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-live-status</a></p>
<p>That is always a good first step. Hope this helped! =)</p>

<h2>            you are not currently connected to a network</h2>
                    <p>I am posting this from the computer with the problem so apparently I have some Internet connection.&nbsp; Web and Email work but the network and sharing center say&nbsp;I am not connected to any networks. This is keeping Windows Update (among other things) from working.
 I have tried the network troubleshooter, Deleting and reinstalling drivers. Turning the firewall off and any other way I can find to reset the network. I'm at my wits end. Suggestions?</p>

    <title>Apps automatically launch when I move my mouse in the app drawer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Apps automatically launch when I move my mouse in the app drawer</h2>
                    Ever since I upgraded to 8.1 (which in all fairness was only about a day after I got a new laptop with 8 built-in) moving my mouse around using the touch-pad in the app drawer (the one you scroll down to from the Start menu) it randomly launchers an app,
 or a game or whatever. Most of the time I just use the arrow keys to get around without trouble, but if anyone knows what the problem might be or if there is anything that I could do, that'd be great.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually this issue caused because touchpad settings issues. Before we start with the troubleshooting steps, I would like to know some information about this issue.</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error code or error message while startup?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model number of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Download and run Metro App troubleshooter and check.</font></span></p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a><span><font color="#000000">
</font></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Try reducing the touchpad sensitivity and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to change the touchpad sensitivity:</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X</strong> keys and click on <strong>
Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Click on <strong>Mouse</strong> icon.</p>
<p>c. Select the <strong>Device Settings</strong> tab.</p>
<p>d. Click on <strong>Settings</strong> button, you will see a <strong>Properties</strong> window.</p>
<p>e. In <strong>Properties</strong> windows you will see an option <strong>Sensitivity</strong>, here click on
<strong>Touch Sensitivity</strong>.</p>
<p>f. Reduce the the sensitivity accordingly and click <strong>Ok</strong> to save changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply with the status of the issue, so that we could help you better.</p>

            It's an Asus N56JR, I don't get any error messages on startup and changing the sensitivity doesn't do anything. I made heaps of changes to settings and preferences on the computer, installed some stuff but I've been through anything that effects the touch
 pad, the mouse, or the start screen and nothing seems to fix it. It's a different program each time so I doubt it's a third-party app.

                    <p>Hi, I'm back with another problem..</p>
<p>
</p><p>General Description of problems: </p>
<p>I first noticed problems 3 days ago, on 9/11/14.&nbsp; It started when I noticed my AC adapter was not charging my laptop. Which is a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5868. I went and bought a new one and it worked.&nbsp; The next morning I started my laptop up and when Windows
 loaded, everything seemed slow, or delayed.&nbsp; When I hovered the cursor over something, it took a bit to notice it, or highlight it.
</p>
<p>I decided to run MBAM to see if any problems came up. Well, about 5 minutes into the scan, it froze and stopped.&nbsp; I couldn't do anything, so I powered off and started it back up. Nothing still.&nbsp; I shut down and left it for a while. Last night, I turned it
 on to upload some pictures from my camera,. and same thing happened.</p>
<p>I tried Ctrl,Alt+Del and got a warning box that said: Log on process has failed to create the security option dialog- Failure-Security Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the next error I got was after I went into Safe mode w/ networking and did a C: drive scan, It made me restart, and nothing happened until this popped up:</p>
<p>_________________________________</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Client&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>An error has occurred in the program during initialization&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error Code: 0x800b003</p>
<p>_______________________________ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then noticed that Microsoft Security Essentials was no&nbsp; longer showing up on the tray and then I started getting 5 pop up warnings</p>
<p>1.- Windows SQM consolidator has stopped working</p>
<p>2.- HD Audio Control Panel has stopped working</p>
<p>3.- Windows Sidebar has stopped working</p>
<p>4.- Synaptics Touchpad Enhancements has stopped working</p>
<p>5.- Windows Firewall has stopped working</p>
<p>*All these came up at the same time</p>
<p>-I shut down for the night due to major frustration</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then this morning 9/15/14 I started again, when I turned on my laptop I noticed MSE was down on the tray, and windows seemed to be working, so I thought I'd run another MBAM scan, 10 minutes in, it stopped and I got a BSOD. with STOP: 0x000000F4 (0x00000003,
 0x867cd7cd, 0x867cd9dc, 0x82275c30)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm stuck with what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, I'll love ya forever :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>There are many posts all over the Internet discussing this issue, but there does not seem to be a definitive solution.&nbsp; Some people seem to have had success by cloning the drive to an external hard drive using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image and then
 cloning back again ... but I've also seen posts by people who tried that and ended up with everything gone.&nbsp; Some advise repairing the Master Boot Record, but almost as many say that doing so made their drive unusable.</p>
<p>Here is Dell's response: <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?docid=FA000ACDE3324D22E030030ABD622013&amp;c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If all else fails and you want to try to restore your system to its Fresh-From-Dell state, first take the drive out of the laptop, put it in an external enclosure, and copy all of your important data files.&nbsp; You'll need install media to re-install any applications
 that were not originally bundled with your computer.</p>

    <title>Mouse Cursor shoots to top left corner of screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niteviper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Cursor shoots to top left corner of screen</h2>
                    The error always occures whenever i play games on my PC. Although the game itself runs perfectly fine and windows has no issues with the games themselves the problem occures as soon as i put the game in either Window-Mode or Minimalised to task bar. As
 soon as do this my mouse curser will shoot straight to the top left corner of the screen and if i try to move the curser it wll immediatly&nbsp;recoil straight back to the corner (like its attached to a rubberband to that corner).<br />
Now heres the wierd bit, The otherday i was playing a game and the game itself just minimalised for no reason... but my mouse curser was good to use.. it didnt retract to the corner or anyting. I put the game back into fullscreen mode and tried the Shift-Tab
 to desktop but the curser just went straight back to the top left corner again..<br />
<br />
Ive had this issue before but i cant remember how i solved it on that PC, i hope you can help me.<br />

            Thank you for your advice,<br />
<br />
After doing what you suggested there is no change, no integrity breaches and all drivers 100% uptodate and correct<br />
<br />
still no change<br />
<br />
I have spoken to the game manafacturers who have said this issue can sometimes occure and its been known to be OS errors. They have suggested i format my HDD and reload windows back on as it seems although there is a fault with windows, windows itself has no
 knowledge of it which is why all my efforts are in vein... pfft.<br />
<br />
guess ill just have to format n reload my os until it desides to install properly and correctly after all =((

<h2>            Windows 10 April 2018 Update version 1803&#58; error 0x80242006</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing an issue during the major upgrade installation of April 2018 update on one of my desktop PC @work. I've got the same error during the "Fall Creators Update" six months ago fixed using the the Windows Update download tool executable. Still
 this error happens each time a major update is released and rolled out by MS on this PC using the Windows Update Module. No issue for patch Tuesday patch. We're on build 1709.16299.248 at the moment of writing (I'm referring to the 64bit OS on the stable channel)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code is 0x80242006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've done before:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Running the Windows Update troubleshooter tool (it fixed a couple of minor problem but the issue persist)</p>
<p>2. Renaming the Download folder in the %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution path to force Windows Update to rebuild its package database</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I'm quite sure that running again the Windows Update download tool will start the update correctly but I really don't want to proceed that way.</p>
<p>Feel free to share with me other actions...i can share with you logs and registry keys eventually if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bye</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simone</p>

            Hi  Spulci, honestly 1803 is very, very troublesome to install . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Thanks Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>but I want to fix the error under Windows Update....I understand that downloading the ISO with the Media Creation Tool fixes the issue....but it's a workaround I don't want to try at least for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the antivirus issue, as far as I know is acknowledged using Avast antivirus (for which pcs MS blocked the distribution starting from today while deeply inspecting the issue with Avast). I've got no issues on one of my home pc upgrading it to April 2018
 update with Bitdefender installed.</p>

<h2>            Cortana in the Netherlands in English&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have Windows 8.1 installed in English. I read that Cortana won't be available in the Netherlands yet. But I was wondering: is this only with a Dutch install (choosing Dutch as the language) or is also the case if I use English as the language?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just starting out in the world of Game Design and I think Cortana can be a nice attribution to Game Design. I was hoping to be able to used when Windows 10 comes out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's not possible to have Cortana enabled in an English install, when will it become available in the Netherlands?</p>

            Same here, I have set my region to the United States of America and all features work flawless, on my Nokia Lumia 920, Nokia Lumia 1520, Nokia Lumia 520, Nokia Lumia 530, Microsoft Lumia 535, Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual S.I.M., Microsoft Lumia 532, Microsoft
 Lumia 540, and Nokia Lumia 930 devices I have successfully changed the region to those United States of America and enabled Cortana, the same with the Microsoft Windows Speech Recognition service on several laptops, so you'll be able to run Microsoft Cortana
 by changing your region, I'm also Dutch and all devices listed above got preinstalled as Dutch devices.

<h2>            Controller doesnt recognize mic is in unless i hold it a certain way or unplug and plug it back in a bunch of times</h2>
                    I recently bought a mic off amazon and it has worked flawlessly for about a week. All of the sudden it keeps disconnecting and i have to plug it back in and hold it in a certain way for be to use it. At first, I thought it was my mic but I used another
 one and if I moved the cord too much it would disconnect. It seems to be more of a controller issue and this controller is fairly new (purchased within the last month). Has anyone else had this problem before and how did yall fix it?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having the same issue and I am very frustrated. Out of the blue, I was on facebook and then suddenly the cursor became frozen- moving my fingers along the trackpad scrolls up and down, but the cursor itself does not work. I've been searching forums
 and pushing F5 and going into settings and nothing's working. I don't understand how everything could have been messed up so quickly when I didn't even do anything...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

            <p>11/13/14</p>
<p>I had this exact problem and no amount of downloading drivers or other online solutions seemed to fix the problem. To solve the issue for me, it was actually relatively simple. All I had to do was swipe left on the trackpad
 to bring up the black settings bar on the right hand side, then the mouse instantly begins working again. Give it a try and see if it works for you, too. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>12/24/14</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay guys, so the problem with my first answer was that I was never able to replicate the results again. But I've finally found a solution that, although it may not be completely permanent, it can be repeated and does
 not involve any uninstillations or anything dealing with adding more software or drivers.</p>
<p>So our goal is to do a "Fake" restart.</p>
<p>Has anyone noticed how your mouse works completely fine when you're on the Login screen just after a restart, but a short while after you log on your mouse goes on the fritz?</p>
<p>Try following these directions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Press “Windows Key + W” from the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Type “device Manager” without quotes in the search box and hit enter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Expand the arrow for "Mice and other pointing devices", Then click on "Synaptics PS/2 Port TouchPad"</p>
<p>
</p><p>****(It actually doesn't matter which section you click on, all we really need is to expand into the system far enough that whenever you try restarting the computer, the system has second thoughts, allowing us enough
 time to cancel the restart and regain functioning of the mouse)****&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Next, click on the Driver tab, Then select "Driver Details"</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Now, without exiting out of any of the windows you just opened, restart your computer. (If you're using a USB mouse, right click on the windows button in the bottom left of your screen, click "Shut Down or Sign Out",
 then click restart. If you're using a Touch Screen, Long-hold the windows button, &amp; do the exact same thing.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. When it begins to restart, it will begin shutting down all of your windows and the screen will come up visually showing that it is restarting. It will then, display a message saying that you have a window open and
 it will not restart without your permission. Abruptly click CANCEL so that restart does not actually occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully you've now regained control of your mouse and have one less problem to worry about. If this didn't turn out to work for you, I'm really sorry. I hope that someone else can find a solution.</p>
<p>Have a great day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>...Also, I'm using a Windows 8 Toshiba Satellite C55t-A5222, but hopefully it will still work on most computers...</p>

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
StartUp Repair often works from a Windows 7 Installation Disk or Windows 7 Repair Disk
<br />
when it&nbsp;does not from Recovery or a Recovery Disk. If needed how to make a Windows 7<br />
Repair Disk is below. A Repair Disk can be made on any computer with a CD burner running
<br />
XP, Vista, or Window 7 as it uses no files from the Host computer.<br />
<br />
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

<p>Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Windows 7 disk<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Do not worry, will assist you with the&nbsp;issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The common reason for this error is the update download getting corrupt. <br />
<br />
Step 1. Disable Third party Antivirus within the Anti-Virus Menu. <br />
<br />
Step 2. Disable Third Party Programs&nbsp;in Windows 8 - Task Manager. <br />
<br />
Step 3. Reboot PC.<br />
<br />
Step 4. Run the Windows Update Reset Components in Admin Mode - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><br />
Step 5. Reboot PC.<br />
<br />
Step 6. Open Command Prompt as admin &amp; type this command "wuauclt.exe /updatenow"

<p>For me, what I needed to do to re-enable it was enable User Account Control.</p>
<p>You can search this in the search bar, or through control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, when UAC was off, the battery icon would disappear, and I wouldn't be able to launch Microsoft Edge, Groove Music, all the built in features.</p>
