<h2>            Windows 10 Update repeatedly offers the same update</h2>
                    <p>I'm attempting to get my new laptop updated with Windows 10 x64 PRO. When I run the update I'm now in a loop where the same update is being offered, e.g.&nbsp;2018-01 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4058258)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the control panel &gt; Programs and Features, uninstalled the update, applied the update, rebooted the PC, ran windows update and still it offers the same update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I've noticed that after an update has been installed in the Windows Update window it states it "Awaiting restart", your device is scheduled to restart outside of active hours. (Active hours are 0800-1700) This has been going on at least the last four
 hours and it is now 0400 hours. Thus I'm well outside the active hours.</p>

<p>Much thanks for the FB, but I'm going in circles on this. I think I correctly followed the instructions and then I looked at the history. Somewhere during the process I turned off windows auto update, I was thinking that this was creating an issue for me
 and resulting in failure. Following is more info, hopefully, I have described everything correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following image shows the currently installed updates, note that&nbsp;<span>KB4058258 is not listed because I uninstalled it. This is as expected.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7128457b-fc1f-438c-b7b3-97aa05ee70e2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7128457b-fc1f-438c-b7b3-97aa05ee70e2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Now I looked at Settings &gt; Update history and I&nbsp;see several possible errors and I know not what to do.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>KB4058258 is still listed and requires a restart. I've restarted the PC several times but this never changes. I do have a copy for a manual install.</span></li><li><span>A bit further down KB4056887 also requires a restart, again the PC has been restarted several times, this never changes. I'm not able to download for a manual install.</span></li><li><span>The next entry KB4058043 also requires a restart, again the PC has been restarted several times, this never changes. I'm not able to download for a manual install.</span></li><li><span>The last entry KB4041994 failed, this never changes, I'm not able to download for a manual install.</span></li></ol>

            I no&nbsp;longer have the problem only because I gave up on the system. I had another issue which was a hardware issue and it took much too much to convince&nbsp;Lenovo. They finally agreed and offered to send it in for repair but I decided to return it for a refund
 and purchase another brand.

                    <p>Good morning/afternoon/evening all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop decides to give me the BSOD every now and then but now it's getting frequent and I seriously need my laptop to be functioning properly. Every time &nbsp;it gives me BSOD, it says, kernel_data_inpage_error.</p>
<p>Below is a picture of what it says after my laptop has turned on again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much. Hope to hear from you all!</p>

            <p>Hey Cris</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Blue Screen Error Message 'kernel_data_inpage_error' means that kernal data from your page file could not be loaded into memory properly. This commonly indicates a problem with your Hard Drive. To check the state of your HD open up command prompt by
 clicking Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;Command Prompt. Once open supply the Command Prompt with the following statement without the quotes and press enter:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"CHKDSK /R"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps-Robin<br />

            <p>You likely have issues at your DISK or your RAM level. Get both checked out. </p>

<p>To be able to troubleshoot what might be causing your system to crash, we need the dump files. In an ideal situation, more than one file would be needed to establish a pattern so, if you do have more than one (preferrably, nothing over a month old), please
 upload them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please refer to the link below for steps to retrieve, zip and upload them to the file sharing site like onedrive, google's "dropbox, etc.</p>

<p>As you can see below, you system lists a few problem devices mostly related to bluetooth functions but i think the most pressing underlying issue, is the presence of elements of
<strong>AVAST </strong>and <strong>OcpHelper.exe, </strong>which is an executable belonging to
<strong>McAFee online child protection.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The presence of both is likely causing a serious conflict, as evidenced by the number of errors being generated by
<strong>OcpHelper.exe </strong>(McAfee), in your WER file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see for yourself by exporting a copy of your msinfo32 file to your desktop and viewing it that way, but here is one entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time&nbsp;Type&nbsp;Details&nbsp;<br />
<strong>13/12/2014 15:38&nbsp;</strong>Application Error&nbsp;Faulting application name: <strong>

<p>
</p><p>Now, if you are going to run an Antivirus program, coupled with a online child protection program of a different product, you are going to have to find two that work well together, and therein lies the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you <strong>uninstall both AVAST and McAFee </strong><strong>online child protection</strong>, program and turn on
<strong>Windows defender</strong>.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

<p><span>Hello Paolone67</span></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to determine which key is the Control Panel icon then you can always try Reinstalling Vista.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You will need to have a copy of your Vista CD and your product key available.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You will also want to make sure that you have all of your personal data back up as well having all of the media for software that you have install on the machine along with their respective security keys.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am providing you a link for a Microsoft Help article that explains the process so read it thoroughly before deciding to take this step.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here is the link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/e77344fa-e978-464c-953e-eba44f0522671033.mspx#section_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/e77344fa-e978-464c-953e-eba44f0522671033.mspx#section_3</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Since I don’t have that program installed I can’t tell you the exact location. However, I believe you can find it under one of the keys located under</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID
</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Error message&#58; Age of empires II expansion &#34;Conquerors&#34; has stopped working, Windows is checking for solution to the problem.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Why does "Age of empires II" expansion "Conquerors" not work when "Age of Empires II, Age of Kings" does work??? weird...</p>
<p>Ok, let me just start off i have both disks! I did not download off internet so the files should be all good! I bought the double disk set from&nbsp;Walmart&nbsp;, for real cheap, less then $10. Was a cool find, i used to play the game when i was growing up but lost
 my old disks, i was pumped!&nbsp; </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>well when i got home and installed the games i discovered that this was going to be tough getting this old game to work with my brand new Alienware M17X R3&nbsp;laptop. I have tried a lot of different things because there seems to be a lot of different answers
 on the&nbsp;forums online. still no&nbsp;success. i can fix the color issue with "Age of Kings" by ending the process "explorer.exe" with task manager or a batch file, but when i start up "Conquerors" it crashes after loading screen on start up (no matter what i have
 tried). I get a black screen as if its about to play the opening movie but after a couple of sec's it crashes and i get a message that says :</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; <b><i>Age of empires II expansion has stopped working&nbsp;</i></b></div>
<div><b><i>Windows is checking for solution to the problem...</i></b></div>
<div><b><i><br />
</i></b></div>
<div>eventually windows just tells me something like;<i> there is nothing it can do and will&nbsp;notify&nbsp;me if it finds a solution....... &nbsp;;(</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>Really hoping someone can shed some light on this! here is a list of things i have tried;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- tried a couple different&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;modes</div>
<div>-256 colors</div>
<div>-Disabled visual themes</div>
<div>-checked : run this program as an administrator&nbsp;</div>
<div>-drivers are up to date</div>
<div>-downloaded patch 2.0a</div>
<div>-uninstalled and&nbsp;re-installed&nbsp;</div>
<div>-tried both typical or minimum install options and full install option</div>
<div>-ending explorer.exe&nbsp;</div>
<div>-different resolutions&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>Please help !</u></b></div>
<div><b><u><br />
</u></b></div>
<div>Love the game &amp; it should play&nbsp;Awesome&nbsp;on this laptop with no problems.&nbsp;</div>

            I have done all of this already ! Theses articles &nbsp;I have seen before. I listed all the things I have tried which are all the things this article tells you to do. Makes no difference. Black screen and crash no matter what I try! Drivers are updated. Reinstalled
 3 times. different users, safe mode, compatibility. both of those articles are old and the links in the articles don't work! There is no reason why this game shouldn't work on this pc . Windows 7 &nbsp;can't handle old software? Maybe I should use a different OS
 .&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>There has to be some age of empires geek out there that can tell me what to do to get this game to work!</div>

            <p>Hello. I had both AOE II AOK and the Conquers expansion recently installed on my older Vista SP2 HP G60 labtop (so couldn't update to windows 7/8) and both games worked well. I sometimes had strange color issues but were solved by just alt-tab out and back
 again, no big deal. But after all the Sept 2015 updates that got installed by windows update, and now the games both no longer start up. Here are all the updates that I got.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33934cb6-ed89-49ab-8f76-bf5fd4460e75" /></p>
<p>Now, when the game's desktop icons are clicked the splash screens or pre game videos dont even load up, but I get the message "Age of empires II has stopped working". I have searched all over the net and looked at all the proposed solutions for color issues,
 etc, and nothing works. Strange that my games worked just fine, after all these years until this month. Is there anyone else using Vista that is having the issue of AOE II games no longer even loading up???</p>

Hey guys, I was connected remotely with a MS Tech to try and solve the problem this morning and there was no success, unless I had my recovery disks which I do not. I was this morning able to manually send an error report, as my Vista no longer does that automatically.
 I assume you guys have Windows 7 or better so were you guys able to send error reports? Thats the only way this will get fixed I imagine. Uninstalling updates will not fix it apparently.&nbsp;Only other thing is if someone re patches the games. I am sure the more
 people that complain and send error reports something should get done. Squeeky wheels get the grease.

            I'm running Vista also. &nbsp;The message says that "Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available". &nbsp;I assume they're getting the message. &nbsp;Incidentally, I also get the same message on my other computer, which ran the same update,

            <p>Hi,<br />
1) Have you made any changes prior to start of this issue?<br />
2) Do you receive any error message/code?<br />
3) What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
4) Did unknown devices started showing up recently?</p>
<p>Let’s try to uninstall and re-install the most updated drivers for your network adapter. To do that click on start, in the instant search window type in devmgmt.msc. This should bring up the device manager. Right click on the network adapter listed below
 click on uninstall. Now go to your computer manufacturer’s website and download the latest drivers for your network adapter and install them.</p>

            Hello, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />You could use this fix from the tenforum to reset &amp; re-register Spotlight: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset-re-register-windows-spotlight-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset...</a>
<br />There’s a bug with Spotlight since the Fall update, if you choose ‘not a fan’ it resets the background to the default photo so you have to run this fix again.
<br />If this doesn’t work then try an in-place upgrade repair:

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Are you using Advanced System Care, Tune-Up Utilities, or similar System Optimizers or Registry
<br />
Cleaners? If so uninstall those which will only cause you problems while fixing nothing. Many of
<br />
us consider those to be no better than snake-oil. You are much better off coming here or other
<br />
technical sites to learn to correct system problems. Some Auslogics programs also use that&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
filename.<br />
<br />
Find the file - Right Click on it - Properties - Details tab - is there any information to its origin there?<br />
Does the folder the file is in help determine its origin? That file has been know to be malware.<br />
<br />
ThreatExpert - 360tray.exe<br />
<a href="http://www.threatexpert.com/files/360tray.exe.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.threatexpert.com/files/360tray.exe.html</a><br />
<br />
Scan it with your antivirus and antispware programs.<br />
<br />
Upload it to these sites which will use multiple programs to check the file.<br />

<br />
================================<br />
<br />
<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as
<br />
the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />

I wrote a very small vb4 routine that my system runs every morning that changes the name of a file to a dated name just before I get an update from an external site. e.g.: account.txt gets renamed to acct_02-08-10.txt and balance.txt to bal_02-08-10.txt, etc.<br />
Unfortunately, this fails when running under Windows 7 with a vb40032.dll error which I cannot seem to fix.
<br />
Is there another way to do this function that is easy and readily accessible?<br />
I appreciate any assistance that any of you can give me on this issue.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Craig from Austin

<p>Try placing your vb40032.dll in the same folder that your VB 4.0 application is in. I don't know why this works, but it I discovered this in cunjunction with my mother, accidentally. It worked for us.</p>
<p>Anyone... Please let me know if this has been helpful.</p>

<h3> xcmxrawx  say:</h3>
<h2>            problem with halo 4&#58; cannot connect to friends games, i appear as a level 1 when i&#38;&#35;39&#59;m level 20 and can only use level 1 classes</h2>
                    
<p><span>it says "The Halo 4 servers are not available. Please try again later. Matchmaking has switched to using the default playlist". When i do connect to a game, i loose connection again after it. I'm level 20 but it says I'm level 1, my armor doesn't appear
 in matchmaking, and neither do my classes. I cannot join any friend's games. My dashboard is now slow to load and even if i am connected to xbox live it sometimes wont show me the market place. My NAT type is "open" and when i test my xbox live connection
 it connects to the modem but not the internet. However when i plugged the xbox in via the cable to the modem it worked but this is inconvenient for me. please help?</span></p>

<p>As Hassassinade has previously stated on another thread like this before;</p>
<p>"<span>There have been some matchmaking issues with the game that 343i is looking into. You'll need to be patient as the game just came out.</span><br />
<br />
<span>As far as you not being able to connect to friends, can you actually invite these friends into a party chat that your having an issue with and does that option work?</span><br />
<br />
<span>The rank issue is not something we can personally help you with as that would be something the developer would need to address.

<p>If you're having trouble with wireless I suggest you follow this guide;</p>
<p><span>Getting the Wireless Network Adapter to connect to a wireless network is a relatively painless process. We’ll walk you through the process of physically connecting the adapter and configuring the Xbox 360 to recognize and connect to your wireless network.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>1. Align the tabs on the Wireless Network Adapter with the slots on the back of the Xbox 360 and snap the Wireless Network Adapter in place. If you need to remove the adapter, press the button on the side of the adapter (nearest the LED) and remove.</span><br />
<br />
<span>2. Connect the USB cable to the nearby USB port on the back of the system, rotate the antenna so it points straight up, and turn on the Xbox 360.</span><br />
<br />
<span>3. If you have a game disc in the drive, press the Guide button and press Y to enter the Xbox 360 Dashboard. Check the LED on the Wireless Network Adapter. A steady red LED indicates the Wireless Network Adapter is on but not connected to a network. A
 blinking red LED indicates a hardware problem, so try unplugging the USB cable and plugging it back in. If that doesn’t solve the problem, perhaps you’re having trouble with your Wireless Network Adapter or your Xbox 360’s USB port. On the other hand, if the
 LED isn’t even on, make sure you’ve properly plugged the adapter’s USB cable into the Xbox 360’s USB port. If you don’t have any wireless security in place, the adapter may automatically connect to your wireless network. When the adapter is connected to a
 network, the LED appears green.</span><br />
<br />
<span>4. To configure the adapter’s security settings, select the System tab in the Xbox 360 Dashboard. Select Network Settings, followed by Edit Network Settings.</span><br />
<br />
<span>5. Select Wireless Mode and then select your wireless network from the list. If your wireless network doesn’t appear here, select Specify Unlisted Network.</span><br />
<br />
<span>6. If you select Specify Unlisted Network, enter the network’s SSID (Service Set Identifier; sometimes referred to as Network Name). Consult your wireless router’s manual for more information about how to log in to your router.</span><br />
<br />
<span>7. Select the type of security your wireless network uses. Your options include WEP (64-bit key), WEP (128-bit key), WPA Passphrase, WPA2, or No Security. Next, provide the proper key or passphrase. If you don’t know this information, you can usually
 find it in your wireless router’s setup utility. Again, consult you router’s documentation for more information about logging in to the router’s setup utility.</span><br />
<br />
<span>8. Select the Test Network setting. All options should pass, and the LED on the Wireless Network Adapter should be green to indicate that it has established a network connection. Your Xbox 360 should now connect to the network each time you turn on your
 Xbox 360.</span></p>

<p>I can connect to the internet via the wireless adapter, that part is fine however it seems to be the cause with the problems on Halo. When I did it by the ethernet cable into the modem these problems where resolved on halo. So i plugged my Wireless Network
 Adapter back in and I had the original problems stated in the description?</p>

<p>Hi xCMxRAWx,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a faster experience navigating the dashboard, let's see if <a href="http://xbx.lv/mWsFJy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing the cache</a> and <a href="http://xbx.lv/RcvrGT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">redownloading your profile</a> are steps that can help.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for the connection issues, were you able to run a Xbox LIVE Connection Test and see if you notice any warnings about a strict or moderate NAT while on a wireless connection? It is also to have your friends try this that you are trying to connect to.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any of you do notice a NAT warning, let's see if opening <a href="http://xbx.lv/LVEport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
these ports</a> on your router is able to help keep you connected to your friends. Let us know if this helps. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Riven &#40;32 bit installation&#41; on Windows 10 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Riven &#40;32 bit installation&#41; on Windows 10 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really hoping someone in the community is up to the challenge.</p>
<p>I would really love to install my copy of Riven on the brand spanking new Windows 10.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge:</strong><em> Installing a 32 bit game on a 64 bit system.</em>
</p>
<p>Riven is a 32 bit installation file. When I attempt to run the file, the error
</p>
<p>"This app can't run on your PC. To find a version for your PC, check with the software provider."</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The complication:</strong> <em>Not buying another copy...</em></p>
<p>I don't particularly want to buy another copy of a game I already own.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The question:</strong> <em>Is it even possible to run a 32 bit installer on a 64 bit operating system?
</em></p>
<p>Harder still, is it possible for a straight forward (maybe even quick) fix, to get this right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any and all help offered on this one. Thanks in advance!!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Mighty,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I will definitely assist you. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you install Windows 32 bit app on 64 bit, you will be able to run 32 bits apps without any problem, because 64 bits can emulate 32 bits. Windows 32 bit can emulate only 32 bit. So, I would suggest you to contact game support team for further assistance
 they may have solution for this issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Not really. I only have Myst III, and games earlier than 2000 (Riven is '97) often have issues that can be fixed,
</p>
<p>but you may need to visit a Myst/Riven specific , or Cyan Worlds forums to find out what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Fan sites often have fixes, patches, etc. for these 'vintage' games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The original disk based version is more likely to require fixes than if you download an updated version</p>
<p>from GOG or other download site. </p>
<p>The vast majority of games that ran on Win7 will run on Win10. I've had to stuff around with a few again afterupgrading to Win10, but they came good again.</p>
<p>- GOG list Win7/8 as compatible with Riven, so Win10 should be OK as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can probably pick the game up when a sale is on for as little a&nbsp;&nbsp; $2-3USD.</p>

<p>
</p><p>(I just read <em>Bad Whipet's</em> review at the bottom of the main page above. Looks like the disk based version of</p>
<p>this game always has had an issue with 64bit Windows. 64bit XP too, probably.&nbsp; It seems even the download</p>
<p>version may still need some tweaking though. )</p>

            <p>1. Not EVERY 32 bit program can be run in 64 bit.</p>
<p>2. This game is no longer being produced, so good luck.</p>
<p>3. Compatibility Mode doesn't work with it.</p>
<p>4. The saddest part is, most of the community knows more about these computers than all of you "Support Engineers."</p>

</p><p>You can transfer your data and SOME settings by using the windows easy transfer wizard.&nbsp; You will have to install all the apps/programs and frankly I have not been impressed with the results of WET.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You really cant "transfer everything" because of the difference in architecture (32bit vs 64) and hardware (Dell vs Samsung).&nbsp; While re-installing can be a PITA it gives you the cleanest OS with the least difficulties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were you I would update the win 8 to win 10 then do a clean install to get rid of the bloatware, etc.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update causes my programs to spontaneously disappear and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickconnelly1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update causes my programs to spontaneously disappear and re-appear</h2>
                    <p>I don't even know how to explain this succinctly, so here goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was getting bogged down, so I rebooted.&nbsp; Suddenly, I get the ol' "Hold on while we get things ready".&nbsp; There was no indication that I was going to be updating, but I figured I'd let it go.&nbsp; When it came back, my computer was updated to the most
 recent version of Windows, with the revised Start menu and all that.&nbsp; Also, all of my programs were missing.&nbsp; Every single program.&nbsp; It was like a brand new installation of Windows.&nbsp; Fortunately, I keep my data on different drives, otherwise, I would have
 really been losing my mind.&nbsp; However, I also noted that it wouldn't recognize or mount my external drives, and seemed sluggish to populate the explorer with the contents of my internal drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing a system restore, but got an error message.&nbsp; So, aggravated, but needing to get things done, I began the laborious process of re-installing all my software.&nbsp; During one of these installations, I rebooted again.&nbsp; When it came back up, my computer
 was reset to the original settings, as if nothing had ever happened. All my software was there, all my settings, even my background wallpaper was all unchanged and the way it was supposed to be.&nbsp; So, happy day, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I rebooted again.&nbsp; Once again, Windows tried updating, and when it came back up, I was back to the "new" installation, and the only programs that were on there were the ones I had managed to get installed earlier.&nbsp; So, I thought I'd see what happened
 if I rebooted again.&nbsp; This time, it went back to the way it's supposed to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought maybe it was creating a new user account and somehow logging me into that, but according to the login page, it's all one account.&nbsp; The one thing that is different is that if the login screen asks me for a password, I know everything will be fine.&nbsp;
 But if it asks for a PIN, I know it's going to be the "new" installation missing all the software.&nbsp; Weirdly, if I choose to switch the login method from PIN to password at that screen, I get a message saying "incorrect password."</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of all this, I noticed that where I used to have separate user and admin accounts, I now have only one user account that is also the admin.&nbsp; Which doesn't bother me, I just wonder why it changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the faintest idea what would cause this, but it's really messing with my productivity.</p>

    <title>How best to get 150 GB uploaded to OneDrive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roninrr2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How best to get 150 GB uploaded to OneDrive.</h2>
                    <p>I recently came to the conclusion that I should be (need) to back up my Pictures folder (massive 150 GB, 55K files, 3K folders to OneDrive for archival purposes.&nbsp; I don't need these files monitored by OneDrive (don't know if that is a big deal or not) -
 but just want to have the files backed up somewhere (tired to copying them to multiple jump drives).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a smaller 200 GB SSD (mostly used by Windows and my Documents folders) and a 2 TB HD that has all of my Pictures stored on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, what would be the best approach to get them uploaded.&nbsp; I haven't had good luck uploading massive files before because for whatever reason, the upload never finishes and there doesn't seem to be any recovery or way to continue without starting all
 over (does OneDrive upload support this and I don't understand how it works).&nbsp; I am not placing the files in my OneDrive folder on the C: drive (which I think would work)&nbsp;because there isn't room and I don't know how to configure a 2nd HD access for OneDrive
 or a way to have OneDrive continue when its upload is interrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way, or the best way, to do this without having to manually break the Picture folders up into smaller chunks and upload them piece by piece.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below to upload files and Pics into OneDrive:
<br />
<br />1. On the OneDrive website <a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com</a> sign in with your Microsoft account, and then browse to the location where you want to add the files.
<br />
<br />2. Select Upload.
<br />
<br />3. Select the files you want to upload, and then select Open.
<br />
<br />In the link below, explain step by step:
<br />

<br /> 
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.

            Hi  roninrr2 
<br />
<br />What I suggest you do is upload them in sets over a period of time. Thats a lot of images and its likely a one time upload might fail.
<br />
<br />Also, I would not upload them through <a href="http://www.onedrive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.onedrive.com</a> 
<br />
<br />Browsers crash and it makes it difficult to pick up from where you left off. 
<br />
<br />What you should do instead is drag and drop 5 GBs into the OneDrive folder in File Explorer, let it upload each set.
<br />
<br />After you have successfully moved over each, you can enable OneDrive on demand, so you access only the photos you want when you need them.

<p>I was in exactly your position not long ago - 155GB of photos that I wanted to upload to OneDrive for archiving and to share with family and friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are/I was up against two limitations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Most ISPs limit upload speed to just a fraction of download speed.</p>
<p>2) OneDrive itself will place a limit on upload speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, a single upload of 155 - 200 GB might take several days to complete. But even if you were willing to wait it out, the internet is not robust enough to complete a single upload that large. (At least, not without a dedicated connection end-to-end.) Its
 almost a certainty that the upload will disconnect along the way and you'll have to figure out exactly where the connection dropped and then start over from that point. OneDrive itself may stop your upload somewhere along the way, because consumers don't commonly
 upload that much at one time. If you have OneDrive for Business that may not be the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uploaded 4 or 5 GB at a time over several weeks. You might consider other cloud storage services, but unless you have a business plan with the service and with your ISP, you're likely to have the same experience.</p>

<p>Diego-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am familiar with that technique.&nbsp; My wife has a OneDrive account on an "old" laptop that we are getting rid of.&nbsp; Long story, but what I wanted to do was move her OneDrive folders from her old laptop OneDrive to "my" OneDrive - but the MS Flow procedure&nbsp;(OneDrive-to-another-OneDrive)&nbsp;that
 MS provides only supports Files.&nbsp; [The "old" laptop is broken by the way, but the files in OneDrive are still there and good.]&nbsp; So I downloaded her Documents folder down to her current laptop (24.2 GB Documents folder, and that went fine), but could not get
 the 24.2 GB to upload in one upload without problems - so I had to break the 24.2 GB into smaller pieces and upload it over several days.&nbsp; So yes, I can do that, but it is a lot of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andre &amp; S_and_S-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I agree with what you said and suspected that was probably the best way to get the files up to my OneDrive account (it being 1 TB because I have an Office 365 subscription.&nbsp; The advantage I see with this approach is that if I place pieces of my Pictures
 folder in the OneDrive folder on my computer, OneDrive will take care of uploading the files correctly (eventually), fighting through any internet availability problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let me ask a couple of questions about the files once I get them into OneDrive.&nbsp; From the procedure I went through and described to Diego above, I uploaded all of the Documents folder into a separate folder in my OneDrive account and marked the folder
 as "Not Synced" -- because these were old files I just wanted to archive and keep them, you know, in case I ever needed them for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am in sort-of the same situation with the Pictures.&nbsp; If I end up uploading the entire 150GB successfully and mark them as "On Demand" files, for that to work, I have to leave the entire Pictures folder in my OneDrive folder, on the C: SSD in my laptop
 for this to work, don't I.&nbsp; [BY THE WAY, WHERE OR HOW DO I MARK THE FILES AS "ON-DEMAND".]</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as in the case of the Documents folder(s) from the old laptop, I envisioned to just archive the Pictures in my OneDrive, mark them as "Not Synced" and leave them alone (i.e. purely for backup) because I still have immediate access to all of the pictures
 because I have them all on my 2 TB HD in my laptop.&nbsp; Is there anything wrong with that approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as a matter of operation, as I accumulate new pictures or modify pictures (Photoshop Elements), I do it all on the C: SSD and do it with a small Pictures folder in the C: SSD - and as/when I am finished with them, I copy them over to the 2 TB HD on my
 laptop.&nbsp; Just mentioning this as to how I handle my Pictures in my course of operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And let me ask one last question that I forgot about above.&nbsp; You can't have two OneDrive folders in your computer (i.e. on C: and D: drives) simultaneously Synced to OneDrive, can you -- because you can tell from my above questions and comments that I didn't
 think that was possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response and sorry for my long reply.</p>

<p>I was in a similar situation.&nbsp; This method worked for me but the caveat is you need sufficient hard drive space.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Setup the files/folders in a folder (not onedrive) lets call it temp for uploading.&nbsp; Break them into groups of files that make sense and you can work with easily.&nbsp; Setup a second folder, lets call that completed uploads</li><li>Setup the onedrive client to sync the local onedrive folder to the cloud</li><li>Copy a small group of the files from the temp folder into the onedrive folder</li><li>Monitor onedrive it should upload over time in the background</li><li>Once uploaded move the completed files from the temp folder into the completed folder</li><li>Repeat these steps</li><li>Once everything has gradually moved into onedrive delete the temp and completed folders that are local on your hard drive, leaving the migrated files in the onedrive folder (and synced).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on your network and internet connection speeds this can take a while but is a method you can just leave doing its thing.</p>

<p>OK, Mark, that sounds like what I need to do.&nbsp; I have a couple of questions though:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;I have read "a lot" of OneDrive documentation and I am still trying to figure out the synchronization business between the OneDrive in the cloud and the OneDrive folder in my PC.&nbsp; A "lot" of the documentation just says "OneDrive" and often it is unclear
 if it is referring to the real OneDrive in the cloud or the OneDrive folder on my PC.&nbsp; Is there some sort of default understanding that I have missed somewhere - i.e. which OneDrive are they referring to when they just say "OneDrive", standing alone by itself
 in a sentence.&nbsp; This is just a comment, but could use some help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; I see that you you can turn ON the "Files On-Demand" in the OneDrive Setting, but I don't see anything else about marking the files as online only or locally available.&nbsp; Does all of that stuff have to be handled in File Explorer, based on the little
 cloud icons that appear on the files and folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp; If I delete a "locally available" file in my PC, I think that I understand that is is still up there on my OneDrive in the cloud.&nbsp; But If the file disappears from the OneDrive folder in my PC, how do I get the file back.&nbsp; Do I have to go to my OneDrive
 cloud and find the file and then download it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; I understand that if you delete and "online only" file, It is removed from your PC (to recycle bin), but also from the OneDrive cloud and also from any other device (i.e. another PC) that had that file on their PC.&nbsp; Also, moving the file "out" of the
 OneDrive PC folder is the same as deleting it from all of the OneDrive(s) (OneDrive cloud or any other devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5)&nbsp; On-Demand files are still synced, aren't they?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6)&nbsp; And it looks like if I access (get, use) an On-Demand online only file, it becomes locally available (temporarily?) and stays locally available until I re-mark it as "free up space" - is that right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7)&nbsp; What happens if I run out of space (Yes, I know, that is another problem), but if that was the case, would the temporarily locally available file revert back to an online only On-Demand file?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, probably enough questions for now.&nbsp; As you can probably tell, I am rather paranoid regarding losing files, either by my own hand (me deleting an online file, it is gone, isn't it, except for the recycle bin) or maybe deleting an online file in the OneDrive
 cloud (but that doesn't disappear on my PC, does it).</p>

<h2>            Automated Startup Repair fails. Cannot find OS Loader.</h2>
                    On installation of 'Windows 7', after installing needed drivers, some of which were designed for XP or Vista, on a Toshiba Portege M200 (Tablet PC from 2003) and Windows 7 automatically downloading and installing updates:<br />
<br />
Windows 7 can't boot.<br />
<br />
It goes directly to the Automated System Recovery and no matter which option I choose it fails to fix the problem.
<br />
<br />
1. Sometimes it says it did fix the problem and didn't.<br />
2. Sometimes it says it failed to fixed the problem and in those cases the Diagnosis and Repair details says as:<br />
<br />
Root cause found:<br />
Boot manager failed to find OS loader.<br />
<br />
Repair action: File Repair<br />
Result: Failed. Error code = 0x490<br />
Time Taken = 4767 ms<br />

What is the cause of this? And how do I fix it?<br />

<p>I had the same problem on one of our laptops. &nbsp;This has 2GB of memory so it appears to be related to that and Windows updates. &nbsp;I did the following from the following Microsoft article which resolved the issue for me&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392/en-gb</a>.</p>
<p><span>To run the Bootrec.exe tool, you must start Windows RE. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Put the Windows Vista or Windows 7 installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.</li><li>Press a key when you are prompted. </li><li>Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or an input method, and then click<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Repair your computer</strong>. </li><li>Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>In the&nbsp;<strong>System Recovery Options</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>Bootrec.exe</span>, and then press ENTER. </li></ol>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;To start the computer from the Windows Vista or Windows 7 DVD, the computer must be configured to start from the DVD drive. For more information about how to configure the computer to start from the DVD drive, see the documentation
 that is included with the computer or contact the computer manufacturer.
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392/en-gb#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fpublic%2fen-us%2fuparrow.gif" />Back to the top</a></div>
Bootrec.exe options
The Bootrec.exe tool supports the following options. Use the option that is appropriate for your situation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note&nbsp;</strong>If rebuilding the BCD does not resolve the startup issue, you can export and delete the BCD, and then run this option again. By doing this, you make sure that the BCD is completely rebuilt. To do this, type the following commands
 at the Windows RE command prompt:
<ul>
<li><span>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup</span> </li><li><span>c:</span> </li><li><span>cd boot</span> </li><li><span>attrib bcd -s -h -r</span> </li><li><span>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</span> </li><li><span>bootrec /RebuildBcd</span> </li></ul>
/FixMbr
The&nbsp;<strong>/FixMbr</strong>&nbsp;option writes a Windows 7 or Windows Vista-compatible MBR to the system partition. This option does not overwrite the existing partition table. Use this option when you must resolve MBR corruption issues, or when you have
 to remove non-standard code from the MBR.
/FixBoot
The&nbsp;<strong>/FixBoot</strong>&nbsp;option writes a new boot sector to the system partition by using a boot sector that is compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7. Use this option if one of the following conditions is true:
<ul>
<li>The boot sector has been replaced with a non-standard Windows Vista or Windows 7 boot sector.</li><li>The boot sector is damaged. </li><li>An earlier Windows operating system has been installed after Windows Vista or Windows 7 was installed. In this scenario, the computer starts by using Windows NT Loader (NTLDR) instead of Windows Boot Manager (Bootmgr.exe).</li></ul>
/ScanOs
The&nbsp;<strong>/ScanOs</strong>&nbsp;option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7. Additionally, this option displays the entries that are currently not in the BCD store. Use this option when there are Windows
 Vista or Windows 7 installations that the Boot Manager menu does not list.
/RebuildBcd
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>/RebuildBcd</strong>&nbsp;option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7. Additionally, this option lets you select the installations that you want to add to the BCD store. Use this option when
 you must completely rebuild the BCD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After following the above i then ran the following from command prompt:</span></p>
<p><span>bootrec /fixmbr</span></p>
<p><span>then</span></p>
<p><span>bootrec /fixboot</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This resolved the issue for me and allowed me to log on to the PC in its previous working state. &nbsp;Great stuff.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this&nbsp;works&nbsp;for you!</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your effort.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely you can download it doesn’t make any difference. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also install the wireless keyboard drivers/software in compatibility mode and check if it works for you. This is to check if this is caused due to any driver/software compatibility issues.
<br />
•&nbsp;Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘Properties’.<br />
•&nbsp;Click on the ‘Compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue
 persists. </p>

<h2>            skype not allowing me to connect &#40;says no internet connection when there is one&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have just got a new router from Orange, and since then I can't seem to access Skype- the error message says there is no internet connection where there clearly is one, and the version of Skype is recent, no changes have been made to the account, all else
 is working fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to use Skype so what do I have to do to get it working? And no, the firewall is not suddenly blocking skype, there's no need to download another version of Skype, there's something else wrong, most likely the problem appears to be to do with with
 the new Orange hub (and my windows firewall already allows the alternative ports to be used, 80 and 443).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise? Thanks.</p>
