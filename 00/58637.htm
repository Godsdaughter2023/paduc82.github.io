<h2>            Team Forerunner Now Supports ALL Halo Games &#40;Halo 3, Halo Wars, Halo Reach etc.&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won't post a long forum, so this will be very short since most of you know what our clan is like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back and played Halo 3 and&nbsp;Halo Wars, and I loved playing every minuite of those games. Don't get me wrong, I love Halo Reach, but I wanted to get back to the other Halos that made Xbox so much fun. So now Team Forerunner will play any Halo of your
 choice. . .Halo: Combat Evolved (PC), Halo 2 (PC), Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo Wars and finally Halo Reach. We will also expand to the upcoming Halo: Combat Evolved Remake and Halo 4.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining, send me a message and I will get back with you asap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Combat Flight Simulator 3</h2>
                    I am not able to run microsoft combat flight simulator 3.<br />
I have recently purchased a new computer running windows 7.<br />
I have tried running the compatibility program.&nbsp; When I have done so, I get the error statement - -Font OCRB isn't found using "Arial" instead.&nbsp; The game apparently begins running but I can not see it.

<p>Hey mvpq,<br />
<br />
Please verify the system requirement for the game from the link below.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/pc/combatfs3.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/games/pc/combatfs3.aspx</strong></a><br />
<br />
As we can see that the supported operating systems are Microsoft® Windows® 98/Me/2000/XP, hence you could be facing compatibility issues.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, try this method below that has helped many users in getting the game to play in Windows 7. Please try the same and see you get successful in playing the game.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Copy CFS3.exe from the game location for example: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Combat Flight Simulator 3<br />
2.&nbsp;Paste it to any location.<br />
3.&nbsp;Rename the file, copy and paste it to the original location C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Combat Flight Simulator 3<br />
4.&nbsp;Right-Click on the new file which was recently moved and select “Send to Desktop (Create Shortcut). This creates a new shortcut on the Desktop<br />
5.&nbsp;Go to desktop and change the compatibility setting of the new shortcut icon to Windows XP (Service Pack 2)" under Compatibility mode.</p>

    <title>What is the microphone&#39;s &#34;immediate mode&#34;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregory_microsoft_community  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the microphone&#39;s &#34;immediate mode&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    On the Enhancements tab of the microphone properties dialog, there's a checkbox for "Immediate Mode".&nbsp; What is that?

            That sounds more like the microphone's "Noise Suppression" option.&nbsp; Immediate Mode is available on both the microphone and speaker properties dialog Enhancements tab.&nbsp; If it were VOX, I wouldn't expect it on both input and output.<br />
<br />
I did find something in a paper from the Microsoft site dealing with DirectX audio processing generally, but not Vista or the properties dialog specifically.&nbsp; It makes it sound like the checkbox puts the driver into a mode where the Vista management of the
 audio signal would be bypassed:<br />
<br />
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to bypass the queuing</p>
<p>mechanism and program the hardware directly. This is</p>
<p>especially true for hardware diagnostics and operations</p>
<p>such as hardware resetting, which require immediate</p>
<p>action. In addition, for slow operations, such as setting</p>
<p>the analog port (video-in circuitry), programming the</p>
<p>hardware in the kernel using queues is undesirable.</p>
<p>The kernel driver supports an immediate mode of</p>
<p>operation that is accomplished by mapping the hardware</p>
<p>to the library’s memory space, disabling the command</p>
<p>queue, and allowing the library to program the</p>
<p>hardware directly.<br />
<br />
Maybe for compatibility with old software/games?&nbsp; <br />

<h3> lo001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting Blue Screen error STOP&#58; 0x000000D1 in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a computer I purchased about 3 months ago with Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bits, i5 2400 CPU, Asus P8H67-M Pro, 8G DDR3 RAM, and a Sapphire ATI 6790 display card. I do a bit of gaming with the computer and it has been running without any problems until
 2 days ago. <br />
<br />
I have always kept my drivers and stuff updated, and the computer has some serious BSOD problems now. I kept getting BSOD after about 15 mins into my games. The blue screen would just freeze, and I have to hit the power button to shut it down. Sometimes, it
 won't even boot up after I switch it on, I would see the power light goes on and the fan start spinning, but no signal for my monitor. Then I will have to turn it off and on again, it takes a few tries to get it on sometime, then it would eventually BSOD again.
 I have tried to let system restore fix it but it didn't help either.<br />
<br />
This is the BSOD messages I am getting, it said there is an error, so the computer has to shut down to prevent damages.<br />
<br />
DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL<br />
<br />
Technical information:<br />
<br />
*** STOP: 0x000000D1<br />
<br />
*** dxgmms1.sys<br />
<br />
I received an update notice from ATI for the display card driver to update, and the problem seems to start after I updated it, but I am not exactly sure what is causing the problem.
<br />
<br />
Please help me find out what may be causing it, if anyone know what the error messages mean, thank you!<br />

            From time to time, updating video card drivers via Windows Update will usually result in this kind of thing. This is usually caused by files left over from the old driver. I recommend that you first uninstall your current ATI driver, then download and
 run <a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/software/security/system_cleanup/driver_cleaner_pro.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Driver Cleaner Pro</a>. Select ATI from the menu in the program and let it run. Once it is finished, download another copy of your ATI driver directly from ATI's website. Restart your computer, then install the newly downloaded driver. Follow all directions,
 restart, and this *should* fix the problem. If this does not fix it, then it may be something else that was newly installed.<br />

    <title>Cannot install intel matrix storage manager on windows 7 - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thetacowarrior  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install intel matrix storage manager on windows 7 - &#34;computer does not meet minimum requirements&#34;. Used it for years on XP.</h2>
                    Yea its pretty much in the title. I use it to monitor my raid 1 array, and for whatever reason, it won't install on windows7 home. I have an intel 925x chipset, 4gb ram, P4 3.0ghz HT, 2x barracuda 7200.11 500gb in raid 1. It installed correctly onto the
 raid array, but not it just won't install the chipset drivers from intel or the matrix storage manager. I assume it has the chipset drivers built into windows because everything comes up correctly in the dev manager, and the raid 1 works as designed. did i
 not install the raid drivers correctly or something? i am at a loss, it all works, i just can't install the storage manager. thanks all for your help.<br />

Other than the Xbox 360 and Xbox Original games the xbox one games are not owned after downloading them so after your gold membership runs out you can't play any of the Xbox One games that were free with games with gold.</p>

<h2>            activation of windows</h2>
                    I bought a code, did a fresh re-install of windows 10 home, I was told that I needed to activate windows, so I went trough the process of trying to activate windows through setting and came up with the error code "0xC004C008" and no I haven't tried using
 this code to install on a second pc, this is my second code that I have bought with the same error coming up

            Hi  leonardbright,
<br />
<br />Roughly how much did you pay for that Windows 10 Product Code?
<br />
<br />Where did you purchase the Product Code from, was it from the Microsoft Store or fro a 3rd party website, if so, which one?
<br />
<br />Are you sure the Product code Edition of Windows (Home, Pro . . .etc.) matches the Edition installed on your PC?       
        </p>

            I bought my code from Kinguin.net for about $50 and yes, I bought a windows 10 Home oem key. I have already bought and used a key from kinguin before and it worked fine no issue so I'm a bit stumped

            Hi leonardbright,
<br />
<br />Every other day on this forum, we have users that purchased Product keys form Kinguin that do not work . . .
<br />
<br />A lot of the Product keys sold on Kinguin are either fake or are volume licence keys designed to be re-armed in a company or organisation setting
<br />
<br />If I were you, I would stop payment on that purchase and contact the seller on Kinguin to resolve this matter . ..

            Unfortunately payment has already gone through and I have just sent a ticket to Kinguin to try and get feedback from them, I have also previously talked with the support team and they directed me to microsoft, so hopefully Kinguin can resolve my issue,
 if not ill be back -_-

            Hi,
<br />Microsoft warns at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop....</a>
<br />
<br />Beware of Product Keys Sold Separately
<br />With the exception of Product Key Cards (PKC’s) distributed with COA’s, Microsoft does not distribute products keys as standalone products. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad, or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it’s a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen.
<br />
<br />Please note, OEM can be sold only as a packet with a DVD disk inside.

            You likely bought an MSDN license from kinguin that has been exhausted. You might have to look at this as a lost. You could try get back your money and purchase directly from the Microsoft Software.
<br />
<br />Kinguin is gonna try to persuade you to take another product and that one will likely activate, but will eventually be blocked too and then they will stop communicating with you. 
<br />
<br />If you can, try getting back the money and don't purchase anymore too good to be true price software. 
<br />
<br />Only Microsoft and Amazon (non-market place section) are authorized for Digital downloads). 
<br />
<br />About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys 
<br />They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.
<br />
<br />In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.

<p>The XBLPET generally do not discuss suspensions OP, check the message on your console for the date your suspension will be lifted.<br />
<br />
(Also suspensions are lifted at around the same time of day they were issued), so if you were suspended at 5pm the suspension will not be lifted until 5pm on the relevant date when the suspension is due to end.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>PCs usually experience blue screen error when it needs to shut down suddenly to protect itself from data loss. The error message that you got means that a hardware error has occurred. We can resolve the issue by getting the latest updates with Windows Update.
 Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on the Windows icon at the taskbar. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>. (gear icon).</li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; security</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Windows Update</strong> then select <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you try <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
restoring Windows back to an earlier point in time</a>. Click on the link that we have provided you and follow the steps under
<strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should there be anything else, let us know right away.</p>

<p>I haven't changed any software (ever since upgrading to Windows 10 last year) nor hardware (since that is a laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message found in the screen is WHEA_UNCOLLECTABLE ERROR. Would there be a minidump file associated with BSOD like this? If there is, I'll send that to you.</p>

    <title>What is going on with Sync options in Windows 10 creators update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamhiggs  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is going on with Sync options in Windows 10 creators update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok. &nbsp;So I have a Windows 10 pro x64 creators update os and it is joined to a domain. &nbsp;The domain controller is a windows&nbsp;server 2012 R2 datacenter server and has the creators update group policy templates installed on it. &nbsp;I have a domain user account that
 I use and into which I have imported my Microsoft Live account as well. &nbsp;However, in the settings app under account, when I select "Sync my settings" to sync my settings with this device, &nbsp;I get the following screen as if the os doesn't even recognize that
 there is a microsoft account attached to the profile:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e01d8cf-dfa2-463e-9ad0-6c35ce639ba8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e01d8cf-dfa2-463e-9ad0-6c35ce639ba8" /></a>This
 is the screen shot also showing that my microsoft&nbsp;account is imported into the account:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fa2510b-ada0-493c-910d-46c575b2e653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fa2510b-ada0-493c-910d-46c575b2e653" /></a></p>
<p>However, when I unjoin the domain, login as a local user, and import a Microsoft live account into the local account, I get the expected outcome:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ac2e9db-25a2-4742-9cd3-9fd34c4587b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ac2e9db-25a2-4742-9cd3-9fd34c4587b9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why is the domain account suddenly unable to recognize a microsoft account has been associated with it? &nbsp;It is not a corrupt user profile, as I deleted the domain account profile off of the computer entirely and reimported it as if it were the first time
 it was logging in, and the issue persists. &nbsp;It used to work fine on the other versions of Windows 10 before it, so why is not working now? &nbsp;And before any even THINKS about saying the words group policy, know that I am the administrator for the domain, and
 have not configured a single group policy that limits or prohibits the syncing of settings. &nbsp;I could go into the fact that I wasted about 2 hours of my precious time on the phone with Microsofts absolutely horrible customer support (I'm serious, a bullet to
 the brain would be more pleasant. &nbsp;Not a single "Technical support rep" *he says his voice dripping with sarcasm* that was not Indian, so not only was there a language barrier so I couldn't understand a thing they were saying, but they were all freaking idiots
 who had to be told how the operating system works and how it is supposed to normally function, which bodes very badly for the rest of the call), but I will just state I already tried that option with no success and it was about as pleasant as a sandpaper dildo.
 &nbsp;I am fairly confident this is just ANOTHER bug in the creators update that microsoft&nbsp;should, but probably won't, address at some point. &nbsp;Might as well take this opportunity to share with Microsoft (once again) the other bug concerning the out-of-the-box corruption
 that the Windows 10 creators update installation media has. &nbsp;On every single os running windows 10, the following command will fail due to source files not being found:</p>
<p>dism&nbsp;/online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</p>
<p>This occurs even on brand new os installs. &nbsp;The reason for this being (after using tweaking.com's Windows AIO repair tool) that one of the Windows package files has an invalid digital signature right out of the box. &nbsp;Here is the excerpt from the log:</p>
Scanning Windows Packages Files.<br />
│ Started at (5/8/2017 12:55:25 PM)<br />
│&nbsp;<br />
│ These Files Are Possibly Corrupt (Bad Digital Signature): (Total: 1)<br />
C:\Windows\servicing\Packages\Microsoft-Windows-TestRoot-and-FlightSigning-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.15063.0.mum<br />
│&nbsp;<br />
1 Combined Problems were found with the packages files, these files need to be replaced (These mainly only effect installing Windows Updates.)<br />
│ The SFC (System File Checker) doesn't scan and replace some of these files, so you may need to replace them manually.
<p>
</p><p>Which would explain why SFC does not detect the corruption and passes when it is run. &nbsp;However, this issue has been present and reported to Microsoft PERSONALLY BY ME in feedback app, over phone, and now in forums multiple times, yet it is still an issue.
 &nbsp;Yes I am fully aware that there is a fix out there which entails deleting the affected package files and removing the registry keys associated with them from the registry, but that does not change the fact that it is a third-party fix and, if a user were
 to encounter an issue after applying the fix, Microsoft would simply sidestep the issue explaining that you performed a fix that was not supported or authorized by Microsoft or whatever scapegoat lingo they decide to use. &nbsp;So, case and point, do us all a favor
 Microsoft and FIX YOUR BROKEN PRODUCT. &nbsp;The creators update is probably the worst release to date of windows 10 in terms of usability, performance, and stability, and your insistence on not fixing what's broken infuriates me to the point where I will probably
 have a stroke before the first reply is posted. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are experiencing this problem and that's what we are going to figure out. This type of issue normally happens when there's a hardware failure or software change made on the computer prior to this concern. To isolate this
 concern, we suggest that you roll back your computer to the previous version of Windows. Kindly follow the steps provided by

<h2>            Bluetooth LE forgets pairing on reboot</h2>
                    <p>I've only just noticed it, but if I pair Bluetooth LE devices with Windows 10, once I reboot, they are gone. A check of the Windows registry indicates that the entire HKLM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\BTHLE key has been removed every time I restart the machine...
 why?</p>

            I have now tested this with Build 17134.345 on two other machines. One is using a USB BluetoothLE dongle and the other has built-in BluetoothLE. Both exhibit the same behavior. Paired LE devices vanish after a reboot. This was working during a trade show
 at the end of August so something must have happened with one of the patches since 17134.228.<br />

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />The first thing you can try to resolve the Bluetooth issue is the Windows Troubleshooter. It may resolve the issue automatically:
<br />
<br />Click Star and type "troubleshoot". Click the first result.
<br />Select Bluetooth and run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />If this doesn't resolve your issue, try the System File Checker:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />Hopefully this resolves your issue. If not, please let me know and we can try something else! Thanks!

<p>Troubleshooting didn't help, as there is no trouble. I can pair and use the device to my heart's content. Secondly, System File Checker didn't find any corruption because the problem isn't due to a corrupt file. One of the machines I tested was a fresh installation
 of Windows 10; fully patched, so would have been highly unlikely to have had corrupted files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bug introduced into Windows. All the support in the world cannot fix an underlying fault in the operating system. Only a developer working on the Windows 10 Bluetooth LE at Microsoft can do that.</p>

Nope. Uninstalling and reinstalling the Generic Bluetooth Radio did not impact the problem. I can still pair and communicate successfully with any number of devices. These pairings are still lost when the machines are restarted. Current build 17134.376.

<h2>            Distorted Sound when calling thru Skype or internet.</h2>
                    when I call through skype on my laptop, I receive Distorted voice/sound from built in speakers (Sony Vaio VGN SR 13 GN running on Windows 7), however the sound/voice is perfectly fine when using external speakers/headset. If I lower the volume of the built-in
 speakers, then the voice becomes distortionless, but the voulme becomes too low..

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Let’s try the below steps and check if that helps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Select Microphone boost.</p>
<p><br />
a. Open <strong>Sound </strong>by clicking the <strong>Start </strong>button, and then clicking<strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type
<strong>sound</strong>, and then click<strong>Sound</strong>.<br />
b. Click the <strong>Recording </strong>tab, click <strong>Microphone</strong>, and then right click on microphone and choose<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
c. Go to <strong>Custom </strong>tab and place a checkmark on <strong>Microphone boost</strong>.<br />
d. Now click on Advanced and place a check mark on the following two options under the option "<strong>Exclusive Mode</strong>".</p>
<p>i. Allow application to take exclusive control of this device.<br />
ii. Give exclusive mode applications priority.</p>
<p>Also, under the option "default format" try using the different sample rate from the drop down menu till you get the satisfied recording.</p>
<p>e. Click <strong>apply</strong> and then <strong>Ok</strong> to close the window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Disable all enhancements.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Open Audio Devices and Sound Themes by clicking the <strong>Start </strong>
button, clicking<strong> Control Panel,</strong> clicking<strong> Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then clicking<strong>Sound</strong>.
<br />
b.&nbsp;Double-click the <strong>Enhancements </strong>tab. If you do not see the Enhancements tab, then your sound card either does not support audio effects or you have installed sound card software that replaced the Enhancements tab. For example, you might have
 a tab with the name of your sound card's manufacturer, and this tab might include different advanced features than are shown in the picture below.<br />
c.&nbsp;Place a check mark for<strong> Disable all enhancements</strong><br />
d.&nbsp;Click on <strong>OK </strong>button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Also please have a look at the below article.</p>
<p><br />

<p>You may also try contacting the system manufacturer for assistance, because the issue is with the built-in speakers/Microphone.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Print spooler hangs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobw111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Print spooler hangs</h2>
                    
<p>Running Windows 7 Pro with all the latest upgrades..&nbsp; Installed an HP 1600 with latest drivers from HP, and local printing works fine.<br />
<br />
Set the printer to be shared on the network.<br />
<br />
Installed latest HP drivers on 3 other machines, all with latest operating system upgrades..&nbsp; (1) Windows 7 Pro, (2) Windows 7 Starter, (3) Vista 32.<br />
<br />
Print jobs sent from any of the other 3 computers to the shared device go into the print que but hang.<br />
<br />
Jobs will not print until I stop and restart the Print Spooler service on the Windows 7 Pro machine that the printer is physically attached to.<br />
<br />
However, I connected the printer directly to my network router and all computers can print without problems.<br />
<br />
For me this nails it down to being a problem with the Windows 7 Print Spooler or a setting that controls it.<br />
<br />
So, is it the Print Spooler, or is it a setting causing the problem??<br />
<br />
And, if it is a setting, which one or ones??</p>

            Uncheck Enable Bidirectional on the Ports tab of the printer properties on the machine sharing the printer.&nbsp; The HP language monitor needs access to a resource that only the local administrator has.&nbsp; When you restart the spooler the jobs are scheduled
 in system context rather than the users context.<br />

<h2>            When I signed back on to Skype, my username changed and my contacts disappeared.</h2>
                    <p>I logged onto Skype this morning and everything was fine. My username was my name. I logged off for 2 hours and then logged on again. This time my username had changed to a part of my email address and all my contacts had disappeared. The system still recognised
 me and showed my name in various pages such as profile etc. Why has this happened and how can I solve the problem?</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2d5ae852-cf62-4147-9584-037b292ba312" title="NigelTN">
<p>
</p><p>Based on the statement you stated above, the account you are accessing might be a different one. Signing out and signing back in to your account will not change your username especially if that is the one you used to login to your account. Additionally,
 contacts are tied to the account and are saved in our servers. They will not be removed unless the user remove them himself/herself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that even though all&nbsp;Skype accounts were migrated to basic Microsoft accounts last October 2016, legacy users still&nbsp;need to fully update their accounts to unify their sign-in credential.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason that may have happened on your case is that instead of signing back in using your Skype Name, you signed in using the account's associated email address
<em>without merging them first </em>thus resulting to a new Skype account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly recommend that you sign out and sign back in using the credentials you used to
<strong>initially </strong>create your account. You can use the <strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Accounts Diagnostic link</a></strong> to determine whether you have multiple accounts or not.
 Enter the email address associated with your account and click Continue. We'll give you the list of accounts that are under your email address.
</p>

<h2>            I Already Paid For Xbox Live Gold, And Still Can&#39;t Play</h2>
                    <p>My previous Xbox Live Gold subscription expired, so I bought a 12 month subscription. However, whenever I want to play multiplayer, My console wants me to buy another subscription even though I&nbsp;already have one. When I checked my Microsoft Account, it said I had&nbsp; the subscription. Underneath&nbsp;the subscription page in settings on my console it also says I have the subscription. I've tested this with different games and got the same thing. The Xbox live service status is fine. How do I fix this?</p>

<h2>            Win 7 installation hangs at Setup is starting Services</h2>
                    I'm upgrading Vista Home on an Acer Aspire 4730Z Notebook, completely stock.&nbsp; Installation has gone along nicely until the Setup Is Starting Services message appeared.&nbsp; The first time, I also received a little white box message saying there was a problem
 logging on.&nbsp; Clicked OK, and I now have the Setup is Starting Sercies message displaying.&nbsp; On a power off/power on, Win 7 logo comes up, then the blue screen with the Services message comes up again.&nbsp; No go anywhere!&nbsp; Upgrade is a shrinkwrapped Home Premium
 upgrade disk, 32 bit.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Wilrex, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. Can you uninstall any antivirus that you currently have installed if any? Also, are you doing an upgrade install or a custom install. If you are doing a upgrade install, another option is the custom install. This will install a clean copy
 of windows, however you will need to do a backup of all your files, and reinstall any programs after the installation has completed.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mouse scroll wheel not functioning properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ergun kalbak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mouse scroll wheel not functioning properly</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to windows 10 I had problem on scroll function of mouse scroll wheel. When I turn the scroll wheel of mouse pages were not scrolling down or up properly. The page is not scrolling down or up smoothly and continuously. (No matter which program
 I'm using. IE, Chrome, Firefox, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Corel etc) For example, I'm turning scroll wheel of mouse up and page is scrolling up and I keep turn the wheel up but page is scrolling down a few ticks and I continue to scrolling up and then again
 page scrolling down and then jumping up, jumping down... I mean scrolling page is not controlling very well by scroll wheel of the mouse. I hope I could describe well what is my problem.<br />
<br />
PS-What I've done until now: I changed all mouse settings one by one, scrolling lines value, speed, etc. Updated driver. Removed the mouse hardware and installed again. Removed mouse driver and installed again. I changed transceiver from USB port and put on
 others one by one. I bought a brand new mouse (HP)... Nothing changed! Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can watch the video here:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/27fZlpKh6NY</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Please pay attention the movement of scroll bar in the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Ergun</p>

            <p>Hello Ergun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I suspect that the problem might be due to malfunctioning mouse driver or with software conflicts. I see you telling that you tried updating drivers with no success. Suggest you to try performing a Clean Boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program. Follow the
 below mentioned steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press <strong><span>Windows Key,</span></strong> t</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ype
<strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> in the search box, and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. On the <strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong> check box, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Disable all</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click <strong>
<span>Open Task Manager</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong><span>Disable</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. Close Task Manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">f. On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click <strong>
<span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If a service is causing issue, I suggest you turn on 5 services at a time, reboot and then see if the problem reappears, keep repeating this until you find a group of 5 services, which are causing this issue, then check the one
 by one, till you find the one which is causing your issue. Perform the same divide and apply for
<strong><span>Startup's </span></strong>too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer the&nbsp;below article on&nbsp;"<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Perform Clean Boot</a></strong>". As the&nbsp;article is designed for Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows
 7. Unlike launching step for&nbsp;'System Configuration', options and steps to Clean Boot are same for Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> After you finish troubleshooting, refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" from the&nbsp;same article.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Keep posted how it went.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Yashwanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your kind reply and your time. I did a clean boot as you recommended but unfortunately it didn't work. It's still same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I had chance to test my mouse in another computer which has windows 7. Surprisingly I had same problem in this computer too! So, I think my mouse scroll wheel has some technical problem or defect from factory. Like I said before, it is a new
 brand HP mouse that I had bought around 1 month ago. I don't understand how this new brand HP mouse has technical defect or manufacture error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I had Microsoft mouse with same problem. I though it's quite old and decide to new one from HP. Both of them has same scroll problem. (I didn't have chance to test Microsoft mouse on windows 7.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see the pictures attached for my HP mouse and model. Maybe I should contact to HP to give back the mouse and request for refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ergun</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this line "<strong>I bought a brand new mouse (HP)... Nothing changed!" </strong>
in your description, I thought you tested with another new mouse without success. Hence, I didn't ask you to test the mouse on different computer nor try connecting another mouse.</p>

<p>

</p><p>Since Pandigital is out of business and there isn't an&nbsp;official company website, a Google search found this</p>

                    I have two computers where the Windows shell experience host was uninstalled without my knowledge, the only way I found out was that the iobit uninstaller should up asking to remove leftovers. I know this is for the start menu because it doesn't not work
 on either computer. How was this uninstalled and how do I get it back? I can't click on the start menu, cortana, or the network, sound, and notification buttons, but the pinned programs do open.
