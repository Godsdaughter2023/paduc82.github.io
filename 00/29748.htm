            <p>Try these different solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)Open up device manager and click on the scan or hardware changes on the toolbar. the driver should install itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)in device manager Right click the device with yellow mark and select update driver software. then select automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)if 2ns solution does not work then&nbsp;after selecting the update driver software select browse my computer for software and then select pick....option rather than defining the path and select the manufacturer details and it should be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)go to windows update and click on scan for updates and hopefully you should see a driver update in the optional or important updates section.</p>

            <p>Hi Cspork,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have reached the right forums. Let us try and fix this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand, in the Action Center settings the Network Access Protection Agent service is not running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Network Access Protection (NAP) agent service collects and manages health information for client computers on a network. Information collected by NAP agent
 is used to make sure that the client computer has the required software and settings. If a client computer is not compliant with health policy, it can be provided with restricted network access until its configuration is updated. Depending on the configuration
 of health policy, client computers might be automatically updated so that users quickly regain full network access without having to manually update their computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service can be left to be configured to start manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is mostly for in case the computer needs to access a corporate network domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance, we will be happy to help you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem started when I wanted to create a restore point. I got an error code 0x81000203. There was drives listed in the system Property page. I started a command Prompt (admin) -&gt; chkdsk-&gt; got errors. Could not fix. I then used a EaseUS Todo Backup Emergency
 disk to boot from DVD. It worked and patition C was fixed from all error. Removed DVD and restarted computer. Everything OK, However I am still not able to create a Restore point. Checked everything that was suggested by others: Vvolume Shadow Copy Service-&gt;Automatic-&gt;Started-&gt;Runnung,
 Microsoft Shadow Service-&gt; Automatic-&gt;started-&gt;Running, Disabled Trend Micro Security-&gt;did not help. I am sorry that now I am asking you if you know how to fix this problem of Creating Restore Point. Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for replying</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me explain.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The problem started when I wanted to create a restore point. I got an error code 0x81000203. There was no drives listed in the system Property page. I started a command Prompt (admin) -&gt; chkdsk-&gt; got errors. Could not fix. I then used a EaseUS
 Todo Backup Emergency disk to boot from DVD. It worked and patition C was fixed from all error. Removed DVD and restarted computer. Everything OK, However I am still not able to create a Restore point. Checked everything that was suggested by others: Volume
 Shadow Copy Service-&gt;Automatic-&gt;Started-&gt;Running, Microsoft Shadow Service-&gt; Automatic-&gt;started-&gt;Running, Disabled Trend Micro Security-&gt;did not help. I am sorry that now I am asking you if you know how to fix this problem of Creating Restore Point. Thank
 you.</span></p>

            In the start menu search for "Restore Point"
<br />This should take you to System Properties dialog &gt; System Protection tab. 
<br />In the "Protection Settings"  all of your drives will be listed, beside each on is an On/Off indicator.   
<br />
<br />If the C: drive is not turned on, single click on it and then click on the "Configure" button.
<br />
<br />In there you can turn on protection and define how much space on the drive you will allocate to checkpoints.
<br />
<br />OK to save changes.
<br />
<br />Then you should be able to create checkpoints.

<br />There are several methods, but after looking through the article, I think method 2 is the best.

<br />Turning on Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider Service
<br />If TuneUp (or other tuning utilities) are not been installed on your system, it‚Äôs possible Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider service isn‚Äôt running. Here‚Äôs how to get the service active.
<br />
<br />PRO TIP: If the issue is with your computer or a laptop/notebook you should try using the Reimage Plus Software which can scan the repositories and replace corrupt and missing files. This works in most cases, where the issue is originated due to a system corruption. You can download Reimage Plus by Clicking Here
<br />Open the Start Menu and type ‚Äúservices‚Äù. Right-click on it and ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù. You can also do this by pressing Windows Key + R for the Run prompt, typing ‚Äúservices.msc‚Äù and pressing Enter.
<br />
<br />Search for the service ‚ÄúMicrosoft Software Shadow Copy Provider‚Äù and double-click it.
<br />Set the Start type to ‚ÄúAutomatic‚Äù and click Start to start the service.
<br />
<br />Open the Control Panel and navigate to System and Security &gt; System Protection and then select the drive, click the Configuration button, and set the Maximum Disk Space usage to something more than zero (depending on the number of restore points you want). Remember to Turn on System Protection from here is you haven‚Äôt.
<br />
<br />Click OK, restart the computer and check again for the issue.

<h2>            issues with Windows 10 not recognising the Canon HV40 camcorder.</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/firewire-not-recognised/209cc1dc-21cd-456f-9b64-204583b4c8c8" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Canon HV40</strong></p>
<p>I too am having the same issues with Windows 10 not recognising the Canon HV40 camcorder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The camera has two playback modes: HDV/DV and DV LOCKED modes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I believe is this: Whilst connected to the IEEE1394 Firewire port...</p>
<p>
</p><p>SD LOCKED mode, computer uses "<strong>msdv.inf</strong>" file and is listed in device manager as an "imaging device".</p>
<p>HDV/DV mode, computer uses "<strong>mstape.inf</strong>" file and is listed as a "sound, video and games controller".<br />
<br />
msdv.inf specifically lists the camcorder by name but has no configuration for the camera while in HDV mode, this code is missing. Therefore, mstape is used instead. which incorrectly places the device in sound video and games controllers, thus making it inaccessible
 for programs such as Windows Movie Maker. And because of this miss-identification, no other video editing software recognises the camera in HDV mode either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to copy and paste specific references to the Canon Camcorder from msdv.inf to mstape.inf without success, as apparently these are system protected files, even when using notepad in "open as admin" role. So, I am at a loss. If Microsoft could
 provide an updated msdv.inf file which will identify the camcorder whilst it is set to HDV playback mode, that would completely fix the problem. There is no hardware problem or firmware problem with the camera or firewire configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to a response and download link for the amended msdv.inf file with great anticipation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stephen Peters.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay in responding. I thought I had gotten around to replying to all my threads everywhere...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok... In answer to your above, I've tried all of that - Anyone with a half decent knowledge of computers would have done the same. Here's what I've managed to find out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the camcorder is in HDV playback mode, it's recognised by Windows 10 as a "AV/C Tape device" and placed under "Audio, Video and game controllers" within the device manager list and is inaccessible via any video editing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the camcorder is in "DV LOCK" mode, it is recognised by Windows 10 as a "DV Camcorder" and placed under "Imaging Devices" within the device manager list. In this mode it is accessible via video editors such as Movie Maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In "DV LOCK" mode, msdv.inf is the controller for the camera. In "HDV" mode, mstape.inf controls the camera. I've looked at both these files via notepad, msdv lists the camera specifically, while mstape does not. I believe this is the problem. I also believe
 from my searches on the internet, that any camcorder from Canon, JVC or Sony, that identifies itself as an HDV unit will not be recognised correctly by Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Every device in the world which can connect to a network has a unique identifying address call the MAC address.&nbsp; (This has NOTHING to do with Apple products - although they too will have mac addresses.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one for your printer will be on the documentation, and probably on the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most routers have the ability to only allow specified MAC addresses to communicate through the router.&nbsp; If you have not got such filtering enabled in your router then you need do nothing.&nbsp; If you have got mac filtering turned on then you need to type the
 printer's address into the appropriate page in the router's setup.</p>
<p>There is nothing on the printer to '"disenable".(sic)</p>

</p><p>I just got an HP Envy x 360 with windows 10 a week ago. This morning went to power on and got nothing. Batter was fully charged last night but I plugged it in then hit power. I got the blue screen saying windows is updating don't turn off computer. &nbsp;I waited,
 it got to 100% then started over with the update. &nbsp;It got stuck on 30%, I had to move to another location and had to unplug it. The screen went black and now it won't turn on or do anything. Please help. I got this to help me edit pictures for my photography
 business, please tell me I haven't lost a weeks worth of work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bose Soundlink Mini Users</h2>
                    
<p>Ok my mom got me a Bose Soundlink Mini Speaker for Xmas.&nbsp; I thought ok lets see if I can hook it to the tv and get all components to work through it.&nbsp; Well I already had a 3.5 mm jack&nbsp;on each end cable and that did not work.&nbsp; I did some digging around and
 found an adapter for it at Wal Mart that had the red and white component audio on one end and the 3.5 mm jack on the other&nbsp; hooked it to the TV and presto Bose sound through ALL my devices (TV, Xbox 360, PS3, and Xbox One).&nbsp; Just threw this out there in case
 anyone else got one of these and was trying to get it to work with the above listed electronics.</p>

    <title>When my laptop goes into sleep and I open it again I get a weird - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbnn  say:</h3>
<h2>            When my laptop goes into sleep and I open it again I get a weird lined&#47;static screen.</h2>
                    <p>This randomly started happening to my laptop a few weeks ago. Whenever my laptop goes into sleep and I open it again, a fully lined/static screen is what I am presented with. the only way to get rid of it is by holding the power button and force shutting
 it down. Then when I turn it back on it's a normal screen again but then as soon as it goes into sleep it will do the same thing, constantly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how this could've happened and what I can do about it?</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer? 
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem? 
<br />How long has this been happening? 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703? 
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? 
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

            Hi.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />Check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About if you have Version 1709 yet.  
<br />
<br />Make sure you have the latest Display adapter from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   Go to the PC or Display adapter's Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest driver.  
<br />
<br />Access Device Manager by right clicking Start menu button.  Click on Display device, then Driver tab.  If you have the latest driver, use the Uninstall button to uninstall the latest driver, restart PC to reinstall it.  
<br />
<br />If you already have the latest driver, try rolling back to another one that may work better.  You can look for other drivers on the PC's Support Downloads webpage.  You can also access all previous drivers installed on the PC from the Driver tab by choosing the Update Driver button, then Browse My Computer, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />If you do not have Version 1709 yet then what I would do  is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Thank you for posting your&nbsp;query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right
</p>
<p>direction to fix the issue. However, are you using a local user account or a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/sign-in-what-is-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft account</a>?</p>
<p><span><span>If you're using a local Windows user account, then you may refer to the steps provided in the following article:</span></span></p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/what-do-forget-windows-password#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">What to do if you forget your Windows password</span></span></a></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Important: </span></strong><span>I highly recommend <em><strong>backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device</strong></em> before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Alternatively, i<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">f it is redirecting you to account.live.com, I conclude that it is a Microsoft Account which can be reset online.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>So, I would suggest you to refer to following articles in order to recover your password.
</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>(Refer to the <strong>Reset your password</strong> link.)</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Ignore the suggestion to reinstall Windows for now.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>On the other hand, there is a possibility that your Microsoft account has been compromised‚Äîor hacked‚Äîit means that someone has stolen your password and might be using your account to access your personal info or send spam.
 We can help you&nbsp;recover your account, and help prevent it from being hacked again. Refer to the following article:</span></span></p>

    <title>USB-Serial Adaptor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbartko  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB-Serial Adaptor</h2>
                    Tried several USB-Serial adaptors from Belkin &amp; Garmin. None had Vista 64 bit software so unable to install fully or correctly. Now have a Prolific PL 2303 USB-Serial w/ Vista 32 &amp; 64 bit drivers, V 3.3.3.114 obtained from
<a href="http://www.prolific.com.tw/eng/downloads.asp?ID=31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.prolific.com.tw/eng/downloads.asp?ID=31</a>. It appears to load sucessfully but when I plug in adaptor to USB I get message that driver is downloading, then an error "Windows encountered
 a problem installing the driver software Prolific USB to Serial Comm Port. The name is already in use as either a service name or a service disply name."
<br />
<br />
Tried to use the previous uninstall programs from old attempts but little luck. Garmin had used an older Prolific adaptor for serial GPS connections and I suspect remnants of that remain here.<br />
<br />
Any ideas to fix?<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
Bernie

Thank you for posting.&nbsp; I've researched your issue and found how someone else solved their problem.&nbsp; I've included the whole article for your convience.&nbsp; Also i would suggest that you uninstall all instances of the device before going further.&nbsp; The step below

<p><em>I‚Äôve got a couple of USB&lt;-&gt;Serial adaptors, neither of which work in Vista. On plugging them in, I went to the hardware manager, and looked at the properties of the unknown device (specifically the HardwareId) - this showed up as USB\VID_0607B&amp;PID=2301.</em></p>
<p><em>A quick search on the internet shows Prolific as the vendor ID 0607B, and on visiting their website, found out that they do not support Vista, and you need to go to whoever you bought your adaptors from.</em></p>

<h2>            Sound sounds like it&#39;s coming from under water</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 - have had the computer 1 year. I stream sound from the computer through my stereo system. Up until 2 weeks ago, I had no issues. Now, intermittently it sounds like the sound is coming through water. It's not the receiver as I can
 play the radio without an issue. This happens regardless of the player used - whether it's Windows Media Player or a station's own player.

<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Playing Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter to see if it resolves this issue . . .

<h2>            sd card read only after upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a micro sd card which does not have the lock function.&nbsp; I am unable to delete or reformat because all the files have changed to read only.</p>
<p>I have tried many things to change the setting - cmd commands, Easeus, and whatever else I found online but to no avail.</p>
<p>I am at a loss here.</p>
<p>I have read that upgrading from OS 7 to OS10 is the cause and that Microsoft was supposed to fix the problem but, obviously it has not.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestion anyone can provide.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for answering.&nbsp; I know you have nothing to do with the development of Windows, and actually I am only interested in figuring out this problem and finding a solution as MANY people seem to have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have more than one micro sd and they all seem to be read only!!! an option which cannot be changed by the way.&nbsp; Regular sd cards are not such. I think there is something wrong with Windows 10 OS regarding these cards. I will try on another computer with
 different OS, maybe the library..&nbsp;and see.</p>
<p>It is really driving me crazy.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows 10 is not known for causing issues with SD card readers however it could be a driver/firmware problem. Check with the maker of your Computer or Motherboard (if not a pre-build unit). Check for SD card drivers or even chipset drivers (some makers include
 SD drivers in these). Check with the maker's support and forums. Good idea to update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and all major drivers (see methods below).<br />
<br />
The above is especially likely to be needed if those cards can be read in other computers.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Right Click the&nbsp;Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - <br />
write down the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click <br />
- Driver's tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not
<br />
do anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Hi again and thank you again for answering.</p>
<p>I downloaded that drivers' tool, but I was a bit overwhelmed with all those strange names. I am not sure which one belongs to the sd port or other USB&nbsp;ports that I can use to read the card.&nbsp; I did see more than one USB&nbsp;driver...</p>
<p>My computer is a 6 year old&nbsp;Dell Inspiron N5110.&nbsp; I looked on Dell site for updated drivers and Bios, but I was confused as it did not give me a choice for the OS.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 from OS 7, and the choices I saw were for OS 7 and 8. I am a bit
 hesitant to do something that will debilitate my machine.</p>
<p>I had that happen in the past and it took a very long time to fix (with the help of generous people such as you).&nbsp; But then I also had a Mac (now dead due to logic board failure) so I could work on one to fix the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now back to my problem.&nbsp; Dell says that one should update drivers in a certain order or things could get messed up.&nbsp; The first one they say to update would be the Bios, but as I said I don't know if it is the correct one as my current OS is not listed in
 the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Dell site is not very intuitive, and there is no support for old machines!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tomorrow I will try to go to the library and see if I can get this card reformatted or not.&nbsp; The company will give me a new one, but I don't want to send it with my personal information on it.&nbsp; In any case, given that the other micro card also seems to be
 read-only, the problem must be the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if the driver is the problem why is it that the USB&nbsp;drives are ok?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Thanks again and have a lovely Sunday</p>
<p>DH</p>

            The SD card reader used different drivers than the USB (though they may be included in an installation routine).
<br />
<br />The Dell forums should be able to help as well.

<br />What is your exact and complete model number and model type?

            On this page the below driver is the latest I can find for your Card Reader.
<br />
<br />Realtek RTS5138 Card Reader Driver    Chipset   12 Dec 2013 
<br /><a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/inspiron-15r-n5110/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/prod...</a>
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />You might also want to check these :
<br />
<br />There is a "Detect Drivers" link near the top right of the page below which I would run. 
<br />
<br />And/Or :
<br />
<br />Get the Dell Update Application available near the bottom of this page - indicated as "Dell Update".
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/servicetag/d4dzdr1/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/prod...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />You have the latest BIOS however the date you show is not the same as on the above webpage. You show A11 8/3/2012 and the A11 offered has a Release Date of  9/13/2012.
<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Note there are Windows 7 and some 8.1 drivers for your system however there are no specific for Windows 10. Best to check in the Dell Forums to see if others are having issues and how they are dealing with them.
<br />
<br />Dell does not support Windows 10 on that model.

            Hi sadkristine,
<br />
<br />Turn your PC off and remove all connected devices except for Mouse and Keyboard
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>All my other internet applications are fine too. In your case though if you already have an xbox connected you are probably hitting the port conflict issue adding a second xbox.</p>
<p>So you connect to live through ports and only one IP address on the network can have the ports open and assigned to it. By attempting to connect a second console you are trying to open identical ports on the second console. Unfortunately the only way around
 it is to get a second IP address from your ISP which will be expensive or kick your brother off so you can use the ports on your console.</p>

<p>Yes, their forum is flooded with them. I recon it's to do with their p2p throttling service incorrectly identifying xbox live traffic as bittorrent traffic. I'm seriously thinking about moving to another supplier, I have heard Be are good, any recommendations?
</p>
<p>What's the point in having 50mb download, 1.5mb upload if you have a connection that keeps dropping and is so unreliable!?</p>
<p>Just out of interest, what does that error code mean?</p>

<p>Hey mate, I'm afraid I can't provide any details on the code. My suggestion would be to check the Be forums, to see if they're similarly flooded. Also, a rep would be happy to discuss their service with you, too, and whether they recommend it for a LIVE
 connection. </p>
