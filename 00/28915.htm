<h2>            Outlook 2010 won&#39;t send&#47;receive unless I close and re-open</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
A problem has crept into Outlook 2010. I can't send or receive email without first closing and then re-opening Outlook. A sent message stays "hung" in the outbox, the message bolded (no attachments, nothing irregular); as well, messages don't come in. I've
 tried changing settings re automatic send/receive and hitting the refresh key. As well, this whole thing is fairly recent; I suspect it began, although I can't be sure, when the company switched to Office 365 for its server/host/whatever. Oh ... and there
 are no error messages. <br />
<br />
The weird thing is that Outlook works fine when I'm at the office (nothing special about the ISP or network at all), but when I bring the laptop home, that's where the problem begins. It can't be an add-in, because it works at the office perfectly, just not
 at home (I'm operating wirelessly in both cases). No firewalls in either place. <br />
<br />
Office 365 web app works fine. I'm using Window 7 64-bit; Outlook 32-bit.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions? I'd really appreciate some brainstorming! Thanks in advance,<br />
Brett<br />

            <p>You say your company switched to 365.&nbsp; Was that recently?&nbsp; Did it used to work at home prior to changing to 365?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your company has switched recently, then your old mail service may still be available/functional and your outlook is not configured properly to use 365 and could still be using the old service.&nbsp; If that old service is something like an exchange server,
 that could be a possible explanation of why it works while you are in the office and doesn't outside of it.</p>

            Hi Butch, thanks for answering so quickly.<br />
<br />
It was a fairly recent switch, yes. And yes, Outlook used to be fine both at home and at work. Just to add a wrinkle, though, I was travelling in the spring and Outlook worked fine in the hotels I stayed in--in a few different states. I suspect it might then
 be something unique to just a few service providers, the one I'm on at home being one of them.<br />
<br />
I think the account is set up to use 365. I'm no expert on settings, but it seems so.<br />
<br />
I have only one .ost, and it's listed as Microsoft Exchange in the "Type" field. Under server settings, would having "Use Cached Exchange mode" checked make any difference (it's currently checked)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, in any case,<br />
Brett<br />
<br />

            It sounds like things are pointing to your home ISP as the problem.&nbsp; Do you have any co-workers that use the same ISP at home as you and do they have the same experience?

            Heh ... nope. I'm live in a very rural area. I'll get a old of my home ISP people, see what they have to say. The more I read up on things, the more I think that's the problem. I'm going to recreate my .ost first to see if that might have any effect, then
 on to some phone calls.<br />

            <p>I don't question that the stroke you cite may have gotten the job done, but it's awkward overkill that may be counterproductive based on newer software &amp; OS being more exacting. Try using either;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift+Click</strong>, <em>or</em></li><li><strong>Command+Click</strong></li></ul>
<p>Either will do the same re selecting multiple objects but there is a difference in other contexts.</p>

    <title>Issue with right click Spell check in Office 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weissada  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with right click Spell check in Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with the right click spell check in Office (Word and Power Point in particular) 2016 for mac. Currently, if I misspell a word and right click on it, a drop down list of possible corrections will appear. If I select the first option in this
 list, instead of correcting the word, my mac systems preference app will open and word or power point will freeze for about 5 seconds. The misspelt word does not update to the correct spelling. If I select any other suggestion after the first one, it works
 fine (no systems preferences and the word updates to the correct spelling). This seems to be an exclusive problem with Office 2016 applications; text editor for example does not have this issue).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus far I have tried deleting and reinstalling Office, updating to the latest OS (El Capitan 10.11.4) and am running out of ideas short of doing a total wipe of my machine and starting from scratch. &nbsp;Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Emails not coming to Inbox - sometimes showing momentarily and then disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I am facing a serious issue with my Hotmail. I have noticed for several weeks now, that some emails are coming to my INBOX and some others are not coming at all. There does not seem to be a pattern to this - and so I do not know at all times which emails
 are coming and which are not. For example, just a few minutes ago, I was to receive an email with password instructions for another site. I saw the email flickering in my inbox for about HALF a Second and then it disappeared ! I looked in the deleted AND Junk
 folders - no luck...the email was not there. </p>
<p>Who can help me with this? I also realize with a shock that there does not seem to be any dedicated SUPPORT number for Hotmail where I can call and speak with a software support expert to sort this out.
</p>
<p>This is a huge problem and I hope someone on the Hotmail team can address this immediately.
</p>
<p>Can anyone help me?</p>

<p>In my message itself, I have mentioned HOTMAIL email. So, I did not understand what you mean when you say "are you referring to Outlook.com or Outlook mail"?</p>
<p>I have not made any recent changes. I primarily use two browsers : Internet Explorer and EDGE. My Hotmail email Account&nbsp;is also configured into my official Microsoft Outlook Home Page.</p>
<p>I am concerned that there is no&nbsp;one&nbsp;i am able to speak with&nbsp;or chat with who can understand and address this issue.

<h2>            Problem with Windows Mobile Device Center on Win 7, 64 syncing an HP iPAQ 211.</h2>
                    I have been using iPAQs and syncing them on my PCs (Mostly Win XP Pro) for many years with little problem.&nbsp; I have just built a new system and am operating it on Windows 7, 64bit.&nbsp; As I try to set up a partnership with the iPAQ, it has taken over two days
 to sync the device on Win Mobile Device Center.&nbsp; Also it always changes my device name on the iPAQ to WindowsmobiledeviceXX, and I always have to change the name back on the device (I experience the same renaming problem with my laptop operating on Vista Ultimate
 that I&nbsp;will soon will be upgrading to Win 7, 64 this week)

            Hi Linley, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did that&nbsp; before writing the problem description. Syncing (If it does occur at all) takes an exceptionally long period of time.&nbsp; I really don't think that the slow speed is a factor of the PC.&nbsp; The PC is a Gigabyte EP45UD3P Motherboard, with an Intel
 E8600 CPU Running @ 3.33Ghz, and 6Gb of Ram, and 4Tb of RDD Raid 10 (Windows Experience Index 6.1).&nbsp; It used to take less than 10 minutes to sync on XP Pro PCs.&nbsp; Also what is the deal with the Mobil Device Center always changing the Device ID on the iPAQ to
 "WINDOWSMOBILEXX", WITH THE "XX" being a two digit number that advances every time the device is synced (This problem is the same on a PC running Vista Ultimate)?&nbsp; Do I have to install Activesync 4.5 and run it as an XP program and dump the Mobil Device Center?&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not a "Newby" with PCs.&nbsp; My history with computing goes back to the Litton DIANE in 1966, and PCs to my Xerox Alto back in the early 1970s.&nbsp; I was a Beta user of the original Windows program and an implementer in developing a Xerox GUI based on Windows
 II.&nbsp; Can you explain a solution for these problems?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom<br />

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem about unwanted renaming the device I solved, after some hours of searching on the web.</p>
<p>Here is the solution what works for me, on a iPAQ HP2490 (WM5-device), and syncing under Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>After I changed the name of my device <strong>without an underscore </strong>in the name, I never&nbsp; had the rename problem again. Probably you use an "_" in the name of the iPAQ... You can change the name under Start &gt; Settings &gt;System &gt; About &gt; Device ID</p>
<p>Hopes this help. By the way, I think you might have solved your problem after asking here.. it's 10 moths later now! :)</p>
<p>greets,</p>
<p>p</p>

<h2>            Podcasts &#39;skipping&#39; in Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed that low-bitrate audio files created with iTunes will randomly skip over a few seconds occasionally throughout the file. If I rewind a little, it will play the section without skipping. A minute later, it will skip again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens using both the built-in&nbsp;'Music+Video'&nbsp;player and the Nokia music player. I haven't tried installing a different player, because I presume they're all using the same audio capabilities provided by the OS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files are hour-long podcasts&nbsp;converted to a&nbsp;low-bitrate M4A (22050Hz, mono, 32kbps) using custom encoder options iTunes, to give a file size of around 15MB. Note that I get the same issue using the standard "Spoken podcast" preset in iTunes which results
 in a larger file of around 25MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files play without issue on my iPod, Win8 laptop and Surface. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files are copied to the phone using the 'Windows Phone' app on Windows 8. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files are playing from a micro-SD card, which I initially thought might be part of the problem, but regular music files at much higher bitrates (256kbps -&gt; 320kbps) play just fine. As an experiment, I converted the podcast to a high quality&nbsp;320kbps file
 and it played without skipping (which isn't really a resolution, because I don't want a silly podcast taking up 120MB).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Lumia 822 on Verizon, OS version 8.0.9905.12, firmware revision 1532.2108.1244.0003.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul.</p>

            I have used a Lumia 820, Lumia 620 and now I am using a Lumia 810, and all of them have this exact issue. Music plays just fine, but all of the podcasts I listen to will skip. The files are all sorts of bitrates and sizes, all of them downloaded directly
 from the Store. A few of them are files that I have actually made myself and put up in the Store, and those skip too.
<div><br />
<div>I have tried two different SD cards, one a class 4, one a class 10. I have tried using regular headphones and bluetooth headphones. In all cases, I get the skipping.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I did notice that while using bluetooth headphones the podcasts skipped ahead about 5 seconds each time, whereas via regular headphones it only skips about 1 second.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have OS version 8.0.10211.204.</div>

            Hi, I have the same issue with my Lumia 830 Windows 8.1. I've discovered that streaming the podcast eliminated the issue altogether. My next issue is trying to justify why my phone bill is so high to my manager as I'm only on a 2gb plan and have so far
 burned through 5gb in a couple of weeks. Would you happen to know how to store the podcast at its full size? Mine downloads as it is. Any advice is much appreciated.

            <p>I have had the same problem using both the HTC 8XT and the Lumia 635 and with different Bluetooth headsets. The podcast playback will skip at random times, and listening to music podcasts makes that EXTREMELY annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I use a wired headset connection there is no skipping. Also this only seems to happen with podcasts; none of my music files skip in the Music player whether using Bluetooth or wired headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am amazed this is still a problem as it has been ever since my 8XT was updated to Windows 8.1. Is someone at Microsoft aware of this?</p>

            I am still having this same problem on a Lumia 1520 w/ Denim.&nbsp; I noticed it is only when I am listening on Bluetooth (both a headset and with my car transceiver), and increases in frequency the longer the podcast plays.&nbsp; I listen to windows weekly often,
 and the video version starts skipping badly around 1-1.5 hours in.

            I just got the brand new, latest and greatest Lumia 950 phone. I was hoping the problem was just related to the performance of the 635 and the 8XT, but it seems it is not that simple. The podcast playback STILL SKIPS and falls off at times, a few times
 every minute often times! I have to use wired headphones to be able to listen to my podcasts reliably. Attention Microsoft: When is someone going to address this issue?

</p><p>May I ask if you have already tried to reset the password of your Skype account? You may do these steps in order to update your password from your Skype account:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Sign in to your Skype account using this link: <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>2. At the lower right, under Settings and Preferences, select on Change Password</p>
<p>3. Follow the on screen instructions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you reset your password, try to sign back in to your Skype account and see if the same would still persist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know the updates. </p>

</p><p>From what you mentioned you are given a prompt that there is something wrong with your account. In this case, have you tried on following the steps above by resetting your password and updating your security information through the site:

    <title>Access 2010 - Datasheet Autofilter options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denniswarchol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2010 - Datasheet Autofilter options</h2>
                    <p>Apologies for these&nbsp;"basic" questions - but I am unable to find any information for this problem&nbsp;in the Access Help lookup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q1.&nbsp; In the datasheet view of the records in a table, <u>why do some fields "not display" the dropdown list of Autofilter choices</u> ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the table,&nbsp;I have (2) date/time fields - one displays the Autofilter list, one does not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Review of the column properties
 for each column appears to be the same values for each column - and each column seems to have valid formatted dates.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also other fields (and data types) in the table that are displaying the Autofilter list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2.&nbsp; <u>In the query view, the Autofilter list feature is not available for any of the Date/Time fields</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there some property or value to be set to enable this in the query view ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead it displays the&nbsp;message - "Syntax error (missing operator)
 in query expression 'Termination Dt'.&nbsp; (Rude!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your assistance.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask your teacher or the web site from where you have downloaded your e-learning course from. ref:
<a href="http://www.scorm.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.scorm.com</a> and <a href="http://www.trivantis.com/forum/f120/unable-find-api-adapter-unable-locate-lmss-api-implementation-10122/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.trivantis.com/forum/f120/unable-find-api-adapter-unable-locate-lmss-api-implementation-10122/</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But first your could try (I cannot test this as I don't install Oracle java RTE on my machines)</p>
<p>From IE select</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Manage Addons&gt;Show "All Addons"</p>
<p>and locate the Java runtime Addon (not sure of its exact name) in the list of Installed addons.</p>
<p>Double click on the item to display its properties, then click the 'Allow to run in all sites' button. Save your changes and close and restart ALL IE windows.</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>make sure you are accepting the default Ie Security Zone settings. Internet Options, Security tab, click the "Reset all zones to default" button.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You MUST be connected to the internet when you access the e-learning coarse from your desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            The N8 does not currently have this option. The only option is to save them to the phones memory. Don't worry though, even if you have 1000's of messages it uses very little space.

<p>The message you are getting is probably due to the SIM Message memory being full.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goto Menu &gt; Messaging &gt; Options &gt; SIM messages</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and delete all messages you find there</p>

            thanks for that nj15,i'll try that route as i must retreive them if at all possible, (they were only deleted as a last resort, to allow space for further messages, s'pose i should have forwarded them to another phone) anyhow, time to buy a "modern" phone
 with more capacity to store them methinks :)

That's a good idea.For a new "Modern" Phone,you can choose between Series 40 and Series 60(Smartphones).

            If you had made a backup of your phone memory, then you can restore the backup and get the sms back. That is, the texts that were in your mobile before you made the backup. Otherwise, I'm sorry to say, you cannto get them back.

<p>On a lighter vein, i would ask you to take your phone to the NSA and tell them that there is a deadly patch of code that can cripple the entire military network of almost every other nation in the world. They may be able to recover it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, mate. Once lost, you cannot recover data stored in the phone memory. And I'm not getting any other ideas</p>

    <title>Samsung Omnia Activesync over Wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> virudhaka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung Omnia Activesync over Wifi</h2>
                    Hi i have a Samsumg Omnia, PC running Vista, and a D-Link modem/router. My pc is connected to my modem via Ethernet. I have my Omnia connected to router via Wifi. The omnia works fine with the Wifi browsing the net. I was just wondering if i am able to
 network the Omnia with my pc through activesync over the Wifi connection. I have used the Add Wireless device tool to search for wireless devices connected to my network but it did not detect it.<br />
<br />
The main reason i want to do this is i have Mobiola Web Camera program installed, this turns your phone into a web camera, it connects to the phone usinga activesync either by usb (works great although the usb cable is really short) or via Wifi<br />
<br />
If anyone can give me any help it would be greatly appreciated

    <title>Migrating from Google Apps to Office 365 when Microsoft accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> watcherjoshua  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migrating from Google Apps to Office 365 when Microsoft accounts already exist</h2>
                    
<p>I work for a small business, and we currently use Google Apps for Business, with our custom domain, for our email, online storage, shared documents, etc.</p>
<p>We have been considering switching to Office 365, in part due to the tight integration of OneDrive with Windows 10, much larger amount of storage, and better compatibility with the desktop Outlook software.</p>
<p>From what little research I have done, it sounds like the migration is fairly simple, but I have one additional concern: many employees already have Microsoft accounts using our work email addresses. Our company cell phones are Windows phones, and we make
 extensive use of OneDrive for sharing and storing photographs taken with those phones. So, we already have free Microsoft accounts tied to our work. In addition, software licenses (primarily Office licenses) are tied to some of those accounts.</p>
<p>What happens to our existing Microsoft accounts if we try to migrate the Google Apps accounts into Microsoft accounts, when those Microsoft accounts already exist?</p>

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>For your concern, do you mean whether you can still use the existing Microsoft accounts to access the Microsoft service like Outlook or OneDrive after the migration?(If it is not this scenario, please correct me with some more information.)</p>
<p>If so, we can still use the Microsoft accounts to access the Microsoft service to view our files and content. Since I do not have a Google Apps for Business account, I used my own Office 365 account for a test. Firstly, I created a Microsoft Account use
 my own Office 365 account and then deleted my Office 365 account and removed my custom domain associated with the Office 365 test account, after that, I cannot sign in to my Office 365 service. But the Microsoft Account service is not affected and I can still
 sign in to my Microsoft Account to use the service.</p>
<p>Let us know if anything is misunderstood and we will continue to assist you.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allan</p>

<p>I am not exactly sure if you answered the question, but it might. Let me try explaining again to be sure.</p>
<p>I currently have a Microsoft account using my Google Apps for Business email address as the username: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. This account has software licenses associated with it and files saved on OneDrive.</p>
<p>If I sign up for Office 365 and migrate all of my email, does it just add new services to my existing Microsoft account? Or will there be some other kind of conflict due to a Microsoft account already existing with the username *** Email address is removed for privacy ***?</p>

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>I'd like to explain the following information:<br />
1. You will be required to create a list of Gmail mailboxes to migrate (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).<br />
Here is an article for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Migrate-Google-Apps-mailboxes-to-Office-365-665dc56c-581c-4e35-8028-6bc1e8497016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Migrate Google Apps mailboxes to Office 365</a></p>
<p>2. Since you have Microsoft account with the same name *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, when you login to Office 365, it will let you choose&nbsp;either of the two accounts to login (Office 365 or Microsoft account). So it won't affect your existing Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jim</p>

    <title>Windows 10 is really just Windows 8.2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barthumphries  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 is really just Windows 8.2</h2>
                    <p>This isn't a Windows 10 technical preview, it's a Windows 8.2 consumer preview because there's nothing technical about this preview. There's no ADK, no API, no method changes, as far as any of us non-Microsoft employees can tell, there really aren't any
 changes from Windows 8.1 other than:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows button instead of a Start button</li><li>Metro menu has been shoved into the Start menu. &nbsp;Only a few apps to start with, but more can be added so that the Start menu fills the whole screen</li><li>Search and "task view" icons on the taskbar that can't be gotten rid of.</li></ul>
<p>That's not a completely new version of Windows, it's just some slight features changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft: No, it's really different, we promise!</p>
<p>Us: Ok, how?</p>
<p>Microsoft: Well, we can't tell you yet, but it will be different. &nbsp;We'll have Cortana!</p>
<p>Us: Do you have that now?</p>
<p>Microsoft: No, but we've added some drop shadows that we didn't have before!</p>
<p>Us: Seriously, that's the big difference that you're highlighting, drop shadows?</p>
<p>Microsoft: Uhm, uhm, you can search from the desktop!</p>
<p>Us: How does this qualify as a completely new version again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Metro app icons are still as clunky as ever -- a giant desert of a weird random color surrounding a single small icon with the name underneath (or you can make it a small icon and remove the name). &nbsp;If we wanted large icons on the desktop we would have increased
 icon size but Microsoft thinks we're all going blind and need ginormous icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is still in love with horizontal scrolling, despite that practice being a big no-no in web development, Microsoft somehow thinks we'll welcome it on the desktop. &nbsp;Metro apps on the Start menu arrange themselves horizontally by default. &nbsp;Even if
 you only have 7, and they're all small, you can't put them in a column so you'll have a giant dessert of whitespace underneath them on the Start menu. &nbsp;If you drag "documents" over to the right side of the start menu, you go from a normal favicon to a giant
 folder image for old blind people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, other than the Metro screen being shoved into the Start menu, there's nothing new. &nbsp;There're promises of more, and when those resolve perhaps I'll change my mind. &nbsp;Until then, I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that's the lamp
 of experience. &nbsp;There's nothing in this consumer preview that's technical in any way.</p>

            <p>Every version is just a few slight features changed. 2000 to XP was just a different color taskbar for the most part.&nbsp; Blue instead of gray.&nbsp; That's also why the internal versions reflect the true amount of changes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows NT<strong> 4.0</strong> (along the same time as Windows 95)</p>
<p>Windows 2000 was just NT <strong>5.0</strong></p>
<p>Windows XP was just NT <strong>5.1</strong></p>
<p>Windows Vista was<strong> 6.0 </strong>and was a major change, mostly to take advantage of new hardware for things like graphics acceleration that were never possible before.</p>
<p>Windows 7 was just <strong>6.1</strong> and really just changed some taskbar behaviors.</p>
<p>Windows 8 was <strong>6.2</strong> and although it looked different, the big change was just a bigger (full-screen) start menu. Although it was big, it had the same function (shortcuts and an 'all programs' directory).</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 was <strong>6.3 </strong>and added some mouse functions and title bars</p>
<p>Windows 10 is just going to be <strong>6.4.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Everything is gradual.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Metro app icons are still as clunky as ever -- a giant desert of a weird random color surrounding a single small icon with the name underneath (or you can make it a small icon and remove the name). &nbsp;If we wanted large icons on the desktop we would have increased
 icon size but Microsoft thinks we're all going blind and need ginormous icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is still in love with horizontal scrolling, despite that practice being a big no-no in web development, Microsoft somehow thinks we'll welcome it on the desktop. &nbsp;Metro apps on the Start menu arrange themselves horizontally by default. &nbsp;Even if
 you only have 7, and they're all small, you can't put them in a column so you'll have a giant dessert of whitespace underneath them on the Start menu. &nbsp;If you drag "documents" over to the right side of the start menu, you go from a normal favicon to a giant
 folder image for old blind people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, other than the Metro screen being shoved into the Start menu, there's nothing new. &nbsp;There're promises of more, and when those resolve perhaps I'll change my mind. &nbsp;Until then, I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that's the lamp
 of experience. &nbsp;There's nothing in this consumer preview that's technical in any way.</p>

<p>
</p><p>+1 to most of what you are saying; however, the minor improvements are just what the doctor ordered at this point (for my purposes) and, since I was really happy with Win 8.1 update 2, I'm almost glad they are staying with it for now. Again, your observations
 are correct. It is Win 8.1.2 in disguise with a a few cosmetic changes. Maybe that's why the technical preview is so stable.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Interesting.&nbsp; Re Windows 10 first I'll say I'm delighted to see MS putting the start menu back.&nbsp; I hope they remember to consider business&nbsp;education and conversion costs the next time they're tempted to make dramatic changes to the desktop.&nbsp; Regarding the
 start menu though,&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;doesn't really give you anything you can't already get with the likes of Classic Start (which is free) or Start8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'd also like to comment on the transition from Vista to Windows 7.&nbsp; I agree it was like going from 6.0 to 6.1 which is why it's always amazed me at how almost everybody still thinks Vista was a 0 and Windows 7 was a 10.&nbsp; I've never had problems with Windows
 7, but I never had problems with Vista either.&nbsp; People can be funny about things like this.</p>

<p>In Windows 7, everything ran in the "standard" environment. &nbsp;In Windows 8, according to Microsoft, desktop programs were running in the desktop app, and so were 2nd-class citizens whose support could be pulled in a future version (and so everyone should
 convert their desktop programs into apps to take advantage of the new Metro methods before they lost their support). &nbsp;That's a pretty huge change -- there was a lot more going on than just a bigger full screen app window thing that you first saw when you booted
 in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The additional problem was that, not only were desktop programs theoretically slowed down because they were now running in what we were told was a desktop app based on top of the Metro environment, but Metro programs were similarly theoretically slowed down
 because unlike desktop apps they couldn't work with files directly, they had to call the new Metro file structure which would then call the file for them. &nbsp;There were plenty of other things that seemed like additional barriers to apps that would make them
 ever so much slower than desktop programs (not to mention the thought of having to pay Microsoft for every program released) and whether or not it was true, that was the impression that was given. &nbsp;It was bad advertising and Microsoft did a bad job of communicating
 what changes they were making and why people should want to embrace those changes. &nbsp;Microsoft's official answer was that they knew more than the customer did. &nbsp;That might be ok for Apple who only represents about 4% of all gaming platforms (according to Valve's
 Steam survey) and just barely 20% of all browsing experience (judging by how many websites are hit by Safari, and most of those are probably iPhones and not desktop Macs), but for Windows, with their much greater audience size, they couldn't get away with
 telling their customers that they didn't know jack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure there are things about Windows 10 that will similarly annoy and/or anger people, and I'm glad Microsoft has wised up enough to seek out some minor feedback, but Microsoft apparently doesn't want to tell anyone about any real changesfor several more
 months, and doesn't want toreceive any feedback on whatever those changes are. &nbsp;From that viewpoint, this whole feedback thing is a sham. &nbsp;"Hey, we want you to give us lots of feedback. &nbsp;Not on anything substantial, mind you, but how do you feel about the
 Metro screen being moved to the Start menu on the desktop instead?" &nbsp;I doubt, by the time Microsoft feels ready to release any actually technical information, that they'll still be collecting feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a technical preview. &nbsp;This is a consumer preview. &nbsp;When technical information, methods, API's, APK's, etc., are released, then it can be a technical preview.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That statement&nbsp;is so far from correct it's just funny. It's a Tech Preview designed to allow techies and enthusiasts to give feedback on the new features included in this build, as such this preview isn't stable and is prone to crash which therefore means
 that consumers shouldn't be using it. A Consumer Preview will come along later when most, if not all, of the features that will be in the final release are implemented. Not only that but the Consumer Preview will be far more stable.

<p>This is the single biggest thing that destroys the Windows experience.&nbsp; Horizontal scrolling is a huge disaster and Microsoft should either double down and horizontal scroll everything (MSN, Bing) and notice that everyone abandons it, or acknowledge their
 mistake and retain the vast majority of Windows ecosystem users who prefer vertical scrolling.&nbsp; It's not too late for them to reverse - None of the Metro apps are useful at this point, and honestly if they scrolled vertically instead of horizontally they could
 be much more useful across all devices - yes even tablets and phones.&nbsp; There is a reason why Android and iOS scroll vertically instead of horizontally.&nbsp; It works better.</p>

            <p>Ok, here we go , again.&nbsp; It seems it, really, doesn't matter what Microsoft does to please or appease End Users there will (still) be blind, knee-jerk, arbitrary bashing and lack of awareness, understanding or appreciation.&nbsp; OMG, it does become tedious &amp;
 tiring!<br />
<br />
<br />
I won't bother to be verbose but, will touch on a couple of points as concisely as possible.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Win 10 puts Search &amp; Task View on the Taskbar but, now, get mad because those cannot be removed, as if they provided no value &amp; as if there is no good reason for them being there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the Search icon there means one can search w/out having to pop up
 the start menu 1st or use keyboard shortcuts to initiate search... nothing bad about that nor anything bad about having the wee bit of space on the Taskbar use by said icon.<br />
Task View:<br />
This is not just another way to View &amp; Select open or active windows.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is not the same as hovering across the Taskbar items or Alt-Tab.&nbsp; Task View works in conjunction w/ the (new) ability in Win 10 to have multiple Desktops.&nbsp; Thus one can have a cleaner,
 neater, more organized and less cluttered Desktop experience.&nbsp; Each Desktop created can contain related items, windows of the same 'family'; even, to the point that groups that may require different log-in info can live together simultaneously.&nbsp; It is very
 handy &amp; helpful nor, again, is the wee bit of space it takes up on the Taskbar a big deal.<br />
<br />
2. Win 10 is not a sequential step from 8.1, it is more than, that.&nbsp; Microsoft started working on 'Threshold' around the time 8 was released, if not before.&nbsp; A lot has been done in 10 for Enterprise but, aside from that... this OS is way more than the cosmetic
 or mechanical issues one sees on the surface.&nbsp; We had different skus or versions for different devices.&nbsp; But, now, w/ 10 ONE CODE is like a chameleon... no matter what device )phone, tablet, PC, Touch, non-Touch) the User gets the optimum experience expected
 on that particular device w/ consistency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. 10 gives people a familiar, easy to use experience. A start menu, no more '4 Corners', no Charms Bar, no restriction to APPs being Full Screen only, no need to add 3rd Party start stuff and no need to change screens to see, find or access things.&nbsp; APPs
 can, now, be treated in the customary fashion as 'windows' and w/ appealing &amp; improved ability to size, share screen, and manipulate them and all whilst staying on one screen location.&nbsp; &amp; BTW, all that is or will be possible in this area is not in the current
 Build but, will be seen shortly in further Builds.<br />
<br />
4. Yes, the current offering is "Technical Preview" (read, Beta Build) and a "Consumer Preview" is coming.&nbsp; The recent&nbsp;presentation in San Francisco focused on Enterprise &amp; that makes logical sense.&nbsp; Yet, the OS has been made available to everybody &amp; anybody,
 along w/ a request for Feedback from same.&nbsp; This is a marked change from when early OS Builds were only offered to us IT Pros &amp; Official, Registered Beta Testers.&nbsp; To say Microsoft is not interested in what End Users feel or say is categorically outrageous
 &amp; 100% false.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; The Win 10 TP should not be installed or used as an 'update' to any currently used OS.&nbsp; That should ONLY, EVER, be done once an OS is GA!&nbsp; On the other hand, to say the TP is 'buggy' &amp; or unstable, I am seeing no evidence of that;&nbsp; maybe I am just lucky,
 lol.&nbsp; So far everything works &amp; works well, it is easy to use &amp; easy to see how to use it and that's straight out-of-the-box!<br />
<br />
Sorry, but, to buy into bashing what Microsoft has, NOW, given... I can't and it is darn tough to see why anyone would.&nbsp; Sure, you can't please everyone all the time BUT, I will adamantly &amp; w/ firm conviction state that it is expected MOST people will,
<br />
I am using it&nbsp;nearly 100% of the time due to finding its 'comfort zone' to be on a very high level.&nbsp; This can be expected to increase as future Builds come down the pipe AND certainly, when we have the Final Release in hand.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
