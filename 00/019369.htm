<h2>            Error in printing images in excel</h2>
                    I have Office 2007 and I insert tif images into my excel sheet as well as arrows.&nbsp; It use to print fine a few months ago and now when I print the arrows do not completely show up. A portion of the arrow is blocked by the image and I've tried different
 format picture settings but this keeps occurring.&nbsp; Is there a software change or issue that is causing this?&nbsp; I've printed to different printers with different drivers and I still have the same issues.&nbsp; This also occurs in Word too. Please help.

    <title>Office 365 shuts down when opening a file from OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 shuts down when opening a file from OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Both Word and Excel shut down with "Microsoft Word/Excel has stopped working" as the error message whenever we try to open a file that is stored on OneDrive. That is OneDrive for Business if it makes a difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other files on OneDrive, e.g. pdf's open correctly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If we copy a file from OneDrive to the local disk, it also opens correctly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Excel in safe mode (excel /safe) will also open the files on OneDrive correctly. Consequently I disabled all Add-ins in Excel, and it still shutdown when opening a file from OneDrive. ABBYY Finereader is not installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been through <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/why-cant-i-start-my-office-2013-application-HA104011864.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<span><span>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/why-cant-i-start-my-office-2013-application-HA104011864.aspx</span></span></a> with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is unlikely to be a hardware issue as I know it has been working successfully with this hardware combination previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last 3 weeks there have been 2 updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security Update - KB2993651</li><li>Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.320</li></ul>
<p>This is new behaviour - that is it was working well in this exact process, until a week or two ago. The user for this PC is not at her computer all the time, and was unable to say exactly when it stopped working, and if anything had changed in the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what else changes between normal and safe mode apart from the Add-ins?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>Darryl</p>

            <p>Found the solution courtesy of MS Support - Ricky. It was a corrupted registry entry for Office. For those who want to know, it was:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">HK Current User | Software | Microsoft | Office | 15.0 | Common | Internet</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ricky renamed it, and then let MS Office rebuild it. All seems to be working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Office 2010&#58; Inserting an Excel spreadsheet into a Word document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff_cooper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010&#58; Inserting an Excel spreadsheet into a Word document causes incorrect rendering of font in Word</h2>
                    I'm using Office 2010 Professional running under Windows XP SP3.<br />
<br />
I'm having an odd issue when I try to insert a Excel spreadsheet into a Word document.<br />
<br />
In Word, I'm selecting Insert-&gt;Tables-&gt;Excel Spreadsheet to insert a new spreadsheet.&nbsp; When I'm editing the spreadsheet, the font used by Word looks normal, but when I click off of it to save the changes, the spreadsheet is redrawn oddly.&nbsp; The font used looks
 like it's the same family, but there appears to be no anti-aliasing or kerning information used (i.e. the font is blocky looking and letters run into each other).<br />
<br />
I've posted screenshots of what I'm seeing at: http://jacooper.smugmug.com/Other/Support/18467689_jhFjSJ<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this happening and if so, has anyone found a solution? <br />
<br />
I've posted a similar question internally in our organization and have found a number of other people having the same issue.&nbsp; So far the most common solution is to use Open Office. :-)&nbsp; I'm sure you'd rather have us use a Microsoft-centric solution.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
Jeff Cooper<br />

<h2>            How do I move an attachment field from 1 table to another</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need to move an attachment field from my "products" table to my "marketing" table. The attachment is a picture of the product.</p>
<p>The tables are related by "item" which is the primary key in each table. I already have an attachment field in the marketing table, and it is currently empty. After the move, I will delete the attachment column from the products table.</p>
<p>I have looked at this tutorial <a href="http://www.access-freak.com/tutorials.html#Tutorial07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.access-freak.com/tutorials.html#Tutorial07</a>&nbsp;and this accompanying blog<a href="http://www.access-freak.com/blog2007.html#BlogEntryAugust200705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.access-freak.com/blog2007.html#BlogEntryAugust200705</a>.</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY what i need to do but I dont understand code AT ALL.</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me step by step where I need to input MY information into this code.</p>

<p>I have already made the form and subform, and button as he outlined, but the "on click" event is not working...obviously because we have different table names, etc.</p>
<p>Your help is appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if an update query works for object data.&nbsp; However, you can try creating an SQL statement to update the target table.&nbsp; You will need some related field value between tables to correlate the records.</p>
<p>UPDATE [TargetTable] INNER JOIN [Source Table] ON [TargetRelatedField] = [SourceRelatedField] SET [TargetField]=[SourceField]</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps.&nbsp; Remeber, if any answer here helps you or is the solution to your problem, mark each one as such.</p>

    <title>Don&#39;t you think Microsoft should scrap the hamburger style menus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jabbar ahmed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Don&#39;t you think Microsoft should  scrap the hamburger style menus and fall back to the design principles of windows phone 8&#63;</h2>
                    Back in 2010 when Microsoft released the first version of Windows Phone, I was in awe of its UI design. The gallery app with that Scrollable image in the background , the ever so easy to navigate menus ( thanks to pivot controls) , colorful live tiles
 , smooth transition effects , et al ,made windows phone by far the most beautiful and easy to use mobile operating system. The gallery app especially was the most beautiful one any OS had at the time . I loved the design approach Microsoft took with windows
 phone , &nbsp;to offer something new , colorful and fun to use. Back then ,using a windows phone was so much fun. Sure it lacked some notable features like a unified notification system , but this was actually an advantage for Microsoft since they were in a position
 to see how other operating systems (iOS , Andriod ) are implementing these features and develop a better and unique solution.<br />
<br />
I was excited that Microsoft would do that and thereby redefine the mobile space by developing an OS that is miles apart from iOS or Andriod. But that was not the case. With every new iteration of windows phone ,the design started drifting more and more towards
 its counterparts( iOS and Andriod). It all stared with the notification system, same old 'slide from top' approach. Then gradually Microsoft started changing everything that was good about Windows Phone just to keep up with iOS and Andriod.<br />
<br />
With windows 10 mobile, Microsoft scrapped the pivot and panorama controls. Also many other features that made windows phone visually appealing , were scrapped. This is such a bad move since windows phone was , to a large extent , fun and easy to use because
 of these controls and design guidelines. Now with windows 10 mobile , we'll have to reach to the top of the page to access the hamburger style menu. This is so difficult to do in devices with large screens , and now a days 70% of mobile phones are 5 inches
 or larger in size.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There was a time when surveys showed that windows phone users were the most satisfied mobile phone users , more than andriod &amp; iOS users. I'm not very sure that we'll get similar results once windows 10 mobile launches to the public. I , personally loved windows
 phone so much so that I thought I would never switch. But now with Microsoft doing what it's doing with windows 10 mobile , I guess I'll have to reconsider. &nbsp;I'm very sure that there are millions of other users who feel the same way that &nbsp;I do , about the
 needless changes Microsoft made in windows 10 mobile.<br />
<br />
This is a humble request to Microsoft to give us back those glorious days when windows phone was fun and easy to use , when it was nothing like iOS or andriod. Give us the privilege to be different and unique again.&nbsp;

<h2>            Last Build.......&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>why from Insider preview official page (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced) is possible to download only 17127 release .ISO file, and Windows Update fast ring service can upgrade to 17661 release??? The distance
 between 17127 and 17661 releases is very long, don't you think?</p>

            Those of us that are on Step Ahead have had a number of builds.&nbsp; Step Ahead started at 17600+ just so there was space if the 1803 updates needed more builds.<br />
17134.1 is available through the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; It is the public release of 1803.

</p><p>The next ISO will be of a new Build that is Released to Slow Ring when it is Stable enough for them.</p>

<h2>            &#64;mentions not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We recently migrated to Office 365 from Lotus Notes, with our users on a Business Essentials package.</p>
<p>All computers had Office 2013 or 2016 OEM/retail Home &amp; Business with Outlook installed on them before the transition</p>
<p>I noticed today that the @mention is not working on our Outlook 2016 installs? I don't think it should work in OUtlook 2013?</p>
<p>From what I can see, they are on a supported version Microsoft Outlook MSO (16.0.8827.2131) 32 bit</p>
<p>I have tried doing a Quick Repair but no change. Does this have to be "turned on" somewhere?</p>

<p>Hi Al Thornquist,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply in private message. Since the issue persists on the test account, it is related to the client. I have checked the feature should be available in Click to Run
<strong>Office 365 client</strong>. Based on your screenshot, it isn’t Office 365 client. It means that the feature isn’t supported in your client. Your understanding will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos&nbsp;</p>

<li><span>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm searching for the trouble with creating my signature with embedded png or jpg images that are links. I have some local png images (and copies of them as jpgs) of buttons for social media, and embedded them into the signature, then turned them
 into links. I did this using Outlook 2007. In Outlook 2007, they looked fine and when I emailed, the signature showed my social media buttons with the links properly working.</p>
<p>I installed Outlook 2010 and now the signature images are little black squares instead of the images. If I try to embed new images of the same files they are still black squares. If I try using WORD 2010 to edit the signature html file directly,
 they are still black squares in WORD. If I view these same images under the Windows 7 explorer (viewing the folder in medium icon view), they look fine. If I open them under Google Chrome, paint, or Quicktime picture viewer they look fine. If I open with Microsoft
 Office 2010, it is a black square. If I embed the image anyway, then send the email including the signature to &nbsp;my email account (e.g. gmail) the image is a black square. For some reason, Office 2010 is seeing images as black squares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried looking at properties of the images within Word and within Outlook, but see nothing that would help. I tried looking at the jpg file properties from the Windows explorer, and even tried removing all personal properties and also unblocking
 the file, but it still shows up as a black square.</p>
<p>Any idea what is wrong or how to debug?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<p>HI,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not all images. For example in investigating your ideas, I was able to put a "Like Us on facebook" .png picture in the signature using Outlook 2010 by accessing the File-&gt;options-&gt;Mail-&gt; Outlook Options-&gt;create or modify signature-&gt;Signatures and Stationery
 dialogue. When trying to add some other pictures into the signature, they show up as black squares. It has nothing to do with Outlook itself, because if I load these same problematic jpgs or pngs into WORD 2010, it has the same behavior, showing them as blacked
 out. I shouldn't say squares because these trouble images have a white or shadow border, and the border is still there, but the rest of the image is all black. I haven't tried an Office 2010 repair, because it is a fresh installation (the first) and seems
 to function fine except for this strange quirk.</p>
<p>As such I don't think it can be Outlook AV integration. It seems to be something strange about the images themselves, or the files, that doesn't bother Windows 7 explorer, or other applications but does bother WORD and Outlook. By the way if I right click
 on a trouble file and choose Open with-&gt; there used to be a microsoft picture manager option on the menu, but now there is only OFFICE 2010. If I use it to view the image, it also shows a black square.</p>
<p>As a work around, I found some icons that do not have the problem and replaced the ones I was using with those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is what I'm now seeing in Settings &gt; System &gt; About after updating to 15058, does that mean I'm now on the public release (note no Insider Preview / Prerelease / whatever after Windows 10 Pro)? &nbsp;Want to come off the Insider program as soon as I can,
 so don't want to wait and get another update which will tie me in to the program for many more months.</p>

            <p>The answer is yes. &nbsp;All devices update to 10586.11 today. &nbsp;Public PC, Insider PC, Insider Phone. &nbsp;All. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 10586 is NOT a preview build. &nbsp;There is no 10586 preview. &nbsp;It is the public release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now insiders are on the same release as non-insiders and will be until the first Redstone build flights to insiders. &nbsp;This is why insiders got their first cumulative update ever today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insiders on a preview build do not receive cumulative updates. &nbsp;They receive new builds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't confuse the delivery channel (public versus insider) with release builds and preview builds. &nbsp;Insiders simply got their 10586 public release through the insider channel but that did not make 10586 a preview.</p>

                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an excel spreadsheet with a long list in it. &nbsp;I need to&nbsp;iteratively include the data in each cell into a repeated sentence within the same document. &nbsp;I'm thinking mergefields, but I don't know how to pull this off. &nbsp;I'd really appreciate your help.</div>

            Yes, you can use mail merge.&nbsp; It might be best if you use a directory merge.&nbsp; To do this, click the Start Mail Merge button on the Mailing ribbon and select Directory then click on the Select Recipients button and select Use Existing List, browse to your
 spreadsheet (make sure it has a single row of column headings).&nbsp; When you've selected the data source, type your sentence using the Insert Merge Field button on the Mailings ribbon to insert the fields at the relevant points.&nbsp; Make sure you press Enter when
 you have written the sentence.&nbsp; Now click on the Finish &amp; Merge button and select Edit Individual Documents, merge All records and you should now have&nbsp; a new document containing a list of sentences with the different words.

    <title>How do I delete that annoying profile picture attached to my - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I delete that annoying profile picture attached to my emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm finding this all very frustrating!</p>

<p>Like other posters, I can't seem to remove the 8 year old or so photograph (that I didn't even remember uploading although must have done when I created an MSN account years and years ago that I haven't used for eons!) that is attached to my emails. I do
 not want my email recipients viewing this outdated or indeed ANY photograph of myself.</p>
<p>I have tried to tag onto one of the previous posts about this issue but can't seem to add a comment or click the Had this question, Me Too button. Why have it there if it cant be clicked!!</p>
<p>In the end I have resorted to creating a small blank white file in the Paint programme and uploading this as my profile picture. I'd like to know where these pictures are stored - I have no idea what other photographs are attached to this account! How can
 I find them and delete them?</p>

<p><strong>I am very seriously considering deleting this account altogether and switching to GoogleMail.</strong></p>

<p>The latest Microsoft software is more like a virus than something you'd actually want to use if you didn't have to, sigh.&nbsp; I have the same picture in my email problems as everyone else.&nbsp; I have no desire to automatically have my picture&nbsp;show up in messages
 that&nbsp;I send.&nbsp; If I wanted my picture displayed, I'd attach it myself!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it&nbsp;turns out that I finally recognized the picture -- its an old one from Skype!&nbsp; I guess now that Microsoft purchased Skype they feel free to raid its content too.&nbsp; I now need to delete my picture from Skype (where I used to like having it).&nbsp; Too
 bad.&nbsp; If you are still stuck, I suggest that you check your Skype profile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an XDA Orbit (HTC Artemis) with WM6. I can sync internal data using WMDC OK. I can see the storage card in Sync Centre but it only offers me the choice to sync with Windows Media. This doesn't let me sync the entire contents of my storage card which
 has more stuff, apps, cabs than just Media files. Why can't I see a folder on my PC Desktop with the contents of my storage card just like I can the internal data? Or why can't I see it as part of the "Documents on My Device" folder which is what one might
 expect?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I sync the entire contents of my storage card?</p>

            Thanks, Linley, I can stop banging my head against this brick wall now <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fWindowsMobile%2fWebResource.axd%3fd%3dNySzF1eivP_rMoc50GQJzcvS4MHMOEKwYrCIgDtzuzlw7GsNki3H_INlfYaLgkxFdA4ESFRtesEUXj11MHjIL5WMBvm3Pubiu_iWcnqAaGQ1%26amp%3bamp%3bt%3d633263991144971555" />.<br />
<br />
Couple of points though which I hope might be read by someone at Microsoft. 1) This should be made explicit in the documentation / help. When you can see the Storage Card offered for sync by Sync Centre and can't get it to do the same thing as your Device which
 is also in Sync Centre, it strongly implies that sync is possible. So it should be very easy to find out that it isn't.<br />
<br />
2) Why on earth is Sync / WMDC crippled in this fashion? Sync can detect the card (see above) and also can sync Media with it via WMP. Windows Explorer can also see the card and you can copy files to it manually. So clearly Windows knows it's there. Equally
 clearly WMDC and Sync Centre can sync files from main memory. So synching certain files but not others is a perverse behaviour.<br />
<br />
What possible reason can there be for this? Microsoft knows (obviously) that storage cards will be used with Mobile Devices but has disabled the backup/sync functionality for them? Most odd.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks again, Linley - have a good Mauritian Happy New Year!<br />

    <title>How to create different horizontal margins in the Header and Footer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenniferjones_03  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create different horizontal margins in the Header and Footer Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I need to insert an image into the header of a Word 2010 document.&nbsp; I&nbsp; need the header to be .5 inches from the horizontal edge of the paper.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I need the document itself to have its margins set at 1 inch all around.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I make this happen?&nbsp;
 This is what I've already tired and it didn't work:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Click header</p>
<p>2. Insert image</p>
<p>3. Click on the image and go to the page layout tab.</p>
<p>4. Go to page setup</p>
<p>5. Go to Layout</p>
<p>6. Go to Headers and Footers (it ONLY lets you adjust the vertical margins in "from edge"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I tried this:</p>
<p>1. Click header</p>
<p>2. Insert image</p>
<p>3. Click on the image and go to the page layout tab.</p>
<p>4. Go to page setup</p>
<p>5. Go to Margins&nbsp; (this adjusts the margins for both the header AND the body --- that's doesn't work)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I tried this:</p>
<p>1. Click header</p>
<p>2. Insert image</p>
<p>3. Click on the image and go to the page layout tab.</p>
<p>4. Go to the paragraph section.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Adjust the left and right margins&nbsp; (I can adjust the margins, but it seems to have NO effect on the image.&nbsp; The image still stays stuck at 1 inch regardless of the left and right margins I select in the paragraph section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advice appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Assuming your overall page margins are already set at one inch all the way around, try this:
</p>
<p>1. Double-click on the header to access it.</p>
<p>2. On the horizontal ruler (the one for the header you're now in), click and drag the left indent marker to the 0.5-inch point.&nbsp;(The left indent marker is that tiny rectangle under the indent arrows). All three markers will tag along, and your header margin
 ONLY will now be 0.5 inch from the left edge of the page. (The overall page margins won't change.)</p>
<p>3. Go to the "Right Indent" marker in the header (the up-pointing arrow at that's probably at the 6.5-inch point); click and drag it half an inch to the right.
</p>
<p>4. Now that your header margins are set, insert your graphic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked on my system; hope it helps on yours as well.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I know if I delete a user, they are removed from O365 and when I disable an account, i have to go into O365 and remove the license, but having a user move from one OU to another OU, I don't know.</p>

            Hi ParrotHead1972,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delayed response. And thanks for providing such details.<br />
<br />
I see that you have tried a test account, and the filtering could work as expected. This indicates that your AD Connect synchronization process should be okay. Given the fact that the affected accounts were previously migrated from an Exchange on-premises server,
 we need to check whether these Office 365 accounts are truly matched with on-premises AD accounts by comparing their
<strong>Object GUID</strong>. Please select one of the affected users and run <strong>
Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName username@domain.com | fl</strong> to check the item called
<strong>ObjectID</strong>, and then see if the corresponding user account from the on-premises AD has the same ID exactly. If they are not the same, we can determine they are actually not matched, which means you need to manually delete these accounts from
 Office 365. And if the IDs are the same, please post back.<br />
<br />
And another important point: how were these user accounts migrated to Exchange Online? Was it a

cutover migration</a> or any other migration method? Please clarify it.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<h2>            Search does not work in Outlook 2016 for Mac &#40;Exchange account&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The search feature does not work for me in Outlook 2016 for Mac when connected to an Exchange account (with local cache), whereas Outlook 2011 has no issues whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled to no avail, a Microsoft support rep has remote "assisted" me only to conclude that I should phone Microsoft support, and all attempts to do so and wait have ended up disconnected..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have any ideas? Unfortunately it doesn't look like the database can be recreated as per Outlook 2011. And to think, this is meant to be a 'release' version for us unlucky Office365 subscribers!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>This Microsoft Office for Mac 2016 suite is nothing but frustration. &nbsp;The only reason I've not gone back to the 2011 Outlook version is because it crashes continually in El Capitan. &nbsp;Outlook for Mac 2011 also doesn't allow me to propose a new time when responding
 to an invitation either, so I'm sticking with the newer version. &nbsp;But Microsoft really has to help us out here with all of these issues! &nbsp;And no, I'm not going back to Windows!!!</p>

<h2>            Linked in contact pictures</h2>
                    
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p><br />
I have been provided from my university with an "Office 365 Education for students" account, and I have connected it to my linked in account. The contacts have synced just fine, but their pictures have not. I can't find a setting to enable/disable syncing of
 pictures and I would like to actually have the pictures too. Is it supported?</p>

<p>Hi VangelisM,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.<br />
The information that is synchronized between LinkedIn and Outlook Web App includes first name, last name, all phone numbers, all email addresses, and all physical addresses. The contact picture is not feasible to sync in Outlook Web App. Please see the “What
 else do I need to know?” section in the below article:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/Article/Manage-LinkedIn-contact-sync-in-your-organization-8097c125-8628-4453-8138-baec6438863f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Manage-LinkedIn-contact-sync-in-your-organization-8097c125-8628-4453-8138-baec6438863f</a><br />
I understand it would be nice if the LinkedIn contact pictures can be synced to Outlook Web App as well. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:<br />

            Hi Timothy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's a Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.

<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Good John.  
<br />
<br />I'd still be sure to scan with Malwarebytes and keep it on hand as it's the latest best scanner for all types of malware, in addition to Windows Defender as antivirus which gives best WIndows performance with least issues.
<br />
<br />Do you have any performance problems at all?
<br />
<br />If not Let us know if there's anything else.

<br />If not then you can mark the post which helped most as the Answer, to help others.  A rating is also appreciated.

<p>That's a fake warning/alert.... A so-called Tech Support scam...</p>
<p>If you can't close your browser in a normal way: Open Task Manager (press Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard) and in the tab Processes end all browser processes. Make sure to not restore the browser session.</p>

    <title>MSProject duration question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stormy girl  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSProject duration question</h2>
                    I'm using project 2010 and something weird happened today. I have my start date set to 4th Aug 2014, I input all the tasks, they are not yet linked (no predecessors) but I have the task mode set to autoupdate or whatever it's called, my last task is marked
 as a milestone. All tasks start on the project start date but the milestone says 3rd august rather than 4th. Is that right? Also, if I type edays in against a task duration it adds a day on??? So if I put paint dry 6 edays it calculates the finish date as
 7 days after.&nbsp;Help, what's going on?

            <p>It always makes more sense if you can see the time as well as the date. Go to options, display, and choose a format that shows dd/mm/yy HH:mm.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that you can see the indicators column so that you can be sure that none of the tasks/milestones have the date constraint icon.</p>
<p>You haven't said what the duration of the tasks is, and especially what the duration of the one marked as a milestone is.</p>
<p>If you say 1 eday for paint to dry, it will finish at the start of the next eday, like this:</p>

<p>Go to File, Options, General and as date format select the upper one in the lis, the one that will show time of day. You will see that Project does not add or los a day, arther that sometimes it makes a atsk start at 8:00 and/or finish at 17:00 which if
 you do not show time of day may look like a day's difference.</p>

            <p>Stormy Girl,</p>
<p>Okay, your default start time is 8:00 am and your default end time is 5:00 pm, but did you set the date format (File/Options/General group) to display the time as both Trevor and Jan suggested? That's what you really need to see to figure out what is going
 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question that didn't get asked, do you have SP2 installed? If not, you need to install it immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, your zero day milestone should show a start date of 8/4/14 8:00 am if that is your Project Start Date and the milestone has no predecessor links and shows NA in the Actual Start field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would help a lot if you could post a screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other questions.</p>
<p>1. Are you using the Standard calendar or do you have a custom calendar? If custom, what are the parameters (i.e. working days and times)?</p>
<p>2. Do you have any task calendars (normally the Task Calendar field will show "none" meaning the task calendar is the same as the Project calendar)?</p>
<p>3. Do you have resources assigned? If so, do any of your resources have custom calendars?</p>
<p>4. What is the setting for Hours per day?</p>
<p>

    <title>Word 2010 not remember size of labels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bleufille  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 not remember size of labels</h2>
                    
<p>We have recently upgrated from Office&nbsp;2007 to Office 2010.</p>
<p>We use Avery A4/A5 L7163 to print our address labels.</p>
<p>In the past, once we had changed the label size, Word would remember it; however, with the new Word 2010, it seems like we need to set the label size every time we want to print an address label as the programme does not remember our selection, and seems
 to default to a Microsoft label size. I cannot see any box to tick to make Avery L7163 our default label.</p>
<p>Is there a way around this? Thanks</p>

            <p>Doug was suggesting creating a template based on a built-in label definition. You can easily do that by selecting the label and choosing New Document to create a page of the labels, then saving it as a template. You don't have to do the math to create a
 table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your question is actually a different one. You can still create custom labels, but they will be listed under Other/Custom (which
<strong>is</strong> still there in Word 2010). These custom label definitions are stored in the Windows Registry. If you want to move label definitions from one computer to another, see

            <p>If Word is not retaining your settings, you need to investigate whether there is some add-in preventing them from being saved because your experience is not typical. Most of us do find that Word 2010 remembers which label was last selected (in my case, it
 is often one I've never used but one I selected in order to answer a user question).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line here is that this is not a problem with Word 2010; it is a problem with
<strong>your</strong> Word 2010.</p>

            Hi HEDNOD1,<br />
<br />
a) What do you mean by "buffer so much while streaming online"?<br />
<br />
The reason a video buffers is because your computer needs to load the movie/Video clip through the internet connection . If the connection Isn't fast enough for the video to transfer it stops to buffer more.<br />
<br />
b) Does it happen all the time with all the websites?<br />
<br />
If it happens on a particular website, the issue could possibly be with the website itself.<br />
<br />
c) Do you have multiple applications, tabs, windows opened while playing a video?<br />
<br />
If yes, the first step is to free up some memory on your computer so that videos can load more content at a time. See the processes in the task manager that are currently running and end ones that you don't need.<br />
<br />
You may also improve the performance of your computer by following the steps in the given article.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I believe this could be Internet Explorer (if using) issue since you mentioned streamig online.<br />
<br />
<strong>Optimize Internet Explorer</strong> and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps in the given link to optimize IE.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</a>
<br />
<br />
If Optimizing Internet Explorer does little help, You may also reset IE to the defaults to see if this will solve the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>To reset IE to the defaults</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
click Tools&gt; Internet Options, then go to the Advanced tab. Click on the reset button at the bottom of the Advanced tab and select the options you would like to keep from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the link below to reset Internet Explorer settings:<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just upgraded the Ovi Maps on my device. TO my surprise the Maps interface and even the display has changed. THe application no more opens up to the Menu but directly goes to my Position. I have no choice to go to the Maps Menu. Moreover, the other services
 like weather, Expedia , and more cannot be accessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this intended?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 will not automatically switch between - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ae971  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 will not automatically switch between speakers&#47;headphones, when I connect&#47;disconnect them.</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I have possibly identified a problem with the VIA HD Audio driver in Windows 10, build 10074. I have read through several threads but I have come across none so far that covers
 my problem.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The short version is that, no matter how I try to configure the VIA HD Audio device, Windows 10 will not automatically switch between speakers/headphones, when I connect/disconnect
 them.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I can manually change between speakers/headphones by entering Playback Devices, right click on either speaker or headphones and select it as the default device. It is the automatic
 function that does not work. I have also tried to disable all enhancements on both speakers and headphones but with no success.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>For a short while I managed to get it to work automatically by installing the Via Audio Driver v6.0.10.1200 for Windows 8, x64 (that did not solve the problem) and then uninstalling
 the driver through the Programs menu (that did solve the problem). However, Windows automatically updated the driver to Via HD Audio driver to version 6.0.11.600 and now it does not work anymore.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Via Audio Driver v6.0.10.1200 includes a settings program called VIA HD Audio deck, but it does not work in Windows 10 either. Tat I have found several threds about, and that
 does not seem to have a solution.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I have an ASUS ROG G55VW-S1257H with following hardware:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Intel® Core™ i7 3630QM Processor</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Intel® HM77 Chipset</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>16GB DDR3 1600 MHz SDRAM, 4 x SO-DIMM</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>15.6" HD Full HD (1920x1080) Wide View Angle LED Backlight Non-Glare LCD Panel</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 660M with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Via HD Audio Card</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>For more information about its hardware, se link below.</span></span></p>

            <p>I had the similar problem. After connecting the headphones the sound still goes through laptop speakers.</p>
<p>All drivers were ok, and Widndows also looks ok (as it is possible :) )</p>
<p>
</p><p>What solved my problem is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Right-click on audio in tray</p>
<p>2) Playback Devices</p>
<p>3) Set Headphones as Default</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it is working now as it must work</p>
