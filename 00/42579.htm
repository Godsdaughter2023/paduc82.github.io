<h2>            Event ID&#58; 4625 and system takes a lot of time to boot.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: <span>.com/fwlink/events.asp.____Event Type: Information__Event Source: EventSystem__Event ID: 4625__</span></p>
<p>My system suddenly began taking forever to boot.&nbsp; When checking why, I found this:</p>
<p>Event Source: EventSystem<br />
Event Category: None<br />
Event ID: 4625<br />
Description:<br />
The EventSystem sub system is suppressing duplicate event log entries for a<br />
duration of 86400 seconds. The suppression timeout can be controlled by a<br />
REG_DWORD value named SuppressDuplicateDuration under the following registry<br />
key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\EventSystem\EventLog.</p>
<p>What is this about, how did it occur, and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>BC</p>

<p><span>Hi court reporter,</span></p>
<p><span>In some situations, you might not be able to use all of the memory on your device to speed up your computer. For example, some flash memory devices
 contain both slow and fast flash memory, but ReadyBoost can only use fast flash memory to speed up your computer.</span></p>

                    i installed vcdrom.exe and copied vcdrom.sys to windows/system32/drivers like instructed, but when i try to select vcdrom.sys in the install driver list it's not even visible. but when i go to said location ouside the program i find it no problem, i tried
 running the program as admin, i tried setting the sys file to full control and it makes no difference. what should i do?

            <p>There is actually an updated version that's <strong>supposed</strong> to work with Win7</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-clicking the vcdcontrolTool.exe file and choosing <strong>Run as administrator</strong> eliminates the "Cannot Open SCM: Access is denied" message, but VCdRom.sys is still not visible in %windir%\system32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently it's just not compatible with x64 versions... even if you&nbsp;run it elevated and try to&nbsp;load the copy of the driver file&nbsp;left in the unzip subdir (which is found with no problem), the message "Driver has been blocked from loading." results.&nbsp;Possibly
 whatever MVP re/wrote it either forgot about kernel mode code signing or doesn't want to pay the ($400?) annual fee to MS&nbsp;for signing x64 drivers.</p>

<h2>            System file corrupted due to bad cluster - What is it&#63;</h2>
                    Running chkdsk on my hard drive resulted in bad clusters for 3 files.&nbsp; Two files I can restore from backup but one file I cannot restore:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \Windows\WinSxS\Backup\X8B3FE~1.DLL<br />
which I resolved to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x86_microsoft-windows-a..on-authui-component_31bf3856ad364e35_6.2.9200.16728_none_d9c73f0ee10a311c_authui.dll_05ff9fd2<br />
which was created 11/13/2013<br />
<br />
I don't know what this directory and file is.&nbsp; <br />
Can I get away with ignoring this corrupted file?<br />

<p>You have a hard drive that's failing.&nbsp; Please run your hard drive manufacturer's diagnostics to confirm. You may also check with the manufacturer if the data in the corrupted cluster could be recovered.</p>

            Well, I found a backup with a good version, but I'm getting an error trying to replace the bad file with the good version.<br />
<br />
I took the hard drive and connected it to another computer.&nbsp; But when I tried to replace the file I got the error:<br />
&nbsp; <i><b>You require permission from TrustedInstaller to make changes to this file<br />
</b></i>What do I need to do to replace this file?&nbsp; I tried changing the permission and give myself Full Control but it didn't work.<br />

<p><strong>In a typical Details view in Windows Explorer there is a Type column. &nbsp;I would like to rename some of the file types. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>For example I would like to change </strong></p>

<p><strong>"OCX File" to "Application Control" &nbsp; so that when I sort by Type all my Application Files (.exe, .dll, .ocx) are all near each other.</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi dtencer,</span></p>
<p><span>Usually, file name extensions should not be changed because you might not be able to open or edit the file after doing so. Sometimes, however, changing

            <p>It is that the user must have either changed or added their memory configuration. If the person who is having the problem checks, they may see that they have different or incompatible memory. The error message for the memory issue is not obvious because
 it is pointing to the Array driver file, but the memory is causing the OS to think there is a problem in another program. Try removing one of the memory chips or the latest one added and it should work.<br />

<p>There's a bit of confusion here. While the expressions <em>log in</em>, <em>sign in</em> and

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On windows 10 my SD card is detected and shown as drive G in Explorer. When I double click on it to see the content I get the message "You don't have access to this folder" and the button COntinue with the administrator/security shield&nbsp; logo is shown. After
 pressing that button,&nbsp; a similar error "You don't have access to this folder" is given and the the option "Use the tab

<p>
</p><p>After pressing the hyperlink&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Security</span>&nbsp;the properties of the drive G are shown, but there is no tab Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get access of the content of the card.?</p>

<p>Hi Marcel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to access a drive, it could be that there is a program that is blocking you from accessing it, or that some permissions to access the drive are incorrectly configured. For us to isolate the issue in accessing your drive, kindly respond
 to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Were you able to access these drives before? If yes, what changes were made to your computer before the issue occurred?</li><li>Are there any third-party antivirus or security programs installed on your computer?</li><li>Are you able to access these drives when you connect them to a different computer?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No</p>
<p>2. Yes, McAfee Internet security</p>
<p>3. When I put the same SD card in an internal card reader of my previous Dell Laptop, I can access the files. Also on this Dell computer Windows 10 is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop that isn't working is a HP laptop with an internal card reader as well. In both cases the card reader displays a drive, but on my HP I cannot access the files as described before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate the information you have provided, Marcel. You mentioned that you have a third-party antivirus program installed. We recommend that you temporarily disable it and see if you are able to access the files from your SD card. Sometimes, these programs
 block access or overwrites security permissions in Windows 10 causing a file/folder or setting to be inaccessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help you protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn’t disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you’re done. If you’re connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update from you.</p>

<p>We appreciate the feedback, Marcel. You mentioned in your post that there is no
<strong>Security </strong>tab shown when in the <strong>Properties</strong> of the drive. Can you send us a screenshot of it? Also, is the tab seen in other folders that are saved locally in that computer? In addition, are you logged in as an administrator
 to your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly log in as an administrator and check the file/folder permissions of the drive.&nbsp; Here's how to check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the drive, then select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Security </strong>tab.</li><li>Under <strong>Group or user names</strong>, click the user name you are currently logged in to to see the permissions.</li><li>Select <strong>Edit</strong>, then select to check the check boxes for the permissions that you need, then select
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>

            Thanks. So does that mean I can just drop stuff from other folders there and it will be saved. I would do an online back up but it won't connect to the Internet that's why I want to refresh it. And I don't have a cd/DVD drive since it's a laptop and I
 don't have any flash drives.

            Hi jimmywhite
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should upgrade to 1809 through Media creation tool. Execute the below steps to go to 1809 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. A. Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Disable any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can enable it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

<p>Unfortunately this has the same result, several BSODs (Inaccesible_boot_device) then "undoing changes made to your computer.."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then 0xC1900101 - 0x40017</p>

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h2>            Windows 10 File sharing reverts to read only after every reboot</h2>
                    I installed Win 10 on four homegroup devices (2 desktops and 2 laptops).&nbsp; With Win 7, I was able to share files 'read-write' on all four devices without any problems.&nbsp; This sharing is essential to my homegroup.&nbsp; Since upgrading to Win 10, all devices have
 been signed on to the homegroup with the appropriate password.&nbsp; File sharing has been set to 'read/edit' for documents and pictures on all four devices.&nbsp; Files are than shared and edited as needed.&nbsp; However, when desktop #1 is rebooted, the file sharing permission
 reverts to read only. This happens after every reboot.&nbsp; I then must set documents and pictures back to read/edit.&nbsp; This repeats after every single reboot.&nbsp; Interestingly, the file sharing permission on the other three devices does not change.&nbsp; The only difference
 I can find between the devices is that when I view desktop #1 on the homegroup, there are two Users files - Users and Users2.&nbsp; My administrator account and all t

I did try leaving the homegroup.&nbsp; After leaving the homegroup I no longer have any access to the folder, subfolders or files.&nbsp; Before leaving the homegroup, The folder, subfolders and files were available as read only.&nbsp; This problem has gone from bad to worse.&nbsp;
 I've run error check through task manager and that didn't help either.&nbsp; When I originally installed Win 10, these files were backed up.&nbsp; I've since modified several of them and am desperate to have access.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?<br />

            <p>Good news.&nbsp; I left the homegroup again and then rebooted.&nbsp; After rebooting, I joined the homegroup using the same password as before.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Then I did the following:</p>
<p>1. I set the permissions to 'share' for Documents, Pictures, Videos and Music under Network in Control Panel</p>
<p>2. In file manager I right clicked on Documents, hovered over 'share' and then left clicked 'read/edit'.</p>
<p>3. I repeated step two for Pictures, Music and Video.</p>
<p>I had to wait for 20-30 seconds for the new settings to update.&nbsp; Since then, the homegroup file sharing seems to be again functioning normally.</p>

    <title>Adding game chat&#47;Party chat to twitch app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding game chat&#47;Party chat to twitch app</h2>
                    
<p>Its a subject talked about often by the xbox streaming community for some time now but it has yet to be added to the app. Currently the only way to get your game chat and party chat into your stream is with a slightly pricey headset, a capture card such
 as the Elgato HD60, and running your stream via OBS or Xsplit along with piles of cords going from your xbox controller, to your Mixamp, and then to your PC. The capture card alone will cost you around $180 at the least and the headset can be from the area
 of $90-$200 and then around $30-$45 for the cords to make it all happen. This seems like a lot of cash and roundabouting just to have your party or game chat added into your xbox one stream. Now not to poke fun at Microsoft or anything (the XB1 is my preferred
 system) but Sony added this into the PS4's live streaming almost effortlessly. Does anyone have any info on Microsoft considering adding this to the app or are we stuck forcing our viewers to watch us talk to ourselves?</p>

                    Running office 2016 on Windows 10. &nbsp;I have two printers with the same name (HP Laserjet 400 M401 PCL6 Class Driver and HP Laserjet 400 M401 PCL6 Class Driver (Copy 1)) that show up on my printers list in Word, Excel, and Outlook. &nbsp;Underneath both names
 it reads, "Error - Delete: 1 document waiting". This/these printer/s are not installed on the computer any more. There was a third, however, I deleted that in hopes that they would all go away and I could reinstall. I was never able to print correctly after

<h2>            how to quickly change spell check language in live essentials mail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using Mail application from Live Essentials package I write messages in different languages. Is there any way to
<strong>quickly change&nbsp;spell checker language within message window</strong>?</p>
<p>As for now I have to go for application options and change <strong>spell checker default language</strong> (it affects all messages written from that point of time - till I do not change it again). I would&nbsp;prefer to change spell checker language in real
 time within the message window (as it's possible in Outlook).</p>
<p>Did I missed something or that quick language change is not possible in Live Essentials Mail?</p>

<div>You have two ways of specifying the spell-check language: either select a
default language, or use the Windows input language. Once installed, you can
change the input language by a single keystroke. See this page for more details:

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Network</h2>
                    I can see my neighbors' wifi and even my wireless printer on the available networks, but mine won't show up and everything else in the house (phones, Roku, other laptop) are connecting just fine. I have updated the known connections several times and still
 it won't find it. I have run Windows Updates, virus, and malware scans; and even checked for an update to the wifi driver. I don't know what else to do. My laptop literally sits right under the modem and router and won't connect, but can connect no problem
 via Ethernet.&nbsp;

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Pavilion dv6 Laptop. It came running Windows 7 Home Premium when I purchased it, and it was genuine Windows. I am aware of the "Install Windows 10 on Genuine software, and you will get the equivalent of it." I installed it this evening, and
 I realize that I don't have Genuine Windows. I used the software installation from Microsoft's website, am connected to internet, and I can't figure out my problem, since I did pay for Windows 7 Home Premium in 2009.</p>

            Hi Brace.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The free Windows 10 Upgrade program ended two and a half years ago.  
<br />
<br />It is true that the left the method to activate using the old Product Key operative for quite a while longer, but I don't think it's still working.  You can try by inserting the Windows 7 Product Key into Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.  
<br />
<br />Let us know what you find.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            DVD burner&#58; Won&#39;t burn DVD. Reads and plays them fine. CAN burn regular CDs</h2>
                    
<p>Here's what happened and what's going on..........</p>
<p>Reformatted hard drive. Reloaded Vista. Reloaded Vista Service Packs 1 and 2 and all other available Vista updates.</p>
<p>Everything is working fine with ONE exeption. The DVD burner WILL do the following:</p>
<p>Reads files off DVD OK</p>
<p>Plays true DVD format disks OK</p>
<p>Plays other video files off DVD (like AVI, WMV, etc.) OK no trouble.</p>
<p>It WILL burn files to a regular CD (any files seem to work. Docs, video files, audio files are all burning to CD fine)</p>
<p>The ONLY thing it will NOT do now is burn a true DVD. I have tried using Windows DVD Maker (which had always worked just fine before) and tried other DVD burning software (Like Roxio) and both have the same problem. They both will let me add the video files
 and they both run ALL the way through the encoding and everything is looking good UNTIL it goes to burn the actual image to the DVD. It's at THIS point that it fails. The onle message I get is "Windows was unable to burn the DVD" It then suggests I try reformatting
 the disk or try the burn again. Same problem when using either Windows DVD Maker or Roxio.</p>
<p>Wierd, huh? I have searched this and other forums but nothing seems to help. I THINK I have all pertient drives and updates loaded but it sure ACTS like some driver that controls the actual burn of the image is missing or damaged or not working or something
 like that. I don't think it's a hardware issue as everything else including burning of regular CDs is working OK.</p>
<p>Any&nbsp;one have any ideas???&nbsp; ALso tried slowing the burn speed down but same problem.</p>

 to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should be able to restore with
 no problems.</span></span></span></p>

<p>No a restore won't help. I had reformatted the hard drive and started from scratch so there are no restore points previous to the reformatting available. The problem began immediately after the reformat of the HD and the reloading of all the SPs and updates
 and software, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion though!</p>

<p>Try using different burning software and see if that makes any difference (there are many freeware options available for download on the internet if you don't have more than one already installed).&nbsp; If the other software allows you to burn DVDs then it's
 a probem with the original software and I'd just uninstall it (unless it is Vista's feature then just don't use it and use the new software and the problem is solved.</p>
<p>It still sounds like either a driver problem or a hardware problem.</p>
<p><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device
 for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers, firmware and/or software&nbsp;(and you should
 for at least the CD/DVD drive), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></a><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Once
 you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows: </span>
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance the CD/DVD drive itself is defective and needs to be serviced or replaced.&nbsp; Burning DVD's is slightly
 different in the device than burning CDs or reading DVDs and that may be what is wrong with it.&nbsp; If it is still under warranty, make an immediate claim.&nbsp; If not, decide it you want to service it at a reputable local computer repair shop, the device manufacturer,
 the computer manufactuerer (if it came with the computer) or it you just want to replace it.&nbsp; If the new device also doesn't work in the same way, return it for a refund because the problem is then probably something else.&nbsp; In that case, post back and we'll
 try to check it out further.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p>As I said in the original post I've already tried other burning software and they have the problem as well. I've already gone through all the steps you suggest. There are no hardware problems detected. All the loaded drivers show as working with no problems
 although it being Vista I don't actually believe that.&nbsp;I've already made sure the drivers are current and up to date from the drive manufacturer. Even so I've uninstalled them and reinstalled them to no effect. I believe this to be another of the myriad problems
 Vista presents software-wise but am at a loss to explain this one as everything was working great until that reformat and the reloading of all the software. I'm wondering if maybe the stack wasn't assembled correctly or in the right order (for Vista) when
 I was reloading software. I had another issue some time ago that was caused by one of the Vista updates messing with the execution order and resolved that one by reloading the problem drivers in a different order. The only issue with trying that here is figuring
 out what to load in what order since it was a full refomatting and absolutely everything got reloaded. That's a lot to try and figure out by trial and error. I was hoping maybe someone here on the forums had hit the same problem and could zero in on it for
 me without having to go through all that.</p>
<p>I don't believe it to be a hardware problem with the burning array because it is just TOO coincidental that the problem occured immediately upon the refomat and reload of the HD. That being said I'm going to confirm it with a buddy's external burner as soon
 as he brings it over here. If I&nbsp; have the same problem with a completely different burner then I'll definitly know it's not the hardware at fault and I can go back to Vista bashing LOL.</p>
<p>Anyone else have any ideas?</p>

<p>The issue I have with it being Vista is that I know of no programs that control how the CD/DVD drive operates (other than that provided by the drivers, any software that came with the device, or any third party burning software).&nbsp; There are no settngs in
 Control Panel or anywhere I know that control what functions a CD/DVD drive is permitted to perform.&nbsp; I wouldn't know how to shut down DVD burning within Vista even if I wanted to do that (and that includes modifying the registry though there may be a hidden
 seeing there that I didn't see which does provide this level of control but I sincerely doubt it).</p>
<p>I understand that the coincidence is hard to swallow, but it is still possilbe.&nbsp; I'll be very interested to learn the results of you testing another drive on the system and seeing if that works - that will indeed be very revealing information.&nbsp; Please do
 let us know what happened with this test.&nbsp; It would be good if you could test your drive on their computer as well to see if has the same problem on a different machine but that may not be necessary depending on the results of the test.</p>
<p>In the meantime, perhaps&nbsp; someone else will reoly with a suggested we haven't considered.&nbsp; I hope that happens and that it works and that the drive isn't bad (as I still suspect despite the coincidence).</p>
<p>Good luck and best wishes!</p>

<p>Well when trying the external burner on my system I hit the same problem. Reversed the test and tried MY burner on his system and it worked just dandy so now at least I know the hardware is good.</p>
<p>What I was referring to above ARE the drivers. Drivers from different sources (and sometimes even from the same source/company) can definitly interfere with each other. Looks like I'm left with only one option and that is to reload everything again and keep
 trying different load combinations till the dang thing works. Arg. Was really hoping to avoid all that!</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;controlling the burner from within Vista: You can control the burn speed but as far as I know that's all.</p>

<p>Any one have any other last minute ideas before I shoot myself? =)</p>

<p><span>You may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible:</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 This may at least cut down on the time to check every combination individually (assuming it works like I think it does - I've never actaully tried it before).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry it took so long to get back to you, but I've been looking for an answer off and on and this was all I could come up with that might help.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a genuine Vista Installation Disk, we could try a system repair/upgrade to see if that resolves the problem.&nbsp; It's a fairly radical step, but it might
 solve the problem and it will certainly take less time than the procedure you were proposing when last we talked (IF that procedure would even work given that you aren't getting any error notifications in Device Manager).</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, I thought I'd post that link and let you know I haven't forgotten - I just haven't been able to find anything else of use except the re-installation.&nbsp;
 If it were my machine, I would almost certainly re-install by this point.</span></p>
<p><span>Then again, maybe the problem is already resolved in all this time - which would be great.&nbsp; I'd love to know how it was done if that's the case.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>

            Been having much the same problem with my external DVD burner. Tried several burning programs and found the only one that can do anything is tied to a movie downloader called VUZE. Download movies fron there site (long drawn out process) and it will burn
 to the DVD burner although it cost almost $30.00 a year for this. Would prefer to find one that isn't so costly. Burner is made by LG (No drivers available says use Windows drivers) Model number HL-DT-ST-BDDVD CT10L. Spend hours working with Microsoft Support
 on the phone.

            I had this same exact issue with an internal drive.&nbsp; After much searching on the internet I couldn't find any issue similar except for your posting.&nbsp; Finally it dawned on me to check my BIOS settings.&nbsp; Seems that my bios was not recognizing my disk.&nbsp; As
 soon as I did an autodetect it saw the drive and everything worked fine.&nbsp; What is amazing is that windows saw the drive and treated it as a CD-R.&nbsp; It really shouldn't have worked at all.&nbsp;I guess that is the nature of layered computing.

            <p>I have had the same problem under Vista using DVD RW+ disks which I like since they are the most</p>
<p>compatible disks with most machines and have the most robust format.&nbsp; I use the mastered format as</p>
<p>opposed&nbsp;to the "Live Files" format since a 4 GB DVD under&nbsp;"Live Files" takes about 13 hours to
</p>
<p>write.&nbsp;&nbsp; The "mastered" format is much faster (when it works).&nbsp; I have found "sometimes"</p>
<p>that erasing the disk first solves the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also writing smaller amounts of data to the disk using</p>
<p>the mastered format sometimes fixes it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is rather erratic and unpredictable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would</p>
<p>recommend having as few other processes running as possible and having lots of free disk space.</p>
<p>I have found no guaranteed solution to this problem and would really like to find one since I like to</p>
<p>write disks with the mastered format since writing 4 GB to a RW+ DVD with the "Live Files" format takes</p>
<p>several life times.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me know if you find a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would be delighted to hear one.</p>

<h2>            Playing World of Warcraft on Surface Pro 3 and game freezes with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been playing WoW on my Surface Pro 3 and it will freeze the game. I can Alt-Tab from the game but my cursor is the cursor in WoW and won't click on anything. I either have to restart or log out of my windows account to kill the game.
</p>
<p>I've had no problems before playing WoW before and this freezing has started with in the last month.
</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 and thought I went through to update all my drivers being this was a problem I read on forums. The game still freezes and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.
</p>
<p>I've already uninstalled and reinstalled WoW.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Were there any changes made in the Computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>The only change I can think off is some of the new Windows updates. I've downloaded a few apps and games, but have uninstalled most of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I get no error message when the game freezes. I did get the error message that my display driver had messed up and was successfully recovered.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have same problem but it's random, sometimes will be fine for almost an hour others just a few minutes. &nbsp;Given the horrendous problems Microsoft has had with drivers on the surfaces I am guessing it's a graphical driver issue. &nbsp;Unfortunately I haven't
 been able to find viable workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bummer, love the surface but between the driver coding falls and the erratic throttling they have hamstring the ability.</p>

            I did try that and the game still freezes. I will fixing my desktop so I can play WoW on that instead of the Surface. Once there is a fix to this issue I might try playing it again on the Surface.

            Same problem here - worked fabulously for over a year on my SP3 using Windows 8.1, now freezes regularly on W10.&nbsp; Looks like a real issue, hope they get a fix out soon.&nbsp; I may have to revert to W8.1 for now.

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have found a work around. &nbsp;As originally posted I do still think this is a driver problem. &nbsp;I have replaced the microsoft driver with the newest Intel driver from their page and haven't had the lock up problem since. &nbsp;To be honest I am not sure
 why microsoft doesn't just use Intel's driver instead of trying to tweak it. &nbsp;Another instance of developers/engineers outsmarting themselves...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used this page's instructions for process:&nbsp;http://lifeisabug.com/installing-latest-intel-hd-graphics-driver-microsoft-surface-pro-pro-2-pro-3/ &nbsp;(follow link and do process at your own risk as though I didn't have any problems nobody can guarantee anyone
 else won't.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it works for everyone.</p>

            <p>The USB might simply be defective.&nbsp; This does happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reverting to read-only is a commonly-reported failure condition for USBs.&nbsp; This USB might last for years as a read-only installation drive [before even reading data on it&nbsp;becomes a problem].</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is still under&nbsp;a warranty then contact the seller / maker for a replacement.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, just accept that you have a Windows 10 installation disk.&nbsp; This disk does double as a system repair disk.&nbsp; When you boot from it the screen containing the button for
<em>Install now</em> also has a button for <em>Repair your computer </em>and that takes you into the Windows Recovery Environment [WRE].</p>

    <title>Time zone offset problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrmymllr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Time zone offset problems</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a system where I have a Linux server and Windows clients. &nbsp;The software that is running is for security cameras, and it compares the time zone offsets between the server and client to determine what time to display for recorded video events. &nbsp;The
 problem is that Linux thinks I'm at GMT-05:00, which is correct, and Windows thinks I'm GMT-06:00, which is wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are set up for Central time, and both report the correct time despite having different offsets. &nbsp;I'm assuming Windows maintains the offset based only on time zone, then in addition applies a Daylight Savings Time (DST) offset because if I disable DST,
 the offset is the same. &nbsp;In any case, something is wrong. &nbsp;There isn't much point in mentioning the system I'm running because it's obscure and that won't help any. &nbsp;But the difference in time zone offsets is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, this happens on multiple Windows computers, XP and 7. &nbsp;An Android client works correctly, but that's based on Linux so not a big surprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what is the deal with the Windows time zone not displaying correctly?</p>
