<h2>            Elite controller bumper is semi stuck.</h2>
                    <p>Hey, my lb on my elite controller is having an issue where i can press the bumper at the peak of it but if i hit it further down on the side, as tends to happen when i'm playing it wont press. Is there a way to fix this? Has anyone had that happen? Can i fix it by replacing the bumpers? Also waaaaaaay outside of warranty so I'm trying to avoid spending the cash on a new one.</p>

            <p>The 2 bumpers are connected together, if the broke apart it can cause a similar issue&nbsp;to what your describing.&nbsp; You can purchase bumpers from amazon or ebay and there are videos on youtube on how to fix this.&nbsp; I have done a couple of them myself.</p>

    <title>Various programs overflowing underneath taskbar and past the bottom of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Various programs overflowing underneath taskbar and past the bottom of the screen</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem ever since I got this computer. I never had it on my old one, but I also never upgraded from Windows 7 on that computer. Anyway, the problem is that certain programs or games display at such a size that the window clips under my taskbar,
 and often past the bottom of the screen itself. Not only does this mean I can't see some of the window, but in some cases (like the one in the screenshot below) I can't access crucial parts of the program. My screen resolution is 1366 x 768, and can't go any
 higher. I feel like this has something to do with it, but it seems nothing can be done about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63b086f0-e102-4c07-bc00-7ccfde476410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63b086f0-e102-4c07-bc00-7ccfde476410" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this screenshot, you can see that the "Output Settings" window in this animation program keeps going past the bottom of my screen past my taskbar. Right past where it gets cut off is a setting that lets me change the framerate that the animation outputs
 as. This means that I can't access that setting to change it, so every single animation, when rendered, renders at 24 fps and not the fps I animated at, and thus is twice as fast as it should be or more. I can't change the size of that window to get to that
 setting either, so you can see how this is a problem.</p>
<p>And it's not just that program. If I try to play a game or run <em>any</em> program that doesn't have a windowed mode or a resolution setting I can change, it does this, and it's about a 1 in 5 chance I'll be able to use it functionally.&nbsp; Is there any way
 at all for me to fix this so I can actually use some of my programs? Or is it a resolution problem that there's no way for me to fix because my resolution is simply too short?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies if the topic is wrong, I honestly have no idea how to classify this.</p>

            Usually this is a limitation between how the application is design and Windows 10 itself.
<br />
<br />You can try adjusting the scaling if the screen resolution can't go any higher.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout listbox then choose a lower or higher scale to see if it helps.
<br />
<br />You can try other work arounds such as auto hiding the Taskbar.
<br />
<br />Right click Taskbar
<br />Click Taskbar settings
<br />
<br />Toggle on Automatically hide the taskbar in desktop mode and Use small taskbar buttons.

<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?

<h2>            Intermittent Active Noise Cancellation and Touch Controls</h2>
                    <p>Probably haven't used these headphones for more then 24 hours despite owning them for a week and a hald- but that's because they've been prohibitively frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I'm connected to an iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 12 - while listening with the screen off the audio will pause and the active noise cancellation will change levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can press play from the lock screen to get audio, but it doesn't always restore touch controls or the ability to adjust the noise cancellation. Two feature which I feel are key to these headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally, I can turn them off and then on again to restore desired functionality or lower and raise them again and the advanced features will come back. It's entirely inconsistent and I'd love to find a solution to this rather then replace them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restore to factory defaults a couple of times and it's entirely random when the advanced features might work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that occasionally the LE Surface Headphones will be disconnected when I'm troubleshooting which might have some correlation but no direct solution when reconnecting to that item in the Bluetooth menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've chatted with support, but they mentioned that I should get the headphones replaced since our session&nbsp; ,where I just restored to factory defaults, didn't resolve the issues. I've read about resetting firmware, but don't really know how that should look
 or what I should experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated because I'd like to keep these around for a while.</p>

<p>Hi Loyd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the experience where noise cancellation will come on and off when in loud environments, on the train for example, or high wind. But when that happens it's just the noise cancellation and not pausing the audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly when the issue I posted about I'm in an open office and nothing else is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I do experience the issues with the Noise Cancellation stopping at times and then coming back during loud, directed noises, it is rare that the music stops playing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From additional testing it seems as though this action is related to the pause while the headphones are down. While this doesn't always work, occasionally a head turn, or a jolt will turn off noise cancellation and stop the music. A quick fix is to either
 move the earcup, or to take the headphones down and back up again. Once I figured that out, I am now able to get a consistent experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the lack of AAC and AptX support is a non-negotiable and I'll be returning these headphones later today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to improvements to the product in the future, but for now I'll be an observer of the Surface Headphones from afar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Miles</p>

<h2>            Dragons Dogma. I never really knew&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>After first buying this game for the PS3 I never got past the two hour odd mark as the constant hitching it gave me on two Playstation 3's marred my experience a bit. This is not to say I didnt find the game nice looking or any less fun, far from it. It
 was more a case "I'll get around to it one day..". A few days ago though I re-bought it for the 360 and gave it a bit more time as I thought I should, seeing as, I've actually had the damn games since day one and never got round to it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Good, God! First off, it runs a hell of a lot smoother on the 360 I'll say that!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Being a total hard nut head case detroyer of worlds I am.. I started playing the game from the off with zero HUD, nothing at all, on Hard with the new fangled Hard patch they've just brought out for it and my goodness it's a pain in the ***. I die at just
 about every encounter going. The first goblin killed me from the off, but, It was fun..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The games scenery, in some parts, looks as stunning as Dark Souls with no hud but with a bit more freedom to wander. It's exactly how I wanted Dark Souls to be sometimes and wandering around at night actually feels like your wandering around like a lost
 fart through proper darkness, it's marvelous!! the stars, fires in the distance, magic fireballs lighting the way as you fling them around. I cant fault the looks of this game at all! It's easy to control as well, always a plus..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Granted I'm late to the party and all the sausages on sticks have been eaten I just thought I'd make a thread to let anyone know thats in the same boat&nbsp; I was that this game is well worth your time and money and with the new hard patch they've brought out
 that it's probably the best time to get stuck into a wonderful looking (And sometimes painful) game!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Why I never went with the xbox version to begin with I'll never know. 10/10 from me. Thats my christmas gaming sorted.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Now if they'd just hurry up with that "No HUD" patch for Far Cry 3 I'll be laughing...</p>

<p>Its a fantastic game, i think a lot of folk didnt give it chance, only issue i had was that after you finish it and start a new game, the baddies didnt scale up so it was very easy sadly, i hear they have fixed this in the upcoming patch, and theres major
 content due next year too. The pawn system is just a fantastic idea, except when they come back with rocks.</p>

<div>I have tried that new Hard patch and from what I can gather it mainly affects your character only. Your Pawns can take a beating but you'll be down from so much as a whisper from a Goblin if your unlucky. It can be brutal especially
 if you trek quite a way from any of the settlements without saving. But, I cant comment on what the hardness will be like on a new game plus as I've only just started out.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>I do wonder how it will effect it as by the end of your game surely you'll be able to deflect most damage from those said Goblins anyway, unless they do now scale with you. I'll have to get stuck in and find out.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>And I couldnt agree more with the Pawns bringing you gifts. Because I was still getting my head around the game I went to sleep one night in a Inn and woke up with the Pawn telling me the had gifts to bear. Excellent I thought, give
 it to me!</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>Ah, A rock, cheers.. And not even a funny shapped one at that! If your going to bring a Rock back it has to be a funny shape, at the very least..! Haha!</div>

<div>I think, if memory serves, it was Skyrim? I cant bleeding remember now but yes a game did engulf this one at the time. And I would say it's well worth looking into buying at some point. It's well worth&nbsp; a purchase!</div>

<div>I actually like the fact as well that there is no fast travel. I do find games that have it are a tad more, how can I put it, less involving to a degree it has to be said.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>And I have to agree there as well about the Pawns comments. They are starting to grate a little, not too much mind and it is bearable. but my GOD! I must have been told twenty odd times that...</div>

<p>One of the very best RPGs around in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could be tricky at first but once you got into the swing of things it was fantastic and I know alot of people were put off by not being able to fast travel everywhere but I loved it, actually made you explore the game and get more out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easily one of my games of 2012.</p>

<p>game starts great but lack of quests and locations makes the game drag out and it eventually descends into either an escort quest or kill x amount of enemies. Some very good ideas coupled with some not so good ones.</p>

<p>You can set up a fast travel system, but i think you can only do it in NG+ as you only get one of the required stones in your first playthrough but can buy more in NG+ 1/2/3/4 playthroughs.</p>

<div>Does the map not open up to the west? (I'm currently down the east coast at the start of the game and it looks like it's going to be quite big). Has Capcom done a two worlds 2 where the map is there but you cant explore it?</div>

                    My sister's HP Vista computer has had some really bad computer bugs for a while. Sometimes her computer would freeze when attempting to log in, and many programs would crash on her computer. I've tried to look up answers for a few of these individual problems,
 and decided that maybe updating the computer to Windows 7 would do the trick. After the update everything went smoothly for about a week, but then today my sister left her computer to take a nap, and when she came back the screen was all large and nothing
 would work when she tried to click things. We restarted the computer but it takes forever to start up (about 30 minutes to an hour) and when it reaches the desktop everything is default and none of our installed programs or documents are there. We've tried
 Safe Mode as well but it still acts the same way. If anyone can help, please answer ASAP, we are worried because there are a lot of important files that we might lose, even after backing up last month. Please let me know if the

<h2>            Computer Selects Things On Its Own</h2>
                    
<p>I have to use a remote keyboard and mouse because when I use the keyboard or mouse on my lab tap my computer will, at random points in time, select things on its own.</p>
<p>For example: (It is difficult to type a paper when the cursor will randomly move to a different part in the paragraph then where you are typing.)</p>
<p>This is making it VERY difficult for me to use to use my lab top.</p>
<p>Apparently, Windows 7 does not let you disable double tap, but I have put the setting on as fast as it will let me.</p>
<p>I do not know what is causing this problem or how to fix it. If you know what is causing it, or have any suggestions on how to fix this problem, I would greatly appreciate your help.</p>
<p>I have a Dell Vostro 1500, was Vista until I had brother reformat for me and add Windows 7.</p>

<p>As this is a laptop, disable the touchpad to see if that helps.&nbsp; If not, a Windows 7 forum would be more appropriate going forward since you're running Windows 7 and this forum supports Vista.</p>

<h2>            Won&#39;t Let Me Activate Windows</h2>
                    <p>I've had my computer for over a year. When I bought it, it had Windows 10 preinstalled. Now, out of nowhere I have an Activate Windows watermark on my screen. When I go to settings, activate windows I just get a screen that says detecting activation problems
 that runs for hours.</p>
<p>I have no idea how to proceed.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>

    <title>Windows 10... settings, games, etc.... will not save - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevingerhard1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10... settings, games, etc.... will not save</h2>
                    <p>3 weeks ago, I started getting an error message when playing Skyrim SE, essentially saying game progress couldn't be saved.&nbsp; Researched online for answers, and every "answer" I found didn't work.&nbsp; 2 weeks ago, I decide to try playing Fall Out 4, and shortly
 discover that game progress isn't saving there either.&nbsp; I had been progressing and saving in both games with no issue until the first week of December.&nbsp; Thinking it might just be a steam issue, I download a game off of Origins....... needless to say, game
 says it is saving, but nothing is saving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight I try to have a web chat, and discover my microphone volume is muted.&nbsp; End up re-configuring the microphone, take off the mute, adjust volume, but the apply button is greyed out.&nbsp; every 1-30 seconds, the microphone goes on mute.&nbsp; There is no way
 to get the setting to "save".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When checking out my game folders properties (and all folders for that matter), they are all set to "Read Only".&nbsp; I can change that setting, update the profiles, create new users...... nothing saves.&nbsp; It always reverts back to Read Only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume this is something to do with Windows 10, as I've never experienced anything like this before with other OS.&nbsp; I am not technically savvy, so I would really appreciate a simple straight forward fix if possible.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your feedback.</p>

                    <p>If Microsoft want users to use Edge over IE, then a function needs to be added, beside the file download issue, to import all stored login information from IE.</p>

            <p>Does it always take this long to set-up the 'Family' function with Microsoft? Have others reported problems with the 'Family' function of Microsoft? Maybe they've gotten so fed up with the disappointment of the promises that Microsoft has made about the
 'Family' function to protect our children that they've simply given up. I have to say, I know how they felt - I'm near to that point myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you recommend a good third party software out there that will actually deliver on their promise to protect my family and I from all the smut on the internet?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I'm a novice at using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question; when my child and/or another adult accept my invitation to join the family, do they need to accept the invite by using their Microsoft account - or can they accept the invite by using my Microsoft account? That's the only thing I can think of that
 may cause their acceptance to take so very long to be approved by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Hmm, odd. I guess we can try a couple basic things to see if it shakes something loose:<br />
<br />
Delete all the Zune files off the HDD and redownload the app. Delete Files &gt; Clear Cache &gt; Restart Console &gt; Reinstall Zune &gt; Retry purchase<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to delete your profile (profile only, not files!), clear cache, restart console, and recover your profile.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you may be in a small group of people who's ISP is acting like you are in a different region. I remember a few users from Ireland who's ISP was rerouting them through UK and messing up their Xbox marketplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you've created your Skype account after October 2016 - you don't have a Skype username. Skype accounts are now Microsoft accounts.&nbsp;In an effort to improve the sign-up experience, Microsoft now offers a new simplified method for creating
 a Microsoft/Skype account. </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This new simplified account sign-up method allows customers to either use an email address or a phone number as their Microsoft/Skype account name and only requires
<span>Email/Password</span> or <span>Phone Number/Password</span> as minimum requirements for sign-up. That being said, the system will automatically generate a Skype ID for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can provide them your registered email address/phone number, generated Skype ID or your profile information (i.e. name, address, etc.) so they can search you in Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still got more questions, please reply to this thread.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,</span></span></p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Do you receive any error message/code while editing a document in IBM Lotus Symphony?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state, and then try to open the program and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original
 behavior.</div>
<div>How to troubleshoot problem by performing clean boot in Windows 7:<br />

<div>Note: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in Step 7: to reset computer as usual.</div>
<div>If the issue persists please contact IBM Lotus Symphony support for further assistance. Refer the link mentioned below.<br />

Gears of War 3 Weapon Skins DLC Confirmed
List of unlockable content too
<p>Written by <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/PunkyLiar.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PunkyLiar</a> yesterday at 20:11 | Credit to

<div>Yesterday evening, Epic's Rod Fergusson appeared on a live stream, complete with a glass of wine, to confirm or deny several rumours about
<a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/game.aspx?gameid=3998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Gears of War 3</a> that have been floating about over the last couple of weeks. Here is a summary of that live stream, which you can watch
<a href="http://www.twitch.tv/sournothardcore/b/295241566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> if you so choose.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>Season Pass</b></span><br />
<br />
As we covered <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/n5214/gears-of-war-3-goes-seasonal.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
previously</a>, <i>Gears of War 3</i> will be getting a DLC Season Pass. The pass includes the first four pieces of DLC for the game for the low price of 2400 MSP. This means that players will be able to download the DLC for no additional cost as soon as it
 is released onto the Marketplace. If players choose to buy these four pieces of DLC separately, it will instead cost them 3600 MSP.
<br />
<br />
The four DLC packs will include new content for Beast Mode and Horde Mode. There will also be content for the campaign, and this will not simply be a deleted scene like that released for
<a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/game.aspx?gameid=1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Gears of War 2</a> ; it will be completely new content. There will also be multiplayer maps, characters and weapon skins included.<br />
<br />
As for the availability of the Pass, Fergusson had this to say:<br />
<br />
<span>...there's no limited time on it, so it will be available probably until it doesn't make sense, where all four [DLC packs] are already available, or whatever, but it's not like you have to get it on day one.</span><br />
<span>...there's no limited time on it, so it will be available probably until it doesn't make sense, where all four [DLC packs] are already available, or whatever, but it's not like you have to get it on day one.</span><br />
The pass will allow players exclusive access to the Liquid Metal weapons skin, so that you get something for your money on launch day. However, the first included piece of DLC will not launch until November, with the second piece of DLC following shortly after
 that.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>Weapon skins</b></span><br />
<br />
The weapon skins are a cosmetic addition; they will not affect the way that the weapon works at all. Skins are available for five of the game's weapons: Lancer, Retro Lancer, Hammerburst, Gnasher and Sawed-Off. Seven skins can be unlocked for each weapon by
 doing certain things in-game. <a href="http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2011/09/15/gears-of-war-3-unlockables-guide-weapon-skins-characters-mutators-executions/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MTV</a> managed to get themselves a list of the criteria for these unlocks, some of which have been confirmed previously. The criteria for the Crimson Omen Lancer and the Team Insignia Sawed-Off are yet to be confirmed.<br />
<br />

Rumours have been drifting around about Weapon Skin DLC Packs that would be available for purchase on launch day. Fergusson confirmed that there will be a total of 21 weapon skins available for purchase for each of the five weapons. These weapon skins will
 be divided into two types - static and animated. Here are videos of the animated Plasma and Rainbow skins:<br />
<br />

<br />

</div>
<div><br />
<br />
The launch day Weapon Skins will be sold in a variey of ways. Firstly, the skins will be sold in individual 'sets' of five skins. These 'sets' comprise of one type of skin for all five weapons. They will have two price points; the static skin sets will cost
 240 MSP each, and the animated skin sets will cost 320 MSP each.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, players can choose to buy skin packs for individual weapons. These packs will include all 21 skins for the weapon. There will be four packs - Lancer, Retro Lancer, Hammerburst and Shotgun - each retailing for 1200 MSP. The Shotgun pack will include
 the skins for both the Gnasher and the Sawed-Off.<br />
<br />
Finally, there will be the "Launch Collection" which will include all 21 weapon skins for all five weapons. This will cost 3600 MSP.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>Leaderboard reset</b></span><br />
<br />
Those of you who pride yourself on your position in the leaderboards will be concerned over the lead gained by those who have managed to get their hands on the game early. You need worry no longer; the
<i>Gears of War 3</i> leaderboards will all be reset at 6PM BST / 1PM EST on September 19th. This will work out as 5AM on September 20th in New Zealand - the time of the first sale in the first country to get their hands on the game on launch day.<br />
<br />
Those of you who were lucky enough to get your hands on a copy of the game early will not have your personal progress erased; it is only the leaderboards that are being reset.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>Play the campaign first</b></span><br />
<br />
If you were one of the players who tried Horde mode out in <i>Gears of War 2</i> before trying anything else, you would have come across certain species of Locust, such as the Sires, without having already met them in
<a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/game.aspx?gameid=1201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Gears of War</a>. These were intended to be introduced during the
<i>Gears of War 2</i> campaign, and some players considered this to be a spoiler for when they later tried the campaign.
<i>Gears of War 3</i> has a similar situation, so those of you who want to encounter your new Locust nemeses in the correct context will want to play through the campaign first.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>Mutators</b></span><br />
<br />
Mutators can be used to add different gameplay variables in Horde mode and Arcade mode - they can not be used in every competitive game mode. Some mutators will increase the difficulty level, but will increase the player's score as a result. Those that decrease
 the difficulty level will decrease the score too. There are also 'Fun' mutators that have no impact on gameplay or score at all. Here is a full list of mutators, and the criteria need for unlocking them:<br />
<br />
