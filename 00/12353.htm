<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus - still prompts for activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially installed Office 2013 Professional Plus - 32 bit edition. However, we did not have a valid license key. So we obtained​ Office 365, 2013 edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the 2013 Professional Plus edition, restarted the PC and then installed Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I open Office apps it still prompts to activate the old install. It is running on a Windows 7 64 bit edition PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I resolve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simon</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may have occurred due to improper deletion of the <strong>Office 2013 Professional Plus</strong> data. To assist you with your concern, we suggest that you completely uninstall it using the
<strong>easy fix tool</strong> for <strong>Office</strong>. To do this, kindly follow the steps listed under
<strong>Option 2</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8#OfficeVersion=2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note: Once you use the easy fix tool to uninstall Office, the Office 365 that was newly installed will also be deleted. Proceed to Office 365 installation after utilizing the fix it button.</strong></em><br />
<br />
Let us know it goes after performing the suggested steps.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easy fix tool did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried a manual uninstall - option 3 - that failed as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is causing the activation window to appear? Is it referenced in the registry?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your help.</p>

<h3> bennyhma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activating HUP Office 2013 Asks For Company Account ID and Password</h2>
                    <p>I purchased the Office 2013 on HUP.&nbsp; I downloaded it OK.&nbsp; At the end of download, it asks for account to activate.&nbsp; I used my company account, and it asks for password.&nbsp; I did not create an Microsoft account using my company email address.&nbsp; When I skipped
 that step, but when I open one of the office program, it came up for the same question.</p>
<p>I asked my company IT, and they said it should not show that.&nbsp; The account the activation is asking for has to associate with the company I work for.&nbsp; I have no idea what password it is, and how to get the program to activate.</p>
<p>I have the product key, and it has not asked for it yet.&nbsp; I imagine it will after I have successfully sign in with the company account, but I have not gotten to that point yet.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

            I got it working. &nbsp;I created another Windows live ID, I then&nbsp;<span>reset the phone and used that ID to create a Zune ID using it -- worked perfectly. &nbsp;Sucks that I had to do that to get

<h2>            &#34;Microsoft Security Essentials - Free Version&#34; - Security Center says Your Computer May Be Unprotected with this program</h2>
                    <p><u><em>Original Title</em></u><strong>: Problem with Icon and its wording</strong></p>
<p>I downloaded your Microsoft Security Essentials - Free Version. It was referred by a friend. I did the Full Scan and the icon on tool bar stayed green for about 2 days. Then it turned red.&nbsp; I did another full scan and it turned red the next day.&nbsp; It says
 Your Computer May Be Unprotected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Anti-virus program it replaced stayed green and never told me this. It was from a totally different company than Microsoft.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I did a Quick Scan and the icon didn't even change to green, it stayed red and still continues to say I may be unprotected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this continues, I may be forced to uninstall this program and go back to the other company as I am getting tired of having to do a Quick Scan before I go online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife also downloaded it onto her computer and she too is having the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you help?</p>

            <p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many things could cause this.&nbsp; What most concerns me is your indication that you downloaded the free version which implies a paid version was offered and there is and never has been a paid version of MSE - so I'm not even certain you have the correct program.&nbsp;
 Let's check a few things and then start from scratch to make sure it was all done right.&nbsp; You'll need to do essentially the same thing on each computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This means not only current ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:
<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:
</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Do not yet remove the one primary AV program you are using until you have downloaded the MSE file so you are protected while doing so – then uninstall and remove that program after the download but before beginning to install MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).<span>&nbsp;
</span>If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once
 done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a> and
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a> or
<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a> - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span>&nbsp; </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If so</span></b><span>: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to hide the &#35;N&#47;D when there is no references to write on my cell&#63;</h2>
                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"PROCV"</div>
Hi all!<br />
<br />
I have various sheets on my database. On one of them, I create a list of precences for a workshop. I used PROCV and it works fine. I copy the formulas down and it still works fine.
<br />
<br />
Is there any way to hide the #N/D when the is no references to write on my cell ????<br />
<br />
Thank you for any suggestion!<br />

<br />
PROCV and #N/D are terms used for a non-English version of Excel, perhaps Brazilian.&nbsp; See http://office.microsoft.com/pt-br/excel-help/procv-HP005209335.aspx.<br />
<br />
The English equivalents might be VLOOKUP and #N/A.<br />
<br />
You can avoid the #N/D error by using the Brazilian equivalent of IFERROR.&nbsp; In English, I would write:<br />
<br />
=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(...), "")<br />
<br />
where "..." represents your parameters to VLOOKUP (PROCV).<br />
<br />
In the future, I suggest that you post to an Excel forum that is specific to your language.&nbsp; I will see if I can find one; but I am pressed for time this morning.&nbsp; Perhaps someone else can offer a pointer.<br />

<h2>            Ovi Store V 2.06.00042 and network connection on N8</h2>
                    
<p>I updated yesterday to the latest version of Ovi Store as per title and have established that my handset does not disconnect the data or wifi connection after I exit the application and I have to manually close down the connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else got this bug ?</p>

Have you rebooted since updating it to see if that sorts it?

            Just tested mine again on both 3G and wifi and it successfully disconnected itself both times.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the issue is being caused by another app? Maybe it's the Qt version on your phone? It probably won't make a difference but have you tried reinstalling the store?

<p>In order of questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I seriously doubt it, I have virtually no apps requiring a network connection</p>
<p>2. Not sure what you mean</p>
<p>3. After messing about with uninstalling and reinstalling OVI Store the last time I ended up having to do a complete clean flash of handset and mass memory to bring things back to normal, I am not doing it again.</p>

<p>1. Fair enough<br />
2. Using different versions of Qt for some apps can affect the reliability of others. If you haven't knowingly experimented with Qt you don't need to consider it as a cause.<br />
3. Pretty simple really and doesn't mess up the phone but if you don't want to try that and don't consider another app to be the cause that is entirely your choice.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone else can offer a solution for you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have ripped from Cd, to Xbox Hard Drive there is no legal way to do this, however if you have purchased the music through groove, then the music should be stored in the cloud (I think) do you have a windows 10 PC/Tablet etc? you could always sync
 and see if your music is there, then you should be able to download it that way.</p>

            <p>You're not the only one having this problem. Evidently, if you don't use Facebook you can't post comments; this would leave me out if I weren't already getting my news from my Yahoo home page. Even some people who have Facebook accounts are having trouble
 posting comments to news stories, according to some of the responses in other threads.</p>

            I cant even find where to ask them the question directly... i get every link except that one... I was going to get rid of my facebook accouint but apparently you can't comment here without it... That to me is a problem. I notice this is happening on a
 lot of news sites. They should be aware not everyone has facebook and not everyone with an facebook account wants to log into it in order to comment here or else where. I'm starting to believe some of the conspiracy theorist about this whole set up.....

            Yea you can cancel facebook... the thing about it is, what ever you have posted, comments, pictures etc etc, will never go away. Upon reading up on it, I found out that they have the right (and exercise it) to keep all info that you have ever put on that
 site. It will in fact never go fully away. That is why i rarely comment online and am considering dropping my account. If that means i can't comment on other news sites oh well. I think it's highly suspect that these sites require you to have an account on
 social media in order to comment anyhow. Makes you wonder who Facebook really is, who is actually behind them, and why.&nbsp;

            I HAVE facebook and it still won't let me post. I never, ever have posted anything that was even rude so I know it is not because I've been banned. A lot of times it stops showing me everyone else's comment and replaces it a line that says "Leave a Comment"
 that is not a button at all so I can't leave a post OR see them-I can only read the article.

<p>The 950XL does have two heat pipes, because is has an other SOC that creates more heat than the 950s SOC.</p>
<p>An 950XL has a snapdragon 810 (quad core) and the 950 has a snapdragon 808 (dual core)</p>

<h2>            Outlook 16</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Office 365 and when&nbsp;I open Outlook 16&nbsp;a dialogue box opens saying "The server you are connected to is using a certificate that cannot be verified. The target principal name is incorrect". I have an option to view the certificate and
 save on the computer or continue. If I View and save the certificate I can use Outlook, but the next time I open I have the same problem so I just continue. My ISP says this is an Outlook problem as nothing has changed their side. What do I do to sort this?</p>

<p>Hi Pspeedla,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Office 365, may I confirm did you purchase Office 365 for Business or for Home?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my research, to prevent this error from occuring, use the Add a trusted certificate wizard in the SBS console to request and install a 3rd party certificate. This certificate must be purchased from a trusted certificate authority. Before running
 this wizard, you need to complete the Internet Address Management Wizard to configure your external FQDN. Be aware that, by default, the Internet Address Management Wizard adds “remote” as the prefix to the domain that you enter. For instance, if you entered
 contoso.com as your domain name, then the wizard will assign remote.contoso.com as your external FQDN. Therefore, you should use remote.contoso.com in your certificate request.</p>
<br />

<h2>            Word 2007 - security alert appears even after active-x control is deleted</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Word 2007 in compatability mode, to which I added active-x controls, but now have decided to make do with legacy controls only to avoid the security alert.&nbsp; However, after removing the controls the security warning still appears.&nbsp; I have gone
 into visual basic and there is no macro code attached to this doc.&nbsp; I have spent hours searching the web (and recently&nbsp;specifically Microsoft's site), but the results are swamped with results such as how to use the security settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even opened an Excel forum in which the same type of question was asked, (in case there were parallels), but it only stated that the VB module itself must be removed, instead of just deleting the macro in the module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried to open it using the 'open and repair' option to see if that would somehow change whatever background setting is causing this problem (getting desperate), but no joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copying the whole doc and pasting it into a new one would probably do the trick, but then you lose other data (headers and footers), and I'm not sure what else.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to have found one workable solution, although I would be glad to hear if there is another way.&nbsp; (Would be nice to know if this helps anyone else too).</p>
<ol>
<li>Save the file as a docx file.&nbsp; This will generate a couple of prompts, including one which warns you that you are saving to a Macro-free format, and that your VBA-Project will be dropped (what VBA project?, but never mind...).
</li><li>Close the file.&nbsp; This seems to be quite important, I didn't do this the first time I tried it, and when I resaved it as a doc (compatability mode) the problem still persisted.&nbsp; (Word itself was still active as other docs were also open at the same time,
 but this does not cause a problem if we just close the problem file/doc). </li><li>Open the docx file, and resave as a doc again.&nbsp; </li><li>Close the doc and reopen and&nbsp;hey-presto, the 'non-existant' VBA-project has apparently been removed, as the warning does not appear any longer.
</li><li>Throughout this whole episode, there was no visible VBA-project attached to this doc&nbsp;(at least not&nbsp;from what I&nbsp;could see in the&nbsp;VBA editor).
</li></ol>
<p>Note: when replicating the problem/fix (just to make sure I had got it right), after I added in&nbsp; an active-x control, I then got the pop-up macro warning instead of the security alert line below the ribbon, not sure why, but this fix&nbsp;works regardless of
 the type of warning (provided of course that&nbsp;you have removed <strong>all</strong> macro code and/or active-x controls).</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<h2>            Trouble with App removal CDNetstreamer2.r05&#63; Anyone heard of it&#63;</h2>
                    So I've been getting these pop up ads at random. When I'm surfing on mozilla, when I'm just cruising around my desktop moving files or doing drive modifications or what ever else. I understand when surfing the net but when I'm just on my desktop with no
 browsers open? Also when I'm in my game clients or even playing a game! I've had pop ups show up when playing Starcraft Remastered, when playing StarCraft II and also playing StarTrek Online! Also when playing around with my Logitech Gaming Software app. When
 i'm just in my Blizzard client, steam client or Arc client? Anyone ever get this? I found another file that was also in my apps and programs that i couldn't uninstall but I was able to get rid of that with a malware program and that did happen to be a adware
 file so that may have fixed my problem. Now I'm just trying to figure out what this CDNetStreamer is! Also came up as qqCDNetstreamer2.r05 when trying to uninstall it! It cant find the exe. file to uninstall it so I did a search

FYI making the user run scans multiple times does not make the defender with its infamously good reviews any&nbsp;better in doing its job</p>

            <p>That’s typically an indication that CCleaner or a similar registry cleaner type program is being used on the computer and is removing the scan history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a Windows Insider I’m sure you know MS does not recommend the use of registry cleaners and that you would not be using such a program so I’m guessing you’ve encountered a different problem. &nbsp;Frustrating, isn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you install a third party antivirus program (there are a number of good alternatives… free and paid…take your pick) and that should disable Windows Defender and you’ll have no more “annoying” concerns with Windows Defender.</p>

 It's right side up, but it's 'backwards'.&nbsp; All text is illegible, and it's not easy to use it as a sharing tool for conversations.&nbsp; IS there an easy way to fix this?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the quick reply.&nbsp; However, I followed your clear directions exactly, and the picture / video from the front camera is reversed (text reads backwards, etc.).&nbsp; I have another webcam app (Yawcam) and it works fine for both front and rear camera.&nbsp;
 There must be something else at work here.&nbsp; Again, thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I do appreciate it.</p>

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>thank you again for your direction.&nbsp; However, since both WebEx and and Yawcam work 'out of the box' without reversing the picture, I'll simply use those tools for conferencing.&nbsp; It's a shame, but the last 5 years (windows 10) things have degraded in terms
 of plug and play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for your time and assistance.&nbsp; (BTW, I did attempt those solutions, and they either were not applicable, or had no affect on fixing the reversed video problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            How can you keep the history when changing recurring appointments</h2>
                    It seems ridiculous that you can do it on an I pad which links into outlook by only charging future appointments and you cannot do it on outlook. Com or any&nbsp;Microsoft calendar. I an wanting staff to record lesson plans on their calendar but am worried
 that they will soon lose confidence when they lose their previous lessons if they make a change to the series. Come on Microsoft!

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you would like to keep the history of the recurring appointment when the series is edited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried setting the start and the end date for the appointment and are you attaching any files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set the start and the end date to the recurring appointment and when you edit it next time, it will not loose the previous information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer the suggestions by 'Diane' and&nbsp;'Mark-MBS' from the following thread link and check if it helps you.</p>

    <title>how to get auto height to work correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zamek7  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to get auto height to work correctly</h2>
                    a table I have should have the same height for all cells, yet when I select table&gt;fit autoheight, some rows are thicker than they should be, ie there is a blank line underneath the text in the cells that are thicker. I have to look over the table and manually
 adjust those rows with bigger cells than required but why is auto height not working in those rows?

<p>thanks for the detailed answer, I had read the article you suggested and a few more.&nbsp; My table didn't have merged cells but I did manually adjust some row heights before when the auto height function wasn't working on all the rows, ie some rows had blank
 lines at the bottom of the cells even though there was nothing there. the strange thing is when I forced the row height manually on the whole table and then retried the autofit feature on the whole table the larger rows came back just as before. Was I supposed
 to use the autofit feature on the larger rows only rather than select the whole table?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before posting here I did scour the internet and it seems this problem has been around for awhile. However if you think I'm still using this option incorrectly, let me know or&nbsp;I can send you a copy of the table if you think it's a bug in the software.</p>

    <title>Key Command for Clearing Highlighting from text&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Key Command for Clearing Highlighting from text&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a command for clearing highlighting from a string of text? (Applying Normal doesn't remove highlighting; in fact, there seems to be no way to specify highlighting properties in the settings for normal style at all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Are you sure about that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I see is that using the Highlight command applies the last used Highlight color. IOW, a keystroke assigned to the Highlight command only removes highlighting if the highlight color that's currently applied is what was last used. If the text is currently
 Highlighted in Yellow but the last color applied was Turquoise, using a keystroke when selecting the yellow text
<em>changes</em> the Highlighting to Turquoise &amp; deselects the text. You then have to select the text a 2nd time &amp; use the keystroke again to toggle the Highlighting Off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO, it's more efficient to just select the passage then choose None from the Highlight tool's palette... Unless you can come up with a macro such as:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Sub NoHighlight()<br />
'<br />
' NoHighlight Macro<br />
'<br />
'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Options.DefaultHighlightColorIndex = wdNoHighlight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Range.HighlightColorIndex = wdNoHighlight<br />
End Sub</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>NB: This macro is just an example that was quickly recorded. It has at least 2 shortcomings;</p>
<ol>
<li>It leaves the text selected, &amp;</li><li>It leaves the Highlight color set to None, so a keystroke assigned to the command will not apply a Highlight color until you next select one manually.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>James: Highlight color cannot be applied/removed by a Style because it isn't a formatting attribute. A comparable effect can be controlled by Styles using the
<strong>Format&gt; Borders &amp; Shading - Shading</strong> formatting property.</p>

            <p>The highlighting function is a toggle (on/off). </p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you assign a custom keyboard command such as Cmd+Opt+H to the Highlight function then whatever the setting is currently for the selected text (Red, Green, Yellow, etc) when you select the text again and press the custom keystroke, the highlight function
 toggles to the opposite... which is Off.</p>
<p>

            That happens to me aswell.<br />
<br />
If you are on the 3 Network and select their default theme, you cannot find the wallpaper as it is built into the theme.<br />
<br />
As for some others, they may be built into the theme.

<h3> brettop7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Move rows containing data from one tab to another</h2>
                    <p>I have a sheet in a workbook named "Work".&nbsp; The number of rows of data on this sheet is populated via formulas and macros so that each time the sheet is used, the number of rows of data changes.&nbsp; The minimum number of rows of data, starting from row 1, is
 8.&nbsp; The max number of rows of data can be up to 10,000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, there are always 10,000 rows of data, made up of formulas that always either show a value, or display the "" blank sting.&nbsp; I only want the rows with displayed values moved to the "Results" tab so that when users go to print out the results, Excel
 will not print potentially pages and pages&nbsp;of blank text due to the rows that contain formulas with the "" string in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I need a macro to accomplish this, but I do not know what that would look like.&nbsp; I just know that the macro should look for values, other than "", in column A on the "Work" tab and, so long as a value is listed in column A, it should copy and paste
 the entire row into the "Results" tab.&nbsp; Column A will always have values in consecutive order -- in other words, there will never be a case where the "Work" tab will have a value listed in cell A1, A2, A3, but not in cell A4, but will again have a value listed
 in cell A5, for example.</p>

    <title>Can I import a .pst file to a new excel or access file&#63; Public - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I import a .pst file to a new excel or access file&#63; Public Folders advice.</h2>
                    <p>My new job is in a very busy real estate appraisal shop. &nbsp;The shop receives job requests from the same clients (banks) repeatedly, and even requests for properties they have appraised previously. &nbsp;Their filing systems consists of paper file folders, along
 with a huge list in an Outlook Public Folders file. &nbsp;The Public Folders file contains about 30 years worth of jobs consisting of only 4 fields: file number, file date, property address, and client name. &nbsp;They reference this Public Folders file every time they
 receive a new job request so that, if it was previously appraised, they know where to locate the old paper folder stored on the shelf. &nbsp;I am desperate to create a database or spreadsheets that hold accurate client, property, and invoice information. &nbsp;My boss
 thinks of his Public Folder as a great security blanket, but I cringe when having to update it several times a day, which is done via an outdated Public Folders form. &nbsp;If I can't come up with a workable solution, I am considering finding a new job! &nbsp;Thank
 you for any advice.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think the bet you will manage is to export the PST fime to a delimited text file and import that into Excel. Then cut it down to the required field set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that PST file is backed up regularly?</p>
