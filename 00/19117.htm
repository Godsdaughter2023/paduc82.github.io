    <title>Word Starter 10 - click-to-run configuration failure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word Starter 10 - click-to-run configuration failure</h2>
                    Hi. My laptop recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 (unexpectedly as it happens, didn't seem to need permission). I've had lots of problems ever since, one of which is that I can't get into any of my word documents. I followed a set of instructions
 online to try and restart Word Starter 10, but I realise now I may have been following pre-upgrade instructions because they didn't tally with the way my system is set up now. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I uninstalled Word Starter 10 and couldn't reinstall
 it - now every time I try to get into a word document it tells me click-to-run configuration failure. Can someone advise me on what to do? Thanks.

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Offline address book &#40;OAB&#41; files were not found.</h2>
                    We have a couple of computers here that are having issues with the OAB. it seems to just remove itself and disappear from outlook, when we try and re download the OAB its asked for user name and password but will not take the user name and password, it
 will just keep promting for the username and password, We ran the Microsft office configuration analyer tool. and found the errors with the OAB when we go to re download the OAB it fails and will not download. it is only affecting 5 computers on are network
 of over 40 computers. have not been able to find a fix for this.&nbsp;

<h2>            Correct Powershell For Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I have the regular powershell and azure powershell installed for Windows 8.</p>
<p>I am able to login and run the command "Get-MsolUser" to get a list of other users, but the command "Get-Mailbox" is not valid.</p>
<p>I assume that I need a different shell for the actual mailbox commands.</p>
<p>Can somone point me to the correct powershell?</p>

<h2>            N8 - Software &#40;OS&#41; update&#58; Yes or No&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a new Nokia N8 and read some funny stories about the Update process (Anna --&gt; Belle) of this device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked myself if it would be a good idea to update and risk a good working device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions? What happens if the Update will damage the phone? Will Nokia then charge me or tell me that it was my fault to use their official update Software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's about the "USB connection lost" issue during the installation process? I didn't find a solutions for it yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happend to Nokia's Quality Control since the Ex-Microsoft-Manager-Now-Nokia-CEO is in charge?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what to do. I want to keep my <strong>working</strong> device up to date, but I also don't want to send it in, because the updated Software causes trouble. Chance is 50:50.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am in exactly the same position but I have had my N8 for about 18 months.</p>
<p>There seem to be some happy Belle users but for me, there are far too many asking how they can revert to Anna and the answer appears to be that you cannot revert back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot see any advantages in Belle and in fact it seems a disadvantage to me because it gives your N8 the look of something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have therefore decided that I do NOT intend to install Belle.</p>

<p>I tried to update, but the Update Software is confusing me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Installed the Nokia Suite under Windows 7 32-bit</p>
<p>- Rebooted the computer</p>
<p>- Started the Nokia Software</p>
<p>- Plugged the USB into the N8 and computer</p>
<p>- Downloaded the 287MB Software (Belle)</p>
<p>- and ended up in a loop (Connection lost ....)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Update Software says that I must press the power button down for 10 seconds (if the device was already on, after pressing the power button for 10 sec. the device is off). Plug the USB back into the device and wait and wait and wait .... to click "Ok"
 in the Update Software also doesn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of Update Software is that? For me as a Nokia Customer, this Update Software is annoying.
<strong>That's a fact!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With my USB ports is everything 100% or is Nokia telling me now that I must sent my Laptop to Dell to get the USB port fixed?</p>

<p>After re-connecting to PC with device off, what happens if you momentarily tap power button upon N8 (don't keep it depressed). Device has to be in

            I have myself decided not to install Belle due to the mostly negative feedback.<br />
<br />
But Naumi: I suggest you wait a bit, because a Belle Refresh is just around the corner, which is basically Lite version of Belle, for phones having lesser processing power, around 680 Mhz or so.

<p>Hi Naumi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow the advice given by aspergerguy with regards to recovering from the failed software update. If you are still encountering problems and do not feel confident in updating, please visit your local Nokia Care where they will be able to assist you.
 The advice given by Samarth619 is merely speculation at the moment (besides the description is misleading and incorrect), until Nokia makes an official announcement (which is expected within the coming weeks). Nokia has already made an official statement re-affirming
 its committment to supporting initial Symbian^3 phones with updates and improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Move Message to Trash</h2>
                    I bought a new iPad Air in June last year. All was brilliant until Septemer October time when I could no longer delete most of the emails from my Hotmail account. I get an error message saying that the messages cannot be moved to Trash. There are so many
 messages that cannot be trashed that my Hotmail account is unworkable. I have tried every remedy I have found here and on the internet generally. They cannot solve the problem either at The Genius Bar. They even gave me a new iPad but the problem is still
 there. I would so like this problem to be solved. It will soon be a year since my Hotmail account has worked. It drives me nuts. Thank you in anticipation.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Jose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply to my query. I've tried deleting "Trash" but unfortunately it only gives me the option to delete the folders that I've created myself so this option doesn't unfortunately work for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will be glad of any help. I've had my Hotmail account for well over twenty years and don't want to change it. Have no problem on my Mac or iphone. Have spent hours trying to solve it myself and with Apple Support both on the phone and in the Genius Bar.
 It seemed to go wrong following the big Apple update in September/October time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Jose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply. Taking my Hotmail Account off the iPad and reinstalling it is the only way that I can get rid of the many, many emails that won't go to Trash. Unfortunately it still continues to have the same problem as soon as I start
 trying to delete emails again. The weird thing is that when they won't delete off my iPad they actually do still delete from my iPhone and Mac!! I've even had my iPad back to Factory Settings several times to try and rectify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for trying to help. Apple too have tried but with no success. As I mentioned they even gave me a brand new iPad but the problem is just the same. Would appreciate it very much if you have any other ideas please.</p>

<p>Hello Microsoft Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your question asking if this problem has been solved, I'm afraid it hasn't. I will have soon spent a year trying to resolve this problem so I've decided reluctantly to give up and change my email address. I've had my Hotmail account for nearly
 a quarter of a century and always thought Hotmail was great to use so it's going to be a real pain to change. The trouble is my Hotmail account will hardly send any emails to trash so it is unworkable. None of the remedies online have solved it and I've spent
 hours with Apple - even being given a new iPad didn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you anyway for your interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h3> chrismorry  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Word cannot start converter sspdfcg.cnv&#34; &#40;or sspdfcg_64.cnv&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just installed MS Office Professional Plus 2019 a few days ago. I uninstalled my old copy of MS Office Professional 2010 before doing so as recommended so there should have been no residual issues carried over to the new version.<br />
<br />
Immediately and ever since, whenever I open Word or Outlook (I have not tried the other programs in the suite) within a few minutes I get the above error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read online that this is associated with Nuance products, specifically, PDF Converter. I uninstalled this software because it wasn't really working properly anymore in any event (it was an older version not recommended for Windows 2010). I also made
 sure that there were no remnants of this installation in the directory "Program Files" or "Program Files (x86)". And following other advice online I also cleansed the directory using RegEdit of any vestige of Nuance products, especially these two cnv files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this had any effect on removing these annoying warning messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So following other advice on this forum, I used the Microsoft Office repair feature from "Apps and Features" -- "Modify" using the online restore option. This caused more problems by invalidating my installation and requiring me to re-enter my Product Key
 before it would recognise the installation as legitimate. And even now I think it has converted my paid single user license for MS Office Professional Plus 2019 into a one year license for MS Office 360, which I went out my way to avoid by buying a CD version
 of MS Office Professional Plus 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all that, these annoying error messages are still appearing every time an Office program is started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have others had this persistent problem? And has anyone found the solution? I see no reason why I should pay Microsoft a support fee to properly do a clean install of one of their products without vestiges of old false error messages appearing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello André:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your link and see that it involves buying third party software to presumably ensure a clean uninstall of MS Office Professional Plus 2019. I cannot accept that this is necessary. Surly Microsoft has taken care of ensuring that their products can
 be cleanly uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder why you would be motivated to make such a suggestion. Do you receive a commission for each purchase of this product? If so, I see that as a conflict of interest in your offering suggestions of this kind on this supposedly volunteer-based community
 forum.</p>

            Well, I have suggested that software before and users have been able to successfully remove Office using just the trial version.
<br />
<br />Here is Microsoft's official tool if you want to use that:
<br />
<br />Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office:

Here is Microsoft's official tool if you want to use that: <br />

Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office: <br />

Proceed to install Office 2019 </blockquote>
<p>I followed this methodology to the letter and rebooted the computer twice just to be sure there was no vestige of the earlier installation remaining. I then reinstall MS Office Suite Professional Plus 2019 and activated the new installation.</p>

            It appears whatever Nuance installed, is still there.
<br />
<br />This is what their support page recommends users do:
<br />
<br />Please refer to the following solutions to correct this issue:
<br />
<br />Solution #1: Rename the "SSPDFCG_X64.cnv" file:
<br />
<br />    Go to "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv" folder.
<br />    Rename "SSPDFCG_X64.cnv" to "SSPDFCG_X64.OLD".
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Solution #2: Remove the "Text Converters" Key within the Windows Registry:
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the Windows registry. Before editing the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem occurs. Follow the steps below to back up the registry.
<br />
<br />    Close Microsoft Word.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />
<br />    Type in "regedit" without the quotes press Enter.
<br />    Export a backup copy of the Registry in case problems occur during the following procedures by clicking "File &gt; Export".
<br />    Save this file to the Windows Desktop and name the file "backup". (Keep "backup" for a few days and if all is well, this file can be deleted.)
<br />    Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Text Converters
<br />    Right-click on the "Text Converters" key and select "Delete".

<p>Hello again André:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I found that information not only on Nuance's website but on numerous other sites aimed at helping people with this problem. I did everything they recommended and much more in terms of ensure that the registry had zero references to not only these
 files but anything to do with Nuance since I have completely removed everything visible and invisible (by using Show Hidden Files) anywhere on my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was only after attempting to use these techniques and seeing no result that I finally resorted to trying to get assistance from Microsoft. As you no doubt know, even though my copy of Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019 is a brand new purchased and
 licensed copy, Microsoft telephone support is only available on a pay as you go basis. That is why I am availing of the "Community" to attempt to find an answer to this question which I am certain is known to Microsoft's own technicians whom I cannot access.</p>

</p><p>For your information, here is the reply I just received from Nuance. This form of corporate irresponsibility has led me to abandon all of the products they sell, of which I had at least four. Microsoft is even worse since they provide zero technical support
 no matter how recently your product has been purchased but I cannot abandon their software because it is essential to my ongoing activities.</p>

<p>Hello André:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have found the solution. At least I have my fingers crossed that this is it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went searching for those two files again ( SSPDFCG.cnv and&nbsp; SSPDFCG_x64.cnv). Previously I done several searches using File Explorer with "Show Hidden Files" selected and was not able to locate them. This time I searched manually through all of the folders
 in Program Files and Program Files (x86). In the latter under Common Files there is a folder labelled "microsoft shared" and in there I found a folder labelled "Text Converters". Inside that folder were the two elusive files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly, Word was referencing this folder every time it started to load add-ins and finding these two files. But because they were a remnant of the old Nuance installations that no longer existed, they could not execute and thus the error messages "Word
 cannot start converter SSPDFCG.cnv" (and SSPDFCG_x64.cnv).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Word after deleting the Text Converters folder and the error messages did not appear as before. I'm hopeful that this has cured the problem completely. If not, I will report back here.</p>

<p>hi michelleelliott,</p>
<p>in order to look into the situation, could you confirm the following information?</p>
<p>1. since only user management admin and global admin roles can now view and manage users’ o365 proplus desktop installations, could you let us know if you are logging in as these two admin roles?</p>
<p>2. generally, we can view user installation via office 365 admin center &gt; users &gt; active users<br />

<h2>            Calendar needed to Add is not found in Directory in Office 365.</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to add a Calendar from a Directory in O365. When I search for the Calendar in Directory, it is not there. Every other contact is there, but this one does not show up. I can see the contact in People as well as their email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any reason why this won't show up? Are there permissions that the owner of that calendar needs to provide me? They gave me permission level as a Reviewer, but this made no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our enterprise does not currently allow Calendar sharing so this is not an option.</p>

            Hi Kellen, <br />
<br />
By default, (I mean for 2 newly created users in Office 365 for example) each of 2 users can view the other user’s calendar in Office 365. This is because each user’s calendar is set up to be “users in my organization can view my free/busy information”. In
 other words, each user can open/add any other user’s calendar via “Add calendar”&gt; “From directory”.
<br />
<br />
For your situation, please make sure whether you can add the user’s calendar via typing the user’s address directly but not looking for the user in Directory.
<br />
<br />
By the way, the information I mentioned above applies for <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App (OWA)</a>. You may add/open another user’s calendar via “Open Calendar”&gt; “From Address Book” (type the user’s address directly if you can’t find the user in address book) if you are using Windows Outlook client.
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

    <title>Euro sign in Outlook &#38; Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Euro sign in Outlook &#38; Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am recently (last week) having a problem with typing a Euro sign (CTRL+left ALT+4) in Outlook and Word (Office 2016 desktop, I have a 365 subscription so it is up to date, I imagine an update was the source of the problem...).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine in Excel. I have the correct keyboard installed in my Windows 10 language settings and clearly it works in Excel, but I have no idea why it is not working in the other programs. I can type it here (€) with no difficulty. I have checked Options
 - Language in both programs and they appear to be the same as the Windows settings; I have added a new language pack to see if that helps but it makes no difference. It's very frustrating as I have to go to insert symbol instead. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>The bigger question would be why would 3 different computers lose it on at the same time and when googling the error shows the original post from '<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/547103e9-a0ea-4599-822f-53dc0d53db03" title="bclewis7">bclewis7</a>

bclewis7</a> because they said it was frustrating to goto insert symbol , so i gave the " ctrl+alt+E " solution to the problem.

    <title>Table cell margins &#47; cell spacing different within the same table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwvc - basic user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Table cell margins &#47; cell spacing different within the same table</h2>
                    <p>I'm working on some instruction cards for a model train club.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I'm using metric measurements on my document but still printing to letter sized paper (8½"x11").</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cards I'm building have to be a certain size to fit sleeves that we put the cards into.&nbsp; I'm using a table in Word to layout the cards and then I type in the information in for each card but all cards have basically the same format.<br />
<br />
The trouble occurs when I copy the rows from the first column and then paste them into the next column, being very careful to use the "merge table" paste option so that the table stays together.&nbsp; All subsequent pasted rows across the page and on to subsequent
 pages have about 1-2mm of left side space that I can't get rid of.<br />
<br />
I have checked all the conceivable options and settings for margins, cell spacing, both in the table and in the document itself and I can find nothing "off" that would cause this.&nbsp; I have compared both the "first" column against the other columns and everything
 is the same, settings wise.&nbsp; While it's somewhat easy to rectify by simply sliding the indent tab into the gray / negative zone, that throws all of the formatting math off that I've used to lay this out with.<br />
<br />
I can post up a photo to a share site if a screen capture would help to illustrate the issue.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any helps</p>

<p><span><span>I emailed the Microsoft Rewards Support Team and they gave me this answer in short:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>"Hulu Offer has been removed since 6/7/2017...&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>There are a lot of upcoming offers and promotions, so please keep an eye on your Rewards Dashboard for the latest updates."</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Unfortunately Hulu 1-month is no longer available, but Walmart&nbsp;Gift Cards are.&nbsp; If you collect&nbsp;enough points for 5 $5 gift cards, you can order a $25 Hulu Gift Card (email delivery)&nbsp;that can be redeemed for 3 months of hulu (at $7.99/month).&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 worked out the math, and basically it comes&nbsp;out to be roughly 1,950 more&nbsp;reward points per 1 free month of Hulu.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>5,250 points x 5 = 26,250 points for $25 Walmart Gift Card</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>$25 Walmart Gift Card = $25 Hulu Gift Card</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>$25 Hulu Gift Card/$7.99 = 3.13 months of Hulu</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Old Reward: 1 month of Hulu = 6,800</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6800 points x 3 months = 20,400 points (for 3 months of Hulu)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>26,250 points (New Hulu reward) vs 20,400 points (Old Hulu Reward) = diff. of 5,850 points</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5,850 points/3 months = 1,950 points more per month</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6,800 + 1,950 = 8,750 points</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>While it was still available, 1 Month of Hulu cost 6800&nbsp;reward points.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;through the Walmart Gift Cards (which is 5250 per $5 gift card), it costs roughly 8,750 per month.&nbsp; It's a significant jump in points, but still doable to get it once
 per month, especially if you're browsing with EDGE.</span></span></p>

            Just saw they added a $25 Hulu gift card as a reward but it is 28,000 points. So it still makes more sense to do like you said and pile up Walmart gift cards then buy a $25 Hulu gift card.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to move music between your phone and your micro SD card&#63;</h2>
                    


I have just recently bought a Nokia Lumia 820, an incredibly stunning device. Once I got home, I was really excited to set it up. 


I'd done the basic setup (windows live ID etc), and I plugged my new phone into my computer. First issue: Why, oh why did they change from 


the zune app (which I quite liked) to this ugly, useless piece of **** of a software. Windows phone sync is horrible. I really do hope they change 


something about that. Anyways, I continued to figure out how to sync my old music library with my new phone, so far so good. I realized that soon 


I filled my phone with music, and so I went out to buy a micro SD card, since they were talking about these being available for my phone. Once I got 


home again, I plugged it in, and the remainded of my music was put on the SD. Great, right? No. I can't download any apps because my phone is 


completely filled up with music, no big deal, I decided to look up how to switch music between your phone's hard drive and your SD

    <title>Start menu is not reliable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcsharp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start menu is not reliable</h2>
                    <p>My start menu has stopped working many times since I've started using Windows 10 preview builds, including the current build 10074. Sometimes the&nbsp;menu fails to open temporarily and works again after rebooting,&nbsp;and a few times, I had to perform a clean install
 to get it working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seeing the number of posts on this topic, it seems that many other users are having difficulties with the start menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not having a reliable start menu is quite unpleasant. Now every time the start menu is a bit slow to open. and this happens often, I get an adrenaline rush thinking that I might have to waste another two hours re-installing the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope that the reliability of the start menu will be fixed soon. This and modern apps that suddenly stop working are the top two issues that have made my life miserable as a Windows Insider.</p>

            <p>There have been problems on my install. I am currently on 10074 and a few days ago all the programs that I had pinned to Start disappeared. These were shortcuts to windows programs whilst the Modern apps Live Tiles were not affected. Also 'File Explorer'
 disappeared from the list at top left. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also seeing rendering problems with Live tiles with black marks appearing at the bottom of tiles when the animate and occasionally my Asparion Clock live tile will render as solid black.

    <title>Word &#40;possibly all Office 2016 Pro Plus products&#41; lagging - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word &#40;possibly all Office 2016 Pro Plus products&#41; lagging</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Been a while since I had no complaints and everything seemed fine. Now I got a newer laptop that is capable to do more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that 'capability' is let down by Office and especially Word. I face a terrible lag whenever something happens or a command is requested. For example, copying and pasting a picture into Word takes&nbsp;<strong>ages</strong> with the "Not Responding"
 white screen shown. Another example is when I want to put a gradient on my words. It takes so much time just to show me the gradient panel.</p>
<p>My laptop is capable enough with an Intel 8th Gen Core i5 with Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz, 4GB of DDR4 RAM, 1TB Powerful-enough Toshiba HDD, and dedicated graphics of NVIDIA GeForce MX130. This machine is relatively new at only 3 months and is capable enough
 of all other tasks BUT this. I really don't know why. I never used to suffer from terrible lag on my old laptop (Intel Core i3 4th gen up to 2.2GHz, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 512GB very-laggy HDD, and no dedicated graphics) and it was running on Office Professional Plus
 2013. So, what's the issue? Why is the 2016-er that's supposed to be better actually worse than the 2013-er?</p>
<p>I thought; maybe it's the cloud services and Intelligent Services that make it laggy, but I was not sure. If that's the case, then I'd choose to ditch AutoSave and dictation for speed.</p>
<p>Also, in addition, all this lag was actually on Best Performance mode on the charger, where this machine becomes a true beast. It's a beast, in fact, for all tasks on Better Battery and even Battery Saver, and it does them efficiently. It seems like the
 bottleneck is just Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me out&nbsp;<strong>URGENTLY?</strong> I need to stop this lag.</p>
<p>Here's the task manager performance tab. Notice that the CPU's speed is written as 1.6GHz while in actuality it's Turbo Boosted.</p>

            Hi  MGuy
<br />
<br />This may boost your Microsoft Office performance:
<br />
<br />Ope the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Display
<br />
<br />Click Graphics Settings
<br />
<br />From the resulting page, you can add each Office Application and set that to run on your Nvidia card, rather than the integrated graphics on your i5 Processor  . .

<p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>I understand what you're saying, and I'm not criticizing badly or making fun, but just a question:</p>
<p><em>What does the graphics card have to do with it</em>?</p>
<p>Besides, Intel's UHD Graphics are pretty powerful for everyday life stuff, so why not Word.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not gaming or running something excessively powerful, so why does it need graphics?</p>
<p>And one last thing, if Office needed graphics, why did they integrate it with this edition and not with previous ones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not making fun. I'm just&nbsp;<em>curious</em>.</p>
<p>I hope I find a quick solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Edit: I'm not sure what's going on. Now it's at full performance with no lag. Sometimes it lags, and sometimes it works itself off. I guess this is Office specific. Weird)</p>

            Hi MGuy.21 <br />
<br />
I have Intel UHD and Nvidia 1050Ti and just found Office to be more responsive on the Nvidia graphics card, as you say, it should not make a difference, but on my system the changeover made a difference. Also when I closed an Office application, it used to
 leave ghosting on the screen and it resolved that also . . .

<p>Hey Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I face the same issue of ghosting...and I'm not sure what's the cause, but I'll try your way if you wish.</p>
<p>I had a will to upgrade my memory with an extra 4GB to become 8GB to handle tasks more efficiently...but seems like memory is not the issue. It's fast at DDR4 and I always find my apps there in their same place. Some memory intrusive apps like Google Chrome
 take just a bit of time to remember everything, so I was quite unsure. Either way, I'm going to upgrade memory.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if yours is more powerful to do it due to 4 times the memory I have or having a desktop Intel Core i7, but I'll try your way.</p>
        </p>

<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter

<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running?

<p>Look Dave,</p>
<p>With no typing and winver&nbsp;(I already know all that you're saying. I have been here for a while and I use Windows a lot of time), I can tell you my Windows version is a bit old when it came from the manufacturer due to the big amounts of cumulative updates
 waiting for me.</p>
<p>Besides, the task view button is squared and is not the one with the scroll wheel.</p>
<p>Just to know, I'm running Version 1709 Build 16229.726 (it even says copyrights Microsoft for 2017)</p>
<p>I knew I'm waaaay behind, and that these updates will improve performance overall. I...was just postponing them.</p>
<p>And it's not my fault. It came from the manufacturer like this.</p>

                    After a major hard drive failure on my laptop I have had to re-install Office 2010 Home Student to recover some of my files. However, some of the files on my USB drive appear to now be in XLSX format and therefore cannot be downloaded back in to Excel/Word.
 How can I safe these files back in to Excel 97 format or similar.

<p>versions of excel from Excel 2007 and going forward use the .xlsx format natively.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to convert a file to the Excel 97 format, then you would need to open it in excel and do a save as to the specified format (Excel 97). &nbsp; Possibly this could be done on another machine if you are saying Excel 2010 won't open the file.&nbsp;

            Thanks Brightner I will give that a try. I have Office 2010 on my laptop now but if I try and open the files on the USB it tells me that they are corrupt, even though they were originally Excel files when saved?
