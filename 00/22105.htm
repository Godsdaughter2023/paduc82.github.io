<h2>            Antivirus for Lumia 540&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a &nbsp;Microsoft Lumia phone. I use facebook every day. my phone tells me that people outside of my friends list like my photos - my settings allow only friends to click on my pictures. It also tells me that I belong to groups that I never joined. What
 antivirus can I use to clean my phone? Thank you</p>

    <title>decimal comma vs decimal point - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave_allen1237  say:</h3>
<h2>            decimal comma vs decimal point</h2>
                    I received an Excel spreadsheet from someone who had exported the data from another programme. I thought I'd converted all "numbers" from text to numbers by selecting the "," option. I then tried repeatedly to insert fairly basic formulae into the spreadsheet
 but kept coming up with the&nbsp;<em>#VALUE!</em> error. Later I realised the problem: the "numbers" in the spreadsheet I received used a decimal
<strong>comma</strong> instead of a decimal <strong>point</strong> (per the settings in my computer) and that the "numbers" were therefore still represented as "text" in my computer. Is there an easy way to convert the "numbers" to number format or will I literally
 have to re-type every single number?

    <title>Microsoft Query broken after Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luke milum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Query broken after Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company recently just updated all our computers to the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition in order to allow better control of updates. However, this has brought a rather unwanted side effect; Microsoft Query has stopped working. We have the MSI version of
 Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, whenever you attempt to use Query from Excel, it comes up saying that it is not installed - although it does appear to open, albeit with restricted functionality (the open door icon is missing, for example). This is an issue for several of our
 staff, whom use Microsoft Query. This issue occurs on systems that were updated, and with those that were reimaged from scratch with this edition of Windows 10; we've tried reinstalling Office, we've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Microsoft Query specifically,
 we've even tried it so that it installs Microsoft Query when it first runs - and it makes no difference. The AD-based users in question have all got different rights, although they are all admins on their machines. The same issue occurs when using a local
 admin account on the computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions for what might cause this, and how we might fix it? Going back to the previous version of Windows 10 we had (which was not one consistent version anyway) is not plausible, as that then sees us at the mercy of the Windows
 Update issues we were having before.</p>

            I should also note that we've tried using OffCAT, and resolving all the issues listed; it made no difference. Same goes for trying Office 2013 and Office 2013 SP1.&nbsp; We've even tried using a laptop that has been freshly imaged and has not been put back
 onto our domain - no difference there either.

            We appear to have fixed it by installing all of the latest updates. No idea which one is the specific fix though.

<h2>            Improved text to speech</h2>
                    I am a student and I have found that having the ability on my iPhone to view my course text books and then highlight them and my phone will read my books to me, which in turn reduces the strain on my eyes of constantly looking at a computer screen. &nbsp;I
 have tried the text to speech and narrator with no success in accomplishing this simple but rather difficult task for windows. &nbsp;If by some chance this could be addressed with out the use of a third party software download, this would be so helpful to me and
 probably other students. &nbsp;Students do use windows based PC's and tablets, so this could be an opportunity to increase your footprint. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

            There are rumors that Cortana will be integrated into Windows 10. If they're true, text to speech will be greatly improved because of the better programming for Cortana's voice.

<h2>            Error upgrading E72 to v023.002</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
My phone when checked through Menu--&gt; Ctrl Panel --&gt; Phone --&gt; SW Update shows an available Phone Software update. However, the only installation available is Update via PC.&nbsp; However, when I check through Device Manager, it shows no available update for my
 phone !!<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, when I try to update through the PC using either Ovi Suite or Nokia Software Update, it correctly downloads the update, but during installation gives an error "Connection to Phone Lost" and leads to the Phone recovery screen presenting a screen guiding
 me to remove battery, followed by disconnecting charger, and then USB, and reinserting the same in th reverse order, pressing the power button for 1 sec. and then Retry. Even on following the instructions, the phone is not updated, and the only option is to
 terminate the update.<br />
<br />
Thankfully so far, the phone has neither crashed, nor lost any data (which I anyways backed up before beginning the update).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions how I could get to update the Phone Over-the-air or rectify the problems being faced while updating through the PC.<br />
<br />
For information, I'm using the version Nokia Ovi Suite 2.1.0.87, Nokia PC Suite 7.1.40.1 and Nokia Software update v 1.8.10 which are the latest available for my geographical region.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, it looks like the Internet Explorer does not work as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of steps that I believe would help you fix this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow this article to run the Internet Explorer performance troubleshooter and check if that helps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Internet Explorer Performance troubleshooter </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The article applies to Internet Explorer 9 as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-ons" mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, and then type <b>
Internet Explorer</b> in the Start Search box. </p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>Click <b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b>. Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a website doesn't display correctly in <span>Internet Explorer</span>, using Compatibility View might help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to open the websites in Compatibilty mode and check:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-9</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally you may try the steps mentioned in this link and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tips for solving problems when <span>Internet Explorer</span> crashes or stops working</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend
 that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature</p>
<span>
<p><br />
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires after 10 days from the date of installation.

</span>&nbsp;
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Keep us posted on the status of the issue. If you face any more issues while working with Windows do post on Microsoft Community.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, it looks like the Internet Explorer does not work as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of steps that I believe would help you fix this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow this article to run the Internet Explorer performance troubleshooter and check if that helps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Internet Explorer Performance troubleshooter </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The article applies to Internet Explorer 9 as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-ons" mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, and then type <b>
Internet Explorer</b> in the Start Search box. </p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>Click <b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b>. Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a website doesn't display correctly in <span>Internet Explorer</span>, using Compatibility View might help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to open the websites in Compatibilty mode and check:</p>

<p>Thank you for your help. Before I got your answer, I was thinking I had to take my computer back to where I purchased it. &nbsp; I tried to untangle the many cords at the back of my computer, and to do so, I had to unplug some of the connections and then plug
 them in again. (I was trying to label where everything went to so I would not have to get someone to set it up for me again.) Just to make sure I had all the right connections, I turned on my computer, and everything seemed to be working fine. Still not quite
 trusting it, I tried it again on Jan. 6 and 7, and EVERYTHING SEEMS TO WORK WELL AND QUICKLY.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I will keep the tips you sent me for any future problems I me face.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</p>

    <title>windows 10 Lumia 1520 language and region resets with different sim - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenny2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 Lumia 1520 language and region resets with different sim cards from different countries</h2>
                    <p><span>I had no problem with&nbsp;my unlocked Lumia 1520 running windows 8 and windows 8.1 and was able to&nbsp;set my phone's region and language. Whatever language and region that I set my phone it would keep those setting even when I moved to different countries
 and put in new sim cards (3 different countries, 3 different sim cards, the phone kept&nbsp;my settings for the&nbsp;region and language that I set). Now that I have upgraded to windows 10, windows 10 ignore my setting and reads the from the sim cards where I am and
 allows the sim card to over right my region and language settings, not only that but windows 10 allows the sim cards to delete my region and delete languages packs that I have installed on the phone. This means that at I have to reset my phone&nbsp;about 12 times
 a day (1 rest for my region and another reset for my language). Not only is it very inconvenient, but it is also draining the battery faster than normal. Is this a hidden feature in windows 10? Is this Microsoft telling us that we should learn more languages?
 (By the way I already speak two languages). Why should a sim card be able to not only dictate my personal settings but also delete stuff of my phone? I find it totally unacceptable that windows 10 has now outsource my personal setting to the sim card. It is
 my unlocked phone and I should be able to configure it however I want to. I am not a billion dollar corporation that will allow me unlimited roaming charges and cost is not an issue. I have to cut my cloth accordingly and so I have to swap sim cards. Did Microsoft
 not test this out before rolling out windows 10? Will Microsoft be issuing a fix for this? Or do I have to switch to Android. I have been a loyal windows phone user since the HP messenger which was windows 6.</span></p>

            Sorry but suggesting I use a feedback app does not a) fix the problem, b) answer the question about Microsoft fixing the "unique" feature. To also suggest that I "downgrade" my phone to an earlier version of windows also misses the point, you are basically
 say that this issue should be swept under the carpet. Neither solution is a solution, so I am afraid I can't mark the question as answered.

<p>
</p><p>I also have the same issue. wrote in a different thread and as requested by the microsoft guy wrote to the feedback app, nothing happend. the feedback app automatically puts you in the field with the same language as your phone is and it doesnt allow you
 to change it in english.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two sim cards and both are in from different countries in different languages. it is a nightmare!</p>
<p>

            I feel your pain. I am going to investigate flashing my windows phone with Android. I really like the Lumia 1520 but windows 10 on that phone is really&nbsp;made the phone is useless. I can now no longer switch languages. Great hardware let down by poor implementation
 of the software, whoever signed of on the software saying that it was ready for production should be taken to task. I am going to search for windows 10 phone reviews and start to give them 1 star and explain why, hopefully the message will get out there and
 maybe , just maybe they will fix it. For me it is possibly too late.

<h2>            Avery 5160 in Office 365</h2>
                    I am using Microsoft Word installed with Office 365, and am trying to create labels using Avery Templates. The current app does not have a template for 5160, and when I search for additional templates in the Office store it says "You already have this
 app". I am going to have to switch to another computer running an earlier version of Windows for now, but for later use, where do I find an Avery template for 5160.

            Word 2013 in Office 365 does have the Avery 5160 template:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/249a01d8-31a7-49be-b37e-3a04dae54f0c" /><br />
<br />
What may be confusing is that the list is not in numeric order, but in an "alphanumeric" order. All the numbers that start with 5 come after all the numbers that start with 4, regardless of how many digits they contain. If you looked at 11070 at the start of
 the list and concluded that there were no numbers lower than that, you're mistaken. Also note that you must select "Avery US Letter" to get this list.<br />
<br />
If you still can't find it in Word, you can download a file from <a href="http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Templates-%26-Software/Templates/Labels/Address-Labels/Address-Label-30-per-sheet-_-1-x-2-58_Microsoft-Word.htm?N=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a> Avery's site. Note two things:<br />
<ul>
<li>If you don't want their crapware toolbar, you must remember to click the "template only" option before you click the Download button. And when you do click Download, you'll be required to give them your name and address, and by default they want to send
 you advertising email.<br />
</li><li>Although Avery calls it a "template", it's really what Word calls a document (*.doc). You can't base other documents on it as you can with a real template (*.dot or *.dotx), although you can open copies of it.<br />

<p><span>Transfering songs to your Nokia E63 can't be done just by refreshing the Music Player library. You need to transfer a song first, either using your PC or sending it to your phone via bluetooth. Once you have save it in the phone, that's the time that
 you can refresh the Music Player library and it will show the number of tracks that you added.</span></p>

<p>Hi Waylon777,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To connect your phone to PC: You need to have a compatible USB cable, CA 101. And when you connect your phone to PC there will be a message on the screen of the phone it will ask you what connection you would like to use, sao choose Mass Storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also transfer using the SD card only if you have a memory card reader.</p>

<p>I;m still having the same problem.. I move my songs to the SD card. then refresh the library, somewhere around 90 to 300 songs, now new songs gets added to the library. I save my songs in a folder called "Music". Is it becuase I put like 1000 songs at once
 and refresh the library, and that's causing the system to bug? or is it something else?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Share Screens Since Update</h2>
                    <p>So today I open Skype to video chat with a relative in EU, only to discover my Skype has updated. Okay, not happy about this, but I'll figure it out. However, when I try to share a screen with him, the only screen available to share is the Skype screen itself.
 Obviously, this is fairly useless, as we are already able to see one another. Why don't I see options to share other screens I have open on my computer? I'm using Skype v.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">8.10.0.4

<h2>            Office resolution</h2>
                    <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having this never ending problem with my new laptop. It's Dell XPS 13 and resolution is 3200*1800.</p>
<p>Video card is Intel HD 5500, and is up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1:</p>
<p>All MS Office products (e.g. PowerPoint, Word, Excel) shows a tiny logo when it loads the software. (Please refer to the image.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a9f3308-c251-4dd3-8d68-4075edfb49d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a9f3308-c251-4dd3-8d68-4075edfb49d2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2:&nbsp;</p>
<p>When exported as PDF, the pop-up dialogue seems not correct: too small window and looks odd. (Image also attached.) The green status bar is too tiny and "cancel" button doesn't seem fit in the dialogue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5e25e29-f954-4c83-9074-3b7d060314a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5e25e29-f954-4c83-9074-3b7d060314a4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen the same problem as mine or could anyone guess why it happens? I contacted Dell support (gees, so many times), but they had no idea what this is. Also the system formatted twice with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your response will be highly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>As I interpret it, the first screen cap is actually 2 captures, one of your screen (on the left) and a "sample" capture you downloaded from the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please remember that 3200*1800, is a very high resolution, especially on a very small 13" screen. When you look at it in that light, the screen area is about 75% larger in both directions when compared to a "normal" HD, 1920x1080, resolution screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
 proportionally, the first image is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I agree the second dialog is "not right".&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case it appears you have problem with the video driver.&nbsp; Between the video driver and the Office applications, things are not being painted on screen correctly.

            <p>&nbsp;Thanks for your reply! I actually have the same problems across almost all software I've installed so far, and some of them are not usable at all due to the weird appearance of the interface (tiny buttons with large text, or illegibly tiny text and many
 more).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I tried changing my screen resolution to 2048*1152, and yes the logo looked right: but then the entire interface looked ridiculously large....lol</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16d19bd8-4e2c-4862-bde8-ca821395c8f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16d19bd8-4e2c-4862-bde8-ca821395c8f1" /></a></p>
<p>&lt;2048: screen looks like a tablet. Menu bar portion too big&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97e0ec9f-9e1b-4cea-aa4f-d7619f2e72ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97e0ec9f-9e1b-4cea-aa4f-d7619f2e72ba" /></a></p>
<p>&lt;3200: looks okay&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know it is hard to tell, but could you guess whether it's the incompatibility of software and my video card, or it's just the defective video card? Or is there something I can test to verify what went wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

            <p>After changing the screen resolution, there are some windows tweaks/customizations you can do to adjust the size of the Ribbon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I don't know of specific ways to test your video card.&nbsp; You could try googling for "Test video card" to find various tests.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most of the tests listed there are "speed" type tests. They may help, but you are looking for a diagnostic
 test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simplest way I know of testing the video card is to pull it out and replace it with another one. But that requires you have a "spare" card to play with, like you are in a computer repair shop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, that does suggest one idea, pulling and reseating the video card.&nbsp; It is hard to do that in a laptop. They are not designed to be opened by a user.&nbsp; Then further research showed that your laptop has a built in video card, not a 3rd party card,
 so card seating should not be an issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, since it is a new laptop, if it is still in warantee you should take it back to the store.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before taking it back, make sure to backup all of your data files and make sure you have all of the Product Keys and/or Registration numbers for installed programs.&nbsp; If it is a video "card" problem, often the simplest/"cheapest" fix for the computer company
 is to simply replace the whole computer and scrap the old one!</p>

            <p>Rohn007,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is still under Dell warranty, but since Dell wanted me to try remote service first, I sent the laptop to the Dell Depot, but received it back without no improvement. Recently, Dell checked the issue and said they would send me a new one, but actually
 they sent me a refurbished one and the same issue is seen.. That's why I hopelessly started posting online question for the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thanks so much for taking your time to answer. I appreciated it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>=====Update 05.23.2016=====</strong></p>
<p>I just wanted to leave some follow-up comments regarding this issue.<br />
<br />
Dell finally offered me system replacement few months ago, so I received a brand new system. That means I had tried three Dell XPS 13 models: 1)
<br />
I found all of them had the same issues I mentioned above, which made me wonder whether the issue comes from the compatibility between Windows 10 and high resolution screen in general. Then I wondered why technicians I had talked to were not aware of these
 issues if this was merely due to high resolution screen. I would have not wasted 6-7 months of time for something that wouldn't be fixed by system replacement...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, after realizing that even the new replacement had the same issue, I didn't try further to solve it. Hope future updates from Windows, drivers, or XPS models would solve them one by one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rohn007, I have very much appreciated your support to try help me out though! Although issues still persist, I learned a lot through the discussion.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So you are saying that the replacement machine had the same problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is strange, because refurbished machines are fully tested to be "as good as new".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to take your problem to a wider forum. Try talking to a blogger or media (TV, radio, newspaper) computer columninst who handles consumer issues.&nbsp; If it is a wider XPS issue, they may have heard about it. If they take up the issue for you to
 the vendor, often the vendor will take extra steps to resolve the issue.&nbsp; Having an unsolved problem spread all over a broadcast medium is to "expensive" in terms of bad media exposure for them to leave unresolved.</p>

            <p>Yes, the refurbished one showed the same problem as I tested a simple thing, which was disappointing. The technician and I tried many more things to adjust the resolution over the remote service while talking on the phone, but no setting could make the whole
 thing correct (one would correct something, but then others looked odd). He said they've never seen this problem before. But then I don't understand why the refurbished one has the same problem... it really confuses me whether this is software or hardware
 issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion sounds like the way to go. I will let them know that I will do whatever I can to bring this to public attention. Thanks,&nbsp;Rohn007!</p>

            <p>Since the replacement one had the same problem AND I have not seen any mention of a similar problem on other hardware leads me to believe that it is Video driver or hardware specific.&nbsp; I can't believe that every unit shipped of such a name brand can't run
 Office adequately.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For a while I thought it was a problem with "bad" 3rd party video chips.&nbsp; But, the problem with that idea is the Intel HD 5500 video chip is actually built right into the Intel CPU.&nbsp; So that makes it hard for me to believe that EVERY i5 or i7 with that video
 card will have the problem you describe.&nbsp; That pushes the problem off to the video driver, IF Dell is providing a custom driver to work with the XPS hardware (it is much higher resolution than "normal" HD).
</p>
<br />
<p>If you run the DirectX tool bundled with windows you will be able to get more specific info on the video hardware/driver.&nbsp;

            <p>You should have received an email notification that the answer had been designated (by someone else in this case).&nbsp; I posted my reply to let you know that "answer" did not have to stand. You, like most other new users here are not aware of all of the nuanced
 of the site. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't think the problem was fixed yet.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it seems like MS employees are under some sort of pressure to designate replies as answer if it seems like the question has been abandoned.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggested using the DirectX tool in order to get the video driver version number. I was hoping that DELL would say they had a newer version of the driver for you and that would fix the problem (either because it included a specific fix for this problem,
 or "accidentally" because it fixed some other separate but related issue). </p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, because it does still seem to be a video driver issue, all I can suggest is making sure you keep up with your Windows/Office updates. But there is a chance it is a Windows/Office issue that MS recognizes (not that they will acknowledge publicly
 unless they are forced to) and is working to fix.&nbsp; Maybe one of them will fix the probelm. And keep checking at the Dell site to see if they issue a new driver for your system. In which case I would suggest installing it to see if it fixes the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone else will come up with a better idea. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to search (google/bing the internet, not just this forum) for anyone else who has a similar problem with other "ultra" high definition systems.&nbsp; Maybe someone using a 4K or higher resolution monitor. Unfortunately, with this ultra high resolution
 type screen right now you are on the bleeding edge of technology. You get to find and troubleshoot unexpected problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last 10 years or so, "HD" has been "<em>upgraded</em>" (in a retrograde direction) to the limits of LCD technology, around 1080x1920.&nbsp;&nbsp; Funny thing, BEFORE that time, when I "upgraded" to my "HD" LCD monitor I was using higher resolutions on an 19"
 CRT monitor (around 2500x?) (I had switch to LCD to only because the "magic smoke escaped" from the CRT monitor, it burned out.)</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>looking for help to support a friend with Office365 Home Mac and a Office 365 Home acct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She is unable to find how to sink Outlook Mac Tasks in her Mac Outlook app, with the online Office365 Tasks. These should always be in Sync correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also can’t see her emails syncing online. We can only see them in her local Outlook app on her computer but they don't sync to her Outlook online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can U please provide guidance as to where we can set this up to sync outlook Mac with Outlook online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials updates fail</h2>
                    Since 1/29/2016, all MSE updates through Windows Update indicate they have failed to update.&nbsp; When I open MSE it says "The virus and spyware definitions didn't update . . . because of an Internet or network connectivity problem".&nbsp; On the Home page of MSE
 it says "Virus and spyware definitions:&nbsp; Connection failed".&nbsp; However, on the Update tab it shows the Definition versions as being current with the definitions being created yesterday and updated today.&nbsp; Further,&nbsp;when I look at MSE "About", it shows that I
 have the latest&nbsp;definitions (currently 1.213.7055.0).&nbsp; My guess is that I do have the current updates but Microsoft Update is sending false messages.&nbsp; Anyone else experiencing that and do you have a solution?

<h2>            Virus or Malware the scanner can&#39;t find&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I run Windows 7 Home version on my laptop, 64 bit. &nbsp;All at once a couple mornings ago the laptop started being extremely slow (takes over 5 minutes to boot up) and it is taking a very long time for anything to come up once the computer does boot up. &nbsp;On
 top of that, it keeps saying "limited access" to the internet and will not connect to it. &nbsp;My desktop PC runs off of wireless, as does my Kindle, and I'm not having any connectivity issues with either of them. &nbsp;I decided to do a system restore and ALL of my
 restore points are gone! &nbsp;I have been researching, and feel sure that the computer has a virus, but so far the scans I have run are not finding anything. &nbsp;I have run the sfc /scannow on it, and it tells me that several files are locked and they cannot check
 them. &nbsp;My uneducated guess would be that this is where my virus is?? &nbsp;I downloaded malware removal tool from malwarebytes, that found nothing. &nbsp;My AVG virus scan finds no threats. &nbsp;Any other ideas????

<div>Computer slodown can cause by virus but not always.. this can be due to heavy applications like antivirus solutions.. etc..&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
you can use taskmanager and resource monitor to find out what are the application eating your ram memory as well as processor&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div><b>(1)</b>you can use what is running ..&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whatsrunning.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.whatsrunning.net/</a>&nbsp;it will show you all the running apps programs, dll
 files (a to z details)<br />
<br />
or u can use&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/</a><br />
<br />
For manual checking u may use..&nbsp;<br />
<b>(2)</b>Task manager details tab can be used<br />
<br />
<b>(3)&nbsp;</b>you can use resource monitor<br />

<br />
<b>(4)</b>&nbsp;you can use system configuration utility (press windows key and R key together and type msconfig and click ok) to check system tray start up items<br />
<br />
<b>(5)&nbsp;</b>you can see the services in windows by services console (press windows key and R key together and type services.msc and click ok)<br />
<b>or</b><br />
you can isolate thirdparty services starting by this method..<br />
<br />
Press windows key and r key then type msconfig and click on..&nbsp;<br />

Then put a tick on hide all microsoft services...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t Receive Incoming Calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Receive Incoming Calls</h2>
                    <p>Using Skype for Windows 10, I can't see incoming calls. I will just get a notification that I missed a call and then I have to call the person back. This is really frustrating. I have Skype open and I'm logged in. All the notifications are set so I should
 get a notification of an incoming call:&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I've had this problem ever since I installed Skype on my phone (Android).&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>There are two Skype applications that you can use on Windows 10. One is the pre-installed Skype application on Windows 10 and the other one which can be downloaded from the Skype website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen shot that you have provided us was the settings from the pre-installed Skype application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please download&nbsp;the classic version of Skype&nbsp;using&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>. Once downloaded, open and sign in to the Skype application, let someone call you on Skype.
 Make sure that you are log in to one device only as you&nbsp;can encounter call routing issue when logged in to multiple devices at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Disable Forwarding Feature from User&#39;s Mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandonbautista  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Forwarding Feature from User&#39;s Mailbox</h2>
                    
<p>Support,</p>

<p>We found that users are forwarding emails on their own through OWA. We would like this to only be controlled on the server side, and blocked for end users to do this themselves. How can this be accomplished. Currently, when users are logged into their mailbox
 through Outlook Web Access, they can go to Options - Forwarding...we want this disabled and only controlled from global admins.</p>
<p>Screenshot attached.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>hi brandon,</p>
<p>you need to modify a user role in the role assignment policy. i suggest you create a new role assignment policy, for test at first referring the following steps.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect windows powershell to exchange online</a>.</p>
<p>2. create a new management role named mybaseoptions-nofwd by using the cmdlet below:<br />
<strong><em>new-managementrole -name mybaseoptions-nofwd -parent mybaseoptions</em></strong></p>
<p>3. set the role entry for the new created role, and remove the forwarding address and forwarding smtp address parameter:<br />
<em><strong>set-managementroleentry "mybaseoptions-nofwd\set-mailbox" -parameters forwardingaddress, forwardingsmtpaddress –removeparameter</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7ce616be-9497-4e6a-98c7-e73d7fae966d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7ce616be-9497-4e6a-98c7-e73d7fae966d" /></a></p>
<p>4. log into ecp, and create a new role assignment policy. please choose mybaseoptions-nofwd under other roles, as in the following example:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2b7d598f-76e9-40c5-98c4-63834bde80c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2b7d598f-76e9-40c5-98c4-63834bde80c6" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. grant the newly created&nbsp;policy for&nbsp;the users, then the forwarding function will not display&nbsp; in user's owa.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a2a32b6b-fdc4-410f-ba22-d994ab54ec7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da2a32b6b-fdc4-410f-ba22-d994ab54ec7f" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f9ac3da2-9ed4-4317-b37a-2a080b15711b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df9ac3da2-9ed4-4317-b37a-2a080b15711b" /></a></p>
<p>please try the steps above, if you have any updates, please let us know.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<p>Great, that worked. I tested with a single user. Do you see an issue with me applying the MyBasePolicy-NoFwd to the default User Role? I am assuming that when you create the child role, it takes all the settings from the parent role, excluding whatever parameters
 you tell it to. Please confirm.</p>

<p>Hi Brandon,</p>

Yes, you are correct. When you create the child role, it takes all the settings from the parent role MyBaseOptions by default, whatever parameters we specify.</p>

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA143563</a> didn't resolve the issue, you may try performing a hardware reboot. This reboot will not delete any personal data on the phone. To do this while the phone is turned off,
 press and hold the volume down and power button keys at the same time until it vibrates and it will restart. If the issue persists, proceed with phone reset. This reset will delete everything on the phone. Please do back up all personal data to avoid data
 loss. To reset the phone go to Settings&gt;About&gt;Reset your phone. Looking forward for the result to further assist you.

<h2>            Deployment on RDS Farm - Shared Computer Activation Auto Renew</h2>
                    We have a RDS farm where we have a few users where auto-renew never works even though they log regularly and before it expires.&nbsp; They are required to sign in and reactivate no matter what every 8 days when the token expires.&nbsp; All users profiles are in
 UPD's and are fully accessible.&nbsp; Should all users typically auto-renew assuming there are no connectivity issues and the license file folder is accessible.&nbsp; I understand if there are changes and the token is expired then an activation would be required.&nbsp; Seems
 it is only mostly working as intended.

</p><p>I'd like to explain that when user log into the SCA enabled Office suite, a licensing token is stored. It will be stored only for a few days. When the token is expired, users need to sign into the Office suite for renewing the token. For more info, please
 see <strong>Additional details about shared computer activation for Office 365 ProPlus</strong> section mentioned in<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Overview-of-shared-computer-activation-for-Office-365-ProPlus-836f882c-8ff6-4f19-8b24-0212e0111c94?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 this article</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, we understand for end user it will be more convenient if they don't have to sign in every a few days. You could click the smile button at right top of the Office application window to submit your feedback. It's the best way to let the related team
 hear your voice. Your feedback will help us perfect our products and services. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim</p>
