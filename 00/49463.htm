    <title>Using a kmodel USB simulator with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulwrightson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using a kmodel USB simulator with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>There is a growing number of people using the 10 in 1 USB&nbsp;kmodel simulators to connect their RC transmitters to the PC and then fly with a variety of flight simulators. &nbsp;This has recently grown due to an increase in FPV quadcopter flying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one of these USB 10 in 1 dongles and a RC transmitter and use it with a couple of flight simulators very successfully, I guess they have specific built in software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, some simulators (especially the cheaper ones) use the Windows controller as an input device and when I connect my kmodel USB it is picked up by Windows, which names it, and allows me to try and configure it as if it is a joystick. &nbsp;However the Windows
 driver only seems to pick up one set of inputs and allows left/right movement but not up/down which is on a different stick on the RC controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way of reading the USB values and map them to the joystick settings so that software which is not specifically written for the USB dongle will allow the dongle to behave as if it is a joystick?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other solutions which mimic the input from the RC controller through the microphone port and convert the signals to a joystick input but they cause me problems and I would really like to use the USB dongle as it works in at least in one direction
 and would seem to be a relatively easy task for someone who is not as dumb as me when it comes to programming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am certain that if this was done there is a market for the software, which will only increase as the hobby becomes even more mainstream.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<p>Thank you for at least trying - but this was not at all useful because it is not specific and does not take into consideration the hardware/software.</p>
<p>The problem is that the joystick configuration does not allow it to read inputs and allow them to be assigned to values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft joystick does not work the same as an RC transmitter which has two four way joysticks one which adjusts speed and direction and the other makes it lean left/right - up/down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is there a way with whatever software/setup required to read values and assign them to the joystick so that other software which uses the joystick as an input device then reads the inputs from the USB/transmitter and runs the software accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned there are software hacks which read values from the transmitter via a 3.5mm stereo jack into the microphone socket and converts them to joystick controls. &nbsp;When I used them last time they worked but then Windows 10 lost all my audio outputs
 from my GForce card which is connected via HDMI and reverted to the onboard audio which was a bit of a hassle getting it back and of course there was no audio during the game.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask if you have already tried to reset the password of your Skype account? You may do these steps in order to update your password from your Skype account:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign in to your Skype account using this link: <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview</a></p>
<p>2. At the lower right, under Settings and Preferences, select on Change Password</p>
<p>3. Follow the on screen instructions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you reset your password, try to sign back in to your Skype account and see if the same would still persist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the updates. </p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player loading on startup in Windows 7 - I don&#39;t want it to do this.</h2>
                    <p>Media player starts when I start my pc up.&nbsp; It does not start if I just do a Restart, only from Shutdown/Start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen these from an answer to an XP problem&nbsp;<br />
1. Got to Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Startup<br />
If you see WMP, a media file of some sort in the folder, remove it. <br />
You may have to show hidden files and folders.</p>
<p>No Media player files there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Go to your Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. In the list on the left side, find Windows Media Player, go over to the Startup Type column if it says "Automatic" double click on it and change it to manual.</p>
<p>Already on manual</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Start -&gt; Run, type msconfig. Click on "Startup" tab, scroll down and look for Windows Media Player, uncheck the box before it.<br />
How to Safely Disable Startup Items Using Msconfig<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not there so nothing to uncheck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is irritating and I need to know how to stop it.&nbsp; My other solution, of course, is to go to All Programs/Show Microsoft stuff and disable the thing completely.&nbsp; I know how to do that if I need to.</p>

            I got the same problem and I found a solution.
<div><br />
<div>Windows thinks that some audio CD exists in my empty BD drive. Default action for AudioCD is Mediaplayer. I just turned off this action and WMP doesn't run at startup anymore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But there's another question to Microsoft... Why empty BD drive appears as audio CD.</div>

<h2>            Documents don&#39;t stay minimized.</h2>
                    When I have a document (such as an adobe PDF for example) minimized and then open another PDF document in the same format, the first PDF document and any others also maximize.&nbsp; Sometimes in the same screen. Sometimes on the other monitor. This seems to
 apply to any document format.&nbsp; If i open an Excel document, I don't want all of my minimized Excel documents to maximize.&nbsp; It's very annoying to have to constantly be minimizing documents to get back to what I was working on.<br />

    <title>Xbox 360 Slim HDD seems dead - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vpsych  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim HDD seems dead</h2>
                    
<p>Lately I've been noticing my 360 has been freezing. First it started doing it after a Netflix update. But it got worse if I tried to download any demo. Now I tried to turn on the 360 today and it goes into a continuous&nbsp;reboot loop where it gets to the "desktop"
 where you can move around the navigation menu before rebooting 30 seconds to a minute later. Looking around I saw a suggestion to remove the HDD which I did and now the console works fine. Plugged the HDD back in and the reboot loops continue.</p>
<p>What can I do now? Is it possible to get the HDD replaced with the contents pulled from the old HDD to the new HDD by Microsoft? Where would I go from that? Support seems to be for the console itself and not the HDD.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HDD support is part of the general console warranty only if the HDD came with the console. Accessory HDDs only have a 90 day warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're in-warranty, call support.</p>

<p>And as the alternative if you do not have warranty, you will have to buy some other storage medium for the console. If you can get hold of a transfer cable cheaply you may find that you can recover some data and that the issue lies within the partition of
 the hard drive which the console uses to run. So to attempt to recover data my suggestion is that you:</p>
<p>Get a USB flash drive (preferably if you have one at home you save all the data on it to a computer then format it for use with the Xbox)</p>
<p>Get a hard drive transfer cable</p>
<p>Plug your hard drive into the transfer cable, USB flash drive into your Xbox and the transfer cable into the Xbox and attempt to copy data over from the hard drive to the flash drive. (Do not worry about downloaded content as it can all be re-downloaded
 free of charge)</p>
<p>If your console freezes during this then you will just have to lose your data but if it doesn't freeze and you recover your game saves, go into the storage selection page, press Y on the "Transfer Cable Hard Drive" and select to format it, you will be asked
 for your consoles serial number which you can find on the back of the console or on a sticker inside of the consoles front USB flap. Once it is formatted, turn the console off, remove the flash drive and transfer cable and put your hard drive in normally.</p>
<p>Now, check if it works as hopefully the issue was due to a corrupted system file and not a physically damaged hard drive. If it works again put your data back onto it and to get your DLC back, follow these simple instructions:

<p>I do have a transfer cable but I used it previously to transfer the data from an old 360 HDD to the new one (a year ago so sadly the warranty is past the 90 days) purchased separately from the 360S. Is it possible to re-use an old one? I was under the impression
 that you could not. </p>

<p>[quote user="VPsych"]I was under the impression that you could not.[/quote]That's because the instruction wording isn't very clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no limit to how many times you can use the cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old transfer software used to erase the source drive after the transfer was complete. That's why it was referring to when it mentioned you could only transfer once. After a successful transfer, the source drive was rendered empty so you couldn't, say,
 copy the source drive to three different destination drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anywho, none of that applies any longer. You may elect to Move all or part of the existing drive, or you can cancel everything and manually Copy or Move whatever you want from System Settings, Memory.</p>

<p>It is possible to re-use an old transfer cable but it must be the Slim compatible one that looks like this:
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnxeassets.xbox.com%2fshaxam%2f0201%2f18%2fec%2f18ecbcf0-39b5-443a-b71a-f09dcdc467f5.PNG%3fv%3d1%23cable-transfer-dual-m-m.PNG" /></p>
<p>If you have that one simply hook it up and try and recover some of your data. If you are lucky there are some corrupt system files and all/some of you data is still recoverable, if you are unlucky, you have a bad hard drive sector and it is unrecoverable.</p>
<p>My computer hard drive failed on me recently but after unplugging it and leaving it for a few days it ran fine and is still working today with no problems so you could maybe try that.</p>

<p>Well that's what I thought at first but they are saying that their Slim HDD is failing so the old transfer cable cannot connect to the Slim HDD as the older ones only connect to the Phat HDDs, not Slim, so they must have the transfer cable which can do Slim
 to Slim transfers. Do you see what I mean? Or am I getting confused here?</p>

<p>My mistake. At some point I thought it was the original HDD, despite the subject...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need the newer cable if you want to try this. Attach the cable to the back of the console, then attach the drive to the cable. Keep in mind that it may not work, depending on what's wrong with the existing HDD.</p>

<p>This is my second post, as my first post is not listed here from this morning. &nbsp; My son was playing this game on XBox Live, and a player named HEAFURRYFRIEND admitted to hacking into the game, putting my son back down to level 1, and then rendering the game
 useless. &nbsp; He has threatened to hack his friends' as well. &nbsp; Furthermore, he put lewd comments on the board regarding my son.</p>

<h2>            Cannot access Uplay or sync companion app to Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing Assassin's Creed IV for two weeks when my game data disappeared. I thought it had something to do with my Nat settings and had them changed to an open setting. I never recovered my data but now I can't access fleet data or any social
 events on the single player. I can't log into Uplay from the game and can only play the multiplayer in limited mode. I created a profile for my boyfriend and tried signing in under his account but that didn't work either. I have the companion app downloaded
 on my kindle and I can access my fleet data from the original game saves I had lost on my console. I don't know if this is a hardware issue or a network issue but I have spent hours on the phone with Microsoft support and Ubi Soft trying to correct network
 issues and nothing has worked. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes I tried John's response to no avail. I shut down every thing in the way of VPN and NORTON"s. and still wouldn't work. Reloaded a full older version of Win10 from CD, and was at first shocked that it was almost a thowback to Win 8.1. After a day or so
 I was told that there were a few upgrades that were waiting to download and install. So I used the restart/install upgrade feature, figuring that the higher functions of the op. system would be off when the upgrades were installed. It appears as if that has
 worked. System seems to be running very well and is stable once more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to thank all who replied to my quest of peace and serenity on my computer. I am sure that somewhere in there was the answer and I somehow stumbled on the solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Multiple Users Sharing one Xbox Live Gold account</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Will my wife and I both be able to sign into Xbox live with a single xbox live gold account? It is currently under my xbox profile only on the 360, and I obviously want my wife to be able to have the xbox one recognize her and login with my account.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>@case No it is not more expensive. Say my xbox one at my home and my main account has gold on it whoever signs into my xbox one will have every single gold feature available, EVEN if they are only a silver member. So basically as long as your main xbox account
 has gold active your wife will have gold features as long as she is on your xbox one. Hopefully that clears it up.</p>

            <p>Hi, The reason FS9 does not work is because disk 4 contains a form of security which Microsoft no longer considers secure (possibly macrovision?? - not sure). When you run fs9 the application tries to run CD4. At that point you will probably see an error
 in the event log about "secdrv". This is where the security is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, you want to get back to playing FS9 which isn't a problem !! First update your install of FS9 to FS9.1.&nbsp; Get that from here and run it......</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=9727</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then download the FS9 no cd patch which will allow you to start FS9 without CD4 inserted. There are a few places you can get it but here is one......</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/15244/microsoft-flight-simulator-2004-v91-no-cd-patch/</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it......... I doubt MS will issue a patch as I don't think they support FS9(FS2004) any more.&nbsp; Also if they supplied a patch it would negate the use of CD4 !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>OH.... One other thing. FS9 doesn't like running in full screen mode in Win10. After launching press "Alt+Enter" to switch to window mode. Stretch it to the full size of the screen. It should remember this next time. Maybe it's time to move to X-Plane !</p>

            <p>One of the requirements from Poulsej's post was to first upgrade FS9 to FS9.1. &nbsp; Were you able to do that?</p>
<p>Then apply this patch. &nbsp; &nbsp;I've heard of others having to do this (as the only workaround for FS9), and have had success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still can't get it to launch, you may want to uninstall FS9 completely (since the Sim is useless to you in this state), remove all remnants of it from your System and Registry, re-boot and then reinstall from your four disks and then using the above
 mentioned method. &nbsp; Afraid that's your only option if you want to stay with FS9.</p>

<p><span>Download The Newest Software/Drivers
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Go to the website of the manufacturer and select your model (this is usually done in the Support section). You should have the option to download drivers for your model if
 they have drivers your your Windows version. Download the driver(s) and follow the instructions to install - every computer is different so I can't give you exact directions.
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If they don’t have drivers, try Windows Update - Update driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can try reinstalling the drivers in compatibility mode:<br />
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot Compatibility</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

            <p>Thanks for the reply!!&nbsp; I appreciate the help.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Yes I installed the game--I've been playing but can't play without inserting disc 1--If I'm playing the game it should be installed correctly-- right??&nbsp; I hope so :)</p>
<p>Method 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have windows 7 and it plays fine--</p>
<p>Method 2--How do you play in compatible mode??&nbsp; Where do you see/find this on disk??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I want to play Age without&nbsp; the&nbsp;CD is b/c my son 5--wants to play together while we fight the enemy.&nbsp; I'm just trying to please him b/c we can't play at the same time with 1 cd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.&nbsp; I will try all these suggestions.</p>

            Most games installed from disc need the disc in for the DRM (copy-write ) check.
<br />
With many&nbsp; games you can eject the CD once the game is loaded and use it&nbsp; on the other PC<br />
as it only checks the copy protection when loading. This games should work that way (some newer games do multiple checks).<br />
The easy option is to use a ' noCD'&nbsp; fix. This is a file that replaces the games&nbsp; AOM.exe file in the installation folder.<br />
 file.<br />

            With some games the&nbsp; - - - <span style="font-style: italic">.exe</span> is created on installation from one of the larger files on the disc,<br />
so you will only find the <span style="font-style: italic">setup.exe</span> there .<br />
The <span style="font-style: italic">aom.exe&nbsp;</span> file should be in the folder the game is installed to. It will have the same icon as the<br />
desktop (or start msnu)&nbsp; shortcut . With most games the .exe is in the main folder, but<br />
in others it is in a sub-folder (binaries, etc).<br />
I don't&nbsp; have the game so I only downloaded the noCD fix to verify it was a simple fix - some games need multiple files to run without the CD, but most of the older ones only need the games .exe&nbsp; replaced.&nbsp;
<br />
I normally make a new folder in the games install folder (main directory)&nbsp; to move the original .exe to.<br />
It is best to 'move' the original&nbsp; - - - .exe&nbsp; file as sometimes copies don't work.
<br />
(This is just a 'best practice' thing as you can always reinstall the game if something goes wrong<br />
I've had a couple of noCD's that didn't work, and sometimes you need the original if a new patch comes out or the patch will not install).<br />
Of course&nbsp; noCD's are only for convenience so I don't have to to find one box out of 100+&nbsp; in order to play a game - (end disclaimer - lol).<br />
<br />
Maybe the CD loads information while playing. Older games will sometimes play music<br />
direct from the disc. Some of these have an option to install the 'additional' files. Then again<br />
being a Monopoly$oft product, it may just be insistent on the disc being present.<br />

                    A few days ago my gamertag disappeared overnight. I tried to download but it gives me the 8007045D error. I've tried clearing the cache and re downloading xbox live updates. Nothing is working.

<p>If you're still having this issue after attempting clearing your cache and updating completely, try making sure your connection is as good as possible. It could be that it's unable to use a stable connection and preventing it from downloading completely.</p>
<p>If you're using a Wi-Fi connection try switching to an Ethernet connection. If possible, try to bypass your router and connect directly into your modem. This will provide you with the best connection possible.</p>
<p>If you're still experiencing issues after trying that, use this very informative website to forward your ports for Xbox LIVE. This will make your network allow the connections Xbox needs to properly service you.</p>
<p>Here is the website containing the information you need to get started. It's a Microsoft website:

<p>Neither of these worked. I tried poet forwarding and dozens to see if it was a network issue but it's not. My nat type is open.

<p>I can't delete my profile because it's not on my hard drive. </p>

<p>I worked around the error. BTW the only fix for this is either formatting your hard drive and losing all your saves etc. Or buy a usb flash drive and remove the old hard drive then download the profile to the flash drive and then reinstall the old hard drive.
 It couldn't download because the gamertag was still on the harddrive but it couldn't be seen or used so the xbox tricked itself.

            <p>Even if the profile doesn't show up, there could still be a corrupt profile in the profile section that could have caused the issue that prevents you from downloading yours.</p>
<p>So it may be best to check the profile section to see if there are any corrupt profiles present and remove those.</p>

            <p><span>Here are some notes about Event Viewer Reports which may help. When you have a lot of errors you need to concentrate on system
 errors and warnings, even if it is applications that are giving you grief. Sorting system problems first can make resolving application problems easier. Note the time the computer is last booted and deal with those at the beginning of the boot first. Correcting
 the earlier errors can resolve later ones.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution.
 Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes
 System is by far the most important.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side
 of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to
 click a second time to see the latest Report at the top. </span></p>
<p><span>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on
 the Copy button on the General tab to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports
 that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.
</span></p>

            I just started have the same issue, around the 16th of this month, tried hard resetting and it didnt seem to help. Im going to do a factory reset and choose to keep all my games and account info and see what happens tonight. Maybe u should try that as
 well. If it doesnt work, I guess send it in for repair...

            Hi this may be because it can overheat you, or you have a lot of dust in the console and needs to be cleaned up. The best way is to give Xbox a certified Microsoft service. Where are Xbox experts?

<p>Hey there MysteriousMrR11, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have this problem and the previous troubleshooting steps did not help, then I would recommend going ahead repair order from Xbox Support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can either set one up on our <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device Support </a>online portal, or you can go directly to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
customer support </a>and have an agent help you out with that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>How will we connect speakers to XBOX One&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> defeatedcrab382  say:</h3>
<h2>            How will we connect speakers to XBOX One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have preordered the XBOX One, and am wondering how speakers will be connected? I plan to get [this ASUS monitor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BZNEVQ/ref=gno_cart_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER). I am also preparing to get a 360 to hold
 me over. I have not owned a 360 since the pre-Elite days, and then I just used my TV's HDMI port and its built-in speakers. Built-in speakers are no fun, and the monitor I'm looking to get does not have any. Also, I do not own a TV.</p>
<p>So... The XBOX One will have S/PDIF and HDMI, as well as USB. I have a set of USB speakers; will those work? If not, what? I have never used S/PDIF. I also have a receiver and two loudspeakers that I use for my record player. The speakers connect to the
 receiver via RCA cables. Would a receiver have S/PDIF ports? I'm not sure what they would be labeled other than AUDIO IN/OUT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe someone can provide some guidance? Hoping to not have to get new speakers, but I guess I must if I must. Will either the USB speakers or the RCA-cabled speakers work with both the 360 and Xbone?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>It has an HDMI port which also supports Audio output, if you want to go with RCA cable with monitor, I would hope they make a VGA xbox one cable as it has the audio cables you need, I will look up on S/PDIF devices and cables to see if I can point you in

<p>You said &nbsp;you have a receiver. First, check to see if it has a digtal optical input for audio on it. If it does, then you can just hook up the sound to come through your receiver. If not, another choice would be to buy some optical speakers. If you don't
 want to do that, then yes, you could always find a converter that has optical to 3.5mm jack if they make it or get a optical to RCA to hook up to your receiver.

<h2>            SFC and DISM to repair a different &#40;non-boot&#41; drive, Unable to boot into drive d.</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original title:</strong></em> SFC and DISM to repair a different (non-boot) drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is this:</p>
<p>I have a computer I built, for windows 7, then upgraded to windows 10. It worked fine except for it would crash upon going into power saving mode. I tried to identify the problem using verifier, but that just crashed my computer, though I did determine the
 problem was AMD_XATA.sys. After some troubleshooting and a system restore, it would crash while loading windows (BSOD) with the error INACCESSABLE_BOOT_DEVICE. After more troubleshooting (with windows PE), I ended up installing windows 10 enterprise on my
 other hard drive (1TB HDD formatted GPT) so I could get back to my life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My set up is like this:</p>
<p><span>AMD A10-7850K</span></p>
<p>ASRock FM2A88X Extreme4+ FM2+ (UEFI capable)</p>
<p>2.5" 480GB SATA SSD (where the original installation exists, volume D:\ NTFS)</p>
<p>2TB SATA HDD (where the new installation exists, obviously not the boot drive volume C:\ GPT)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do:</p>
<p>Repair the old installation because I no longer have the activation code and don't want to have to reroll it. I have determined so far in my troubleshooting that switching between UEFI/non-UEFI and NTFS/GPT is a nightmare, especially while executing commands
 in command prompt. While in the PE, I had done chdsk which eventually worked and reported no bad sectors. I also tried sfc and got "verification 100%, resource protection could not perform requested operation" and tried a lot of things to solve that with no
 luck. I tried some bootrec commands only to get "boot config data for your PC contains errors". I tried DISM without any luck since I can't get online with that drive. I have tried every conceivable method to get into safe mode without any luck. I am aware
 that I need to activate the partition&nbsp;using diskpart before troubleshooting, and have administrator access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I have used EaseUS Partition Master to rebuild the MBR while logged into my new windows installation (C:) which seems to have worked. I still get INACCESSABLE_BOOT_DEVICE when I try to log in to the old one though. What I want to do is try to
 fix the broken installation using elevated command prompt on my working drive, but there may be some compatibility issues because it is GPT and the other is NTFS, I'm not sure. Whenever I try to execute any operation, it always executes on C: even though I
 have activated the D:\ partition in diskpart and executed from the D:\ root. I even tried
</p>
<p>D:\&gt;sfc /scannow /offbootdir=d:\ /offwindir=d:\windows</p>
<p>but it gives me </p>
<p>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some<br />
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For<br />
example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not<br />
supported in offline servicing scenarios."</p>
<p>Is there any way to use DISM from the command prompt in C: to repair the installation in D:?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any insight yall have!</p>
<p>

            I unfortunately can not do this as I can't log in. Like I said, when I try to load windows, it crashes with a BSOD. I have a SECOND hard drive which can boot into windows 10. I am trying to fix the FIRST hard drive while booted into the SECOND hard drive.
 I explained my setup in my first post, thank you for reading.

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to resolve this, I was hoping you could give me some help with the commands I mentioned, or perhaps an alternative.</p>
<p>I have poured over these and other forums, so believe me when I tell you that I have tried all of these basic troubleshooting tasks and many others. I have identified several problems with the boot installation and possibly with the boot record that I believe
 can be solved with the right commands. I have been trying to use the DISM command without success due to my inexperience, but I think it will work if I get the syntax right. I also don't know if it would be better to try these commands from the second hard
 drive (which I'm using right now), or use the PE USB instead.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>As stated in my original post, I can use these commands with success (though at times varied outcomes). In this case, all were a success, with the /scanos command revealing 2 operating systems: (1) D:\windows , (2) C:\windows. If it helps, the physical location
 of C:\windows (the damaged drive) is disk 0, partition 1.</p>
<p>I also managed to damage my D:\windows installation somewhat after using the /rebuild command on it. After I switched back to that drive (boot), I got a BSOD for winload.exe, which like I said before, I think it has something to do with the file system discrepancy
 between the USB recovery console and the GTP HDD. I fixed that though.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>The INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE bug check has a value of 0x0000007B. This bug check indicates that the Microsoft Windows operating system has lost access to the system partition during startup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Cause</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE bug check frequently occurs because of a boot device failure. During I/O system initialization, the boot device driver might have failed to initialize the boot device (typically a hard disk). File system initialization
 might have failed because it did not recognize the data on the boot device. Also, repartitioning the system partition or installing a new SCSI adapter or disk controller might induce this error.</span></span></p>
