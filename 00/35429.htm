<h2>            Where in Event Viewer Does Windows XP Store BSOD Error Codes</h2>
                    As the title states where does Windows XP Professional 0x86 SP3 store the log of the error when a blue screen happens ? I cannot find it I checked in the System log but still could not identify the BSOD error codes. I have it enabled to log these error
 codes when it occurs.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me where to find the Windows Stop Error (BSOD) codes ? Also if you can describe what the entry will look like that should help.
<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            Hi mohanchary, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />There is no need to reinstall Windows 8.1, just clean install Windows 10, this will give you a more responsive and reliable system!
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<br /> 
<br />Since you were already running Windows 10 of that computer you will not need to start with Windows 8.1 first, Just Clean Install Windows 10.
<br />
<br />A Clean Install would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.

<br />
<br />When you upgraded to Windows 10 it assigned a permanent Digital License for Windows 10 to the PC to reinstall it as often as you please and in whatever way you want.  You can change all hardware up to the motherboard without needing to reactivate.  
<br />
<br />If the drive is failing,  I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best Upgrade one can have - lightning fast, faster than a new higher-end PC without one, especially if you do the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<p>The Xbox One is launched, and with it, comes a small change in the network ports used by Xbox Live. This post is updated to reflect that. Since I don't have my One, yet, I'll update the post later with instructions on how to
 set up a static IP on the Xbox One, if your router isn't UPnP capable.</p>
<p>Until then, if you want to find stuff out for yourself, I can also recommend checking out

<p>Also try the troubleshooting tips below, if you already tried to open your NAT and it still shows up as moderate or strict. And finally, if you're just curious what NAT is, and why you are currently
 stuck with it, you can scroll down to the last chapter(or 
click here) for an explanation of what NAT is, and why you need it to be open.</p>

What is NAT anyways?</p>
<hr />
Open, moderate or strict NAT? How do I know my NAT status?
<p>Just turn on your console, go to the "Settings" Hub on the far right, then select the "System" tile in the upper left. If necessary, choose your appropriate connection type (wired or wireless), and then do a network test to Xbox
 Live.</p>
<p>If your console doesn't show you an error message about NAT, you already have an open NAT. Congratulations! You are done here. Go play! If you experience problems with some friends, ask them to do the network test for themselves,
 and if they have a strict or moderate NAT, direct them here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, however, your Xbox tells you something about strict or moderate NAT, read on to hopefully resolve this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
So how do I open my NAT?
<p>That depends on your router and network configuration. Since I can't possibly know all routers, I will give general instructions on how to configure your router to get an open NAT. How you carry out these instructions on your
 specific router, is up to you. If in doubt, check your router's documentation or make a post.
<b>BUT!</b> When asking here for help, please <b>provide us the exact make <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
and</span> model of your router and modem</b>. Just telling us you have "a Netgear WLAN router" won't help as much as telling us you have "a Netgear WGR614 v3 connected to a Motorola SB2100 cable modem". That way we can (hopefully) find the user manual online
 and help you out.</p>
<p>Also, don't forget to check out Shad0wmanUK's <a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/faqs/62-network-test-errors/59-my-nat-is-strict-or-moderate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
page</a>, as it has lot's of popular router makes and models listed with instructions how to configure them properly, as well as the
<a href="http://www.portforward.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Portforward</a> website (keep in mind however, that this page often shows you an advertisement for their PFConfig software to buy it.
<b>You do NOT need to buy this tool if you don't want!</b> The tool just automatically does for you, what you do in this guide manually!)</p>
<p>So let's try to open your NAT yourself. It's really easy with most routers. Especially if yours is capable of UPnP.</p>
Use Universal Plug and Play
<p>This is the <b>only</b> method to get two or more Xbox consoles online at the same time. If you have two or more consoles and no way of using UPnP, there is unfortunately no way around getting a new router (unless your current
 router can be updated with a Firmware patch).</p>
<p>Look in your router's documentation to see if it is capable of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UPnP</a>. If it is supported, enable it in the router's configuration, and you should be done (sometimes your router needs to be restarted. If necessary simply pull the router's
 powercord and replug it again).</p>
<p>Some routers don't have a proper implementation of UPnP, which might be fixed in a Firmware update, so check the manufacturer website, if a newer Firmware is available for your router.</p>
<p>If you continue to have a non-open NAT, look at the
troubleshooting tips below or if you only have one Xbox console, try manual port forwarding.</p>
My router can't use UPnP: Manual port forwarding
<p>This method will <b>only</b> work if you have only
<b>one</b> Xbox console in your network. If you have two or more consoles, you will have to use UPnP.</p>
<p>If your router doesn't support UPnP, or supports it badly, you need to manually create a port forwarding list for your router. This process is different for every router, so again: Please check your router's manual on how to
 do it.</p>
<p>Another great resource of information for this is the
<a href="http://portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/XBOX360_Call_of_Duty_-_Black_Ops/XBOX360_Call_of_Duty_-_Black_Opsindex.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Port Forward Website</a>. Just find your router model in that list (ignore the "Black Ops" heading, as the ports for Xbox Live are the same for all Xbox games), and you will get a guide with pictures and detailed instructions on how to forward ports on your
 router.</p>
<p>Since you forward ports to a specific IP address in your network, we must make sure, that this IP address doesn't change on the console. Otherwise the Router will forward the ports to the wrong address, should the IP of the console
 automatically change for whatever reason. So you need to set the address on the console manually.</p>
<p>To do this, go to your console, and to the "Settings" hub on the far right. Select the "System" tile in the upper left, then "Network Settings". If necessary, choose the connection type you use (wired or wireless) and take note
 of the current IP settings of your console.</p>
<p>For example, if your console is set to automatic, it might have an IP of 192.168.1.23, Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0, Default gateway of 192.168.1.1 (this is the internal IP address of your router), and the IP of the DNS should also
 be 192.168.1.1 (the IP of your router as well).</p>
<p>Now set your consoles network configuration to manual, and simply copy the settings for IP, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway and DNS into the appropriate fields.</p>
<p>If you want to be 100% correct, make sure you choose a static IP outside the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DHCP </a>
IP-range of your router. Again, check the manual of your router for information about how the router sets up DHCP.</p>
<p>Take note of the IP of your console (in this example 192.168.1.23) and go to your PC.</p>
<p>On your PC, browse to the configuration page of your router with your internet browser. Either look in the documentation of your router, or simply type in the IP of the default gateway the console has shown you into the browsers
 address bar (in our example, you would enter "http://192.168.1.1" in the address bar of your PC's webbrowser).</p>
<p>If necessary, log into the administration page of your router. And consult the routers manual if you are unsure.</p>
<p>Depending on the router model, find the appropriate configuration page for port forwarding. Look for menu items labeled "<b>Port Forwarding</b>", "<b>Exposed Host</b>", "<b>Virtual Server</b>", "<b>NAT</b>", "<b>DMZ</b>" or something
 like that.</p>
<p>If you find something like "Port Triggering" or "Port Mapping", this is
<b>not</b> what you're looking for. But you're very close. Instead of "Triggering" or "Mapping" look for "Forwarding".</p>
<p>You should get to a configuration page, that usually asks for incoming port, protocol and internal IP address.</p>
<p>You will need to forward the following ports to the static IP of your Xbox console, that you set up earlier (In our example this was the 192.168.1.23)</p>
<p>Now forward the following ports to that console IP:</p>
<ul>
<li>UDP 53 </li><li>TCP 53 </li><li>TCP 80 </li><li>UDP 88 </li><li>UDP 3074 </li><li>TCP 3074 </li></ul>
<p>For the Xbox One, these three additional ports are also used:</p>
<ul>
<li>500 (UDP) </li><li>3544 (UDP) </li><li>4500 (UDP) </li></ul>
<p>Sometimes a router allows a protocol setting for "both" TCP and UDP combined. If so, choose that to save you some work and create only a single rule for ports 53 and 3074.</p>
Whoa! Wait a minute! Opening ports! Don't hackers use open ports to hack you?
<p>Well, yes and no. Open ports themselves are not the real danger. Vulnerable software listening on opened ports is. Let's make an analogy here. Imagine your router is a large government office building with departments like the
 immigration office, or the department of motor vehicles. Each bureau has a specific room number (port number) and a very specific task (i.e. you can't go into department for motor vehicles and ask for an immigration visum and vice versa).</p>
<p>So imagine a hacker scanning your public IP address of the router's outside interface (since that is the only thing the hacker can see from the Internet), and he detects that port 3074 is open since you're playing an online multiplayer
 match on your Xbox console.</p>
<p>So he goes inside the office with the number 3074 (as all other offices are closed) and sees a clerk with Xbox uniform hard at work managing a Halo Multiplayer match.</p>
<p>The hacker opens the small window at the counter, starts to shout exploits and throws hacking tools at the clerk. The clerk just looks at the hacker and says "Sorry kid. Wrong office. I only do Multiplayer here! I have no idea
 what you are doing." and slams the small window into the hackers face.</p>
<p>As long as you only open the ports necessary for the applications you use (and trust), you have nothing to fear. Just think of it that way: Even if you refuse to manually open ports: right now, when you open a web page, the router
 has already opened an incoming port itself, to let the website data inside to your PC that requested it. Otherwise you couldn't read this text.</p>
<p>So don't be afraid of opening ports. Just be careful to open
<b>just</b> the ports you <b>really</b> need, and forward it to the <b>correct</b> device.</p>
But I have a strict or moderate NAT and am able to play with people. Magic?!!?
<p>Not really. The Xbox Live matchmaking service just managed to match you to a player that has an open NAT himself. And in that case it works just like
that example below with the PC actively requesting a webpage. Your Xbox console just shouted to the router "Hey router! Xbox Live told me about a Halo match at 123.45.67.89, please connect me to that." and the router will do
 that, and since he now knows, the Xbox requested that connection, will automatically route the incoming traffic to the Xbox.</p>
<p>However, as soon as a second player with a non-open NAT joins that game (or a Live Party), it can lead to various problems.</p>
<p>So even if you were able to play with some folks while having a non-open NAT, make sure you get your NAT opened.</p>
Troubleshooting: so I turned on UPnP. I manually forwarded ports to the
<b>correct</b> IP. But it still doesn't work!
<p>From the insight I got from the old NAT thread, these are the most common problems you encounter when trying to open your NAT.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
Double NAT
<p>When you signed up for your Internet service, you might have gotten a cheap (or even free) modem device with basic functions from your Internet Service Provider. Maybe you wanted more comfort and maybe you wanted a Wireless access
 point. So you buy a new (wireless) router, connect it to the modem you got from your ISP, and all is seemingly well, since you can go to websites and so on.</p>
<p>But you find that you have a non-open NAT, so you log in into your new WLAN router and set up everything correctly. But it still won't give you an open NAT.</p>
<p>In that case, the cheap modem you got from your ISP might be a Modem with built in NAT functionality. For example some Motorola Surfboard modems are able to simultaneously connect up to 31 devices to the Internet, despite having
 just one ethernet port (with the help of ethernet switches).</p>
<p>So while you told your WLAN router to allow Xbox Live traffic to the Xbox, the Motorola router "in front" of the WLAN router you set up correctly still refuses to let anyone inside.</p>
<p>To resolve that, you need to configure your modem for "<b>bridging mode</b>" or "<b>pass through</b>" mode. In most cases, you might even have to call your Internet provider, as a lot of modems get a custom firmware specifically
 made for your Internet Service Provider, and you can't change anything on the modem yourself.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to configure the modem for bridging mode, try to plug the cable from the modem to the router into one of the router's LAN ports instead of the router's WAN interface. This way you circumvent the NAT routing
 of the WLAN router, and just need to configure the Modem's port forwarding (if possible).</p>
<p>If everything else fails, you probably need to buy a new "stupid" (i.e. with no NAT capabilities) broadband modem.</p>

<p>Recently, some internet providers have started to run out of public IPv4 Internet adresses for their customers, and start to NAT their own network (known as Carrier Grade NAT). This means the ISP uses one public IP address, and
 "hides" most of their customers behind that one IP (just like your home router does with all your devices at home). In that case, you need to contact your Internet provider and specifically request that you get a public IPv4 Address. If that is not possible,
 there is no way around but getting a new Internet provider.</p>
<p>The same is often true for 3G/4G/MiMo/Mobile Internet users</p>
<p>If you live in an area with bad land-line (cable or DSL) Internet coverage, your only alternative often is a cellphone based Internet connection like 3G/4G. Some providers also offer access through a gigantic "WLAN"-like access
 point for a whole town, which requires a strong antenna.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these mobile Internet providers face a problem, as they can't predict how many devices will connect to that access point where you live, and often NAT inside their own Data Centers (Carrier Grade NAT) as well.
 If that is the case for you, there is nothing you can do about it besides switching to a landline based Internet provider with enough free IPv4 addresses to give you an unique public IPv4 address.</p>
<p>If you want to check if your ISP is putting you behind his own NAT, browse to your router's configuration. Find the router's WAN IP address (check the router documentation again, if in doubt). Make a note of that WAN-IP address,
 and then browse to a page that reads your public IP address (simply <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2acj2xk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Bing for "what is my ip address"</a> or <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">go here</a>).</p>
<p>If the IP address shown on the website is different to the WAN-IP in your home router, you have a double NAT. Either your Internet Provider puts you behind a NAT, or your Modem is also a NAT device.</p>
I use my Laptop as a wireless bridge to connect my Xbox to the WLAN router.
<p>See above for the Double NAT problem, as the Internet connection sharing on your Laptop is basically also an additional NAT device. In order for this to work correctly, you need to configure your router to forward the Live ports
 to your Laptops WLAN IP address. Then in the advanced settings of the shared connection, you need to forward these ports again to your Xbox console connected to the Laptop.</p>
<p>Or, to make things easier, instead of using Internet Connection Sharing, bridge the connection without using NAT. To do that on Windows, press "Windowskey + R", in the small window type "ncpa.cpl" and press OK. Select both your
 LAN and WLAN adapters on your computer (if necessary hold CTRL while clicking on each adapter). Right click on the selection and choose to bridge these interfaces.</p>
<p>Now just configure your router to 
forward incoming Live traffic directly to the Xbox's (static) IP address as above.</p>
<p>For more information on how to properly set up Internet Connection Sharing or Bridging,
follow the instructions in this Post.</p>
Restrictive Firewall or Intrusion Detection Systems in your router
<p>Some routers specifically have a Firewall running on them. In my (personal) opinion this is a simple marketing ploy to convince the buyer in getting this router, since it has "more" functions that the other router.</p>
<p>You see, most non-technical people think, that a Firewall is like an Anti-Virus Software, that blocks "evil" Internet traffic from entering your network. But this is
<b>not</b> how a Firewall works!</p>
<p>Even if you turn this firewall off (or buy a device without firewall in the first place), the router itself
<b>still works</b> like a Firewall in a home user scenario! Because if you didn't specifically give the router a port forwarding list, the router will reject all unknown incoming Internet traffic. But for Multiplayer you specifically
<b>want</b> incoming traffic to your Xbox. <br />
<br />
The purpose for a Firewall would be, you want incoming traffic <strong>only</strong> from a small group of known Internet addresses, like for example: "Only allow the office branch in Chicago with a specific IP address access to your email server in your main
 office in New York, and <strong>no one else</strong>!" But since you usually want players from all over the world to join you, a restricting Firewall makes no sense for your home network.</p>
<p>Having a Firewall enabled on a router, is like telling one bouncer at your disco to allow your friends inside for a multiplayer match (the port forwarding rules in the router), while telling a second bouncer (the Firewall) to
 make sure <b>no one ever</b> gets past that other bouncer. Not even your friends.</p>
<p>A similar problem is with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). These tools are there to defend your network from malicious attacks. But since attackers aren't marking their attacks as malicious (just imagine a terrorist asking
 a policeman if it's OK if he just goes in that building there to blow it up), IDS systems try to look for patterns in network traffic, that
<b>could</b> be an attack.</p>
<p>Now if you initiate a multiplayer match, a lot of different IP addresses are suddenly asking your network if there is still room in your match for another player. The pattern of a lot of "strangers" suddenly asking for access
 into your network could be mistaken as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Distributed Denial of Service</a> attack, and therefore the router will block these requests.</p>
<p>So just turn off these "security" features of your router. In your private home network you will have no security gain from these functions.</p>
Two or more Xbox consoles for multiplayer at the same time
<p>If you have two or more Xbox consoles that are supposed to play online multiplayer at the same time, the router is stuck with the same dilemma as with the quiet listen server in the
"What is this NAT thing anyways" explanation below. If there are incoming Xbox Live data packets to the router, to which of the two consoles should these packets be sent? Xbox A or Xbox B?</p>
<p>Let's make an analogy: Your router's public IP address is the street address of an apartment complex. In that building you have two men named "John Smith".</p>
<p>Now if the mailman comes with a packet for "John Smith" at that street address (but no apartment number), and the postman sees two Mr. Smith on the doorbells. In the Internet, he just throws away the packet and goes away. Both
 consoles have a strict NAT.</p>
<p>The tricky part with two consoles in your network is: You can manually
<strong>only</strong> configure port forwarding rules for <b>one</b> specific port to only
<b>one</b> specific destination.</p>
<p>To keep with the analogy: This would mean that one Mr. Smith puts a sticker on his doorbell reading "All packets from Xbox Live to John Smith are to be delivered to me in this apartment here!"</p>
<p>This way, only <strong>that</strong> Mr. Smith with the sticker on his doorbell will get all Xbox Live packets (the one Xbox having an open NAT), while the other Mr. Smith still won't get any packets.</p>
<p>Placing the other Xbox into a DMZ (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28computing%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">De-Militarized Zone</a>) is like one of the Mr. Smiths camping outside the apartment complex near the doorbells, and grabbing every
 Packet for any John Smith himself before the mailman even reaches the doorbells.</p>
<p>Depending on how the router prioritizes DMZ or Port Forwarding over the other, the mailman could still tell the camping Mr. Smith, that the sticker on the doorbell reads to deliver Xbox Live packets for Mr. Smith there instead
 of the camping Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>Either way, one of the two Xbox consoles will <strong>
always</strong> have a non-open NAT.</p>
<p>The only solution to this problem is to use a router with a
<b>very good</b> implementation of UPnP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all routers with UPnP are able to support two (or more) Xbox consoles. Therefore, Microsoft has tested several routers, and those that were able to support multiple Xbox consoles, got a certification and an
 official "Compatible with Windows 7/Vista" sticker.</p>
<p>On the support site there is a <a href="http://xbx.lv/pXMn6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
list of compatible routers that support two consoles</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if your router does not have UPnP, or if it has a "bad" UPnP implementation, so one or both consoles show a non-open NAT, you need to check for an updated Firmware or buy a new router.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind, that the Games for Windows Live Client on a PC uses the same Xbox Live ports for multiplayer. Even if you don't have two consoles, this might be the problem.</p>
I think I followed these instructions correctly, but it still won't work
<p>If you think you did everything right, and already checked for the most common problems mentioned above, specifically the double NAT problem, feel free to post here, and ask for help.</p>
<p>But <b>please</b>, in order to help you, you first need to help us, by describing your network setup as specific as possible.</p>
<p>Try to describe all devices that your Xbox needs to traverse in order to reach the internet. Please use the full model name of the device(s).</p>
<p>A <b>bad</b> request for help would be "HELP! I have that Netgear router, and I can't play multiplayer!"</p>
<p>A <b>good</b> request for help would be something like this: "Help! I have a Netgear WGR614 v3 router connected to a Motorola SB 2100 cable modem. My console can connect to Xbox Live, but complains about moderate NAT. I can't
 play Black Ops with my friends!"</p>
<p>The more we know about your network setup, the better we can help.
<b>So please help us help you! Thank you!</b></p>
What is this NAT thing anyways?
<p>For those wanting that extra background knowledge: NAT is an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">acronym</a> for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network Access Translation</a>. Its purpose is to allow multiple devices in your home to access one internet line and be connected online simultaneously.</p>
<p>Those with enough networking knowledge, please keep in mind, that this explanation is intentionally kept simple, and oversimplifies the whole process, so the average "I don't want to become a Cisco Certified Network Associate,
 I just want to play Black Ops with my friend!"-person can easily relate to what's happening in his home network.</p>
<p>While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
IPv6</a> resolves most of the problems described below, keep in mind that currently nearly all Internet Service Providers (and Xbox) still only use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IPv4</a> for private home users, and will still do so for quite some time.</p>
<p>As you might already know, each device on a TCP/IP network (and the Internet is just a very large network) needs to have its own unique
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IP address</a>. When you sign up for Internet service with your Internet provider, you usually get one connection to the Internet, and only
<b>one</b> IP address. But since you want your Laptop, your PC, your Xbox 360 and many other Internet aware devices in your home to connect online, you may begin to see the problem. It's not possible for your Internet provider to give all your devices unique
 IP adresses, as you would need to tell him about each new device you buy, and IPv4 adresses are basically "sold out", so all your new devices can't get one anyways, as the amount of IP adresses your provider has bought are limited.</p>
<p>To resolve this, you usually get a router from your Internet provider, that does NAT. The interface, that connects to the Internet (called WAN Interface, for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wide Area Network</a>) recieves this unique public IP address visible from the Internet from your Internet provider. I's basically the "street address" of your home for the Internet.</p>
<p>On the "inside" of your home, the router gives <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
private IP adresses</a> to the devices connected to its LAN ports (for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Local Area Network</a>). So your PC, Xbox, Laptop and internet aware fridge will get an IP address from certain reserved IP ranges. Usually IP Adresses in the range of 192.168.XXX.YYY or 10.XXX.YYY.ZZZ.</p>
<p>To better explain what NAT does, let's make an example.</p>
<p>You are sitting at your PC and want to go to Xbox.com, while your sister is doing homework on her Laptop and wants to do some research on Wikipedia. Both of you type the adress of the websites into your browsers and hit Enter.</p>
<p>Your PC now shouts to the router "Hey router! I'm the PC, and I want to fetch http://www.xbox.com!". The router now takes the order, writes in a list, that the PC wanted to see Xbox.com, and relays the order to the Internet.
 The laptop shouts: "Hey router! I'm the laptop and want to go to http://en.wikipedia.org!", and the router also writes in the list, that the laptop wants to see the Wikipedia homepage. It then shouts to the Internet "Hey Wikipedia! I'm the router at the public
 IP Address 123.45.67.89 and am requesting these pages for some devices inside my network!".</p>
<p>Eventually the website at Xbox.com answers, and sends data to the public IP address of the router. The router now looks at its notes, and remembers that the PC wanted to see Xbox.com. So the router forwards the incoming data
 to the PC. When Wikipedia answers, the data gets routed to the Laptop according to the list.</p>
<p>So far so good. But there are multiplayer games, that use so called "listen servers" (imagine an "ear" the computer uses to listen to incoming other players) to host a game. This means, that for example you start a game of Counterstrike
 on your PC, your PC will silently listen on its internal IP 192.168.1.20 for other players.</p>
<p>The problem with that is: No one knows that the PC is simply listening to incoming requests. In the previous example, the PC shouted out it's order to fetch Xbox.com. Now it's quietly sitting there, listening for other players.</p>
<p>Just imagine a router being a bouncer of a popular club with gaming consoles inside, and you, inside the club, use your cellphone to invite your friends over to the club for a gaming session.</p>
<p>When your friends arrive, they are stopped by the bouncer: "Stop! You are not on my guest list, and with these pants you don't get inside here."<br />
Your friend: "But I am invited! See? My friend sent me that message, that he's playing Halo here!"<br />
Bouncer: "I don't know you, and I don't know of any Halo match. So beat it, before I beat you!"<br />
Your friend: "Okay, calm down! I'm going already..."</p>
<p>Inside you're wondering why your friends don't show up.</p>
<p>Had you told the bouncer that you are doing a Halo match and awaiting your friends, he could write your friends on the guest list, let them inside and direct them to the gaming area where you're waiting for your buddies to arrive.</p>
<p>In router language this "guest list" would be forwarded ports. So in natural language you would tell the router: "If there is incoming traffic on port 27015, this is data for a Counterstrike game on the PC, and if data arrives
 on port 3074, it's meant for the Xbox 360, so please forward it that way."</p>
<p>The router will then do exactly that, and your console won't know a router is there, which results in an open NAT.</p>
<p>I hope this clears up a bit about the confusion what NAT is, and why it's not in Microsoft’s hands to "get rid" of NAT. Maybe in the (not so distant) future, the use of IPv6 gets more popular. With IPv6 any IPv6 capable device
 has its own unique publicly accessible IP address, so NAT isn't necessary. Until then you need to rely on UPnP or manual port forwarding to resolve your NAT issues.</p>

<h3> stevenmetzler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Hyperboot&#47;Fastboot in The latest &#34;Creator&#34; update&#47;Dual Boot Windows&#47;Ubuntu</h2>
                    <p>I dual boot my PC with Windows 10 (Creator) and Ubuntu 17.04. I have noticed that the "old way" of disabling Hyperboot/Fastboot has been removed from this latest update of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is, each time I boot into into Windows 10 it overwrites my Ubuntu EFI Grub File with the Windows Boot Loader and does not allow me to Dual Boot any longer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any permanent fix for this situation with out having to manually add my Grub boot file each time using a second party program called EasyUEFI each time?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating :(</p>

            You are presumably seeing an error message that tells you that the calendar contains corrupt data. This is most probably a red herring; please quote the entire error message verbatim, including the specific error code. You should also state your program
 version and operating system, and mention any recent changes you may have made to hardware or software.

<p>Thanks for your quick response to my quest!&nbsp; The error code was (0x8007000E).&nbsp; I wrote it down before sending my original post.&nbsp; When I attempted to open my WLM to get the whole message, WLM opened and all of my latest email downloaded???&nbsp; I can't understand
 what happened!&nbsp; When WLM opened, I was still looking at your post and so that my browser was connected!<br />

<h3> grapple tackle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help setting up 2nd xbox.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, we just purchased a new xbox. My son and I would like to play together on our own individual xboxes (like in a party in Rocket League and Halo 5) but I can't figure out the right way to do it or how exactly xbox live/gold works with purchases, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I set up his xbox (on a small TV) as the home xbox, will he no longer be able to play with his account on my xbox (on the big TV)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not desirable. Can we just keep things the way that they are and buy a 2nd copy of the games we play together using his account on his xbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the assistance.</p>

<p>A little different approach regarding the Gold subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your son is playing on multiple consoles and you yourself are only playing on 1 console then it might be a good idea to have your son's account have a Gold subscription and set your console as his Home console, that would result in your son being able
 to play online on any console and you to play online at his Home console (being the console you only game on)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, the Home console feature allows Content and subscriptions to be shared across the Home console, so any content or some subscriptions will be available on that console for other profiles.</p>
<p>If the other profiles want to use the content/subscriptions on any other console, they will need access to that content/subscriptions in a different way (like owning it themselves etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this adds something to this topic</p>

<h2>            Admin account</h2>
                    Hi, I have recently purchased an asus laptop from a pawn shop that didn't require me to put a password in to get on the administrator profile, but now that I want to make my own account and change everything it is saying that I have to enter an administrator
 password to do anything. I have created my own account and it still tells me I don't have permission to do any of that, that I need to be an admin for it. Please help the guy that used to own the laptop as since passed and I have no way possible of getting
 the information on the password, I have his old email but that is it. I have proof of purchase with receipt and everything else!

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The only deal killer is if it's a BIOS password which is usually only set by companies to lock down their property from being able to be reset if it's stolen. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise just create the bootable media for the licensed version, boot it and wipe the drive to reinstall  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You should not at any time get a password box unless it fails to boot the media and tries to start WIndows instead.  If it does then try to determine if it's a BIOS password by booting into BIOS or UEFI setup to reset to defaults:  
<br /><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />If it has a BIOS password you'll have to research how to remove it but it's nearly impossible without the manufacturer's help.  Windows password is no such problem, just reinstall as you're doing.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I cant download anything without the admin password. When I purchased the computer it didn't require me to put a password into the admin account that was already on it. I created a local account to switch the admin controls to it so I could download my games
 and everything and now its saying that it requires an admin password which I have no way in getting. I don't have a windows 10 download disk or anything of that type so there is no way I can just redownload windows and reset all the steps from there. It was
 a personal computer for&nbsp;someone. They had pawned it saying they deleted the password setting on it and they just never looked into it I guess. Cause when I went to purchase it I logged on without a password but the moment I added another account it required
 it. I paid 500$ for this thing and there is no possible way of me returning it as its a pawn shop. Is there anyway&nbsp;I can hard reset the whole computer without requiring to log into an admin account so it would remove the account and return the computer back
 to when windows 10 was downloaded to it?</p>

            Obviously you'd need to download and create the media on another PC, as all other methods to access Repairs or Reset require that password. That's why I gave you those steps specifically.
<br />
<br />  If you can't follow them then you'll need to take the PC to a shop for a minimum $150 repair.  
<br />
<br />So I'd read over the steps this time and ask back questions based on the steps that need to be done.  These steps have worked for  tens of thousands of people I've helped with them before.

            <p>I noticed this too, e.g.&nbsp;when entering my PIN.&nbsp; But instead of the Number pad what comes up now is the full Standard keyboard.&nbsp; So, I'm wondering if something has changed to only allow us to see the Number pad when we have the Standard keyboard not a preference?&nbsp;
 I have already tested to see if the problem might be due to having NumLock off after a restart but that doesn't seem to be it.&nbsp; I miss having that neat little Numeric keypad for this&nbsp;but would not want to lose having a standard keyboard for the Touch Keyboard.&nbsp;
 The full Standard TK is functional in this case but really ugly and not as easy to use.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option would be having the OSK come up instead.&nbsp; It could be considerably smaller and it could have a NumPad which would make it easier to use when using a stylus instead of just a finger.&nbsp; I should test that case too.&nbsp; Thanks for making me think
 of this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this! I had this happening when windows 8 first came out on another laptop when using toucpad, but I never realized it was the diagonal movement in touchpads causing it. Any Windows 8.1 engineer reading this? I seen it on Asus system
 too. Defective I/O device? Manufacturer problem? Windows 8.1 in some machines?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing the detailed information about this issue and we appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have caused due to changes in the Touchpad settings. I suggest you to change the sensitivity settings to low and check if it helps. This is to confirm if the issue is caused due to sensitivity related issue or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the Touchpad sensitivity settings you will have to search in the User Guide that the computer manufacturer has provided. For Asus, you may search in the following Asus website link.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.asus.com/download/options.aspx?SLanguage=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/download/options.aspx?SLanguage=en</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your quick response. Your e-mail gave me a hint of the "problem". What's happening is that the touchpad is sometimes behaving like my touchscreen
<span>("Corners and Edges feature on Windows 8.1)</span>. When I go to the very left edge of the touch pad is actually using the "App switching", specifically the "When I swipe from the left edge, switch between my recent
 apps instead of showing a list of them". &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I turned that feature off, and now it the touchpad does not do "App switching" (I thought it was depressing the windows key, but realized it was indeed thinking I was using the touchscreen as "swiping from left edge")&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if i swipe on the very edge of the touchpad from the left, it gave me a list of the apps. So, I turned of the "Allow switching between recent apps" to disable.<strong><em>As expected, the touchpad does not give me problems anymore when "Allow switching
 between recent apps" is disabled</em></strong>. Since every user uses the touch pads different, not everyone might have had this problem, but since im used to use my touchpad close to the left corner with my right hand index moving the cursor and my left hand
 index ready to left click, I hit the edge of the left touch pad and simulate the left swiping often, which causes the annoying back and forth of apps or "strangely" going to the "Start menu" when no app is opened and simply navigating across the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the only problem is that I cannot use the touchscreen feature of swiping to the left to swap apps, but i can live without that feature for the moment, rather than dealing with unwanted touchpad going back and forth.</p>

            Yes, confirmed, if i use the upper-right corner of my touch pad, the charms show, since im not used to move the cursor/touchpad with my index on the upper-right corner, I had not noticed it. My touchpad behaves like a touchscreen! Neat!, but unfortunately
 inconvenient feature for my left side due to my "touch pad" style". Right side will work ok for me, will leave it enable for the charms.

            Maybe there could be two separate options for "Corners and Edges" feature, to disable or Enable on touchpads, touchscreen, or both.

<h2>            W10 Device Manager other devices Error</h2>
                    <p>This this is all a bit peculiar, any help will be appreciated! I have a Packard Bell Easynote ME69BMP upgraded to Windows 10 32/64 about six months ago and which appears to be working fine.</p>
<p>BIOS and drivers are all latest updates from manufacturer/Microsoft and I don't think the machine is contaminated with any virus or malware.</p>
<p>However, I have just noticed the "!" appearing against Other devices. &nbsp;When I investigate this, it appears to be COM6 which seems to be in some manner connected to the Bluetooth enumerator, but I don't pretend to know much more than this fact! &nbsp;However,
 when I try to update the COM6 driver on Other devices, I am informed that a driver can't be found, and in spite of the "!", the properties indicate that the device, i.e. COM6 is working properly! &nbsp;As the machine seems to be working fine, I am thinking this
 may just be a false indication, but maybe someone knows better! Thanks in advance, Howard</p>

            <p>Many thanks Kiran, I understand about the conflict, I have tried what you suggested but unfortunately still have the problem. &nbsp;I also removed all connected USB devices and deleted them from Device Manager, still no luck. &nbsp;I even tried deleting the Bluetooth
 devices, I can see what the rebuild of the devices is trying to do, the problem is definitely related to the Bluetooth enumerator, if that gets deleted</p>
<p>, the other devices error disappears! &nbsp;If you have any other ideas, please let me know, but to be honest as everything seems to be working ok in spite of the error I am not too fussed! Once again thanks for your help, Howard</p>

            <p>Hi Kiran,</p>
<p>Thanks for your additional advice which I have tried as recommended. &nbsp;Unfortunately still no luck, problem remains. The troubleshooter only indicates "need to reboot after update" how ever many times hardware is actually rebooted. &nbsp;The problem is definitely
 connected with the Bluetooth device, and I would like to re-install manufacturer's drivers, but unfortunately these are not available on site, it just says update from Windows, and I am a bit reluctant to try third party offerings which from previous experience
 seem to be riddled with bloat ware/malware. &nbsp;Do you have any site recommendation? &nbsp;My gut feeling is to leave well alone, particularly as I don't seem to be having any problems, Bluetooth and other USB devices seem to be working fine, but I'm prepared to try
 a driver update, I do have an image backup if things went wrong! Thanks, Howard&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply but I have been away from home. &nbsp;To answer your question the model is a Packard Bell Easynote ME69BMP, operating system Windows 10 32/64 and BIos V 2.12, all latest updates installed. &nbsp;Unfortunately, manufacturer site only has 2
 Intel drivers for chipset and TXE driver and a touchpad driver. &nbsp;It then says go to Windows Update for any additional drivers. &nbsp;As the laptop seems to be working with no problems, I am inclined to leave things alone rather than mess around with third party
 drivers, what do you think? &nbsp;Thanks for your continued help and advice!</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Original title:&nbsp; <span>Problems to activate FSX Acceleration Pack</span></p>
<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I bought "FSX Gold edition" from a retailer which included FSX Deluxe (2 CD ROM) + FSX Acceleration Expansion Pack (1 CD ROM); the package was of course with the Microsoft seal unbroken. Inside the box however, there was only one activation key, saying clearly
 "FSX Deluxe". &nbsp;FSX Deluxe activated perfectly, but I am not able to activate FSX Acceleration due to lack of key I guess. I tried to use the same key as Deluxe but it says it is invalid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried following the instructions for tech support, but they request the PI number, which I could not found anywhere in either FSX Deluxe (which is already activated and working good) or FSX Acceleration (working only in<em>&nbsp;Activate Later</em> mode).</p>
<p>Could we solve this here or should I go back to the retailer? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Disable scan of pictures library in windows media player 12 in windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supersloth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable scan of pictures library in windows media player 12 in windows 7.____</h2>
                    I love the new libraries function in windows 7, i love how it adds all the music from my various locations into one easy to get to library. However, I only use windows media player as a music and video player, not for viewing pictures. Is there a way to
 get wmp to not scan or use the picture library but still have it scan music and video? I don't want every picture i've taken over the last 10 years to be streamed out to the rest of the network like i would music or recorded tv.

            You could put the pictures in a library not shared.

            <p><span>Hi Stacey,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and thanks for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As per the description provided, you are unable to encrypt some files as the encrypt contents button is grayed out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you trying to encrypt the files which were already present in the Windows 8 or were it transferred from a different computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the methods below to check if it resolves the issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run SFC scan to fix corrupted files in the computer:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type <b>“cmd”</b> on the start search and select
<b>“Settings”</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on <b>command prompt</b> and left click on
<b>Run as Administrator.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the command prompt, type
<b><span>sfc /scannow</span><span> </span></b><span>and </span>press Enter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note: If the issue is resolved, transfer the data from old account to new account.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same problem. Running the standard version of Win8, OEM preinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried all the steps given, but still unavailable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found I can run "Cipher.exe" in a dos prompt, although I did not try encrypting anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EFS service is shown as STOPPED, and the start type is set to "Manual Trigger" - is this correct? I have not changed status of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default the services would be stopped and set to manual. You can click on <strong>
start</strong> and there's no harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try in clean boot to check if there are any conflicting programs/applications:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note:

            I have followed the encryption file guide exactly, but 'encryption' is greyed out, so am unable to encrypt. Attempts to install Winver. exe have been fruitless. Is there a any other solution?

<h2>            Trouble sharing drives over ethernet</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to share hard drives between my desktop and laptop, which are connected directly with an ethernet cable. I can see and access hard drives connected to my desktop from my laptop, but I can't view drives connected to my laptop on my desktop. I've
 followed all the instructions from the "How to share files and printers without HomeGroup on Windows 10" article (https://www.windowscentral.com/how-share-files-and-printers-without-homegroup-windows-10). Media sharing seems to work, or at least it makes the
 media icon for the laptop appear on my desktop in the Network tab of Windows Explorer, but the "Computer" group that appears on my laptop (which shows both computers when connected, but still shows my laptop when disconnected) does not appear at all. I've
 made sure that file sharing is allowed through my firewall, and as best I can tell all relevant settings are the same on both computers.</p>

<h2>            Start menu, explorer and Cortana does not respond</h2>
                    <p>It used to be that every now and then Windows explorer would crash and not recover, manually starting explore.exe would also not work only showing the taskbar with the start button (that didn't work) and a black desktop. Alt+tab would still work but otherwise
 I would have to restart the PC to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now however Cortona and left clicking start or any incon in the task icon area fails to do anything. All taskbar and desktop shortcuts work. If I try and restart explorer.exe than the same problem as mentioned above happens.</p>

    <title>Backwards Compatibility Questions and Suggestions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corey chan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backwards Compatibility Questions and Suggestions</h2>
                    <p>So I have a few questions/suggestions/topics to go over:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. From what I can see, there doesn't seem to be a place to suggest or vote for backwards compatible titles anymore? I remember there used to be a forum where people would put suggestions of what they like and others would vote to show the demand for the
 game. After that was canned, then people would forward me to:&nbsp;<span>https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/ to do something similar, but that seems to be retired as well? At this point, if everything has been retired, what exactly
 can we do to suggest ideas anymore? Is here the best place?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Are there specific people, developers perhaps, that we can contact? Or someone who makes these decisions for Microsoft?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Understandably, I get that some games deal with licensing issues and this is why we probably will never see them on the list, but is that actually a guarantee&nbsp;that there will never be the option? (This can be considered
 a follow-up with question 2)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. I'm not sure, but I could've sworn somebody mentioned that backwards compatibility for the 360 is completely different compared to the Xbox One and requires a "repackaging" which is another way of saying "creating
 a digital version," is this true?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Suggestions: I'm only posting these because it's my dream to play these games again with the great supersampling and upscaling through my Xbox One X and I can't seem to find anywhere else to post these suggestions so
 here you go:</span></p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The Xbox Uservoice was retired, in it's place is Xbox ideas.&nbsp; However, the ideas website is not meant for BC requests. In fact, any BC requests posted on there will be deleted.&nbsp; I don't think there is any need now for a new voting site. It's done it's
 job. Just because we can no longer see the votes, doesn't mean Microsoft can't.&nbsp; It was their website after all, they would still have all the statistics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose you could approach the game publisher yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; A very likely chance of no BC.&nbsp; This could be down to a number of reasons, a defunct publisher, expired licensing with a movie studio (think of games like Godfather, and the 007 James Bond titles, etc.), expired licensed music tracks.&nbsp; Many people don't
 understand what goes into game licensing.&nbsp; Want to put a Porsche 911 into a car game? Sure you can, but you'll have to pay Porsche - and they won't let you keep selling that game with their brand in it in perpetuity.&nbsp; Even if you want to put authentic guns
 or aircraft in your game, you'll likely have to pay the manufactures of those weapon systems.&nbsp; Yes, really!</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; They are indeed, re-compiled or re-packaged.&nbsp; It's not straight up software emulation like most game emulators.&nbsp; Xbox 360 did original Xbox BC pretty much in software form, Xbox One does it differently with Xbox 360.&nbsp; It's actually more of a combination
 of software and hardware emulation. With the games themselves reverse engineered and recompiled from their original IBM PPC 32-bit binary to 64-bit X86.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to know more about how this is done, check out Eurogamer's Digital Foundry video&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd8nYLO43zs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How Does Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility on Xbox One Actually Work?</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Hd8nYLO43zs?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Hd8nYLO43zs?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you're probably aware, some of those games you've posted have little chance of becoming BC, especially the 007 games.&nbsp; Pretty sure no games publisher currently holds a license for 007 games. Shame really.&nbsp; The only way I can play one of my favourite 007
 titles, Everything or Nothing is on my PC via the GameCube Emulator Dolphin - using an Xbox One pad no less!</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to me. It's nuts to see what all goes into simply reviving a game that was once available. The games I want back more than anything are Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 007 Nightfire and Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some digging on Buffy the Vampire Slayer recently. The company involved with making it was called "The Collective" which merged into "Double Helix Games" which was recently purchased by "Amazon" so I assume the right people to talk to involving a re-release
 of that game through BC would be Amazon and obviously FOX since they own the rights to the Show and such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>007 Nightfire had the best multiplayer in my boat, compelling story, great level designs. I just wish I had an easier option that grabbing my clunky wired controllers and pushing a 480p progressive mode with my component cables. Having a upscaled version
 with wireless controllers is so in order. I understand on rights, it's probably ridiculous getting a James Bond game out, let alone again. If anything, I think EA should make an HD collection with Agent Under Fire, Nightfire and Everything or Nothing. That
 would be SUCH a hit!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Fatal Frame, this one I'm sure would run into some licensing issues. Being that this game is the director's cut, it got a slew of more outfit choices to pick from involving the main characters. One of the sets happens to be Kasumi and Ayane from Dead
 or Alive so Team Ninja i'm sure would have to give their okay. Since we haven't seen a single Dead or Alive game on BC, I assume Team Ninja isn't keen on the idea. Not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had to choose one to play though, it would probably be Buffy. Such an underrated classic.</p>

<p>OMG Finally! A pleading conversation about Buffy the Vampire Slayer games being converted to BC. Thank you Corey, for doing the publisher research. I still have a disc copy of each of the Xbox Buffy games with dire hope that it will someday be considered
 for BC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I'm surprised that it seems to be a completely forgotten game for Microsoft or the publisher (whom ever is truly responsible for the holdup..). With last year being the 20 year anniversary, you'd think Microsoft/Xbox/Amazon ect. would want to relaunch
 the games to take advantage of the quick sales... 20 years, and no joke, BUFFY still has an ENORMOUS fan base!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it worth trying to get in touch with Amazon Games to suggest they relaunch these titles?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for letting me vent,&nbsp;</p>
