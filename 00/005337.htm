            What you received was a scam. Receiving the message does not install malware on your computer. Malware is installed on your computer only when you allow access to your computer by the person. You handled the situation quite well by saying no. The best
 course of action would have been not to call the number, but nothing happened to you or your computer.

            Those scams are all over the web. It's disappointing so many people fall for them too. I think it's the fear that makes people fall for it. I feel like as long as people keep falling for them, more and more will come.

    <title>Locking position of comment balloons to position of other objects in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wildetudor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locking position of comment balloons to position of other objects in the slide</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I annotate my presentations with comments to help me remember what I want to say about each object in the slide, during the rehearsal. While working on the presentation, objects get of course moved around quite a lot, and it is annoying when a comment's
 location (balloon) is no longer at the right place in the slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to make a comment's balloon location be linked not to an absolute position in slide but relative to an associated object such as an image, textbox or bullet point in the main contents?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            As the other John has pointed out, comments can't be moved with other objects because they don't exist as selectable objects on the slide. You could achieve such an effect by inserting a call-out text box using
<strong>Insert&gt;Shapes&gt;Callouts</strong>. Then <strong>Group</strong> the callout with the object that it comments on and the 2 will move together.

            thanks JK, but it appears that, after creating a callout and selecting together with another object (e.g. textbox, or bullet point inside a text box), the Group option is then greyed out

            My guess is you are trying to group the callout with a placeholder? Placeholders cannot be grouped.

            <p>And even if not, you'd lose one of the big advantages of comments:&nbsp; the ability to make them disappear or appear at will and for them always to disappear during a slide show and optionally in printouts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know how to use VBA?&nbsp; A bit of VBA and a bit of a push over the top from a couple of us here could do the job.&nbsp; You could draw a shape of pretty much any type, mark it as a "comment" with one routine.&nbsp; Another routine could toggle the visibility of
 all such "comments".&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also imagine a couple ways of having one "comment" remember which shape it's "attached" to and having something like a "refresh" button move all the comments to, say, the upper left corner of their "companion" shape.</p>

            Many thanks to all of you for your helpful suggestions. I've decided that, for now, the solution for me is to just insert my annotations as Notes instead.

<h2>            Keep Subproject Formatting in Master Project</h2>
                    Is there a way to keep the formatting of a subproject after inserting it into a master project? For example, if I have a task with purple text or a bar that's red, when I insert it into the master file, those colors do not get applied to the master project.
 Is there a way to make that happen or do I have to manually change all the colors in the master file? Thanks in advance for any insight!

            This can happen if the text in the document's language formatting is set No Proofing, Do Not Check...", or to a language you do not have. Without knowing which version of Word you have, I can't offer precise instructions. In Word 2007, for example, press
 Ctrl+A to select everything in the document, then click Set Language in the Review tab. Set Mark Selected Text As: to your normal language, make sure that Do not check spelling or grammar is NOT checked, and click OK.<br />

    <title>PowerPoint 2010 &#40;but not 2007&#41; displays a border round charts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mman444  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2010 &#40;but not 2007&#41; displays a border round charts from .ppt files in Slide Show</h2>
                    <p>We have a mixed environment with PowerPoint 2010 and 2007, and we also work with pre-2007 .ppt files. There is an issue with display of charts in Slide Show in PowerPoint 2010 that was not present inPowerPoint 2007. Specifically, there is a light gray border
 visible round the Chart Area. This is only visible in Slide Show, not in normal view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue seems to happen when a presentation has been saved in .ppt form, closed, and then re-opened in 2010. If the user double-clicks the chart object to activate it and then chooses to convert to a current Excel object, the border is then absent. It
 is also possible to remove it, I think,&nbsp;by manually setting the Fill and Border of the Chart Area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is an incompatibility between PowerPoint 2010 and 2007, or between 2010 and 2003, but it is a problem because users on PPT 2007 can't predict whether the issue will be there if the file is displayed on a 2010 machine; it's worse because
 the issue only appears in Slide Show - on at least one occasion the problem wasn't evident until the slides were being shown to several thousand people on a 10-metre screen. When, believe me, that little border looks HUGE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this difference in behavior between PowerPoint 2010 and 2007 documented, and is there a fix? Relying on our 2007 users to remember to convert all the chart objects in their final versions, to avoid an issue that they can't see, isn't ideal.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. We have seen this on multiple occasions.&nbsp;I have done some more testing and can reproduce the issue with a new file (and have defined better what the issue actually is):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In either PPT 2007 or 2010, create a new file on default Theme (white background), blank slide layout</p>
<p>2. Insert a Chart - I used the Column chart, default data</p>
<p>3. Save the file in .ppt format and close</p>
<p>4. Re-open the file in 2007 or 2010 and double-click the chart</p>
<p>5. In the dialog Convert/Edit Existing/Cancel (or Convert/Convert All/Edit Existing), choose Edit Existing</p>
<p>6. If a border appears round the Chart Area when editing the chart, set that to No Line (that's not what this issue is)</p>
<p>7. Re-save the presentation in .ppt format</p>
<p>8. When viewed in Slide Show in&nbsp;PPT 2010, but not in 2007, there is now a faint border round the chart area.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is actually happening is that when the chart is edited using Edit Existing, a white Fill is applied to the Chart Area - change to a colored background and the behavior is obvious. This is not a new behavior with 2010, but the difference between the
 two is that 2007 does not show any edge to this fill if the slide background is also white.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also happens if you set the slide background to, say, Light Blue, and also manually apply a Fill to the Chart Area in the same color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this thread would have been better titled "PPT 2010, but not 2007, gives a visible edge, in Slide Show but not in normal view,&nbsp;to a legacy Chart object which has the same Fill as the slide background".
</p>

            <p>I fixed it myself. &nbsp;Added the following code to my registry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\htmlfile\shell\open\command]<br />
@="\"C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\IEXPLORE.EXE\" -nohome"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Problem Solved. &nbsp;Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp;Office 2016. &nbsp;All Hyperlinks are working again. &nbsp;Apparently it's not an Office issue. &nbsp;It has to do with installing a new browser as default but the install didn't fix the interactions with IE somehow. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps others. &nbsp;Spent way too long cleaning up such a stupid issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 on Windows 10 Workbook Position - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tkydon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 on Windows 10 Workbook Position</h2>
                    <p>I open several workbooks in&nbsp;Excel 2016 on Windows 10 and every time Excel cascades them down the screen.</p>
<p>So I move each one to the top left of the screen and save, but it does not save the location of any but the first, and they cascade down the screen again.</p>
<p>I cannot get to the tabs at the bottom of the workbook without moving the workbook up to the top again...
</p>
<p>This did not happen in Windows 7.</p>
<p>How do I prevent it in Windows 10?</p>
<p>I do not want to use the Maximize button.</p>
<p>I want Excel and Windows 10 to save the location of every workbook, and not move it.</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions.</p>

<p>Hello tkydon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried replicating your issue and when we opened a number of workbooks and close them, it remembers the last location of the last instance of Excel that was closed. As per the current design of Excel, it is not possible to assign a screen location for
 a specific workbook where the Excel app will always open. However, there are instances wherein other users make use of macro to accomplish this. For you to that, you can post this concern to the Microsoft Programming community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>Hello Bob,</p>
<p>I've complained about the same problem, including that Excel either remembers the window size the document was saved in, but opens second and further documents in the same window size as the first opened document..........and cascaded as tkydon wrote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you really suggest that everyone should convert their documents to .xlsm and start VBA programming instead of Microsoft fixing the problem! I can (I do), but it's a lot to ask every user to be capable of!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my 10.000 bucks question is: The features existed in Excel 2010, why were they removed? It doesn't make sense!</p>

<p>The feature you are looking for isn’t available at the moment. The current design of the Excel app is supposed to work that way. However, every idea counts so we strongly suggest to post your concern to our
<strong><a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel.UserVoice</a></strong> team so that our software engineers and developers would check your concern and if it gets enough votes, it will be added to the next update.</p>

<p>Hi PriyavertSharma,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update. I know more clearly about the symptom. Let’s continue analyzing the issue.</p>
<p>1. Could on-premise users join meetings created by online users before? Does the issue happen just recently?</p>
<p>Or this has never worked?</p>
<p>So that we can know if this issue is related to any recent change/maintenance.</p>
<p>2. For the Office 365 users, are they directly created in Office 365, or moved from on-premise Skype for Business server?</p>
<p>3. If necessary, please configure your firewall to allow Skype for Business Online IP range and specific ports. For detailed information, please see:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#BKMK_SfB_IP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<strong># Expand to see the Skype for Business Online IP Addresses</strong></p>
<p>4. To check if the issue is related to network, could you perform this test: Let on-premise users join the meeting from external network? Does the issue persist?</p>
<p>After that, we will further check it. Upon consulting, we might need to trace and analyze related logs from client.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>Thanks for your replies. I recently noticed that On-premises users can join meeting created by O365 user from external network. However, it is only not working internally. Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Download free app for g-mail and yahoo mail on Nokia E72</h2>
                    
<p>Hiya,</p>
<p>I bought my Mobile in South Africa some 4 yrs ago, and am very happy with it..even the Battery is still strong.</p>
<p>I now live and work in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. U.K. for the last 8 months.</p>
<p>I had my G-mail and Yahoo Mail accounts loaded on the Mobile when I bought the phone and always used it here in the U.K. until 2 months ago, when they suddenly wouldnt work anymore.</p>
<p>On asking my local Network " Pay as you go " supplier..(Orange)...they told me the app has expired and I should download the new free app from the OviStore..which I cannot do...nothing will work??</p>
<p>We have Sky Broadband in the house where I live and cannot download anything from the OviStore through the Broadband either??</p>
<p>I need to have my Internet working on my Mobile as I work daily and do not have access to a Computer, as my Laptop is left at home for the evenings.</p>
<p>Kindly help?</p>
<p>In anticipation.</p>

<p>The Nokia Store on your phone does not allow to download any app, because parts of the&nbsp;Nokia Account server&nbsp;face&nbsp;an outage currently. However, you should be able to download apps via your computer and the Nokia Suite, if you go for&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend to subscribe to &nbsp;(top, left-hand side) because when this works again, you get notified by E-mail. Aynway, do not worry too much about that because we do not need any additional apps&nbsp;– back to initial issues:</p>

The Code is: 0595752<br />
Thanks.

<p>Mhm. Everything works with my Nokia E72 with firmware&nbsp;091.003. Your firmware variant (0595752) &nbsp;did not get the latest firmware version. If you had&nbsp;0586524 as Nokia Product Code, you would have got 091.003 as well. Not sure if that is related. Which error
 message(s) do you get with my tricks? We need those messages word for word.</p>

<p>I have tried to install a new e-mail through the Mobile, and it just stands dormant, and wont go any further.</p>
<p>The same with the Ovi Store..I cannot get into it at all.</p>
<p>My G-mail server version for incoming mails is: &nbsp;imap.gmail.com...Security: &nbsp;(SSL / TLS).</p>
<p>Outgoing Server: &nbsp;smtp.gmail.com ... I thought it may be outdated and all I needed was to get the new route address?</p>
<p>My Yahoo is: &nbsp;incoming: &nbsp;nokia-free-imap</p>
<p>Outgoing: &nbsp;nokia-free-smtp</p>
<p>Gmail and Yahoo all have the same Security: &nbsp;SSL / TLS</p>
<p>I also cannot open the "net settings" from the icons on my phone.</p>

<p>Hiya,</p>
<p>Yes..it is the wi-fi in the House...and when I click on the g-mail or yahoomail icon on my Nokia, the wi-fi sign comes up...saying Sky etc..and then I click on there and it opens my mail up fpr me.</p>
<p>At the moment I get as far as the wi-fi sign coming up and when I click on the Sky sign....it flashes up as "Connected"..then flashes off immediately....as "Disconnected"...and I can see according to my new mail on my laptop..(when I view the mail there)...that
 no new mail has come through on the Mobile, but the mail shows on my Laptop.</p>

<p>Just to double-check again, you use that ‘Email’ icon within Menu? Or where is that GMail and Yahoo! Mail icon? I have to determine, if you use the Nokia E-mail client or a separate app. Please, answer this question in any cas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is that Email icon, sounds like your Destinations are broken:</p>
<p>Nokia E72 » Menu » Control panel » Settings » Connection » Destinations » Options » Default connection » Internet. Then, make sure all destinations are empty – delete via Options – except the Internet destination. That should contain 1-or-more Wi-Fi and
 not more than one packet-data access point (= Orange UK Pay-As-You-Go). Did that help?</p>

<p>I HAVE FOLLOWED THOSE STEPS...and when I get to the end...it states the available wi-fi's in the area and 1 Internet Connection, being Orange, then the default connection says: &nbsp;" always ask "</p>
<p>I have however gone through all the steps and found that the Connection Name is Orange, Data Bearer (packet data)... but the Access Point Name is EE Internet, but it must have come about when EE took over Orange in some form??</p>

    <title>Website redirecting to Linkey tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msplace  say:</h3>
<h2>            Website redirecting to Linkey tab</h2>
                    <p>Primarily from my Yahoo home page, but also from other sites with links I try to follow, I often get (instead of the destination expected) a tab labeled "Linkey" with various logos. I tried addressing this before but was asked to paste image of tab screen
 and couldn't make print screen key work. Just found in an answer in Community that on laptops, you need to hold down the fn key. Successfully pasted a screen image in Paint, so will try here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Great! It worked. Today I'm getting this tab a lot. On one occasion trying to follow a link from a search results tab (where I sometimes get the Linkey tab as well), I got a dialog box saying Network Defender (SW that came w/ Cisco router) had blocked site.
 I'll have to figure out how to modify those settings -- not only am I an adult living alone, I'm an elderly female trying to find thigh high stockings, not hooker hose. Those settings are meant to prevent teens and preteens from getting around protective controls.</p>

    <title>Locked out of a mail account, self-help, mails and support ticket - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christofferfyhn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of a mail account, self-help, mails and support ticket gives little help.</h2>
                    I've got a mail account that I have connected to things like guild wars 2, etsy, ebay, facebook, twitter and so on. This mail I can't get into again. Now, I've tried all the self-help options where I send in details about passwords I have used for that
 account, the answer to secret question, name, birth date, address and so on. Now, they also asked for mails I've sent TO, sadly, I do not use this mail to send with, it's more of a place to collect info-mails I get. I don't have a phone connected to this account
 either, so that option was kinda out of the question. The mail said to be connected (security mail or whatever you wanna call it) is not familiar to me, quite likely an old mail from FAR back, as I've switched mail accounts before, due to spam issues and such.
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Fast forward a bit, I was told to send a support ticked, where info asked was simply what mail I had issues with, what mail they could contact me on, and of course details about the issue. A few hours later I get a mail in my, call it secondary mail, where
 I was given a link. Once I opened it, it said: "[SECONDARY MAIL] has not permission to show this event." I sent a new ticket about this issue as well, and irony goes to the fact the link from that ticket had the same issue. Glorious...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried to open the link in several ways, such as different browsers, computers and so on. Also logged completely out of any signed in account to see if that would help. Nope... Also tried copy/paste the link into the browsers, but that was pretty much
 wasted time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I gave a call to my local microsoft base here in Norway. I was told that it should simply ask for help here, because (hopefully) you can point me in the correct direction from here on out.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So please, any idea, I will give anything a shot, as long as I can get my access back on that account.</div>

            The problem you're facing seems often to arise if there's a discrepancy between your actual location, the location given in your account profile and the location support.microsoft.com thinks you're in. For example, if you're in Norway, you should start
 the process from <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/nb-no/windows-live/id-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/nb-no/windows-live/id-support</a>.<br />
<br />
You should also check that all the information in the <a href="https://account.live.com/editprofs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
profile</a> for&nbsp;your alternative account is accurate.

            I am in the same predicament, having an email that was blocked in which I never send email.<br />
Mine is for ebay/paypal only.<br />
Mine was locked when I dared to logon from my girlfriends house. The irony was that they didn't block that effort, only the one I did when I got home.<br />
You would think microsoft would embrace the mobile community a little bit better than that.<br />
And for me, this is the second account they've done this to. Fortunately the first time happened when all the original support links still worked, and I was still able to do a reset.<br />
Now I fear i've lost this one. We're talking more than 2 years of saved paypal/ebay emails. Gone because I used the account from somewhere else.<br />

The fly in the ointment here, is that this means they don't like it if you log on away from home. How can an email provider not allow for that?<br />
And to make matters worse, my original backup address to the account is now closed, as I had been getting spammed from some scary level middle east addresses. And I never added a new backup to it.<br />
So for me, Microsoft might as well be saying "sorry guy, make a new account".<br />
Well my new account is going to be gmail from now on, because this is way too much trouble for having literally not done a single thing wrong other than NOT sending mail from the account.<br />

            <p>I too suffer from being locked out of my account.<br />
I had to change accounts on my windows phone to get the 8.1 update and either put the wrong live account in or wrong passwords. Now shame on me for not writing down all my passwords.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience with windows is as follows</p>
<p>Once locked out of the account the automated system failed.</p>
<p>It failed as&nbsp;I only had one password,&nbsp;I never sent or received any emails and the system was not sending me a security code. So i contacted the chat lines and was bounced from live account to windows phone back to live account support. Eventually&nbsp;I was told
 that there is no support team designated to help with Windows Phone issues.<br />
Not receiving the info or help I had hoped&nbsp;for I escalated the issue with windows "Subsidiary Executive escalation team"</p>
<p>This takes you from talking directly with somebody to putting you in a secure email type setup that takes several hours sometimes a day for them to respond. Its simply infuriating to know that they simply put up gates and walls like that and call it "support"</p>
<p>My issue was submitted on the 12th, by the time the 25th came around I decided to follow up as I had not heard anything.&nbsp;I come to find out that&nbsp;the escalation team communicates on windows service&nbsp;request website and that I have to log in and&nbsp;follow&nbsp;some
 links and actually follow up and seek&nbsp;help and explain myself all over again to the escalation team.<br />
The escalation team explained to me over&nbsp;about 10 emails back and fourth that there is nothing they can do to further help me and I should speak to the chat people.
<br />
Once I got to the chat people gave the chat agent my case number I still&nbsp;had to explain myself again,&nbsp; to which I was told my case number is "zune support request" and that they cant help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here we are a month after I got locked out of my phone. I have discovered that lt is not uncommon to have to start a new live account. A quick search will prove that I am not the only one in this boat, there are many cases.
<br />
THIS IS ESPESCIALLY BAD BECAUSE YOU LOOSE ANY PURCHASED APPS OR DATAT ON YOUR PHONE WHEN YOU OPEN A NEW ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>HOW ON EARTH DO YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO BUY APPS&nbsp;GAMES MUSICetc&nbsp;WHEN THERE IS NO FAILSAFE FOR RECOVERING YOUR PURCHASE.&nbsp;<br />
I know i wont be purchasing anything until there is better system in place</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Gmail is, in fact, dropping support for IE9. Since you can't install IE10 on Vista I would (in fact I have) install Chrome and use it when accessing Gmail.</p>

<h2>            File checked out or locked for editing by myself</h2>
                    
<p>I am unable to rename, delete or move several files as they're "checked out or locked for editing by another user" and the user it's referring to is me. &nbsp;I'm using Onedrive online only. &nbsp;I copied a file while it was still open in another tab and now the
 copied file thinks it's in use by myself when it's not. I think copied the copy while it was closed and the issue remained in the second copy.</p>
<p>Is there some way to unlock it so I can delete these files?</p>

<p>Hi Avril,</p>
<p>To clarify this issue, I'd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. For the affected files, do they reside in the same library? If yes, I suggest go to
<strong>library settings</strong> &gt; <strong>manage files which have no checked in version</strong> to see if the problematic files are there. If yes, take ownership and publish them to a major version and try to delete them again.<br />
2. Are there affected files checked out? Please try to check out and check in the files if you can.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-au/article/Check-out-check-in-or-discard-changes-to-files-in-a-library-7e2c12a9-a874-4393-9511-1378a700f6de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-au/article/Check-out-check-in-or-discard-changes-to-files-in-a-library-7e2c12a9-a874-4393-9511-1378a700f6de</a>
<br />
3. How do you copy the file while the original file is open? Did the copy reside in the same library?<br />
4. Can you share the files to others? If yes, will the shared user be able to delete them? What about files in another library or another site collection?</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

            If you want to use a Date axis but have unequal Axis labels you will need to create the axis labels using a dummy series.<br />
The dummy series will have data points for each label and Y values of zero, or Min Y axis value)<br />
<br />
You can find examples here.<br />

<p>To recap:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see this message you either have not installed updates, or you are working on a presentation that was damaged by PowerPoint by a previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent this message from happening to any presentations you currently have or make in the future, install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are seeing this message when opening a presentation that has been damaged, your only option is to repair the damaged presentation or to be very safe, make a new one from scratch. If you can find an undamaged earlier version of your presentation, start
 with that and go forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to install updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install the updates.</span></li><li><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.

<p>This was ALREADY fixed by an update, which you must install BEFORE you attempt to re-create or work on your presentations, or you will corrupt them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go the the Help menu in PowerPoint and choose Check for Updates to launch AutoUpdate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to check your update level first, go to the PowerPoint menu and choose About PowerPoint. You should have version 15.34 or later at this time.</p>

I am so sorry to all the people out there seeking help for this error. &nbsp;I just called Microsoft and was told by their representative and her manager that they don't know how to fix this. &nbsp;After losing my cool (which I rarely do over the phone) He agreed to
 escalate the issue (using this link) to a Senior Engineer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On a side note, this is why I prefer to deal with Apple. &nbsp;No one was willing to go the extra mile.... disappointed Microsoft. &nbsp;So now my sons work over 4 weeks will need to be redone in 2 days. &nbsp;:(</p>

<p>They DO know how to fix the problem and have already fixed the problem, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your presentation was damaged by the bad release you will have to re-create it in the current, fixed updated version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New presentations and any old presentations that weren't damaged should not experience degradation. The only presentations that are known to be affected are ones that were opened in the bad release, which has been replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not installed updates, then do so before you open any presentations. Here's how to update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection before checking for updates. Install Mac OS X updates followed by Office updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Install Mac OS X updates first:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Then Install Office Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get the update:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open any Office application:</span></p>
<p><span>3. Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection</span></p>
<p><span>4. Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></p>
<p><span>5. Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></p>
<p><span>6. Restart your Mac</span></p>

            Jim - you may well be right, but it was not what I was told by the 2nd level support person. This seems what Ianuzza found also. I am happy to provide the case number - in the meantime we upgraded to 15.34 as the error was on 15.33 so hopefully you are
 right and its OK for future docs.

 really more of a Outlook Express for mobile than a Office Outlook for mobile. Thats ok, but I am wanting to disable the `block internet images` *** which happens when people link to images in a HTML email. I am looking for a reg hack becuase there seems to
 be nothing in the way of a nice menu option (which you get in Outlook Express AND Office Outlook) to disable this security option.<br />
<br />
Any help, and I mean anything, would be nice.<br />

Thank you,<br />

    <title>Configuring my N82 to act as a USB modem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Configuring my N82 to act as a USB modem</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Web'n'Walk is already configured on my mobile and that works very well..I would now like to extend this service to my Laptop PC.<br />
<br />
Could someone please instruct me on how I may go about configuring both my phone and laptop to enable internet access on my laptop via my N82 as a USB connected modem.<br />
<br />
I use windows XP, have installed the USB cable/modem driver instead of Nokia Suite (only need the modem driver) have created and tried to configure a new connection in network places but thus far have not been successfull. Also as far as I know, PC Suite is
 what should be selected on the Phone...<br />
<br />
Please let me know if I am missing something..also I am sure the configured new network connection must be wrong...
                </div>

            Hi gazawee<br />
<br />
Perhaps T-Mobile branded firmware is constraining your device. Network providers may be happy that you can talk, text or surf with
<b>your device</b> as much as you like, but using it as USB modem is usually outside your package and charged accordingly.

            Thank you scoobyman,<br />
<br />
My phone is not restricted by T-Mobile firmware, it is an unlocked and sim free phone. Also the service I subscribe to is the web'n'walk plus which allows the use of the phone as a modem(Actually it's even possible with the basic web'n'walk even though T-Mobile
 prohibit it).<br />
<br />
The issue is with the correct configuration of the device and PC. Could someone please walk me through the configuration process (step by step)<br />
<br />
P.S I am aware that the installation of PC Suite would resolve this but I really do not want to install a suite of applications when all I need is a connection..(hence why I have choosen to install the modem drivers only)<br />
<br />
P.P.S T-Mobile are unable to support me because this phone has not yet been released on their network.

            Create a dialup connection using the modem and tell it to dial<br />
*99#<br />
that should get you connected, however it wont specify the APN if you need to use one a specific one, so im presuming it will go with the default.<br />
<br />
edit: just found someone posted instructions elsewhere<br />
/discussions/board/message?board.id=connectivity&amp;thread.id=11724<br />
<br />
ps. as you said installing pc suite makes it a hell of a lot easier, just having to select your network and the settings are all there<br />

            I have a problem connecting my N82 by USB cable for use as a modem. I have installed the drivers using PC Suite (you don't need to install all the options by the way), but the connection won't work. It tries to dial, but doesn't connect.<br />
<br />
However everything works perfectly for data and modem using Bluetooth, but I think that uses a generic modem driver, and it's very slow.<br />
<br />
The supplied cable which works fine for data transfer, but not as a Nokia N82 USB modem. However the device is listed as such in Hardware (XP) and passes the Diagnostics test. It just doesn't connect.
