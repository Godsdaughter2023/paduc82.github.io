            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest that you update the video card drivers from the manufacturer website.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing which you can try in order to fix the issue would be to update the
<strong>motherboard chipset driver and also perform a BIOS (Basic Input Output System)&nbsp;</strong>update<strong>&nbsp;</strong>specifically the
<strong>AGPmini.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accellerated Graphics Port</strong> driver&nbsp;within <strong>Device Manager(System Devices)
</strong>install the motherboard update from the motherboard manufacturers website. Ensure that you have the correct update for your motherboard model for most systems, without this, your video card will run in PCI-Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Please get in touch with the manufacturer to update the Motherboard Chipset Driver</p>
<p><br />

            Hello! You must have installed the driver of your graphic card to enable the hardware accelleration... See on web site of your video card producer to find the right drivers&nbsp; :)&nbsp; After you have installed driver, turn on hardware acceleration if it don't
 start automatically :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope to be more helpful :)

<h2>            Explorer.exe consuming 50&#37; of CPU and making my PC really slow</h2>
                    From the last 3-4 months, I started noting that explorer.exe process continuously takes up to 50% of my CPU. Whenever I open a folder it reaches up to 100% and PC Starts lagging allover. Even after closing the folder, it remains 100% and I have to restart
 explorer to bring it down to 50%. This is really frustrating me as I'm unable to work on my PC. Please provide a solution as quickly as possible and yes, I can't reboot my PC as I have many important files and folders of wich I can't backup. Also, I can't
 restore as I have it disabled.

<h2>            Slow Windows Startup</h2>
                    
<p>I have reduced the number of startup programs and services on windows 7 but my start time is still very slow (it takes over 20 minutes for windows to start up after I put in my password).&nbsp; How can I further speed up my startup?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, what services can I disable? I have disabled quite a few optional services but I don't know if there are still other services that I could disable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Check the default Windows Services (set all to default) and then you can experiment<br />
with whatever remains of the 3rd party services - be careful as some 3rd party services<br />
will be needed for proper operation.<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            Again, why are you always unpropose the only correct way to diagnostic such issues?Hi,<br />
<br />
make sure you have the service Superfetch running and next try to speed up the boot with the help of my guide [1]. This trains the advanced prefetcher in Windows 7. This increase the boot performance a lot.<strong>All other tweaking tools are useless. Only
 use this method with this Microsoft Toolkit.<br />
</strong><br />
If this doesn't speed up the boot process, follow my guide [2] to make a boot trace and compress the<strong>boot_BASE+CSWITCH+DRIVERS+POWER_1.etl</strong>as 7z or RAR and upload it to your Skydrive [3] and post the link here.<br />
<br />
I take a look at the trace, maybe I see what's wrong with your Windows.<br />

<p>You should never have reducing the number as an objective. You should<br />
be concerned about <strong>what</strong> the startup programs are. Read the<br />
following:</p>
<p>First, note that you should be concerned with <strong>all</strong> programs that<br />
start automatically, not just with those that go into the system tray.<br />
Not all auto-starting programs manifest themselves by an icon in the<br />
tray.</p>
<p>On each program you don't want to start automatically, check its<br />
Options to see if it has the choice not to start (make sure you<br />
actually choose the option not to run it, not just a "don't show icon"<br />
option). Many can easily and best be stopped that way. If that doesn't<br />
work, run MSCONFIG from the Start | Run line, and on the Startup tab,<br />
uncheck the programs you don't want to start automatically.</p>
<p>However, if I were you, I wouldn't do this just for the purpose of<br />
running the minimum number of programs. Despite what many people tell<br />
you, you should be concerned, not with how <strong>many</strong> of these programs<br />
you run, but <strong>which</strong>. Some of them can hurt performance severely, but<br />
others have no effect on performance.</p>
<p>Don't just stop programs from running willy-nilly. What you should do<br />
is determine what each program is, what its value is to you, and what<br />
the cost in performance is of its running all the time. You can try<br />
internet searches and ask about specifics here.</p>
<p>Once you have that information, you can make an intelligent informed<br />
decision about what you want to keep and what you want to get rid of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but my start time is still very slow (it takes over 20 minutes for windows to start up after I put in my password).&nbsp; How can I further speed up my startup?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two points:</p>
<p>1. You may have reduced the number but you may not have stopped the<br />
important ones. Read the above again, and do as I suggest with regard<br />
to <strong>which</strong> you should stop.</p>
<p>2. More likely than your problem being startup programs is that you<br />
are infected with malware. What anti-virus and anti-spyware programs<br />
do you run? Are they kept up to date?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, what services can I disable? I have disabled quite a few optional services but I don't know if there are still other services that I could disable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disabling services is unlikely to help you with your problem and is<br />
almost always a bad idea.</p>

<p>Tinkering with Services is a recipe for creating a computer where things do not work! Leave them alone.</p>
<p>Look at Applications which load at Start Up. Decide whether they need to load at "Start Up" or whether they are better used on an "On Demand" basis.</p>
<p>Ascertain which routines e.g. anti-virus scans, can be rescheduled to take place at a more convenient time.</p>
<p>Develop a housekeeping routine and stick to it.</p>
<p>Determine where bottlenecks on performance exist by observing which operations are slow and how they impact on memory and CPU usage. Adding RAM memory is often helpful but what is often overlooked is that the way you use programmes wiil impact on performance.
 Editing photos without saving at intervals is an example. The undo feature can create large demands fo memory.</p>
<p>Keep your computer free from error by keeping an eye on errors in Event Viewer and deal with them as they arise.</p>

<div>work, run MSCONFIG from the Start | Run line, and on the Startup tab,</div>
<div>uncheck the programs you don't want to start automatically.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, if I were you, I wouldn't do this just for the purpose of</div>
<div>running the minimum number of programs. Despite what many people tell</div>
<div>you, you should be concerned, not with how *many* of these programs</div>
<div>you run, but *which*. Some of them can hurt performance severely, but</div>
<div>others have no effect on performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Don't just stop programs from running willy-nilly. What you should do</div>
<div>is determine what each program is, what its value is to you, and what</div>
<div>the cost in performance is of its running all the time. You can try</div>
<div>internet searches and ask about specifics here.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once you have that information, you can make an intelligent informed</div>
<div>decision about what you want to keep and what you want to get rid of.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>One last question: please tell us what your hardware configuration is.</div>

<p>I currently use Norton Anti-virus.&nbsp; I've run scans and it didn't show anything...</p>
<p>As for RAM - I have 4 GB of ram.&nbsp; I really only use the computer for school and work related activities - no games. If there is anything else you need for hardware configuration, please let me know :).&nbsp; I do have over 50 GBs free on my harddrive so that
 shouldn't be an issue.</p>
<p>Currently, all I have running (according to MSCONFIG) for startup items is:</p>

<p>HD Audio Control Panel</p>
<p>HP Wireless Assistant</p>
<p>Canan IJ Network Scan Utility</p>
<p>Bluetooth Software 6.0</p>
<p>If necessary, I can put my startup services as well.&nbsp; It would just take a little longer to type them :).</p>
<p>I checked and made sure all my device drivers are updated.&nbsp; I'm just not sure what to do next...its a hassle for it to take so long to start this up.&nbsp; thanks again!</p>

    <title>Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller network drops intermittently after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave williamson2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller network drops intermittently after Windows 10 update from 1511 to 1607</h2>
                    <p>After Windows 10 1511 updated itself to 1607 the network connection would intermittently drop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running a CMD prompt with</p>
<p>
</p><p>ping &lt;my gateway ip&gt; -n 500 -w 500</p>
<p>
</p><p>would typically result in a 4-7% loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In Device Manager found that the Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller when prodded to update its driver would do so.&nbsp; I.E. Windows wasn't automatically applying the driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02a9e66e-8fca-4464-8253-0958e4417f05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02a9e66e-8fca-4464-8253-0958e4417f05" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>While doing a driver update on the Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller didn't do the trick by itself ... I found that switching the device manager to show hidden devices and by connection (found in the view menu of Device Manager) .... and doing a driver update
 on the device above the Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller and then the device above that device, etc. until all were on the latest driver .... the network now stays connected as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone else.</p>

    <title>How do I create a desktop shortcut that will open a Word document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidh,sanfrancsico  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I create a desktop shortcut that will open a Word document located on the Internet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Our Intranet includes Word documents which we need to open in Word, edit, and save to our local comptuers.&nbsp; It ought to be easy to create a shortcut on my desktop that points to one of these documents, and opens the document in Word when I double-click on
 it.&nbsp; But this has proven very tricky.&nbsp; All my attempts to create such a shortcut (copy &amp; paste, drag and drop), create "Internet Shortcuts" which evoke Internet Explorer first, and only then (if I'm lucky)&nbsp;load the document into Word.&nbsp; Worse, in many cases
 they lock up Internet Explorer so that we need to shut down Internet Explorer with Task Manager.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If I start with a desktop shortcut pointing to a local Word document, and try to modiify to point to the docx file on the Web server, Windows refuses to allow it, claiming the target is invalid.&nbsp;

            <p>Hey David</p>
<p>Is the network share/drive mapped or are you only&nbsp;accessing through IE? If the documents need to be saved to the local computer, why create a shortcut on the desktop to the file on the server (just asking)?</p>
<p>If you are opening IE&nbsp;and navigating to Sharepoint or&nbsp;the intranet (assuming a web page?), you will need to open the document and then do a save as and save to the local PC. Trying to create a shortcut from here will be a web-based link (opening IE as you
 have experienced).&nbsp;<strong>Have you tried to right-click the document and select "Send to - Desktop"?</strong></p>
<p>Why I asked if the network&nbsp;share was mapped is that will make it a lot easier creating desktop shortcuts if you can point directly to the file where it resides on the server.
<strong>When creating a shortcut and browsing the location, select "Computer", then select the drive mapping and expand out to the actual file</strong>. This will create a shortcut directly to the&nbsp;file&nbsp;on the network.</p>
<p>Anyway...hope one of those methods will work for you.</p>

            Thanks!<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <b>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a system thread generated an exception which the error handler did not catch.</i><br />
<br />
BugCheck 1000007E, {<u><i><b>c0000005</b></i></u>, 82e24734, 8ab1f648, 8ab1f220}<br />
<br />
^^ The 1st parameter of the bugcheck is c0000005 which indicates an access violation occurred, let's see what caused it:<br />
<br />
<i>:kd&gt; .exr 0xffffffff8ab1f648<br />
ExceptionAddress: 82e24734 (<b>nt!RtlEqualUnicodeString</b>+0x0000002f)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ExceptionCode: c0000005 (Access violation)</i><br />
<br />
It was caused by <i><b>RtlEqualUnicodeString</b></i> which is the routine compares two Unicode strings to determine whether they are equal. Most likely a device driver related issue.<br />

            Yup, Deckard solved the problem. Here is his post from the other thread for quick reference. His solution worked for me:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
"I've read this thread to the end and I've tried all the solutions posted... obviously to no avail.
<br />
The bug repeats itself, not randomly but constantly, in any situation, folders, libraries - sorted by name or by whatever.<br />
I then tried something different, which instead WORKED , and here it is.<br />
<br />
1) I backed up the registry.<br />
2) Searched for occurrences of the word refresh and found this key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{BDEADE7F-C265-11D0-BCED-00A0C90AB50F}\Instance<br />
which contains three subkeys. One of them, curiously enough, is DontRefresh and it has a value of 1 (turned ON)<br />
3) I then changed the value to 0 (turned OFF) and hit F5 to refresh and save the now changed registry.<br />
<br />
Guess what? Now, everything (moving, deleting, copying) works and even the Trash Bin refreshes immediately.<br />
I will keep you posted in the next few days to tell you whether the fix still works.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
PS: I forgot to say that I have 3 machines and they respectively run Win7 Ult, Win7 Pro and Win7 Home Premium. Of course all of them showed this bug.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 8 days and several reboots since the fix and everything is still working fine on all three machines."

Third party software might be responsible for this behavior. I would suggest you clean boot Windows to find out the culprit. A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflict. Follow the steps in this KB article to perform this task</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Just updated Windows and now I can&#39;t access any of my files</h2>
                    <p>So, Windows decided to download some updates and force restart/install them while I was in the middle of using the computer. &nbsp;No big deal, that happens all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the computer finally started up I noticed that the login screen/process was radically different. &nbsp;I signed in and before i could click on it, I saw some message pop up in the tray and then disappear. &nbsp;It was something about being signed in with a temporary
 profile and had to sign out and then log in to see my files, and everything made would be deleted when I signed out. &nbsp;I was confused - but sure enough, the computer was operating as if I was a new user. &nbsp;My apps were running as if it were the first time, and
 not of my files, pictures, etc showed up in my library. &nbsp;I went to log out, expecting to be in some guest profile, only to discover it WAS my profile. &nbsp;I logged out anyway and logged back in - but it was the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely enough, I can go to "my computer" and navigate through to my files - but despite my account being logged in, it's not treating my account as the owner/creator of all the files. &nbsp;How do I get my account access back? I want it to go back to the way
 it was before, whereby I simply logged in and had my fully customized and established account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It looks like the current user profile is corrupted. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. Perform the steps provided here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to enabled the built in admin account and create a new user account to see if that helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to perform the steps mentioned by <strong>'Pinaki Mohanty replied on November 22, 2012</strong>' in the article provided.

            <p>Thanks Winston, I actually just rolled the computer back to a previous restore point cause I really needed to use it (in a functioning fashion) at the time. &nbsp;If I have the problem again, I'll come back here and follow those steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer Crashes and Shows Wrong Properties for Disks Larger than 4TB</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since last Windows 10 Update, File Explorer crashes frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of such crashes happens trying opening the Properties window for a 5TB WD hard disk while using a non-administrator account.</p>
<p>The same operation tried with an administrator account don't crashes, but report wrong figures for disk space used and available. It looks like a formatting error, as total capacity is reported correctly, and the Disk Administrator tool reports all disk
 data correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea of what is happening or if there any fix available?</p>
                </div>

            There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Hi AvidAgate
<br />
<br />Version 1803 of Windows 10 introduced a bug into Explorer.exe, whereby it has trouble reading file metadata, that also results in Explorer not being able to read the properties or correct size of folders with a large sub-folder structure - including large drives
<br />
<br />Microsoft have released a fix for this bug, which is currently on the Insiders ring and will hopefully be released to the rest of us shortly . . .

<p>Thanks, Frederick. But it is an external disk using a USB3.0 link.</p>

<p>Hi, Vijay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for such detailed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the KB&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">4099479</a>&nbsp;you suggested doesn't appear in my Updates History list. May be because I am using Windows 10
 Pro (1803, installed: 03/05/2018, version: 17134.472).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find any useful system restore point, and performing a repair upgrade will remove most of my installed software (this is what I conclude from the list that the system provides me; may be because I am using the machine for software development).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it would take a lot of time, and the disk seems to be operating without further problems, I will cross my fingers waiting for the fix that DaveM121 is refering to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I am grateful for your quick and detailed answer.</p>

<p>I performed the repair upgrade using the Media Creation Tool. After several hours (even having a SSD system disk!), my data and programs are still here ;-)</p>
<p>However, the problem still remains. What I noticed is that it happens only on the left side of the Explorer (the tree view). I am not sure that this were the original problem, but at least I can wait now for the fix that DaveM121 commented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks you both for your good will, and Happy New Year!</p>

<h2>            Failed to sync world data&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just updated minecraft yesterday on my xbox one. The update allows me to test features of the new Aquatic update that will be coming out soon, by making a copy of my world. I went to edit my world so I can do that and it started syncing. Then this message pops up..... " The world is not fully synced or has been corrupted. Try playing the world on a console where it's in a good state and try migrating it again." The only option I have is to click go back. The copy is made but no features from the aquatic pack test show up. I never played this world on another version, I created it on this xbox. I don't know entirely what to do......</p>

<h2>            Playing a game on a freezing xbox</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Xbox Forums,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have check all areas time and time again including clearing my cache, searching for courpted files on HDD, installing the game to HDD.</p>
<p>4.also slowly operating the xbox environment eg. xbox guide, buttons pressed, menu actions -&gt; all done in a certain time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>doing number 4 seems to never have any impact on the xbox when 4. is in effect&nbsp;but playing online its quiet hard when your required to keep on your toes 24/7 and recently ive been ignoring this step - 4..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was just playing the best game of assasin's creed brotherhood out of 7 hrs of continuous gameplay online with 3hrs before that game play call of duty 2 online multiplayer.</p>
<p>The xbox fps dropped to like 3fps for around about 15 seconds before sound completely stopped and so did the screen. turning off the controller, ejecting disk did nothing. I check my xbox for heat issues all the time the xbox 250gb slim never has heat issues
 and is well ventilated. why does it keep happening? I do everything possible to prevent it yet it still freezes.</p>
<p>when your a person playing the game and is full immersed and then it just freezes... from the best online experience drops to the floor to like the biggest let down i almost cried.</p>
<p>It seems like the OS visuals are "windows 7" like but the processor is still like windows xp were it just locks up and doesnt try and resolve anything. windows latest OS sure freezes games and IE etc.. but it doesnt lock up and I have to restart my computer
 like windows 98.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTION: I love the xbox and xbox live service but when you have tried everything and still it freezes it hurts. is it the game bugs, xbox OS? does the xbox somehow get "full" after hours of gameplay and can not operate any more? What do I do now, is there
 a solution for me to take to help fix or prevent it from happening again? I still want to play but I dont want to hear that sound when I turn off the xbox when it freezes. turning off the xbox normally sounds different to when it freezes and you turn it off,
 same as personal computers. not only does it hurt the system it hurts me, inside.</p>
<p>those people online, gone. that experience online is like 1 in&nbsp;16 experiences over 14yrs of gaming.&nbsp;PLEASE have some kind of debugging screen to come up on the next xbox or something so we can see what is actually going wrong like RAM/memory error, HDD failled,
 game bug returning to title screen, DVD read error xbox will now restart. rather than a complete crash were you have to turn off the console just like you would to an outdated PC holding in the power&nbsp;button so it can turn off. it hurts and just makes me sad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a gut check for me to.&nbsp; The new ( old now) GTA had just come out and my freezing issues just started on that game.&nbsp; 5 min in, freeze EVEYTIME.&nbsp; I was crushed.&nbsp; I the only option I had after trying all of the support was to send it in for repair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will say it was quick about 7 days and I got my xbox back.&nbsp; That xbox is still running, 4 years later.&nbsp; I would send it in if I was you.&nbsp; Wish I had better news.</p>

<p>nah its not that sort of problem. just like any system were it be windows, apple etc.. freezes I just would like to know why the xbox can not fix itself and continue to run why do I have to hard restart it. imagine everytime your computer didnt respond for
 5 seconds it will then completely lock up you HAD to restart it. some computers take 10 seconds for my computer to load. why can't the xbox -&gt; freeze sure anything will do this. then xbox unfreezes or restarts game or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The console I know does not need to be sent in for repair. my old console I still have the old xbox pro 120gb console. that console needs to be sent in for repair because it starts then freezes at startup screen. the dvd drive can not open anymore unless
 you bang it out. some games get stuck in the dvd drive. also any game you put into the xbox any stance the xbox is on it scratchs the disc so now i only play pre-owned games on that console or games i can easily replace. even if i burn it to HDD the disk it
 like scratched for some annoying reason.</p>
<p>that console doesnt have much life left but its been going since 2007. phone support helped but their solution was to send it in. mine was a solution that took 3 hrs trying different games. forcing the drive. the xbox stopped reading xbox 360 games but could
 read xbox original games. the xbox thought the xbox 360 disc was a mixed content disc and when going to the video/picture viewer you could actually browse the content of the xbox 360 disc. the drive stuffed up good but i fixed it. 3 hrs though..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my 250gb slim freezes after many hours of gameplay. there has to be a reason&nbsp; either you guys don't know or its only known by the devs. I know you guys are just trying to help but the xbox phone support and the forums don't seem to be able to give heavy
 technical support. Ive gone through 4 times when the old pro console wouldn't even operate and only once did I have to send it in for repair and thats when it RROD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from what I have described above in the other message&nbsp;do you or anyone reading this know if I sign in and out or go back to the title screen every couple of hours that the xbox will somehow refresh itself and it is not going to lock up and freeze?</p>

<p>if your onsole is freezing during gameplay, it needs to be repaired. internally itis overheating which is a problem. you wont be able to feel the overheating on the outside of the console. your video card inside of your xbox is what is causing it. and sorry
 to say if your slim is freezing as well. gotta send it in. sorry</p>

<p>the pro console lasts just as long as the slim before it freezes too cause it has a similar problem. but with the pro has a chance to not turn on at all after it happens. pros old and it doesnt really matter with the pro. slim im worried about. you know
 what im going to do if I ever get another xbox again. im going to have fans blowing at every hot area on the xbox. if thats requires 3 notebook/fans then so be it.</p>
<p>my old pro console gets 10 times hot than the slim yet the pro crashs at the same time as the slim. has the slim's overheat protection been turned to a lower temperature then the pro console?</p>
<p>i do understand but any other computer hardware usually you can put your hand over the fan or on the box and you can tell if its warm, hot or like lava. the computer im on now can burn my skin and make me bleed and it still works fine. my old pro console
 if it wasn't suspended in mid-air it would make the ground it sits on feel like your standing next to a heater. the slim console barely approaches warm. infact if I touch anywere else like the dvd drive it can closely resemble ice cold like a muffin or similar
 density left in a fridge.</p>
<p>question: I can not send it for repair either console. I will monitor the heat more closely only on my slim. the slim compared to the pro has far better heat dispertion and I thought because of such less heat feelable on the console the heat isn't there
 to make it overheat. if I send my console in for repair will it fix it? ive already sent my old pro in for repair how many time do I have to send in consoles for repair? If I have the xbox console on a bed of fans tthat some point to increase air intake and
 also to increase and get rid of heat will this upset any hardware inside the xbox eg. internal fans?</p>
<p>these fans i am talking about will be around the outside of the console not inside.</p>

<p>It is not possible to reset a password while in Repair Mode.</p>
<p>Here are two easy and one painful method to reset a Windows password:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log on using the password key file on a USB flash disk (if you ever made one)</li><li>Log on under the alternative admin account (if you ever created one and made a note of its details)</li><li>Use the process below. The process is complex and requires some careful typing.<br />
&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tap the Shift key five times. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxx" ppp&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Replace xxx with the account for which you wish to set a new password, and ppp with the new password)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator /active:yes {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To activate the Administrator account if desired)<br />
13. Log on under this account, using the new password.<br />
14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.</li></ul>
When the pain has subsided, suggest to your friend that a small amount of planning ahead will save her the pain next time round.

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade Corrupts Network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petrula  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Corrupts Network</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are numerous threads regarding networking problems which occur after upgrading to Windows 10, or from updates to Windows 10 systems. The upgrades and updates corrupt networking on Windows 10. Unfortunately, the consequences of the corruptions are a
 wide variety of networking problems - many of which appear unrelated. As a result, many threads speak of computers not appearing in the network, "0x80070035 network path not found" errors, Windows Sockets errors, protocol error messages, and other strange
 errors. These errors are frequently due to the network settings being corrupted by the Windows 10 upgrades and updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a local area network (LAN) consisting of several computers connected via ethernet cable and WiFi to a Comcast modem/router. My goal is in Windows File Explorer in the "Network" item to see both my computer and the other computers in my LAN. And to
 share drives between these computers via "Use user accounts and passwords to connect to other computers". Previously this worked in Windows 7. It did not work after upgrading all the computers to Windows 10 even though all my network settings were identical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following process corrected my situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset your modem/router to factory settings.</p>
<p>Start | right mouse | Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the following two commands, then reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh winsock reset</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh&nbsp;int&nbsp;ip&nbsp;reset resettcpip.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the modem/router to factory settings makes sure the router is not the issue.</p>
<p>Running the two netsh commands resets network component settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a local home network,</p>
<p>in "Open Network and Sharing Center",</p>
<p>make sure it is "private".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to see your local home networked computers using advanced sharing to their drives,</p>
<p>in "Change advanced sharing settings",</p>
<p>in Private (current profile), enable the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on network discovery</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on file and printer sharing</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Use user accounts and passwords to connect to other computers</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to see your local home networked computers using advanced sharing to their drives, both your PC and the other local network PC require an account on both computers with the same name.</p>
<p>In addition, for each computer, you must go into their</p>
<p>"Credential Manager" | "Windows Credentials" tab</p>
<p>and give the Password for the common account to the other computer.</p>

            <p>Your recommendations did not make any difference to my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system automatically defines the network as public and does not find the router. &nbsp;I can use the homegroup troubleshooter to redefine the network as private, but nothing I try makes the router visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other recommendations are for after the router is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone comes up with a way to eliminate this problem and make the computer work again. &nbsp;Once I was able to get it connected, but I don't know how I did it, and it stopped working as soon as the computer rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, but there was no value in your recommendation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A simpler way to do that is to use&nbsp; PowerShell&nbsp; Set-NetConnectionProfile&nbsp; -NetworkCategory "Private"</p>
<p>and then don't use a troubleshooter (since it would make it Public)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are you wanting to see the router?&nbsp; In the Network pane under Infrastructure?&nbsp; I'm not sure what causes that to be shown.&nbsp; It comes and goes it seems.&nbsp; FWIW I don't see it now.&nbsp; In any case I don't need to see that to open my router control panel using
 IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah.&nbsp; I just got the Homegroup working again.&nbsp; (Finally! Sort of.)&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I can see the Infrastructure section.&nbsp; So I guess that only comes with the Homegroup.</p>

            In File Explorer, "Network" does not show the router. It will show all the computers in the LAN which have the appropriate settings to be visible. You must directly log into your router often at 10.0.0.1 to make any router changes.

            <p>My system would not recognize the router at all. I could not log into the router directly as you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, I used a wireless device I had, and got the computer connected wirelessly. &nbsp;I was then able to check for driver updates. &nbsp;I found a driver update was needed and then the problem appears to be eliminated. &nbsp;Conclusion: &nbsp;Windows 10 did not update
 drivers necessary to make the network ethernet connections work.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 freezing and buzzing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 freezing and buzzing</h2>
                    <p>Recently I got a new computer and installed Windows 10 on it. In the first week everything was fine but I started noticing that when playing games or watching a video the computer would freeze for quarter or half a second, make a loud buzzing sound in my
 headphones or speaker and then return back to normal. While playing a video it just buzzes without freezing but in game it does both.&nbsp;One time I even got the blue screen with the message "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting
 some error info, and then we'll restart for you." This happened while playing a game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue cannot be caused by a virus since the PC is new and I didn't download any files. I have not experienced this issue at all on Windows 7 and 8.1. I have considered to return back to Windows 8.1 because of this, it's such an annoyance.<br />
<br />
What I tried:<br />
- Setting from Balanced to High Performance - already was set on that option<br />
- sfc/scannow - found nothing<br />
- Drivers - all up to date<br />
- Hardware issue troubleshoot - it just found something about updating drivers for new pluged-in devices<br />
- Updating Windows - Up to date</p>
<p><br />
Specs (most important things):<br />
Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-6400 2.70 GHz (6M Cache, do 3.30 GHz)<br />
Grapshics Card: Asus nVidia GeForce GTX 1050TI 4GB DDR5 EX-GTX1050TI-O4G<br />
RAM: 8 GB<br />

<p>I have included a picture taken with my phone, it's the other 3 times I've gotten the blue screen. Each
 one just had a different stop code. The one that had the message I couldn't take a picture of because I didn't have my phone close to me. The message was displayed bellow the stop code.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Hardware Reserving 8GiB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffrey hoegee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Hardware Reserving 8GiB</h2>
                    So I have this problem that regardless of what memory I use, It keeps saying 16GB (7.95 usable) and it's going to hardware reserved.<br />
<br />
My setup is MSI 970A-G43, AMD Vishera FX6350, GeiL DragonRAM 4x4 GB DDR3 1600MHz<br />
<br />
Even if I use the RAM individually all slots give me 4GB (2,95 Usable) I have checked every RAM module, and I have checked every slot, ran a Memtest which was OK according to Windows, tried the advanced boot in MSConfig but would only release a max of 8GB and
 when I set the 16GB manually it would automatically drop to 8GB, also my BIOS recognises all 16Gigs and they run in Dual Channel Mode any help on this is appreciated.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not worry, will assist you with the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get a clear picture of how much memory is available on the system and how much is being used, you can check the ‘task manager’. Refer to these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows key +X, select ‘task manager’.</li><li>In the task manager, click on the ‘performance’ tab and then click on the ‘Memory’ tab in the left pane.</li><li>Now, check the total physical memory installed and how much memory is being used and how much is available.</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can also refer the steps provided in the link below. (Applies to Windows&nbsp;8.1 also)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The usable memory may be less than the installed memory on Windows -based computers:</p>

            I had already updated my BIOS and windows recognises the full 16 GB but assigned 4,7 to hardware and 4 in it's cache, it only gives me about 8 GB free memory.

            <p>Hi Jeffrey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a memory allocation issue. As a workaround, I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows + letter R.</li><li>Type <strong>'msconfig' </strong>and hit OK.</li><li>&nbsp;Go to the <strong>Boot </strong>tab.</li><li>Ensure that the <strong>Maximum Memory option&nbsp;</strong>is checked.</li><li>Restart the computer when prompted.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

            Unfortunately this didn't help. I already tried this multiple times.<br />
<br />
Whenever I manually enter the full 16GiB RAM when applying Windows will automatically drop it back to 8GB, I can't change the value above 8GB or Windows will automatically lower it again.

            Actually I have, I used to run 8GB and Windows read all of it. However I reinstalled my Windows after switching from HDD to SDD, my RAM modules are all the same, 4x 4GB GEIL DragonRAM 1600MHz 9-9-9-11 all the chips on the RAM modules are from the same
 series, same line and all have the same specs.

<h3> mboolean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Touch - How do I disable cut and paste&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I touch something on my Windows 8 Surface Pro, the annoyance of the double circle (Cut and Paste) always interferes with touch.&nbsp; Sometimes making entire sites and applications unusable due to buttons and not to mention pull-down menus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did this feature get past user testing?&nbsp; Its on by default and should be shut off just as easily on the charms or somewhere.&nbsp; I mean we wanted cut and paste on the Windows Phone 7 and had to fight for that, but really, allow something like a press and
 hold for&nbsp;second to activate it would be much more user-friendly user-experience rather than an always on, never off.</p>
