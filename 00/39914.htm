<h2>            &#34;Media driver is missing&#34; error when doing clean install from Windows Vista 32-bit to Windows 8.1 64-bit</h2>
                    I have no idea what to do. I've used every resource available to me on Microsoft's website to see if my computer can run 8.1 and it says it can. My computer is 64-bit capable. Tech support has given me no help whatsoever.<br />
<br />
While trying to do a clean install of Windows 8.1 64-bit, I get this error message when I should be asked to enter my product key:<br />
<br />
"A media driver your computer needs is missing. This could be a DVD, USB, or Hard disk driver. If you have a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive with the driver on it, please insert it now."<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what driver it needs. I am installing with the retail disc.<br />
<br />

            I fixed it.<br />
<br />
It turns out that creating a bootable usb was the answer. Thanks for the link about the error; I noticed most of the problems seemed to stem from the DVD drive, so I figured using the USB would possibly work.

If your card is not on the list there is no driver and you will need a new sound card.

<p>I'm having the very same problem.</p>
<p>Method One didn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p>I don't know why you'd suggest Method 2. &nbsp;There is clearly nothing wrong with our sound drivers. &nbsp;The sounds are playing; Windows 10 is not accepting the instruction to implement the modified sound scheme.</p>
<p>Method 3 directs to a page that does not exist.</p>

            I am having the same issue. I have the star wars special edition HP and many of the notification sounds are not working any mail or notification sounds will work with the windows default but none of the star wars ones will work. I have done a full reinstall
 and tried all of the troubleshooting options I could find

            Nothing worked. I had to move the sounds folder from the Star Wars folder into media and change everything over manually and it was a real pain. I'm not really a whiz with computers and I was hoping something else would fix this!

            I am having almost similar issue. I converted my music to wav files set up sound scheme and placed it in media. MY SONGS either don't play or play at random and I have to disable the speakers no other way have I found to turn it off. It will stop itself
 when the whole song has played. I am ready just to go back to windows default, somebody must know something. Don't contact Windows because they will say you have made your own adjustments which basically means your fault and not going to help.

<p>I have done all the things suggested, to no avail.&nbsp; My problem is that when I click on "Sounds," the box comes up, but is only partially open, and I cannot change anything, or even search for other sound files to substitute for those assigned.&nbsp; My previous
 schemes are saved, but there is still one default sound I want to change, but cannot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't manipulate the window enough to allow me to even search for sound files.&nbsp; And, I can't do a print screen to save a screen shot for this request!&nbsp; I am baffled.</p>

            The hard part was gaining true ownership of my files.&nbsp; I did do pretty much what you suggest.&nbsp; Renamed existing files to fit the sound scheme, and deleted the original windows .wav files.&nbsp; It works, but I still lack control of the sounds from that old
 click here thing.

    <title>Arc Touch Mouse SE not seen by Surface after Windows 10 Creators - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayhirschi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Arc Touch Mouse SE not seen by Surface after Windows 10 Creators Edition Loaded</h2>
                    <p>I am in a pure Microsoft HW and SW eco system with purchased set from Microsoft HW and the Windows 10 creator edition download has blinded my Surface from seeing the Arc Touch SE mouse it has worked with for two years... All of my other PC's (not running
 Creators edition) can still see the mouse as can all of my Apple devices, so its not the mouse. My Surface Bluetooth pen works and Bluetooth headset works so its not the surface Bluetooth. I updated the Bluetooth driver and ARC Touch software per all of the
 threads I read... Poor show Microsoft when you break your own HW... pretty sure this setup in on employee desks at Microsoft and in the regression testing labs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for help from the broader community... any ideas folks?</p>

<p><span>I worked through the troubleshooting aids above and found no resolution. The time on system did allow me to conduct&nbsp;additional tests&nbsp;and I found that neither of the PC's that I updated to Windows 10 Creators Edition could see my Microsoft Arc Mouse
 SE or several other Bluetooth devices. Then I stumbled across an article indicating that Microsoft is the culprit here as they have "blocked" Broadcom Bluetooth chips&nbsp;from working with Windows 10 Creators Edition, I wonder if they did the customer service
 math and understood they were disabling their own hardware... Sheeesh! </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the end, I backed out the Windows 10 Creators Edition by going to Settings&gt;Recovery&gt;Go back to an earlier build... The problem was solved once I returned good old Windows 10 Home. Too bad, so sad...&nbsp;Windows 10 Creators Edition had some cool feature
 but (like Pinocchio) I got rid of my wires long ago and no Bluetooth was a deal breaker.</span></p>

                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Computer boots to diagnostics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;*I am running Windows 7 on a Dell Inspiron One. &nbsp;I was having a problem of freezing so I pressed F12 at startup and ran diagnostics. &nbsp;No problems found. &nbsp;I then chose the option of booting to utility partition. &nbsp;Now when I boot &nbsp;it goes directly to diagnostics
 after the dell logo. &nbsp;If I exit it goes to diagnostics again. &nbsp;I used my recovery disk to boot and ran startup repair. &nbsp;No problem reported. &nbsp;It still only boot to diagnostics. &nbsp;I ran the restore utility and it couldn't complete and gave error code 0X8000FFFF.
 &nbsp;I can't get to F8. &nbsp;I have restored bios to factory settings to no avail. &nbsp;I don't know what to try next. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure it must be frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand, every time you try to boot the computer, it boots to Dell diagnostics mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the similar issues, community members on different community forums, including Dell, have suggested to set BIOS to default.</p>
<p>Since you have already done it, you may contact Dell for further help.</p>

            It is custom built with an Intel board, DG965WH, no longer supported. I now recall I had some issues getting Win8 to operate correctly but that was all working fine even with a 64-bit OS. It was just the upgrade to 8.1 that seems to have killed RST for
 some reason.

            I've resolved the problem. During the initial install of Win8.1 there is a period where the screen goes completely black for close to 10 minutes. During my first installation I thought this was flawed so rebooted during that time. I did this a couple times
 and when I finally got up and running I had these issues.
<div><br />
<div>So I reloaded WIn8 and got that all back up to snuff. Then when I loaded 8.1 and let it run it's course I had no issues. It "appears" rebooting during that blackout period I viewed as a glitch may have been the culprit.</div>

            <p>I'm having this same issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can't get the UI program for RST to open.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>IAStorDataSvc is churning away at 15% of CPU.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Intel's Driver Update Utility sees every part of my computer as Unknown/Unsupported.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And when I look at the event log of the RAID controller in Device Manager, lo and behold, the last event was Oct 17th, the day before my upgrade to Win8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It shows the driver to be Ver. 12.0.1.1019, but there is a d/l on the Intel site for 12.8.0.1016.&nbsp; Even though the Update Driver function does not&nbsp;see&nbsp;the newer driver, should I do the update anyway?&nbsp;</p>

            I would suggest yes. Worst case is you can always uninstall it. I am running 12.8.0.1016 and it was working on 8.1 albeit I am currently back on 8 due to other issues. If the driver alone does not resolve the issue, one thing I ran again was the executable
 for the INTEL MATRIX STORAGE MANAGER. A file called IATA89ENU.exe.

            <p>Updating the driver resulted in a loss of the blue circle RST icon in the taskbar, but IAStorDataSvc is still churning away.</p>

<p>Dang it, I can't find IATA89ENU.exe&nbsp;anywhere on my system.</p>

            My apologies. I just reinstalled 8.1 and the way I got RST working again was not with the&nbsp;IATA89ENU.exe although I had executed that as well. What worked for me was executing the RST.exe from within the appropriate download here:&nbsp;<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?DwnldID=20868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?DwnldID=20868</a>
<div><br />
<div>Now I also discovered my virus software, Avast, was blocking a file IAStorIcon.exe from executing so I exempted that directory.</div>

Its not seeing your hard drive so check the settings in the first screen which is your BIOS.<br />
<br />
You may need to remove ALL power then reseat the hard drive cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
On screen 1 do you see load defaults? And on the lower left of that screen it shows how to maneuver the cursor, F1 is Help, and how to save and exit.<br />
<br />
Also you can find all this information for your specific model at Dell using the links I previously posted. Issue such as you are experiencing are hardware so not Windows.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Mixed&#34; Reality</h2>
                    <p>All the demos of Win10 Fall Creators and the various headsets keep showing what are most appropriately labelled "virtual reality" applications and headsets operating as "virtual reality" headsets.&nbsp; That is, there is no aspect of the "physical world" in the
 demo.&nbsp; A "mixed reality" headset would be more like the Hololens where virtual is overlaid on physical, with the recognition that the same concept can be achieved by the headset having cameras which the headset can use to mix a camera image of the physical
 world with the virtual world rendering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if these so-called "mixed reality" headsets will actually do "mixed" in which virtual is overlaid on physical?&nbsp; Can all models, is does a person have to be careful when shopping?&nbsp; Can anyone provide a reference to information about any of
 these headsets working in that fashion?</p>

    <title>Noisy USB line. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samzee 1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Noisy USB line.</h2>
                    
<p>All right. So the problem started when I made the switch from a wireless controller to wired. (Yes, this is a Microsoft controller). There's a constant high-pitched whine that comes through when I use my headset. I only hear it when I hear myself. Such as,
 when I record a voice message, for example. But everyone else hears it constantly, because the interference is enough that it passes through the noise gate. So, the little speaker icon always shows that I'm talking when I'm not.<br />
<br />
Now, I can assure you that this has nothing to do with my headset. The problem persists when I mute my mic, and even when my mic isn't connected. (If it's just the 2.5mm cable dangling from the controller.) I've scoured the internets, and haven't found a whole
 lot pertaining to this, but I have seen some say that it's just the noisy-*** USB line in the 360. I'm pretty much 100% certain this is the culprit. That it just picks up way too much digital &amp; analog interference, and that, said interference only manifests
 when you create a loop by way of using a wired controller. Another weird thing is that, sometimes (not always), this creates a digital "farting" sound in games. For example, when I reload in MW3. It's weird. Also, it's really only a problem in game chat. In
 party chat, the noise gate is aggressive enough to filter out the interference when I'm not talking.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about getting something like this. I really don't want to go back to a wireless controller. I feel like the input isn't quite as precise, besides, charging, and, reasons. I guess my question is, has anyone else had this problem?
 Could it just be a faulty controller, or, is there another way to get around this? If Microsoft just made it so that you could adjust the digital noise gate, I wouldn't have this problem.<br />
<br />

<p>The whine could very well be caused by local wireless interference, or even something as changing your battery brand for another. Sometimes consistent power draw is an issue, but that's unlikely.</p>

<p>The whine is very consistent. It never comes and goes, and I feel like it's more a product of the goings on inside the box. If I had to guess, I would think the fan might be the main cause.</p>

<p>Rereading your post, it could also very well be something known as "coil whine", and there's nothing you can do about it. It's just the way your controller is. If it's the controller and only the controller, then that's what it is. Controllers have no fans
 inside, if your console isn't making any noises when the controller is not plugged in, I can just assume that it's coil whine. Besides, fans make a grinding sound rather than a high pitched whine when they're failing.</p>

    <title>Want to use system restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithd32623523  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want to use system restore</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 64-bit pro. &nbsp;My computer's video card drivers are crashing for some reason while playing Fallout 4. &nbsp;This happened before and restoring to an earlier restore point fixed it. &nbsp;Windows 10 updated itself and now the entire restore menus
 are all changed. &nbsp;I just want to be able to restore to the restore points that I had windows create on a regular basis to one that works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to use System Restore it tells me that "System protection is turned off. &nbsp;To turn it back on so that you can use System Restore, configure system protection". &nbsp;I NEVER turned it off, I had it creating restore points on a regular basis. &nbsp;I assume
 that the Windows 10 stupid update took it upon itself to what turn off my system restore? &nbsp;I don't want to configure restore points or backup this broken state that my computer is currently in, I want to use the restore points that I had created before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to use "reset this PC" and have stupid Windows 10 change all my file preferences back to **** like Groove, Bing and all the Windows programs. &nbsp;It is so annoying to have to go back and manually change them to the way I set them all over again.</p>

            <p>By design, existing restore points are automatically deleted after major updates. You wouldn't want to restore a restore point made before a major update - that would almost certainly damage your operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the same reason, restore points are automatically deleted after <em>X</em> number of days. In Windows 7 that was 90 days; it's earlier in Windows 10 but I'm afraid I don't know how long
<em>X</em> is. You wouldn't want to restore a very old restore point</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore is widely misunderstood and often confused with backing up. Since Windows 10 includes both file backup and disk image backup - and since third-party software that does this is widely available (and superior to Windows' own tools, in my view)
 it's no surprise that System Restore is turned off by default. Wouldn't surprise me if it was removed altogether in a future upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of System Restore, you should learn about making disk images. Briefly, an image is an identical copy of your hard drive. If your computer gets messed up, just restore an image and you've gone back in time like nothing ever happened. With third-party
 imaging software you can schedule images to occur automatically, overnight, so you're never more than 24 hours from a working copy of your computer.</p>

            <p>No, you don't have to buy third-party software. You can use Windows' own backup and imaging utilities, just as you can use Windows' own media player, antivirus, PDF reader, web browser etc. if you want to. But often third-party software has better features
 and is easier to use. Windows can't be all things to all people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backing up is one of the most basic skills that a computer user has, regardless of what operating system they use. And computer journalists, bloggers, authors and teachers have been teaching people to backup since forever. Today's backup software makes backing
 up effortless. There's no excuse for not backing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That "feature that was working absolutely fine" was actually not working fine, which is why it's turned off by default in Windows 10. There are much better solutions today.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />Regarding your question:
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Try to add the Bluetooth device again.
<br />
<br />3. Try uninstall and reinstalling your Bluetooth drivers and look for updates first
<br />
<br />Also, I attach some link with more procedures in case the steps above didn't work:

            Hi Hugues.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />TROUBLESHOOT BLUETOOTH: 
<br />
<br />See Fixes here:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br /><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/823894/how-to-make-bluetooth-mouse-automatically-reconnect-to-my-microsoft-surface-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://superuser.com/questions/823894/how-to-ma...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br />Troubleshoot Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menu at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt;  
<br />
<br />TROUBLESHOOT HEADSET:
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page.  While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Your best option would be to either roll back to the previous Driver, download the newest driver from the Realtek website, or possibly the best option is to download the driver from the support page of the manufacturer of your system.
<br />
<br />Also, I provide the link below with the procedures to resolve the incident:

    <title>Using Tablet with Convertible Notebook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jkitsmiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Tablet with Convertible Notebook</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 notebook. &nbsp;I like that I can use the Active Stylus when in tablet mode to take notes using OneNote. &nbsp;So I purchased a USB pen tablet to be able to write in OneNote while I am docked and working at my desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it doesn't work with OneNote. &nbsp;It seems the driver for the tablet has to be able to put it in Tablet Mode to be recognized as a pen input device for OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to make an external pen tablet work with a 2-in-1 notebook that has it's own tablet mode?</p>

            This is a general question about Windows. &nbsp;Will Windows allow a pen tablet the ability to put a 2-in-1 notebook into Tablet Mode since the notebook itself can be put into Tablet Mode by flipping the lid. &nbsp;This is Windows 10.

    <title>Good things to know for your Surface Pro 2 - tips, accessories, backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elaland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Good things to know for your Surface Pro 2 - tips, accessories, backup and restore</h2>
                    <p>I am an engineer, and decided to convert from a Panasonic toughbook laptop to the Surface Pro 2.&nbsp; I wanted to carry a lighter load, and discover some of the ins and outs of tablets and Windows 8 in anticipation of supporting Windows 8 machines at our location
 in the future.&nbsp; In order to make the tablet a fully functional laptop equivalent for my needs I purchased some additional hardware: a keyboard cover, USB mouse, docking station, display port to vga cable adapter, USB to 9-pin serial cable adapter, and a 3.0
 USB four port hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've listed below some tips I found useful, and other things that I had to learn the hard way with a lot of internet searching.&nbsp; I did run into a problem where my SP2 would not boot reliably after a few weeks.&nbsp; It seemed to boot usually after 3 or 4 tries
 if I was connected to my docking station, but sometimes a half hour of reboots would not get it to come up if I was using it without the docking station.&nbsp; I finally had the unit exchanged which led to some of the items listed below regarding backup and restore.&nbsp;
 I can tell you that Acronis Backup and Recovery 11.5 will successfully make backups, but restoring the System volume it has an issue with due to their proprietary "Active Restore" feature which only works with MBR disks, not GPT volumes such as the SP2 uses.&nbsp;
 I still have an active case with Acronis, but in the meantime I was able to use the Powershell approach to successfully transfer everything from my old SP2 to the new one (even with an error message saying it failed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the following items are found useful for those who are looking for some answers in one place.&nbsp; A couple of them I've copied from help files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------<br />
Create a Recovery USB drive:<br />
<br />
Step 1: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Connect the power supply to Surface and plug into an electrical outlet.<br />
Step 2: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Insert your USB drive into the USB port on your Surface.<br />
Step 3: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.)<br />
Step 4: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the search box, enter recovery, and in the search results, tap or click Recovery, and then tap or click Create a recovery drive.<br />
Step 5: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the User Account Control dialog box, tap or click Yes.<br />
Step 6: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tap or click to select Copy the recovery partition from the PC to the recovery drive, and then, tap or click Next.<br />
Step 7: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tap or click the USB drive you want to use, and then tap or click Next.<br />
Step 8: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tap or click Create.<br />
<br />
The recovery image and necessary recovery tools will be copied to your USB drive. Your Surface must stay awake during the copy process, which will take 10 to 15 minutes.<br />
Step 9: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After the recovery tools are copied, do one of the following:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap or click Finish if you want to keep the recovery tools on your Surface.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap or click Delete the recovery partition if you want to remove the recovery tools from Surface and free up disk space. To confirm, tap or click Delete, and when removal is complete, tap or click Finish.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Important<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you choose to delete your recovery partition, you will need your USB recovery drive if you ever need to refresh or reset your Surface in the future.<br />
<br />
Step 10: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remove your USB drive from Surface and keep it in a safe place.<br />
<br />
It's best not to use the recovery drive to store other files or data.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Booting from a USB into the UEFI firmware menu:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold volume up button<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press and release the power button<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Surface logo appears release the volume up button<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
In UEFI firmware menu consider disabling the "Secure Boot" feature.&nbsp; It is designed to protect against rootkits, and the like but also prevents booting from USB sticks and I'm not sure about other potential issues.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
A red background on the "Windows" boot screen indicates the boot keys are missing.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Surface powered off, press and held the Volume Up button.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power the Surface on, holding the Volume Up button pressed the entire time.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the BIOS screen choose “Install Default Secure Boot Keys” and selected “Yes” to cause the Surface to load the default secure variables.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure the “Secure Boot” option is enabled, exit setup, choosing “Yes” to save the configuration changes.<br />
<br />
NOTE: In order to boot from a USB drive Secure Boot MUST be DISABLED.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Boot from a USB<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold volume down button<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press and release the power button<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Surface logo appears release the volume down button<br />
&nbsp; NOTE: If using a USB hub to access external devices along with the boot USB drive ensure that the boot USB drive is in the 1st port of the USB hub or it may not be recognized.&nbsp; I used the following:<br />
&nbsp; Port 1 - USB boot drive<br />
&nbsp; Port 2 - USB drive containing backup to recover from<br />
&nbsp; Port 3 - USB keyboard<br />
&nbsp; Port 4 - USB mouse<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Backup and Restore using windows Powershell.<br />
BACKUP:<br />
&nbsp; Search for "Windows Powershell" on Metro, right click result and "Run as administrator"<br />
&nbsp; Enter the following command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WbAdmin start backup -backupTarget:D: -inlcude:C: -allCritical -quiet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: :D: reference is the hard drive letter for the USB drive used to store the backup<br />
RESTORE:<br />
&nbsp; 1. Boot from Microsoft Recovery USB Flash (hopefully created after receipt of unit)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or using machine's recovery partition: PC Settings, General, Advanced Startup, Restart Now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: Secure boot must be disabled via the UEFI firmware - See "Red background" text above.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 2. AFter booting from from Recovery USB or the Recovery Partition Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubleshoot, Advanced Options, System Image Recovery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If default backup file is correct use it, else select correct location of backup file<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 3. Rather than getting a "restore complete" type of message I got an error message box stating "the system image restore failed", and "Error details: The parameter is incorrect (0x80070057).<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 4. Ignore the error message, and reboot the tablet; the restore worked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Two button shutdown/startup process:<br />
&nbsp; Power Down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold power button in for 10 secs (forces shutdown instead of sleep)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold volumue Up button and power button at same time for 15 seconds, and then release both<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait 10 seconds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press and release the power up button to turn it on.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Booting into Safe Mode:<br />
&nbsp; The F8 key to get into safe mode in prior Windows versions is disabled in version 8/8.1.<br />
&nbsp; The most direct way to enter Safe Mode assuming your Surface Pro 2 is active and can boot is as follows:<br />
&nbsp; 1. Pull up the Charms menu (swiping from right or use "Windows key + C")<br />
&nbsp; 2. Select the following: Settings, Change PC Settings, Update and Recovery, Recovery, Under "Advanced Settings" select the Reboot button.<br />
&nbsp; 3. Wait - screen may go blank for a little; be patient.<br />
&nbsp; 4. Select Troubleshoot, Startup Settings, Restart<br />
&nbsp; 5. Press a number key corresponding to the type of Safe Mode you wish to boot into.<br />
<br />
I used Safe Mode to remove a Trojan virus that my antvirus software detected, but couldn't remove.&nbsp; My antivirus includes a command line executable version and fortuntely by entering Safe Mode and running the antivirus executable I was able to remove that particular
 trojan.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Important shortcuts:<br />
&nbsp; Windows Key + X: Power User Menu<br />
&nbsp; Windows Key + P: Monitor allocation</p>
<p>&nbsp; Windows Button on Tablet Border + Volume Down button: Print Screen (Image saved in Pictures\Screenshots)<br />
&nbsp; Windows Key + C: Charms menu<br />
<br />
Soft keyboard with function keys:<br />
&nbsp; START/Settings/Change PC Settings/PC &amp; Devices/Typing/Add standard keyboard layout<br />
<br />
Keep icons from rearranging due to scaling between local and external monitor:<br />
&nbsp; Control Panel/Appearance &amp; Personalization/Display/: checkbox for "Let me choose one scaling level for all displays"<br />
<br />
Command Prompt<br />
&nbsp; Font size too small and hard to see on native screen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change font size to 12x16 in properties for the command prompt.<br />
&nbsp; Admin command prompt full screen (native only - not VMware)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run C:\WMICS<br />
<br />
Avoid Windows startup issues<br />
&nbsp; Control Panel/Hardward and Sound/Power Options/System Settings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on "change Settings that are currently not available"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncheck "turn on fast startup (recommended)"<br />
Note: I also changed power button settings to "shut down" instead of default "Sleep"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help alleviate the periodic loss of WIFI connection:</p>
<p>Uncheck the option to turn off the power to the network adapter to save power.&nbsp; The setting is found from Device Manager - Network Adapter - Power Management.</p>
<p>Also -</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 may have drivers failing to execute the command that wakes your WIFI receiver from selective suspension thereby causing limited connectivity issues.&nbsp; Disabling it should therefore provide a more stable connection.&nbsp; You can get to it by the following
 steps:</p>
<p>1. Go to "Control Panel"</p>
<p>2. Select "Hardware and Sound"</p>
<p>3. Select "Power Options"</p>
<p>On your selected power plans, select "Change Plan Settings"</p>
<p>Select "Advanced Power Settings"</p>
<p>Expand "USB settings"</p>
<p>Expand "USB selective suspend setting"</p>
<p>Disable selective suspend</p>

            <p>ETP2,</p>
<p>I found this stuff with a lot of internet searching plus using my own judgement as far as what was useful, and what wasn't.&nbsp; The avoiding Windows startup issues was one such case.&nbsp; I came across the details in some other help forum, and knew from personal
 experience when "Sleep" mode first came into existence that it could cause problems on bootup.&nbsp; It's a problem when the internal flag that tells the system to restore from sleep versus boot up get mixed up.&nbsp; The laptop solutions were to pull the battery, wait,
 then reinstall the battery which tells me the "flag" is stored in RAM memory.&nbsp; Anyway, that is how/why I included that note in my list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're last post said "This stops at 90% in 8.1".&nbsp; What were you referring to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another topic I've found an additional setting that I will add into my post which I think helps alleviate periodic loss of the WIFI connection.&nbsp; At least it seemed to help what I was experiencing.</p>

            Hi Matthew, what is the make and model of your laptop and your mouse? I recommend that you refer to the support article on how to perform a clean boot in Windows and check your issue
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />Refer to the same article and read Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
<br />Disclaimer Clean Boot:
<br />A “clean boot” starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program.
<br />Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in a clean boot environment, however that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after you have finished your troubleshooting.

<h2>            How to get Windows Journal back &#63;</h2>
                    I recently purchased a laptop. It was pre-loaded with Vista Home Premium, and numerous other goodies including a program called Windows Journal.
<br />
<br />
I have even more recently upgraded to Win 7 Home Premium. While still in Vista, my copy of Windows Journal (under Program Files) mysteriously disappeared. I thought the upgrade would restore this, but it didn't.
<br />
<br />
I don't know why it disappeared in the first place, but I was wondering if there is a way for me to get it back ?

<h3> daniellothringer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 64-bit won&#39;t install</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new SSD and am trying to install Windows 10 to it, from a USB I purchased directly from the Microsoft store today.&nbsp; But when I initiate the install process, I'm given an&nbsp;0xc0000098 error, which tells me that I'm missing a CI.dll
 file, preventing the install from continuing.&nbsp; I'm not sure how this could be, since the HD is fresh out of the box.&nbsp; Some additional info: I have an Intel i3-4130 CPU @ 3.40 GHz, with 8 gigs of RAM.&nbsp; I had no problems running Windows 10 on my last SSD HD,
 until a truly disastrous Windows 10 update led to corrupted files and rolling freezes, necessitating the new drive in the process.&nbsp; Needless to say, I am confused and frustrated and just want a working desktop, and would welcome any advice anyone might have.&nbsp;
 Thanks!
