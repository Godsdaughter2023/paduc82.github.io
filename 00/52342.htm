<h2>            Mac to PC Migration</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have an iMac which stores all my documents/media/photos etc, as well as backing up to Backblaze and Time Machine. &nbsp;The iMac is a good few years old now and I'm contemplating moving back to Windows permanently for a number of reasons (I've just
 bought an Alienware laptop for about 1/2 the price of a not quite as spec'd macbook pro been the main reason!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I start the migration though I was hoping to get some advice from people that may have done this before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Documents - Simple enough, I'll just install OneDrive for Mac and move all my docs from icloud to OneDrive (I have an Office365 subscription and 1TB of cloud storage).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Videos - Guess I'll use iTunes for syncing my iPhone and AppleTV although I've been told iTunes for Windows is a tad clunky? I'd like to use the native app but more on this shortly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Music - Either use iTunes or copy music from iTunes library to OneDrive for access via Groove for iPhone. &nbsp;Guess I'll need to keep them in iTunes in case I need to sync to my iDevices so possibly store in OneDrive and reference them from iTunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My biggest issue is my photo collection. &nbsp;This is currently in Photos so hidden in packages. &nbsp;I've spend quite a bit of time create albums by year/month within photos as I'm not keen on the 'moments' split it does automatically. &nbsp;My dilemma is I'm not sure
 how to get the photos out in with the directory structure reflecting the Album/Month structure so I can get them in OneDrive. &nbsp;I think I can export them within the app itself but not sure if it exports originals and in what structure, I could possibly install
 iCloud for Windows which I believe will download the photos but my Windows laptop SSD does not have the capacity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experience with this kind of migration or thoughts on App comparisons (Mac Photos vs Windows Photos app, Groove vs Music on iOS, using OneDrive on iOS instead of the Photos App etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to transfer your data from mac computer to Windows, as you are switching to Windows from Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most documents and media types are supported on both Mac and PC platforms as long as you have an application installed&nbsp;that supports the file type. Some of the most common file types that you might want to migrate are&nbsp;Microsoft Office files, Music, Movies,
 Pictures, e-mail and other data files. These files can easily be migrated using the methods described in the article mentioned below.</p>

<h2>            Window 7 Dell N7110  error 1721 after windows update about 2 weeks ago</h2>
                    <p>After the Windows update which happend about two weeks ago, I had problems with my antivirus, and internet connection, and Widi software.&nbsp; I was able to fix the problem with internet, and virus scan, but still can not connect push to tv through widi,&nbsp; software
 would just hang, and quick flash of error, which I could not see.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Reinstalled video driver, and intel pro software first, and then tried to reinstall Widi software, but could not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to uninstall, and reinstall but could not - have used the windows fix it to remove the widi program, but still will not install.&nbsp; I am getting error 1721 saying there is a problem with the windows installer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to install other software no problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I run sfc, it shows errors that can not be fixed, which are related to Windows Media Center, and Microsoft-Windows-Video-Capture-Filters - Not sure that this is related.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to re-register from the command line, but did not help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marilyn suggested installing from a command line, but did not include any info on the command to use to do this?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Hello <span>Lenniego,</span></p>
<p>You might also try the following:<br />
<strong>Run an elevated command prompt with Run as Administrator option to start the installation</strong></p>
<p>This method will probably allow most failed .msi installer to install/uninstall probably. Simply open an elevated command prompt with<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> setting, and then execute the .msi executable.</p>
<p>Open a command prompt right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as Administrator". This should help most errors for Windows Installer.</p>
<p>Please reply back with an update for us.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>For the connection problems with McAfee, make sure your copy is registered, so you cn reinstall McAfee. I have seen a member recently uninstall McAfee, restart their computer and they could connect. They then reinstalled McAfee and everything was fine. I
 don't think they needed to use the <a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Push2TV had two versions. There was a Push2TV(PT 1000) and Push2TV(PTV2000)</p>
<p>The Push2TV(1000) had problems connecting.</p>

<h2>            CD&#47;DVD Drive not shown in Device Manager, System Information or My Computer</h2>
                    My Cd/DVD ROM Drive is not showing in explorer, device manager, or even system information. I use ashampoo for burning and even it doesn't recognize the drive..<br />
<br />
I use Vista Business 32, on a Compaq V3018TU laptop... I hav tried the registry fixes, but there were no UpperFilter and LowerFilter strings there.. I even tried to make them myself and then deleting them. but it didn't work. Even my bios (phoenix) doesn't
 hav any secton which says anything about the drive.<br />
<br />
I last used it yesterday morning itself. I put a DVD in the drive and used it. Then I removed the DVD from there and closed the door. On doing this, the system restarted on its own. I know its a problem itself but this has happened once or twice before so i
 didn't really care.<br />
Then I checked up bout 4-5 hrs later. My DVD drive didn't open up on pressing the button, so I used the pin hole. And put in the DVD. I checked my computer and there was no drive there... Then i restarted. Normally the light on the drive blinks&nbsp; when the computer
 starts, this time it didn't. So I guess even the BIOS didn't recognize it.<br />
I've using the drive for over a two years now. So I don't think it's gone bad.<br />

            Hi Rami, Thanks for the suggestion. I realized that too. I'm already planning to open it up once I get done with my work. And I've checked up the prices of a new drive.<br />
<br />
And 'yes' it is pretty much a hardware problem, because even the light doesn't blink when the laptop is powered on, that means the motherboard isn't even supplying power to the drive (just as you said), or the drive has failed :D<br />
<br />
Anyways, thanks for the help. All u guys were very helpful and I hope the ideas given above will help other guys too...<br />
<br />
And I'm marking yer post as the answer, thanks :) Take Care.<br />

<p>Phoenikxz, I&nbsp;can safely&nbsp;say that you are having a hardware issue. If you BIOS is not recognizing the drive, then this is before windows is ever involved. You even mention that the light does not even turn on anymore on the drive, this could mean that the
 drive is not getting power from the motherboard or that the drive itself has failed. Contacting the manufacturer will be the best step from here.</p>

            No, since the account was banned the only accounts used were mine and different friend’s account. There’ve been no attempts to access the banned account at all.

            Hello if you tried to log into a permabanned account on the console that is probably why this occurred. If this was done by accident you can always go to enforcement.xbox.com to appeal your case and see if they will accept your request. Good luck!

<p>Good luck whatever happens. I've heard of perma banned accounts being reinstated, but not banned consoles.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure that even if you tried logging in with the perma banned account that would even affect anything much less the console. They'd be able to go around signing in to different friends consoles and getting them all banned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Does your Xbox One indicate when the console ban ends? Where a console ban on Xbox 360 was permanent and irreversible, the same is not necessarily true with Xbox One. Temporary console bans can occur, and are used to protect Xbox Live from significant
 abuse that may be coming from that console, usually in the form of repeated harassment from accounts that use that console.

            Console bans don't just happen. There is a build up, Unfortunately whatever decision was made can't be undone. You can't even dispute a console ban. You may want to have your friend replace the Xbox with a new one if he's the one that did in fact do this.
 The Xbox is linked to your profile &nbsp;I would assume. So the console ban would most likely be on your end unless you let this person designate the console as their home xbox. Then technically it's there console now. Which is permanently banned.&nbsp;

<h3> diannewenham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email PDF attachments not showing up on my Windows 10 Mail platform&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I am&nbsp;using Windows 10 Mail as the platform to manage the email service I get from a local provider.&nbsp; No problem receiving email attachments, including PDF files, until today.&nbsp; It rejected the pdf attachments that came in a email.&nbsp; I got the email, just
 not the attachments &amp; no indication that they had been rejected...they just didn't show up.&nbsp; When I check my email using my android tablet, no problem the email &amp; it's attachments are there.&nbsp; Ideas as to why this is happening.&nbsp; I haven't changed my security
 program (Norton) nor any of the settings.&nbsp; Thanks

</p><p>I can totally repro with Windows 10 mail/IMAP/SMTP.</p>
<p>If I use MailEnable on the same account or Thunderbird PDF attachments are visible. I see the internet has been complaining about this bug for ages and know at least one other person with exactly the same issue.</p>

<p>I'm only chiming in to confirm a client of mine has this same issue and has always been on the latest builds, including now 1803.&nbsp; Still no PDFs come through via email.&nbsp; The Mail app SUCKS and has always SUCKED.&nbsp; It should go away like Windows Phones.&nbsp; I
 usually don't even bother reporting anything to a Microsoft site because what is the point.&nbsp; They almost NEVER do anything about our complaints.&nbsp; They live in a bubble and are lost in their own thoughts and ideas.</p>

<h2>            Brand new Surface Pro problems</h2>
                    I just bought a Surface Pro, and initially the set up seemed to go fine. The system automatically tried to update to the latest version of Windows 10, but the update has been unsuccessful after several tries. I am connected to wi-fi, but the system will
 not update and I am stuck! I also cannot get on-line, even though when I check my settings it shows that I am connected to the internet. HELP!! Is it possible I got a "lemon"? Do I need to return this Surface Pro to the place of purchase?

            Sorry for the initial bad experience. We see this every so often (and I don't know what causes this to happen). 
<br />
<br />You have two choices - return to place of purchase and get a full refund - and then repurchase - do NOT exchange online with Microsoft as they will exchange for a used refurb. 
<br />
<br />Or you can download a recovery image and start fresh. If you do this, do NOT connect to WiFi/select a wifi network during setup so that you avoid getting updates during initial setup. Wait until setup is complete and you are at the desktop, then you can go to Settings, Updates and check for updates. Here are the instructions to do this clean install:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacereco...</a>   (with a different computer since yours is not working properly)  and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-
<br />
<br />To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:
<br />Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).
<br />Step 2: 	Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.
<br />Step 3:	Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.
<br />Step 4: 	When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.
<br />Step 5:	When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.
<br />Step 6: 	Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.
<br />	If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.
<br />Step 7: 	Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.
<br />Step 8:	Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.
<br />Step 9: 	Choose Just remove my files.
<br />Step 10:	Select Reset.
<br />	Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).
<br />
<br />Again, sorry for the trouble. Hope this helps. If it was of assistance, please DO mark as Answer.

    <title>Reinstall windows 7 Home Basic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prams12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstall windows 7 Home Basic</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a lenovo laptop with original windows 7 home basic. From last few months I have been using ubuntu and now I again I want to switch to my previous original windows. But unfortunately lenovo didn't give any recovery disk instead a one key recovery
 software and a recovery partition. But the one key software is not working probably because I formatted the whole hard disk (except the recovery partition). I have genuine windows label having product key pasted at the back of my laptop. Please tell me options
 to reinstall my previous windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Tools you will need for this task:</p>

 into a “universal disc” that will prompt the user to select an edition during setup. It’s a free download
<strong><a href="http://code.kliu.org/misc/winisoutils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">here</span></a></strong>
</li><li><strong>Genuine Retail Windows 7&nbsp;64 bit Installation DVD – </strong>this will be used to reinstall Windows 7 Starter 32 bit, any retail edition of Windows 7 32 bit will do, this includes Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate, doesn’t matter if its upgrade
 or full version. You cannot use a 64 bit DVD because there is no 64 bit version of Windows 7 Starter. You will need to create an image of the disc, please refer to our Notebooks.com tutorial about how to create a digital backup of your software
<strong>here</strong> </li></ul>
<p>After you have created the image of the Windows 7&nbsp;64 bit DVD, we will edit the image and remove the ei.cfg file so we can reveal all editions of Windows 7 during the installation and select Windows 7 Home Basic. Lets take a look at doing it step by step.

<p>After downloading the eicfg removal utility, you need to extract it, since its in a .zip file. Just right click it and click Extract All.

<p>Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment, the only difference this time is, you will be given a choice to select the edition of Windows 7 you want to reinstall.

            <p><span>Hi Sarah,</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To stop the emails of conversation history from entering your Outlook client. Based on my test using Office 365 cloud-based account, &nbsp;you can open Skype for business desktop client&gt;
<strong>Options&gt; Tools &gt;Options&gt;Personal&gt;Exchange and Outlook integration</strong>, then untick
<strong>Save call logs in my email Conversation History folder</strong>.</span></p>
<p>If the methods above doesn't work, could you please peovide with the following informations for futher troubleshooting?</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you using Office 365 cloud-based account or your organization have on-premise server, such as Exchange server or Skype for Business server?</span></li><li><span>The version of your Skype for Business client and Office client.</span></li></ol>
You can check the version of Skype for Business client, you can open the Skype for Business client&gt; Settings&gt;Help&gt;About Skype for Business. See the screenshot below:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6916d07-1d14-4fb5-9536-d11388efa6c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6916d07-1d14-4fb5-9536-d11388efa6c8" /></a><br />
<p><span>To check the version of Office suite, you can open any of the application, for example, Outlook, go to
<strong>File&gt;Office Account</strong>, see the screensgot below:</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3630952-0e3b-4c51-bacf-7863ceabb90f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3630952-0e3b-4c51-bacf-7863ceabb90f" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>Besides, as a workaround, I</span></span>&nbsp;suggest you create an inbox rule on your Outlook to look for the subject line contains "Missed Calls" and delete them so they will not delivered to the Inbox of Outlook.</p>
<p>You can create inbox rules in Outlook desktop client or Outlook Web App.</p>
<p>In Outlook Web App, please refer to this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Inbox-rules-in-Outlook-edea3d17-00c9-434b-b9b7-26ee8d9f5622?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Inbox rules in Outlook</a>.</p>
<p>In Outlook desktop client, please refer to this article:<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-C24F5DEA-9465-4DF4-AD17-A50704D66C59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Manage email messages by using rules</a>.</p>

<h2>            Windows cannot find 3ds Max</h2>
                    Hi all :-)<br />
<br />
<p>I have the Student edition of max 2012 and whenever I try opening it I get the error message:</p>
<p>“Windows cannot find ‘C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2012\3dsmax.exe’. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.”</p>
<p>I tried going to program files and opening Max from there and nothing, I tried fixing the Max installation, reinstalled it twice, still nothing..</p>
<p>No idea what to do… I recently had a large clearout of my computer (Max worked fine before this) and I had stopped the FLEXnet service, I restarted it and set it to automatic but still nothing :-/</p>
<p>I’ve searched around all over online but can’t seem to find anyone with the same problem…</p>
<br />
I've tried deleting everything and all of the registry entries and common files and appdata for max and then reinstalling...<br />
Ive done 4 reinstalls upto this point and still nothing<br />
<br />
Really dont know what to do, I've also posted this on the Autodesk AREA forums... Not sure if its a windows problem or a problem with Max<br />
<br />
Also if I try to open up a saved .max file in windows explorer I get the same error but with that file name cannot be found instead of 3dsmax.exe cannot be found.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi - I see no response has been forthcoming and to be honest I am not totally sure, but a couple of things you should consider...</p>
<p>1) Is the slideshow 'loop' setting checked as well as 'shuffle'? (right click while slideshow is playing to see options)</p>
<p>2) It may be that the volume of files is overwhelming it...try selecting half the folders and see what happens.</p>
<p>Failing that it might be worth trying a 'Windows Essentials' repair...let me know if you need assistance with this.</p>
<p>Cheers - Ric.&nbsp;</p>

</strong><strong>Remove ALL power and reseat all the cards, memory, and cables (both ends when<br />
possible)</strong> - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Those are for a PC and about all<br />
that can be done for a laptop is reseat the memory and clear the vents. Make sure the BIOS,<br />
low level chipset drivers, and major device drivers are all up to date by check manually at the<br />
makers' sites.<br />
<br />
Many Bluescreens are caused by&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device<br />
drivers which are not the most current even though the computer is new. Check manually
<br />
for updates using the methods for updates as&nbsp;indicated in the troubleshooter linked above<br />
and/or the methods below (which are the same).<br />
<strong><br />
</strong><br />
<strong>BCCode: 1E&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001E <br />
<br />
Bug Check 0x1E: KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED<br />
<br />
</strong>The KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check has a value of 0x0000001E. This indicates that a kernel-mode program generated an exception which the error handler did not catch.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> <br />
<br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p>KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED Parameters </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>1</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The exception code that was not handled</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<p>2</p>
</td>

<p>The address at which the exception occurred</p>

</td>

<p>Parameter 1 of the exception</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
This is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT
<p>An unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT
<p>A breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.
</p>
</li><li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
<p>A memory access violation occurred. (Parameter 4 of the bug check is the address that the driver attempted to access.)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the ntstatus.h file located in the inc directory of the Windows Driver Kit.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not equipped to debug this problem</strong>, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video
 adapters. Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
<p><strong><br />
If you plan to debug this problem</strong>, you may find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should pinpoint the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p><br />
If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, this indicates that a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the
<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the
<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p><br />
If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame will supply additional information.</p>
<p><br />
If the specific cause of the exception is unknown, the following should be considered:</p>
<p><strong><br />
Hardware incompatibility. </strong>First, make sure that any new hardware installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about compatibility with Windows&nbsp;7 at the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Faulty device driver or system service. </strong>In addition, a faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
<p><br />
If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file
 system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.
</p>
<p><br />
If the problem is associated with Win32k.sys, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, the service can be removed by starting the system using the Recovery Console and deleting the offending system
 service file.</p>
<p><br />
Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve the error. You should also run hardware diagnostics, especially
 the memory scanner, supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</p>
<p><br />
The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is a system BIOS incompatibility. BIOS problems can be resolved by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

<strong>To get a stack trace if the normal stack tracing procedures fail </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff551943(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>kb (Display Stack Backtrace)</strong></a> command to display parameters in the stack trace. Look for the call to
<strong>NT!PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread</strong>. (If this function is not listed, see the note below.)</p>
</li><li>The first parameter to <strong>NT!PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread</strong> is a pointer to a structure, which contains pointers to an
<strong>except</strong> statement:
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Copy </div>
<div>
<div>typedef struct _EXCEPTION_POINTERS { PEXCEPTION_RECORD ExceptionRecord; PCONTEXT ContextRecord; } EXCEPTION_POINTERS, *PEXCEPTION_POINTERS; ULONG PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread( IN PEXCEPTION_POINTERS ExceptionPointers )
<p>Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff542790(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>dd (Display Memory)</strong></a> command on that address to display the necessary data.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The first retrieved value is an exception record and the second is a context record. Use the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff563043(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.exr (Display Exception Record)</strong></a> command and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff562301(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.cxr (Display Context Record)</strong></a> command with these two values as their arguments, respectively.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After the <strong>.cxr</strong> command executes, use the <strong>kb</strong> command to display a stack trace that is based on the context record information. This stack trace indicates the calling stack where the unhandled exception occurred.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This procedure assumes that you can locate <strong>NT!PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread</strong>. However, in some cases (such as an access violation crash) you will not be able to do this. In that case, look for
<strong>ntoskrnl!KiDispatchException</strong>. The third parameter passed to this function is a trap frame address. Use the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff565491(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.trap (Display Trap Frame)</strong></a> command with this address to set the Register Context to the proper value. You can then perform stack traces and issue other commands.

==========================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>You could try using the backup in &gt;Settings &gt;Update and security &gt;Backup.</p>
<p>For the backup (Windows 7) when you set it up, after you select backup drive and click Next, you get a window asking 'what do you want to back up?', select 'let me choose', click Next and you'll get a window listing drives. Make sure the dvd drive is not
 checked.</p>
<p>By the way (@Bulldog) I've used Backup and Restore (Windows 7) to create a system image and actually restored the system from an image 2-3 times now. So it still works but has been deprecated and may disappear in future.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I didn't say it doesn't work. It's only supported for restoring backups made in Windows 7 to Windows 10. It's not supported for making backups on Windows 10. You can use it to make backups if you like - the code is still there - but in that case you're on
 your own. If it works, great, but if it doesn't work there are no solutions from Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 product key during usb install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zorgaem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 product key during usb install</h2>
                    so, i just did a successful upgrade from windows 7 home premium 32-bit to windows 10 home 32-bit. As my desktop is 64-bit, I tried doing a clean install from a flash drive with the 64-bit windows 10 and it asks me for a product key. I tried my windows
 7 product key and that does not work. Any ideas on how I could fix this problem?

<p><span>We have a new Panasonic flat-screen TV, and I'm connecting all our various gadgets and consoles to it. The 360 had been connected to our old tv's component inputs via the Xbox 360 Component HD AV Cable. However, when I try to use that cable to connect
 to the new TV, the screen looks like this:</span></p>

<p><span><span>The correct source is selected on the TV. If I connect via HDMI and choose that as the source, it looks great. However, I need to use the component cable if possible because of the video capture device I use with the 360.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Any ideas? Is this component cable with the 360 incompatible with newer TVs?</span><br />

            It sounds like you are running Task Manager in tiny/small footprint mode.<br />
<br />
If you double click the empty space around the border of the Task Manager display it will switch back to regular mode and then you should see the tabs you are used to seeing.<br />

    <title>My Google Chrome Proxy Server is Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cincyboy07  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Google Chrome Proxy Server is Not Working</h2>
                    I've recently been doing some research on my IP address and my proxy server after I found out that someone had been using my IP address for illegal things.&nbsp;
<div>I have Google Chrome and Microsoft 7. When my proxy server is enabled the <b>
HTTP ERROR 401 UNAUTHORIZED</b> pops up when I try to open Google Chrome. A pop up then appears that says
<b>"Authentication Required, Server http://www.google.com:80, Server Says NETGEARWNR1000V.3"</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The only way I can access the internet in anyway is if I go to <b>Settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Network &gt; Change Proxy Settings &gt;</b> and then disable my proxy server.&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is causing me and my wife continued stress because we use this computer for educational purposes and we are one step away from our internet connection being completely taken away if we do not figure out how to fix this. From what I understand I need
 to figure out how to get my computer to recognize my proxy server and/or IP address.</div>
<div>If anyone has any advice it would be GREATLY appreciated!</div>

    <title>Terrible WINDOWS 10 AUDIO drivers, audio input problems. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> outkast312  say:</h3>
<h2>            Terrible WINDOWS 10 AUDIO drivers, audio input problems.</h2>
                    <p>So I upgraded to windows 10. regret it. I knew I would. I fell for it. windows 7 had NO problems. Now I am stuck with 10. can uninstall it. even the 30 day thing doesnt work for me. i tried to do the 30 day go back thing and it told me i must first remove
 the account i created with windows 10 before i can go back. and I am like ****, i never created another account. And I went to accounts and there are no other accounts but mines.... so anyway. &nbsp; to the now present problem... &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I use ham radio with my laptop to I have line out and line in. they are what I use to connect my radio. I also had been using (win 7) a cheap USB audio card. I used the usb audio card with the radio and that way I could still listen to sound on my laptop
 with out it going out over the radio. so basiclly i had two outputs and two inputs. well 3 inputs if you count the built in mic.. &nbsp; btw i have a dell n1010</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I know about the IDT thing and removed that after upgrading as it was causing major problems with the desktop and taskbar restting. &nbsp;so now I have the HI DEF AUDIO DRIVER that windows 10 update for me. WHICH is terrible. &nbsp;when i try to use just the line
 in to listen to audio with my radio, into my ham radio program it mixes both the line in WITH the built in mic. so i get noise from the internal mic, mixed with the line in jack. I can not separate them. and before in my sound settings menu, it used to have
 a INTERNAL mic option and a LINE in option. and now it only has a microphone option which like i said ends up being a mix of the line in jack and the internal mic which is up by the web cam. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and one other problem. I used to be able to split the audio out between the laptops line out and the usb line out. so i could set up my ham radio soft ware to out put on the USB line out jack which i would connect to my radio, and then i would use the laptop
 sound for web brosing and such. but now with windows 10, i can not split the sound. its one or the other. my ham radio software has a configuration menu to select which output to use. but no matter what i set in the program it uses what ever is set in the
