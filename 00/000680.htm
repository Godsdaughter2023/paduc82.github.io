<h2>            Intelligent Services - No options in Options General</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have checked everywhere i can but I cannot find anything relating to this so here goes;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1 enterprise 64 bit on a Surface Pro 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 365 (work account) running Office 365 Pro Plus Version 1705 build 8201.2025 (Click to Run)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no option under file options general for intelligent services. there is no design ideas under the design tab. When I start a new presentation if I choose start an outline I get the quickstarter pop up and I can enable intelligent services - quickstarter
 works fine. However if I close that and repeat again it asks if I want to turn on intelligent services (so it seems it doesnt remember I said yes).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case under these conditions I still dont see design ideas - how do I enable this?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />
Ben</p>

<p>Hi there&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for this. In the end the solution was rolling back to a deferred build although the means of doing it was via the registry - updates were turned off so I turned them on and it updated to an older build (1701 7755.2092 and everything including powerpoint
 designer is there and working)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this - just changed the updatechannel from business to Current and hopefully all will still work after that&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers - PROBLEM SOLVED</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t auto-forward or redirect email from O365 to Yammer</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've created a rule on a shared mailbox to automatically redirect or forward particular emails onto a Yammer group. For some reason the rule is being processed (i've added myself in) but is not delivered to Yammer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The shared mailbox is a member of the Yammer group. I can manually forward email but i can't do it via a server-based rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Somehow i don't think it's an Exchange issue as i know the email is getting to Yammer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested this by using an incorrect Yammer group and Yammer responds back that there is no such group, i change the rule back to the correct group and the email disappears into the abyss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tested that the rule itself works by adding myself as a recipient. I get the same mail that is sent to Yammer but for what ever reason it's being dropped\ignored by Yammer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can i ask how you actually tested? Was it via a mailbox rule? Did you run the rule manually against your email or send an incoming email and let the server process it. I ask that because the former works and the later doesn't.</p>

<h2>            Access SUM function not calculating correctly</h2>
                    Working with the SQL query interface in Access and the SUM function is not calculating correctly. The table I am working with has an AMT column with values in it that are limited to no more than 2 decimal places. Data was imported to this table from Excel,
 where the total of the column was confirmed to be 4,845,474.96, however when&nbsp;using SUM(AMT) the result returned is 4,845,474.96000043. Very nearly right, and yet impossibly wrong. Had a similar SUM function go wrong where .00000001 or so was lost when doing
 a sum. The raw data contains absolutely no data beyond the second decimal, so having anything beyond that is impossible, yet somehow Access is creating this extra data.&nbsp;Where did these extra decimal places come from?

<p>Access uses binary&nbsp;when doing math and all other kinds of numbers&nbsp;except Integer can give such errors.</p>

    <title>Product key constantly required - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macfan2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Product key constantly required</h2>
                    I recently purchased Office for Mac 2011 via Apple Store and after every start up, or sometimes a day later, it keeps asking me to re-enter my Product Key. &nbsp;Computer is a new iMac, late 2013 model, running 10.8.5. No previous versions of Office were ever
 installed. &nbsp; I re-enter the Product Key and the software will work ok for a day or maybe only until the next start up. Then it will ask me to re-eneter the Product key again. The computer is on a home wifi network and has time machine running and a super drive
 connected. Nothing changes on the computers configuration. Can someone provide help as this is a major inconvenience?

            Since it’s a new Install:<br />
<br />
Remove and reinstall. I know, I know, the MVP's will jump on this faster than a Tick on a Dog. But I believe you have a defective install. Assuming you bought actual office package and Not Office365<br />
<br />
First see if you have accidentally mistyped the wrong numbers<br />
&nbsp;Is it on&nbsp; the DVD as a Sticker?<br />
<br />
If so your typing it wrong<br />
<br />
There are several items that can be mistyped depending upon font used<br />
3's and E's <br />
8's and 3's <br />
1 and Capital I (eye)<br />
Capital O and 0 Zero<br />
V and U <br />
<br />
Also Capitalization Matters<br />
<br />
If you received the key through Email carefully copy the code and Paste.<br />
<br />
IF that didn't help go to this:<br />
<br />
Do the following:<br />
<ol>
<li>Remove per instructions here:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768</a> ,<a href="http://http://www.office.mvps.org/install/reinstall_office2011.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.office.mvps.org/install/reinstall_office2011.html<br />
</a></li><li>Then Restart computer with Shift key down.</li><li>Next sign in when asked, using password you gave computer when setting up computer</li><li>Now run the the installer again.</li><li>This time when asked to key in the License key, try Copying the license key that sent you, then Paste where start of License key begins.</li></ol>
<p>Now see if office works without asking for license key. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>IF you actually purchased Office365 there is a Back button which takes you to an activation site. You must sign in with User ID and Password you used to purchase.<br />

            I've got exactly the same issue with my new mac that I bought at the same time as macfan, also bought with the Office Product key (not a DVD as iMacs haven't got a drive). It's driving me mental. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling (as per MS instruction),
 deleting the licensing files and putting them back (as other messages instruct) but nothing works for me, I just have to keep on entering the key at each logon. Unlike Macfan above I don't have any superdrive connected only a USB backup drive.
<div>Re Jones reply above, this is the downloadable version (only option with an iMac), the licence entry box doesn't allow pasting into, would be good if it did as it would half solve the problem and having to enter the licence all the time would be less of
 a burdon. Not sure what more I can do!</div>

            Hi, after much trial and error I have found that the MS Office software will ask for the product key when it senses a change in the computer's configuration. &nbsp;It thinks the software is being used on a new machine. &nbsp;Very bad design by MS. &nbsp;Now that my iMac
 is set up and seeing normal use it is not asking for the key. &nbsp;But if I unplug the external RAID drive and use the mac or install an update to the Mac OS it will ask for the key again. &nbsp;Luckly these situations are not often now. &nbsp;No amount of uninstalling
 and reinstalling the MS Office software will help. &nbsp;My guess is your USB backup drive is causing the conflict. &nbsp;Try leaving the drive unplugged and start up the machine, use MS Office, shut down the Mac, then restart the Mac with the USB drive still unplugged
 and see if it&nbsp;
<div>asks for the key again. &nbsp;If not its the drive, if yes then there is something else changing on the Mac that is tripping the key request. &nbsp;Could be software or external hardware.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Yes, finally sorted it. Unplug my USB drives, enter the licence key for office, reboot and it's fine, no longer need to re-enter key. This is a major league bug though and a right pain.</div>

<h3> rabbitcook  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;BUG&#63;&#93; Can&#39;t search words within tables&#47;cells</h2>
                    <p>I'm creating some sort of offline dictionary for my archeology career research, using
<strong>OneNote 2016</strong> and I'm organizing it so that I use tables of 4 columns, one column for the word and its differences in other dialects within the same region, the next for the hyeroglyphic scripture (.jpg pictures), the third for its literal interpretation
 and the fourth one for its different meanings and other details related to that word in question and on which assets they were referenced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, when I use the "Search" box to locate a word or a meaning amongst all the sections or a single section of the dictionary, it can't find any words that are within the tables themselves. If I go to the place where I know the word is (lets say,
 "chickpea" on the "PLANTS" page), the word is highlighted in yellow no problem, but the "Search" box doesn't detect any section that contains that word, despite the word actually exist (but it is inside a table cell). This gets more complicated when I'm looking
 for a certain word I forgot on which page was located (there are more than +200 pages as we speak), and the "Search" isn't able to pinpoint the exact location where that word is amongst all the sections and pages themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to bypass this problem <strong>without the need of deleting all the tables completely</strong>? Tables are a neat way to keep things tidy, mostly if there is a great deal of images that needs to be aligned neatly with their assigned groups
 of words. Is this a some sort of bug that can be patched?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>(using Win10 Home x64)</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>Will add a few more details. I still have installed the <strong>old version of OneNote</strong> but I'm unable to uninstall it because the Uninstall button is grayed out. Not sure if that is contributing to the problem but I thought it should be mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found one more bug about this bug. Apparently now my <strong>OneNote 2016</strong> detects there is a word inside a cell, but in a different page to the page I'm looking at. Funny enough, it says there are no more pages with a similar matching word to what
 I searched, but as you can see on the photo, the page for "BIRD" does contain the word, and is highlighted in yellow. The page for "SAY" does have the word in it but, why is not detecting it elsewhere despite all the pages are formatted the same?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I added another example searching "PA.LU" on the "BIRD" page. It only found two matching pages amongst the sections which are not the "BIRD" page, nor even in the same section (the first result redirects to a blank page that has nothing written yet, which
 makes this bug even weirder). Still not working as intended.</p>

 OK and he has pretty much every thing from the Old laptop he needed.

    <title>OneNote 2013 Messed up the Text Recognition in Picture - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> call.me.thx  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2013 Messed up the Text Recognition in Picture</h2>
                    I have both OneNote 2010 and 2013 on two different computer.&nbsp;
<div>If I print a pdf document into 2010, the text recognition in picture, although not completely accurate every time, is fine. Even if the notebook is opened by 2013 later, as long as I do not change the language recognition settings (which means I do not
 switch to, for example French, and switch back to English), it is fine as well.</div>
<div>However, if the pdf document is brought in via OneNote 2013, the text recognition then becomes horrible. It may still tell you the searched word in a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;page, but is never able to highlight it right. It will also mess up the pdf originally brought
 in via 2010 if I switch the language recognition setting to, for example&nbsp;Spanish, and back to English.</div>
<div>Interestingly enough, if the document is brought in via 2013 and opened by 2010, as long as I switch the language recognition back and forth, it will be fine than.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I believe something wrong with the OneNote 2013 OCR. I am wondering if any body else has encountered the same problem?</div>
                </div>

            Change the system font size to Small (100%) will solve this problem.
<div><br />
<div>The quickest way I find is to right click on desktop and go to screen resolution, find "make text and other items larger or smaller. Change the setting to Small - 100% and apply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then log off and log on again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Users may (or may not) need to re-print the document to OneNote, or switch the recognition language back and forth to make things perfect.</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Sync Vista 64 on AT&#38;T smartphone</h2>
                    Downloaded Windows Mobile 6.1.6965&nbsp; This is the first time I've tried to sync my phone since purchasing the new PC<br />
It will connect without any problems just won't sync.<br />
I restarted PC and phone...still won't work<br />
Also, when I plug the phone into the PC my mouse freezes up until connections are completed on both.<br />
When I select sync it will start but just stops without any type of error message.

<h2>            Meetings in outlook.com calendar disappaearing &#40;365 home&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Recently I'm experiencing that meetings I create in outlook.com calendar disappear after few hours. Also those I invite other to join. So when they respond, I know they have received my meeting invitation, and I get a reply with their acceptance but it says.
 " We couldn't find this meeting in the calendar. It may have been removed or deleted"</p>
<p>Furthermore, syncing with other calendars is acting strange.</p>
<p>Is there any help to be found on the matter?</p>

            <p>Hi Adrian McPherson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your contribution to the forums. If you're trying to update your phone, the only way to do this is actually through the Zune software, so we'll need to resolve that connection issue before you can update the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing you'll want to try is another PC - this&nbsp;won't resolve the&nbsp;connection issue, but at the very least you might be able to get your phone up to date so that you can access the marketplace and use it to the fullest extent. If it doesn't update
 there, try using another USB port or if possible another sync cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your phone is still undetected on the other PC, or you're not able to try on another PC, we've got a couple of other things to take a look at. You'll want to try the other USB port/sync cable with the original PC as well, but you'll also want to take
 a look at the driver for the phone. On your PC, go to <strong>Start</strong>, right-click
<strong>Computer</strong>(or <strong>My Computer</strong>, depending on your version of Windows), and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. From here you should see an option on the left labeled
<strong>Device Manager</strong>(in XP you'll need to go to the Hardware tab first), click that and then find your phone in the list(it may also be an unknown USB or Windows Phone device). Right-click that and then select Delete. Once that's done, unplug your
 phone and plug it back in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your phone remains detected after performing these steps, there's probably an issue with the device itself. In this situation, you'd want to contact your mobile operator or HTC about a repair or replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sam P.</p>

<p>If you do a Clean Install of Windows 10 all things from HP will be gone and only Microsoft things will be on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to go to the HP support site and download the HP things that go with you device but no guaranty they will still work with Insider Builds.</p>

<h2>            Cannot copy or move subsites - access denied</h2>
                    
<p>Recently tried copying subsites (within the same site collection) using "Content and Structure" but get "Access denied". I contacted Microsoft and did several tests but always had the same problem, even if copying sites using File Explorer in Win10. It isn't
 a permissions problem, I have Full Control access to the entire site and subsites. Apparently it is because "Sharepoint server publishing framework" is&nbsp;not activated. I don't know the full implications of activating the publishing framework (other than what
 a google search shows up) but Microsoft suggest&nbsp;that switching it on now might "break" something, so they don't advise it.</p>
<p>So, without the ability to copy subsites in this way, I thought I could try "Save site as a template" and then create a new site from the template in the correct location, but I don't see "Save site as a template" as an option in the settings.&nbsp;After another
 google search it seems that this option may not appear if the publishing features are activated, but they are not in my case, so I don't know why it doesn't appear.</p>
<p>At the moment it seems that I am unable to copy susbites using any "normal" method, so will have to do it the slow way, copying all the document libraries and web parts etc bit by bit, but even then I'm not convinced I can copy everything successfully. And
 it isn't a good long term solution - I will need to copy subsites on a fairly regular basis.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this? Or know of how to resolve it?</p>
<p>As background, one&nbsp;suspicion is that the publishing framework may have been activated at some point in the past, probably at the initial site setup, then de-activated, which has left things in a slightly corrupt state. Which makes me nervous to activate
 it again, particularly with Microsoft advising against it.</p>

<p>Hi JonWUK,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates. Please don’t add "SaveSiteAsTemplateEnabled" as it won’t take effect if it doesn’t appear at the beginning.</p>
<p>For “Access denied” issue, can you help to confirm following points for our investigation?<br />
1. Capture a screenshot of “<strong>Access denied</strong>” page when accessing Content and Structure page (including the
<strong>Correlation ID</strong> if it appears).<br />
2. Capture a screenshot of your check permission page (<strong>Full Control </strong>
permission) on your default live team site.<br />
3. Try grant another permission (at minimum <strong>Contribute</strong> permission) on your live team site and check if same error occurs.<br />
4. Navigate to 
https://j**s.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/people.aspx?MembershipGroupId=0&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Check
<strong>All People</strong> page if there exists two same accounts with your account name. If so, please remove one. (You may verify the account by clicking the account names)</p>
<p>For the issue on your “test” tenant, please first check if there is any <strong>
corrupt list</strong> in your site collection. If so, try deleting it and check the outcome. If any error occurs, please also capture a screenshot for us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’d like to collect your tenant information for reviewing the logs of the errors. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message asking for the information. You can go to this link to access to the Private Message:
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>

<p>hi jon,</p>
<p>thanks for your detailed information which is very helpful for our troubleshooting.</p>
<p>from the permission screenshot, we can see you don't have the add and customize pages permission which is relevant to the access denied error.</p>

<p>this permission depends on the custom script feature. please refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-scripting-capabilities-on-or-off-1f2c515f-5d7e-448a-9fd7-835da935584f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>note: this feature needs to take up to <strong>24 hours</strong> to take effect. after this time, please go to your live site to check if you have the save site as template feature or use the url directly i provided in the former post to check if you can

            <p>I presume you are referring to Windows 10 Redstone.</p>
<p>At the moment we only have a preview build of it, #14251, which is only available to those who have entered the "insider" program, for testing the preview builds during development. The insiders only get the builds through "Windows Updates" from within the
 builds that they have previously received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Redstone is released to the public, it will come as an upgrade to the earlier publicly released version of Windows 10 through Windows Updates, or at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that is the information you were asking for.</p>

<h2>            CUSTOMER SERVICE</h2>
                    I waited over 40 minutes to speak to a customer service representative.&nbsp; I was forwarded to someone who could not answer a question about the change in set up in "photos" so he forwarded me to someone else with a long wait time to be connected.&nbsp; This customer
 service representative then asked my question, asked it again and then hung up the phone on me.&nbsp; Is the practice of your customer service representatives on weekend calls?&nbsp; My question remains unanswered and my dissatisfaction with Microsoft is even more enhanced.

<p>I followed instructions going offline, creating a test message, etc. That did not resolve the issue. As explained above, there are no messages displayed in the outbox although the system indicates there are seven in the queue (but nowhere to be seen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email system is a POP/STMP. I have also gone into webmail and deleted all messages in the inbox, drafts, junk, etc. There are none in the queue there to be sent either.</p>

<p>Hi TedN_726,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, we configure Office 365 account via autodiscover, according to your scenario, could you please provide the SMTP address of your account to me via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Messages</a> (to protect your privacy)to check?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check whether you have any anti-virus scanner or other scanner utility running on Computer. Some anti-virus may scan e-mails when sending or receiving. If any, please try to disable it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a test profile</a>, and set up your account into that profile, please note do not delete the old profile, and back up your account data in Outlook before create.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi TedN_726,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
Private Message</a>, I have replied your messages, please check. Since according to the error code, it most likely some settings interfere the connections to the server, have you check the anti-virus scanner, you can check them via Task Manager to see if any
 running on background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If in a new test Outlook profile, did the issue persists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you said it has 6 messages reportedly in queue, there’s no messages displayed in Outbox folder, if possible, could you please provide a screenshot of error or warning you ever received to me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p>Hi TedN_726,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve received the information in Private Messages. Generally, the issue can be caused by
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2758902/how-to-set-up-an-internet-email-account-in-outlook-2013-or-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
client email configuration</a>, network connection, and server side. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to this situation, the account isn’t an Office 365 account, emails aren’t in Outlook’s Outbox and stuck in transfer queue. If you are in good
<strong>network connection</strong>, have disabled <strong>anti-virus scanne</strong><strong>r</strong>, and the account has
<strong>set up correctly (especially the SMTP server and port)</strong>, however, the issue still exists, please contact your admin or email provider to let them check and further look into this issue.</p>

            Hi RobFen1969,<br />
<br />
To investigate the issue, please check some information:<br />
1. It seems you are using the legacy OneDrive for Business sync client (groove.exe). To check whether it is uninstalled or not launched:<br />
a. Please click Start &gt; Run &gt; input groove.exe, can the OneDrive for Business sync client be launched?<br />
b. Open Task manager, check if you can find the related process.<br />
c. Check the file location. For example: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15<br />
d. Go to the OneDrive for Business library page and try clicking Sync.<br />
<br />
2. If you still cannot find it, please try downloading the OneDrive for Business sync client:<br />

<h2>            IE 11 versions</h2>
                    <p>My coworker and I are both on Microsoft Windows 7 Professional - Version 6.1.7601, Service Pack 1, Build 7601.</p>
<p>However, we are having differences with how some websites perform, so we checked versions of IE.</p>
<p>I have version 11.0.9600.18282, and he has 11.0.9600.18314IS.</p>
<p>What are the differences?</p>
<p>How can we install either of the 2 versions above so that we can still be current, but on the same version?</p>
<p>When I try to install from Microsoft.com, it says I have a newer version than what was downloaded.</p>
<p>How &amp; why do I have a "more recent" version than the latest and greatest that's available from MS.com?</p>
<p>Why are websites performing/acting differently between the two versions?</p>
