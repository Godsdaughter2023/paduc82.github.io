<h2>            Xbox 360 red light. </h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having a problem with my Xbox 360. (Xbox 360 S 4 GB with a kinect).</p>
<p>To be straight froward, I was playing minecraft until there was a buzzing noise. Soon after it froze the screen cut to a cardboard look on screen. This happened in early December</p>
<p>After that I powered it off and when I turned it back on nothing came up on the screen. The Xbox then just showed a red light where the power is, there is also no rings to show what exactly is wrong.</p>
<p>I also do not know the main error or problem with my console. I did try solutions, like get a different HDMI cable but nothing happened. I also tried the recommended solutions &nbsp;for the different problems for the red ring errors. But they did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The console will still power on but the red light still shows. I have tried to register the Xbox for warranty and service, but I am unable to. As there seems to be an error when I try to register.</p>
<p>Help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seems that is a hardware failure and you should send your console for repairs:
</p>
<p><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/warranty-and-service/getting-your-product-serviced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../getting-your-product-serviced</a></p>
<p>If you can't register the console for repairs you should contact xbox chat support to help you:

<p>you can get a little more detail on what type of error you have. &nbsp;by pressing the sync and eject buttons you can retrieve a 4 digit error code which is equivalent to the error code given when the console boots up and displays an error screen rather than
 not booting at all. &nbsp;the error screen gives this code in the E## format.</p>
<p>to get your secondary code, hold sync, then press eject. &nbsp;this will give you the first digit based on the number of flashing lights. &nbsp;press eject a second time for the second digit, again for the 3rd, and again for the 4th. &nbsp;pressing it again will return
 to the original regular red light pattern. &nbsp;(on the older consoles, a number of light will light up 1-4, 4 is equal to a 0 in the code. &nbsp;think of the 4 lights making a circle or 0. &nbsp;newer console do not have the dual green-red leds, so they flash a particular
 number of times if i am not mistaken, rather than lighting up a certain number of ring sections.)</p>
<p>knowing this code can sometimes help narrow down the issue. &nbsp;here is a list of all the flashing light error codes, including the E## code they correspond to, and the general issue related to the code:</p>

<p>QuickMythril the link you have posted its of a third party provider and I invite you to use only links supported by the xbox live since this is an xbox live forum. For example to check error codes the support page is:

<p>ok i tried that page and searched for error code 0102. &nbsp;it said "Sorry! No Support articles were found for 0102"</p>
<p>however that is a very common error code when you have the "red ring/light of death". &nbsp;using the link i provided, i am told that 0102 is E18, which the official xbox page says "This means that there may be a problem with the console." &nbsp;that's not very specific
 or helpful at all.</p>
<p>i would rather use a source with compiled information from many users doing their own personal testing than a generic message. &nbsp;thanks for "trying to point us in the right direction", but i prefer to actually be as informative as possible, so console owners
 can make educated decisions about how they would like to proceed when they have hardware failures.</p>

<p>Your source "with compiled information" advises the console user to apply repairs by himself showing the parts of the system that should be changed. This is a breach of system rules that causes void warranty and as I have explained you before it is dangerous
 for the user as well. </p>
<p>Please read the rules of service and the code of conduct thoroughly in the future! &nbsp;</p>

<p>it is stated on that page, "Notice: None of this is official, the methods have often been proven to work but success cannot be guaranteed, you do it on your own risk! &nbsp;If your console is still covered by the 3 year warranty use it because Microsoft will
 fix it for free!"</p>
<p>no one advises anyone to do anything except learn. &nbsp;unfortunately microsoft only advises you to "let them handle it". &nbsp;i would hope most users know whether the console they own is still under warranty or not. &nbsp;i am not advising self-repair, simply providing
 information on how to get a more specific error code using a method that Microsoft themselves designed into the console.</p>

<p>hello! if you have lights indicating "4141" that would actually be the secondary error code "0101" which is equivalent to the E17 error. &nbsp;this can sometimes be caused by one of the pins in the USB ports being bent and causing a "bridge". &nbsp;i suggest to visually
 inspect the ports to see if anything seems damaged.</p>

<h2>            How do I change the windows 8 Music Apps volume and not change my computers volume&#63;</h2>
                    I usually play music in the background while I play games, well I cannot seem to turn up the volume on my game and turn down the volume on the music app, I can see the games volume but not the music app, am I missing it? I have looked all over and cannot
 find it, Very annoying.&nbsp; It seems as if the music app is linked to the master volume, which would be very dumb I think.&nbsp; Please let me know where to look for the control.&nbsp; Thanks.

See if you can find a&nbsp; Volume Mixer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I see mine open when I click on the Speakers icon in the Notification area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately I do not find it in a settings Search (e.g. after Win-W).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just did a right-click Properties of its Taskbar button when
 it was opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's called sndvol.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm...&nbsp; It's not a File.&nbsp;&nbsp; Win-F&nbsp; didn't find it but&nbsp; Win-Q&nbsp; did.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's an "app".&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knew?&nbsp;&nbsp; But it only shows up when I type in the full sndvol&nbsp;&nbsp; so I think it really is&nbsp;more of a&nbsp;file&nbsp;than an app.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Good luck</p>

            Yes, as I stated I can see the games volume in the mixer but not the windows 8 music app.&nbsp; It appears to have its sound linked to the master volume and not have a volume control of its own.

            <span>There is no audio mixer in this environment as there is in the desktop. It still exists for desktop applications, but your app won’t show up here because we felt it was not a great experience to pop out into desktop to adjust relative app
 volumes. Instead, we are encouraging apps to not include volume controls. This way users are focused on the master volume control which helps simplify the entire volume experience as well – but that’s a different story.</span>

            I am not immediately against this&nbsp;decision by Microsoft, but the volume for the Music app apears to be set at max, so I have to set my system volume to 5 in order to not blow my ears out. &nbsp;As a consequence I cannot hear the sound from anything else that

            The audio for the music app is fed through the main channel, so it cannot be adjusted separately.&nbsp; Users must utilize another program/app, which is assigned its own channel in the Volume Mixer, in order to adjust levels specific to the music played.&nbsp; This
 is a flaw in the design of the Music app, and something I hope Microsoft will address.

            1-2. I'm doing it using an upgrade win7 installation disk from within a running os.<br />
3. Yes, the system is running and I can perform almost anything but one essential task/<br />
4. My IE doesn't work. When I start it, It gets stuck not being able to access even a single site.
<br />
<br />
I did all I could imagine (or collect from the net, or from MS assistance, and Hebrew Answers.MS to solve the problem, and eventually reached the point that a trpair installation should be tried. Here I got stuck, which led me to posting my question.<br />

            <p>Also my&nbsp; old Canon printer (Pixma MP 980) from 2007 is not longer supported by Canon for Windows 10. Anyhow I still can use it under Windows 10 even so no Win 10 driver is available.
</p>
<p>Please check in the device manager that your printer is listed.&nbsp; I assume it still is.</p>
<p>Then press Windows-key pus X-key on the keyboard. Select control panel in the new window poping up (old type of control panel with look from previous Win versuon).&nbsp; There select "devices and printer" (at least it is called so in my German version).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Windows will after a shot moment show all printers, fax etc.&nbsp; Hopefully your printer is listed and it my be listed more than one time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select your printer and define it as standard&nbsp; printer.&nbsp; Test it. if it dose not work take the next copy of your printer,
 define it as standard &nbsp;and test it.&nbsp; if you are lucky it works. </p>
<p>At least it did in my case.</p>
<p>Note: I could not send a test page, that failed. However from any application like word etc I can select my printer and print. With Canon Navigator EX I also can use the scanner as before.</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem too, I downloaded the driver for the printer from the following site http://ccm.net/download/download-6044-canon-mp510-driver ,
</p>
<p>after installing the driver I plugged in the printer, when you go to device and printers it should appear in the printer section and when you click on it it should ask you to restart the pc, and starts working. Anyway thats what worked for me , hope this
 helps</p>

<h2>            I Can Not Join Realms Or Even Create A Realm, But I Can Join Servers&#33;&#63;&#33; Minecraft Bedrock&#58; Pocket Edition</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Am having a problem connecting to my friends realm. At first I was invited to his realm (by the way this is bedrock and im playing on my phone) and was able to join and play, one day I was playing an got disconnected and could not join. I have confirmed
 with his that he did not ban me or anything like that, but what was strange was that the realm was deleted from my realm list. He reinvented me then I tried to accept the Invite, but an error message would come up that says "Something went wrong. Try checking
 your internet connection" Im not too dumb and have tried basically everything, for example I have tried to connect: Using cellular data, my home wifi, my neighbor's wifi, and even downloading it on my computer (a desktop) and trying to accept it from there.
 What is very strange and convinces me that it is not an issue with my connection is that I can join servers for example: Lifeboat Network, Mineville City, The hive, Mineplex, Cubcraft Games with no problem what so ever. From what I have seen I can not find
 any other people with this issue. I really want to play on my friends realm and I really hope some one can help me with this issue.</p>

            <p>Hey there CrushedPuppet81.<br /><br />The passkey can be reset if he knows his account's password. If you don't want him to be able to reset his passkey, we recommend selecting a password for him. As of now, your work around for web filtering is going to be your best option, as it doesn't prevent you from typing the parameters into a search engine. Once your son attempts to visit those websites he shouldn't be able to access without the pass key.</p>

    <title>D drive missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gilbert ivancruz mart&#237;nez  say:</h3>
<h2>            D drive missing</h2>
                    <p>Good morning everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find this very interesting but really don't know why is happening. Every morning, I turn on my laptop and start working. Since last Sunday 6/18 I realized that my D drive was missing (when I tried to play a videogame). I looked for it and never found it,
 so I restarted and then it appeared. All went well during the day. The interesting thing is that it has happened everyday until this morning, and only happens when I turn it on the first time in the day. When I go out for lunch or workout I turn it off, then
 I come back, turn it on and the drive is there. Once again, it happens only in the mornings. I have scanned the driver trying to see if there's a problem but it looks good. I checked the events and I can see this every day:</p>
<p>
</p><p>An error was detected on device \Device\Harddisk1\DR1 during a paging operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and this one of the days:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 1 has been surprise removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how to fix this, if there's a way to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

                    I cannot stop wuauserv service. It freezes in stopping condition. My update is always getting stuck at some point so I need to do some workaround to fix it. For all fixes I have to stop wuauserv service. So I couldn't update since November 2015. I downloaded
 required updates manually from <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Thanks.aspx?id=140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Update Catalog</a>&nbsp;and tried to install but unfortunately I couldn't even do that maybe because its trying to stop wuaserv service.

<h3> peterjchandler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skeleton Skype for Linux 5.3 is a very very long way from ready, please delay stable version 4.3&#39;s retirement</h2>
                    <p>Skeleton Linux for Skype 5.3 is a very very long way from ready, please delay stable version 4.3's retirement:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Viewing the forum shows there are many Linux users who have requested many features for Skype for Linux replacement, however these requests have been ignored. &nbsp;Stable version 4.3, which has been very short of features compared to other versions of Skype,
 is luxurious in it's range of features, reliability &amp; broad functionality, and ability to connect compared to the skeleton Skype 5.3 that Microsoft appears to think is a viable replacement for stable version 4.3. &nbsp;Viewing the recently closed version of the
 forum would reveal a much much larger history of feature requests that Microsoft has ignored in the process of developing the Linux replacement to the point it has moved from an alpha development project to a skeleton development project with still a very
 long way to go before it could be considered as a mainstream application. &nbsp;Although there are not massive numbers on the forum, if you look at the Mac Skype development process, when stable Mac version 2.8 was retired in favour of a Windows type user interface
 for the replacement, Mac users were so incensed that very very large numbers sought out the forum to register their annoyance, with many many threads critical of the new user interface getting close to a thousand posts, with almost all the posts from new users
 with only a few posts. &nbsp;The response to the flood of complaints and feature requests was to close the forum discarding years of contributions by many experienced Skype users, it looks as though Microsoft's response to Linux users repeatedly ignored requests
 for features &amp; functionality in Linux Skype is to repeat the process, ditch the forum and start again from scratch deleting the years of collective wisdom from Skype users. &nbsp; Therefore the limited Linux forum activity is not a good measure of the feature sets
 &amp; reliability that Linux Skype users are looking for before stable version 4.3 is retired, forcing on us an ineffective skeleton Skype that is just not able to offer any viable communication here for more than a few occasional seconds, having tried on many
 occasions compared to the massively more effective stable version 4.3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft people have posted that the new version offers higher quality, more reliability and a mobile friendly application, looking at the forum these absurd claims for skeleton Skype for Linux 5.3 are optimistic to put it politely, or more truthfully,
 absurdly massive distortions of reality as they are so far from the reality of skeleton Skype for Linux 5.3</p>

<p>Perhaps this is an illustration of the Microsoft approach?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft launched the Alpha Skype replacement some time ago for feedback from the Linux community. &nbsp;Many Linux users have run the various Alpha &amp; Beta forms of the new Skype for Linux, spending large amounts of time creating masses of feedback saving Microsoft
 that debugging time, and many many many requests for the features that the current skeleton version does not have, yet are found on every other computer version for all the 10 years have been using Skype. &nbsp;Microsoft staffers have said on many posts in this
 forum that they are listening to the users, however I would suggest that they are only listening for the answers they want to hear, and the Linux community repeatedly gave the wrong answers requesting a Skype that is similar in functionality to other computer
 Skypes, so Microsoft's answer was to shut down the forum and remove the proof that they have not been listening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great to see some evidence of Microsoft listening at the point that many Linux computers are about to be ejected from Skype communications, perhaps the number of "Me To". clicks an illustration of how important this issue is?</p>

            Desktop Skype for Linux is very close to retirement, being replaced by the crappy skeleton version that offers video calls in the same way as trying to persuade a high mileage BMW driver that a bicycle will fulfil that high mileage transport function!

<p>I recently upgraded to debian stretch and was having issues with my wifi when using skype 4.3.&nbsp; So I tried 5.3.&nbsp; It's truly appalling.</p>
<p>Partial list of required features that are missing or hidden well enough they might as well be missing.
</p>
<p>1) Automatically accept incoming calls</p>
<p>2) Disable the connection sound.</p>
<p>3) Separate chat window so you can chat while video is full screen on the other monitor.</p>
<p>4) Limited ability to turn notifications on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For heaven's sake, why would you remove the link to the stable version when the new product is in such horrible state? I'm hopeful you have more sense than to roll this out as stable until you fix the beta version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the plus side this is finally getting my wife in the mood to try alternatives.&nbsp; Thanks for that!</p>

<p>Just got an email from Microsoft asking if this question has been answered.. &nbsp;It would appear that the retirement has been postponed as v4.3 continues to connect to Skype and has functioning calls with other Linux 4.3 accounts, plus some other versions of
 Skype, excluding the new Android version for example, so I guess a partial answer with a partial continuation of connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the broader aspect to the question has not been touched, or any effort by Microsoft to reassure it's user base. &nbsp;Have yet to see any indication that Microsoft are thinking of adding stable version 4.3's functionality to the new skeleton Skype for
 Linux 5.3 toy in anything other than vague long term aspirations. &nbsp;This is hardly an appropriate response to the damage they are doing to the market dominant video communications app that hundreds of millions of people frequently rely on to keep in contact
 with distant family, or businesses rely on for communication, dominant in markets with weak internet connectivity and limited technical experience enforcing that dominance. &nbsp;The 'please bear with us' messages ring rather hollow if you have lost access to your
 means of staying in touch to people you are close to, and have to wait on Microsoft's leisure to restore the unique functionality to Skype that led to it's market domination, as the newer downgrades are forced on Skype users with no option to restore the previous
 version to regain connectivity..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps restating Mark Harris's very relevant comments about Android Skype are the best summary of what most would expect from any organisation that displays responsibility to it's very large customer base, the dominant part of the market:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If a new release/complete rebuild is required as a part of the migration to the cloud, then leave the current application and format in place, and develop the new cloud based application in parallel,
 and rolled out to those that want to try the new version with the option to roll it back. "</span></p>
<p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is NOT a game.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 for lost time and loss of income while you toy with this important application. Of course I am sure there is no hope of that.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 around with and for frivolous stuff like adding colours, graphics, etc whilst losing functionality.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 to. This was NOT the case for this latest installment of technicolour dung.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft's treatment of the Linux community has been far worse. &nbsp;Asking the Linux community for assistance in developing new version of Skype for Linux, which granted did run in parallel to the existing version allowing testing, then resorting to the stable
 version for significant use, then attempting to kill the stable version whilst pushing the Linux community onto a version that has lost more than 80% of the functionality, controllability and has very reduced connectivity is hardly the response most would
 expect as a thank you for the Linux community's extensive testing and significant feedback to Microsoft that must have saved Microsoft significant amounts of cash, perhaps more of a rip off or insult?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps that as posting, this question has more people having the same problem than any other thread on Linux Skype, and, with the exception of the messaging &amp; emoji glitch, the most clicks to share the problem per vieweing of the thread would indicate this
 is a problem that Microsoft should be addressing urgently? &nbsp;It would be great to hear from Microsoft here, however I am not holding my breath!</p>

<p>The Lx community has long held, (well, since the Redmond takeover...largely because Lx users have an innate dislike / distrust of Micro Soft), that Skype was a "don't hold your breath" issue. &nbsp;The vast majority of issues had to do with being ignored. &nbsp;Okay,
 so 90-odd percent had to do with fluff issues in the freeware version, not technical issues, free or premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took years to go from 2, to 3. to 4. &nbsp;Trick is, for the most part, Skype worked. &nbsp;No, it didn't interface with some social media or other communications platforms. &nbsp;But it worked. &nbsp;A glitch here, a glitch there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the kind of defense I <em>used</em> to write in support of Skype, be careful what you wish for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So some algorithm analyzed all that whining and POOF! &nbsp;5. &nbsp;We can now interact with
<em>all sorts</em> of bots, but we no longer have any control over out-going voicemail messages, cameras, microphones...<strong>but we have BOTS! &nbsp;W00T!</strong></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You could have left well enough alone until all of the a, b and real-world testing was done. &nbsp;I get it, it all had to be 64-bit for the move to the cloud, but, as the saying goes: &nbsp;"Timing Is Everything".</p>

<p>This is the tragedy...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft have taken a once elegant and effective communication platform that justifiably ruled the video call market, and now Microsoft are shafting the platform! &nbsp;Sadly Skype is installed on a significant proportion of phones &amp; computers out there, with
 so many dependent on Skype for family relationships when spread around the world, so to describe Microsoft's actions here as gross irresponsibility would cast Microsoft in a positive light compared to what they have actually done. &nbsp;For a significant part of
 the Skype customer base, limited technical knowledge and weak connections will make it impossible to migrate groups to another platform, but hard for those groups to continue to use Skype as the connection requirements go up. &nbsp;It is this total disregard of
 the user that has lead to the EU fining Microsoft enormous sums in the past, guess they are so ignorant that they have failed to learn the lessons.</p>

    <title>Windows won&#39;t scale properly when moving from the SB screen to an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewwillissa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows won&#39;t scale properly when moving from the SB screen to an external display</h2>
                    <p>I have the Surface Dock for the Surface Book. I'm running the i7, 512GB with the dedicated GPU. When I try to move a window from the laptop screen to the external monitor, it's a 80/20 shot it does not scale it properly to the monitor. The reason is the
 native SB screen resolution is so high, it's scaled to 200% by default. But, when you move it to another screen that is at 100% because it's a 1920x1080 or a 1440 screen, that window stays in its 200% scaled display. When you change&nbsp;the SB display to only
 be scaled&nbsp;to 100%, it fixes this issue. However, the text is then too small for most people to read on the SB display.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to avoid this is to just not use the SB as a screen. I have users that have been using two screens and their laptop as a third screen for a couple years. I'm just trying to get the same functionality.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any possible fix for this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you get the same effect if your external display is connected directly to Surface Book, vs using the Dock?</p>
<p>You say this is&nbsp;happening inconsistently.&nbsp; Have you noted that it happens more often with other particular apps open, in addition to the one you are moving to the external display?
</p>
<p>Can you confirm that all updates have installed successfully, with&nbsp;all accessories connected and operating?</p>
<p>Does this happen with different external displays, cables and adapters?</p>
<p>If applicable, is this external display using the latest&nbsp;firmware?</p>

            <p>Same basic issue here, but for me, I don't use my SB screen as a screen when docked and using my other 2 external monitors. Things scale fine if you have started your PC that way, but if you un-dock, work, then re-dock, some apps don't scale back down for
 the external monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I've identified at least IE11 and Skype for Business that won't scale back to 100% when docked (and not using SB as an optional monitor - in fact, SB is closed and monitor is black/off).</p>

            <p>I just got the dock and am having same problem and it's quite the deal breaker. The issues with the Surface Book are just too numerous to list anymore but this is just the icing on the cake. I leave my SB closed while docked and here is what I experienced
 over the last 2 days:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday:</p>
<p>1) Booted SB while closed but connected to the dock first thing in the morning. This was from a full power off and everything was fine. The monitors at work at 1080p.</p>
<p>2) Hibernated unit while still closed and dock. Put in my bag.</p>
<p>3) Attempted to use at home. Woke from hibernate and the scaling was awful. Many elements were far too small including my desktop icons, some (but not all) taskbar icons, etc. Chrome was the proper "scale" but the scaling was very poor quality. Text and
 graphics were jagged. I had to reboot to fix it.</p>
<p>4) Concluded my business last night and put my unit into hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today:</p>
<p>1) This morning at work I connected the SB to my dock and hit the power button while closed. It awoke from hibernate.</p>
<p>2) I have the opposite problem. Many elements are HUGE. The desktop icons are hilariously large along with the batterybar graphics which reside on the taskbar next to the system tray. Taskbar icons seem to be okay. So now I am about to reboot again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should not have to reboot my laptop because the OS cannot handle going to sleep/hibernate at one resolution and awaking at another. This product is supposed to be designed for docking!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade hangup.  Cursor just spinning.</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to upgrade my Lenovo laptop currently running Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; I clicked on the "upgrade" icon in the taskbar and a window comes up titled "Get Windows 10".&nbsp; It then proceeds to have a cursor spin in it continuously.&nbsp; I have let it run
 almost 12 hours.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My other laptop completes this operation and updates the same window with more instructions to continue and schedule the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried upgrading by downloading an iso and installing it from DVD for the laptop that is having the problem.&nbsp; I go thru the whole Windows 10 DVD installation process and at the very end it fails.&nbsp; I cant remember the exact verbage... but basically
 no error message... just a ...&nbsp; "Installation unsuccessful... try again" message.&nbsp; As a software engineer.... I find this really unacceptable... just leaving it without an error code or directions for why it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... back to the first problem... anyone know why I just get the spinning icon in the Get Windows 10 upgrade window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive used windows update to make sure everything is upgraded... </p>
<p>Running...&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 7 Home Premium&nbsp; SP1, 64bit, 4GB RAM, Windows 7 is verified as authentic.</p>
<p>

    <title>I am trying to uninstall XP Service Pack 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ketfl  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am trying to uninstall XP Service Pack 3</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to uninstall Windows XP Service Pack 3 from my laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the microsoft website and tried all of the different methods.&nbsp; Method 1&nbsp; did not show a Windows XP Service Pack 3.&nbsp; Method 2 said 'file not found'.&nbsp; Method 3 only goes back to
 April 2012.&nbsp; I am sure the Service Pack was installed before that but I have no idea when.&nbsp;I did a file search for spuninst and found 142 files.&nbsp; 141 of them were in the Windows/Software/Distribution/Download folder.&nbsp; The last was in system32 folder/Preinstall.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The computer is a 2003 and the initial install was XP Service Pack 1.&nbsp; It was used for a couple of years by my daughter, then sat for a few years.&nbsp; I booted it up again in October 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I want to uninstall the Service Pack because I am&nbsp;using software that does not run correctly under XP3.&nbsp; The company said to revert back to XP2 to remove the bugs or upgrade&nbsp; the software to work with another operating system.&nbsp; That would cost me a couple
 thousand dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since i have the Reinstallation CD for XP Professional SP1, is it possible I&nbsp;can just start over?</p>

            <p>According to <a href="http://www.sewingmachineoutlet.com/digitizer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a>, Janome Digitizer 10000 isn't officially support in
<em>any</em> version of Windows XP (though posts in the <a href="http://content.janome.com/fusetalk/forum/categories.cfm?catid=7&amp;entercat=y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Janome Community forums</a> say it works in WinXP <em>SP2</em> as you've discovered).</p>
<p>So you have two (2) choices:</p>
<p>1. Uninstall SP3 (if possible), keep using Digitizer 10000 but then <em>never,</em>&nbsp;<em><strong>EVER</strong></em> connect the computer to the internet
<em>at all! </em></p>
<p>2. Leave SP3 &amp; all post-SP3 updates installed but purchase &amp;&nbsp;install (or upgrade to)&nbsp;Janome Digitizer Pro/MB (or higher).&nbsp; [I've found upgrades for as little as $499 USD via Google.]</p>
<p>Note: Depending on when you purchased the WinXP computer, it might have come with WinXP SP3 preinstalled. If such is the case, you cannot uninstall SP3.</p>
<p>Since this really has nothing to do with Windows Update functionality, you'd be better off beginning your own, new thread in this forum for further assistance =&gt;

<h2>            Bluetooth Not Showing Up In Settings</h2>
                    <p>I have a bluetooth dongle that was working but after a restart all bluetooth settings dissapeared. The dongle still shows up in devices and device managers, the drivers are installed, but no options show up in the settings list for bluetooth. Bluetooth is
 supposed to show as an option under "Connected devices". What can I try do to get bluetooth back?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You have mentioned that the Bluetooth section is not showing up in settings. In this case, the issue might be caused by an incompatible driver. I would suggest you to first run the hardware and devices troubleshooter which can
 automatically detect and fix most of the incorrect settings. Type 'hardware' in the search box and clickon 'Find and fix hardware issues' in the results. If the troubleshooter didn't fix the issue, then I would suggest you to visit the PC manufacturer's website
 to download and install the latest drivers. If there is no drivers listed for Windows 10, then download the drivers available for the latest Windows OS and install it in compatibility mode. Type' Compatibility' in the search box and click on 'Run programs
 made for previous versions of Windows' to run the compatibility troubleshooter.</span></p>

    <title>Loss of wireless connection- Intermittant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> woodifer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loss of wireless connection- Intermittant</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop computer and a laptop, the desktop is directly connected to a TP-Link WR641G, Ihave cable modem,Virgin Media.<br />
The laptop Acre Aspire 5610Z connected wirlessly to the TP-Link by Broadcom 802.11g Network Adaptor&nbsp;.<br />
It will run quite happily with excellent connection, sometimes for weeks, the quite randomly it will loose its connection. Sometimes this is intermittant and is cured by a re-boot. At other times it is persistant and nothing seems to be a reliable cure. Sometimes
 System Restore will cure it, I have resorted to re-installing Windows 7, 3 times, not always succesfully. I have spent about 5 hours today trying to troubleshoot this problem with no success, currently connectted by ethernet connection.<br />
<br />
Eventually got error message from windows diagnostic that it is unable to connect to hidden network, BUT NETWORK IS NOT HIDDEN.<br />
<br />
I will copy latest dignostic detail.<br />
<br />
Any advice or suggestions will be most gratfully recieved.<br />

            My problem is resolved. After all these years of weird problems with W7 disconnecting when I used my XP system, I finally replaced the old Linksys BEFW11S4 router with a Netgear 300-N. ALL problems went away and I don't drop any more. As far as security,
 I can also now use WPA2. So, W&amp; and the 1397 were obvious doing there jobs, whereas, the Linksys router couldn't survive in the modern world.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Speech Recognition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottmund  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Speech Recognition</h2>
                    <p>First of all, I love Windows Speech Recognition, and it is remarkably accurate. When you train it to recognize difficult words or names, such as the names of medications, it is much more efficient than typing the same words.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, I would like more advanced control to customize Speech Recognition. Is there a guide, a book or web page that can help with this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when I say "manual," SR prints, "Manuel" by default. I need to be able to change the defaults for homophones. Likewise, when I say "doctor," SR prints "Dr."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an underutilized gem of the operating system. I suspect too many people try it and give up without taking the fifteen minutes or so to train the program to recognize their voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>How to backup an encrypted SD card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> biermichl  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to backup an encrypted SD card</h2>
                    I encrypted a 32GB SD card with TrueCrypt (http://www.truecrypt.org), formatted it as NTFS and mounted it under Windows 7. Now I want to backup the content to a network drive but the Windows 7 backup utility does not offer this drive letter as a backup
 source. I use two PCs in parallel. One with Windows 7 Starter and the other with Windows 7 Professional. What is the best way to run differential backups of my mounted volume?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>If the&nbsp;you&nbsp;are referring to bitlocker, you may try the following link and thank to Arthur Xie:</span></p>
<p><span>In Winodws 7, backup includes creating a system image if you "Let Windows choose". If your system image is encrypted by BitLocker, backup cannot create
 image for it. Therefore, if you would like to backup system image, please decrypt, or select "Let me choose" and uncheck the image backup.</span></p>

    <title>Xbox App not allowing me to use mic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smurfkong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox App not allowing me to use mic</h2>
                    So I don't have a newer controller so to use my 3.5mm mic I need to use it through my comp. Well using the Xbox app I can talk in parties and such, but when I leave party I can't speak to anyone. So in lobby chat, my voice does not register but in parties
 it does. My mic is set as default, my mic is turned on, even the Xbox itself notices there's a mic as there's the little headset icon next to my controller battery life and in Rainbow Six: Siege it says I have a mic connected. I am not muted in game, as you
 cannot mute yourself, and every other thread I've seen has problems OVERALL with mic functions. Only out of party chat isn't working for me. Obviously my question would be, how do I make it work in lobby? Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hi Anindita,</p>
<p>Check in the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) if the ports have been disabled.</p>
<p>Refer to the manual from the manufacturer to do the same.</p>

            <p>Hi Divya,</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;for the reply, but&nbsp;I didn't find such enable COM port options in Lenevo BIOS settings. Basically no drivers are provided from manufacturer, all device drivers have&nbsp; to be downloaded from manufacturer website.
</p>
<p>I was able to enable COM port from "Add Hardware Wizard" option in Windows 7 &amp; it enables COM7 port which is currently showing in my Device manager. But it has a 'yellow' icon (not functionling properly icon) associated with it &amp; in my device settings program
 in C# cant identity COM port in my system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any solution would be appriciated....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anindita</p>
