    <title>Problems with saving selection to header &#40;and quick parts&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with saving selection to header &#40;and quick parts&#41; gallery</h2>
                    <p>I created a header in my document by going to Insert/Header and choosing 'Austere (Even Page)'. I filled in the date field and title field like it asked me to, hit CTRL-A to select all of the header, and saved selection to header gallery as 'Company Header'
 (and the thumbnail of my new header--with date and company name filled in--does appear under the 'General' section of this gallery).
</p>
<p>I saved my document and then tried to insert this new header into a new document but my date and company name did not show up--it's just the formatting with 'Pick a Date' and 'Type Title', as if I had never filled in those fields.
</p>
<p>Since this header was created from Austere (<strong>Even Page</strong>) I tried inserting my header on the second page, thinking it only works on even pages, and I still had the same problem. I tried saving this header as a Quick Part as well, thinking it
 needed to be saved in the header gallery and the quick parts gallery, but when I tried to insert header it still did not work. Nor did it work when I tried to insert the header via Quick Parts.</p>
<p>What is wrong? Quick Parts has worked before and so has something I saved to a page number gallery.
</p>

<p>I would appreciate any help. Thank you.</p>

            The placeholders where you typed in the date and title are probably causing the problem. These are so-called content controls. Right-click and delete each of the controls; then you can type in the content that you want and, finally, save as a Building
 Block.

<h2>            Quotation marks</h2>
                    I have a document that is in the font of Century Schoolbook, but the quotation marks throughout are straight and not curled.&nbsp;Is there an easy way/step to change those quotation marks to be curled?&nbsp;&nbsp; I know using different fonts changes the way the quotes
 look and the Century Schoolbook is to have the curled quotes - but my document doesn't.

<b>Summary: </b>When text is added to your document by a macro, and that text includes quotes or apostrophes, Word won't change the quotes or apostrophes to "smart quotes." This tip explains why and shows what you can do about this predicament. (This tip works
 with Microsoft Word 97, Word 2000, Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007.)</p>

            <p>Make sure that "Straight quotes with smart quotes" is enabled on the AutoFormat tab of AutoCorrect Options (not just AutoFormat As You Type), and then run AutoFormat on your document to correct them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, with this option selected on the AutoFormat As You Type tab, use Replace (Ctrl+H) to replace " with ". Word will automatically perform the correction.</p>
<p>Access both tabs with Office Button | Word Options | Proofing | AutoCorrection Options.</p>
<p>Running AutoFormat in Word 2007 and 2010 is not as simple as it was in previous versions, but you can add the AutoFormat command to your Quick Access Toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut Alt+Ctrl+K. If you search Help for AutoFormat, you'll get instructions
 for adding AutoFormat to the QAT. Or see <a href="http://bit.ly/wZ5WLW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/wZ5WLW</a>.</p>

<h2>            remote desktop won&#39;t allow login when a password has expired</h2>
                    <p>We have Mac clients connecting to our Server 2008 server using the Mac RDC client.&nbsp; The problem we have is this.&nbsp; We expire everyone's password every 42 days.&nbsp; If a Mac client does not log in and change their password manually before the expiration, they
 can no longer log in.&nbsp; Normally they should get a password has expired screen and be able to enter in a new password.&nbsp; This functionality&nbsp;appears to be&nbsp;missing in the Mac version.&nbsp; The windows client works correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This causes us a lot of support calls, since the only way to resolve this is to uncheck the "Must change password.." option and let them log in using their old password, and then get them to change it once they are logged in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a functionality problem, or are we doing something wrong.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think there is anything you can do differently in this instance that will be more efficient. The end-user can delete the network password file in the keychain access, but that will not make it any easier on support calls.</p>
<p>You can try the TechNet forums to see if there is anything else that can be done:</p>

<p>Hello Jacqui,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please open Outlook &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Search &gt; Indexing Options &gt; modify &gt; make sure Outlook is ticked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you check if it is marked for indexing, you should also try disabling and then re-enabling Outlook. To do so, follow these steps:<br />
Deselect Outlook from Indexing<br />
Close Outlook<br />
Wait 5 minutes, check in the task manager that Outlook.exe is not in the processes tab<br />
Open Outlook again and go back and select Outlook for indexing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try rebooting the computer to see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Alison</p>

<p>Hi Jacqui,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. For further help, I need more information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. May I know that what meaning of “solved it to some extent”? Can you search the result now?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Could you provide the version for your outlook? And what type of mail account you are using? Exchange account? Or others?<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can check you outlook’s version from following: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Could you provide a screenshot about error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Have you tried configure indexing options correctly, rebuild the search catalog or check your search scope?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If indexing seems to be stuck and is incomplete, you check from following: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2769651/outlook-search-returns-no-matches-found" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2769651/outlook-search-returns-no-matches-found</span></a></p>

<p>Hi Richard, When I deselected outlook from indexing then reselected it the search function worked very slowly and the error said there was a problem with the search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 365 proplus V1705 build 8201.2193. All my e-mail accounts are set up as POP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I cant provide a screed shot of the error message as it no longer appears.</p>
<p>I rebuilt the indexing and it is showing as indexing complete. Now I am back to no results in the search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now delected outlook in indexing options again, and reselected it. I still get no results. I am going to reboot the computer to see if that helps.</p>

<p>Hi Jacqui,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information, we will appreciate it if you can share your update after rebooting computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this issue still persist after rebooting your computer, you can try to search by using Advanced find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5f2141f-dc2e-4e40-a56b-28307e5d9e94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5f2141f-dc2e-4e40-a56b-28307e5d9e94" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If can also try to search emails from different scope like: current folder, subfolders, current mailbox, all mailbox, all outlook item. Because we need to check whether it has problem with different scope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/880cc390-6734-4a20-b12a-c3acfb2a55a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/880cc390-6734-4a20-b12a-c3acfb2a55a8" /></a><br />

<h2>            My subject title keeps on adding &#91;spam-imap&#93; to the subject title to certain incoming emails</h2>
                    <p>I am using outlook on macbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My outgoing mail are fine, I can see from their reply that included the original message that it appears as&nbsp;<strong>"Subject:</strong>&nbsp;photos" on their side. But when they reply, it becomes "[Spam-IMAP] RE: photos" in the subject title when I receive it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also happens when the person email me first. I tried removing it, but when they reply me the subject title becomes the same again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incoming mail: "[Spam-IMAP] XXX"</p>
<p>Outgoing mail: "Re: XXX"</p>
<p>Incoming mail: "[Spam-IMAP] Re: XXX"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other examples of my incoming mail:&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Spam-IMAP] Re: Forward required document</p>
<p>[Spam-IMAP] RE: [Spam-IMAP] RE:&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Spam-IMAP] XXX</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I changed the subject titles into XXX and removed certain words as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching the web, but I did not get proper answers and I'm still not sure what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using my company mail server in outlook, and I configured it using IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They occur more often for emails with attachments, and also when people reply to me or fwd an email to me. They did not change the subject title at all when replying or fwding to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I would like to mention it does not occur for EVERY email with an attachment or RE: or FWD:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's getting really frustrating because I know they can see it too. I am wondering if it is an antivirus software on their side or outlook filters? Because I do not have any anti virus software on my macbook. The phrase is automatically added in my email
 subject titles, and I do not know why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new email address is out of the question as it is my work email address, you can't expect me to tell everyone of my contacts I changed my email.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Kin TwoM - Recognition Issues w&#47; Zune Software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pontiacdream  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kin TwoM - Recognition Issues w&#47; Zune Software</h2>
                    
<p>I am having trouble syncing my Kin TwoM with the Zune software on my computer.&nbsp; When I plug the phone into the computer using the usb cable that came with the phone, I hear the Windows sound indicating that a portable device has been detected.&nbsp; I also hear
 the phone make the noise indicating that it is hooked up to a charging port (and in the lower right hand corner of the display, the battery crossed with a electrical plug shows up).&nbsp; A moment after I plug in the phone, the Zune software starts up automatically.&nbsp;
 The "Connected (unlock to disconnect)" message also shows up in the center of the phone display.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, once the Zune software comes up, it does not show a device connected.&nbsp; In the lower left hand corner, where it shows the little Zune / device icon, it merely shows a grey outline.&nbsp; When I go to click on it, it says "No device connected."&nbsp;
 When I go to the device settings, it tells me to connect a device.</p>
<p>So for some reason, everything seems to be working except for the Zune software here.&nbsp; I've gone to the device manager and it shows that the Kin (listed under "portable devices") is working properly.&nbsp; I've tried restarting both my computer and the Kin, and
 reinstalling the Zune software, all to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, the Zune software suddenly, after a long while of not detecting the Kin, brings up the screen where I am supposed to name my Kin.&nbsp; Ostensibly this is the Zune software finally noticing my phone.&nbsp; However, when I type in a name and press "Next,"
 the software freezes.&nbsp; It seems as though the Zune software takes forever to recognize the Kin, and then the software freezes as soon as, or shortly after, it does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at a real loss here.&nbsp; I'm very frustrated, because I have pictures and video on my phone that I want to put on my computer.&nbsp; One of the reasons I chose to get this phone was because of the camera and video quality.&nbsp; I would be extremely frustrated if
 it proved impossible (or even just an incredible hassle) to get pictures and video from the phone onto my computer.</p>
<p>FYI, My computer's operating system is Windows XP Home Edition 2002 Service Pack 3.</p>

<p>So, half an attempted answer, half a similar question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am considering getting a Kin (Twom) myself. I was on the phone with Verizon the other day trying to get them to advance my upgrade date, and the representative launched into a shpeel about the Kin (he presented is as his own experience, but I think it
 was really something like a memo Verizon put out). He said that the Kin has basically been 'abandoned' by Sharp and Microsoft. As such, there would be no software/firmware updates. Relatedly, he said that the Kin would not sync music or pictures using the
 Zune software.</p>
<p>This struck me as really odd, since I had seen forum discussions where people had no problems (posting mostly in Nov/Dec 2010). That comment along with this question makes me wonder if there has been an update of the Zune software that makes it incompatible
 with the firmware version on the Kin. If so, are there older versions of the software available?</p>
<p>Are these issues related, or no? If I am right, are there any work arounds? Given that I don't really need Zune Pass or anything like that, I don't see why some version of the Zune software couldn't be made to work just as far as interacting with the device.
 . .</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone who can help</p>

<p>I have had my Kin TwoM about a week now. I really like it, but it takes getting used to. GREAT VIDEOS!</p>
<p>As far as my experience is concerned, I downloaded Zune software, went thru settings, plugged the phone in, and<strong>it syncs all videos and pics easily</strong> . Videos downloaded to PC in My Videos Folder and into a Zune subfolder. Pics download into
 My Pictures Folder and into a subfolder I designated. So I don't know why you might be having a problem.</p>
<p>One quirk to note: I took my videos in the vertical phone position, and all my vids on the PC are sideways and I can't figure out how to rotate them so that they play vertically. Maybe you must take all videos in the phone's horizontal orientation to begin
 with so they play upright on the PC.</p>
<p>Also, for indoors, I used the night setting and the saved videos have more than adequate lighting.</p>
<p>Also, my verizon customer service guy was very helpful and told me to try to read as many online forums about the phone as possible. He was a fan of them but noted they are more difficult to get the hang of because they are different.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. Have you been able to load music onto it from your computer as well?</p>
<p>I just have a hard time making sense of the customer service response I got. It is one thing to say "Verizon does not guarantee that this will work," and another thing entirely to say "this does not work." I suppose I will call again and see if I get a different
 response from a different agent. The Zune functionality is the major draw (obviously), so this is make or break for my decision about whether to get one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the threadjack, Pontiac, if it turns out your problem is unrelated . . .</p>

<p>Make another Verizon Customer Service call and try someone different. I know that it works with pics and videos. And I added a pic to the phone by dragging it to the phone icon.</p>
<p>From what I understand from reading is that the Kin TwoM is as good as a Zune mp3 player and that it syncs with Zune software on your computer. I don't have a Zune Pass account. I downloaded the current Zune software. Pay attention to the settings. There
 are many options. It's as much trial by error as anything else because there's not a lot of support. I can see why Verizon can't guarantee that someone else's (MS's) "outside" software will work. MS Studio was suspended so that is not an option.</p>

<p>I don't know if this was a fluke or not, but I went from no connection whatsoever with my Kin TwoM on my laptop running Vista, to full connectivity after doing a couple of steps. When I first downloaded the Zune software, it was version 4.7. After loading
 it on my computer, and hooking up my Kin TwoM, the driver download icon spun for about a minute and failed to load. My device manager told me there was a problem with the phone's driver. After trying several of the proposed solutions with no luck, I downloaded
 Zune software version 4.0 from a site I found on Google. It actually was labeled on the site as version 2.5, but 4.0 is what ended up downloading (go figure). I installed that version (after uninstalling 4.7), connected the phone, and the driver set up in
 about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>So now my computer could see the phone but according to the Zune software, there was no "Zune" connected. Zune then requested that I do an update, so I gave it a try. The update went all the way to the final 5%, then said there was an error with a language
 pack, and quit. It not only quit, but seemed to completely remove version 4.0 from the computer. As a final option before having to decide whether to eat the ridiculous $35 restocking fee and get an LG Octane instead, I re-downloaded and installed Zune software
 4.7. I then re-connected my phone, and everything worked swimmingly.</p>

            Don't use a front panel USB connection... it's like an extension and makes the USB cord too long. (Like with a lot of USB devices) Tr using a USB port on the back of the pc and you should have great results and love using the Kin Twom.

            Use KinO instead of Zune. &nbsp;It works great!

            It might be possible that the sparklines are not already loaded if your print starts.<br />
<br />
I've had a similar problem:<br />
- My WorkBook loads an AddIn within Workbook_Open<br />
- The AddIn copies a picture from an image control within a sheet in the Addin into an image control in a sheet in the WorkBook.<br />
<br />
ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.TrayIcon.Picture = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Syntax").TrayIcon.Picture<br />
<br />
<br />
My solution is simple, I've placed the line in a seperate Sub LoadIcon, and I call this sub with
<br />
&nbsp; Application.OnTime Now + TimeSerial(0, 0, 1), "LoadIcon"<br />
<br />
Try the same with your print routine.<br />
<br />

<p>Do you remember making any changes to your account, like renaming it? Because if you renamed your account to @outook.com, your old account will become the alias of it.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>You can use your alias to send and receive emails but can't use as account log in. You need to access your new account in order for you to use or access that alias or to access that Portfolio tracker.</span></p>

<h2>            Nokia Asha 305- trouble under call history</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Team members,</p>
<p>Recently I have purchased a Nokia Asha 305 phone and updated with laterest version available in November,2013.</p>
<p>However, I am facing the following problems under call history:</p>
<p>1.All calls appeared under one list. If it is divided into received, Dialled and unanwsered is much easy. The same facility available in the previous versions. I do not know it is not available this series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.I am unable to choose the number from the call history list and select the option I want. For example to call, delete, save or send sms. When I tried to select, it is dial the number, nothing else available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.In the caller History, When I dial a number when it is busy, the number is appeared again and again. So it is pull down all the numbers down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.If I want to delete a selected (still I can't select) number, I could't. System ask to delete all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am really upset because of this. I choose the Nokia, because I use the same and familier the system.</p>
<p>But, the laterest version do not have the functions which were available in the previous phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody tell me how can I over come this problem? or if I choose the Nokia suit, this facilities will be updated?</p>

<p>Hi sivaear,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!&nbsp;:Cool:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do apologize for all the inconvenience that you are experiencing right now with the phone. For your first question, we apologize about the logs on your phone. However, this is already a default that we have in this series of devices and there is no way
 that we can change it. For your second question, pressing a certain number will surely just activate the voice calls for it. If you want to have some options for that number, you need to tap and hold the number itself and you will be able to see there the
 options like deleting the number, editing the number, etc. The same thing goes for the third question that you have. You just need to tap and hold the number while you are in the "Logs" tab so that options will be shown from there. About your last question,
 you need to tap and hold the number on the phone for you to delete it from the list. If you select the "trash bin" icon from the top right of the screen, it will only ask you to delete everything from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this answer everything that you have in mind. Feel free to post more if you have other queries so that we can further assist you with that.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Works 9 word processor can&#39;t use different header for first page</h2>
                    I found how to edit page headers and footers. I found the check-box to have no header, or no footer on the first page. How do I make the header on the first page different from the other pages? The document I am working on requires the first-page header
 to consist only of a word count. My old word processor was Word 2002, and it could do this. Since switching to a new computer with Windows 7 and Works 9, I can't find any option for this at all.

<p>The task of having different headers for the first page and a different one for other pages is possible with Word by using a section break. In Works you don’t have section break, we have only page break. Unfortunately we won’t be able to perform the task
 of having different header and footer with Works.</p>
<p>Refer the link which mentions that the section break is converted to page break:-</p>

    <title>Ovi maps 3.03 no A-GPS or network positioning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silviuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ovi maps 3.03 no A-GPS or network positioning</h2>
                    
<p>I have installed the latest firmware on my E52 (v031.012) and the latest Ovi maps v3.03. Since, I haven't managed to find my position by using either A-GPS or by the cell that I was in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Ovi maps that I had before, the phone was able to position me on the map, based on the gsm/3g cell that I was in in a matter of seconds. Also, it was able to get a GPS fix in a few tens of seconds, probably based on A-GPS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the GPS positioning is very slow and working only in open air. Does anybody have a solution to this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, using just the gps and not AGPS is a bit slow, it takes a bit of time, with the Agps using the network it is much faster&nbsp; and locks it down even if you are indoors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well I think a GPS system is meant for out doors really, and the building materials could block out the satellite signal within the house.</p>

<p>Right, that's what A-GPS is for. But i feel that it doesn't work anymore. While the download indicator in Ovi maps shows about 10-50 KB downloaded, the phone cannot position itself on the map, not even based on his cell range, as it did before the software
 update. With the old firmware and maps versions, I was able to position myself in a matter of seconds, even in my appartment, at 1st floor in a 10-floors building surrounded by other 10-floors buildings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I said open space for the GPS to work, I really ment true open space, like in a park or place, not on a street with lots of tall buildings on the sides, as it worked before.</p>

<p>I thought the indicator in Ovi Maps was just for map data being downloaded. Not for positioning data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you sure AGPS is selected as part of the positioning methods?</p>

<p>Just cross check that under&nbsp;&nbsp; GPS DATA&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;OPTIONS&gt;&gt;POSSITONING&nbsp; METHODS all the 3 settings are ticked other than the Bluetooth GPS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should fix the AGps, It takes a while to lock in but once it does it stays.</p>
<p>Also check the POSITIONING SERVER OPTION</p>

<p>It looks like your device is oke. Weather conditions and sattelite position can also be an issue. The more sattelites it finds the better your resolution (5-10meter). The server address should be -&gt; supl.nokia.com.</p>

<p>Haven't tried the Ovi Maps 3.04 beta yet. But I believe the Network/Wi-Fi may be the new positioning method added by 3.04 beta.&nbsp; I read some posts from the Nokia Beta Labs discussion and it seems the Network/Wi-fi may not be that accurate (well, at least
 if you're in an enclosed building where A-GPS/Network positioning can't even get inside that building, and that building has wifi-inside, it may try to guess your approximate location via the wifi network you're connecting (well, that's how I understand it
 anyway -- much like how Google Maps "My Location (beta)" guesses your approximate location -- can be pretty accurate or very general, as in "your approximate location within 18,000 meters")</p>

<p>I have a 5800 with A-gps, gps integrado y Network based options checked. The N5800 is much slower at finding me with Nokia Maps than with Google maps which uses the network to find me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My position server is h-slp.mnc019.mcc214.pub.3gppnetwork.org</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a better server? Can the Nokia phone use the google service somehow?</p>

    <title>Tasks not storing to Exchange Online when flagged for follow up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tasks not storing to Exchange Online when flagged for follow up</h2>
                    <p>I have a client that has O365 and uses Microsoft's online Exchange servers. The issue we have is with flagging for follow up. If a message is flagged for follow up, it does not always replicate to the Exchange server. This is something we have seen with
 both local copies of Outlook (one local copy on her PC, one on mine, new profiles, new OST, full repairs, reinstall Windows, as well as being present on her old PC, the whole shebang) as well as on the O365 OWA. It's inconsistent in its performance. Most times
 it will correctly create a task when something is flagged for follow up. When anything is flagged for follow up on a local copy of Outlook 2016, it will occasionally just vanish, and the item that was flagged will show "Flagged for recipient" whereas for OWA,
 the task vanishes to never been seen again, and the item flagged for follow up shows no flag at all. Similarly, items that were flagged for follow up in Outlook 2016 that show "Flagged for recipient" in Outlook, show no flags for follow up in OWA.&nbsp; The item
 simply never becomes flagged for follow up on the server, and it's simply random when it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This client is the only individual that has this issue, and through all our troubleshooting over the past few months, we're 100% certain that the issue is with the mailbox on Exchange Online.&nbsp; The only solution we've been able to find for this user would
 be to backup her mailbox to a PST file, destroy the current mailbox, create a new one, and then restore from PST. Which my user, of course, finds unacceptable. This has been the only solution we have found with other people who have experienced this apparently
 very rare issue.&nbsp; Is this the one and only solution? Are there actually no alternatives?</p>

<p><span>Hi Andrew,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever tried to fix the issue with the Microsoft support and recovery assistant for office 365 tool? I suggest that download and run it on the user’s PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it doesn’t help, please try to repair the pst file as the following article shows to see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify if the issue is related to her office 365 account exchange online service, I suggest that add the use’s account in another computer and check if the issue
 persists.</span></p>

<p>If you've read what I've already posted we've done all that already...<br />
<br />
The issue is persistent across 3 computers, one of which has had the OS reinstalled, as well as on OWA. This was included in the original post. There is absolutely no reason that a moderator should be unable to be bothered to read an ENTIRE post and then have
 the audacity to tell me to do what I've clearly stated I've already done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not an Outlook issue, but an issue with her mailbox on the Exchange Online servers. I just need to know if there is an alternative to wiping out her mailbox and starting her over. It is NOT a local Outlook issue.

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your updating. We fully understand your concerns, and according to your description, you have confirmed this is not an Outlook client issue and is related to the Exchange Online server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this situation, to narrow down the issue, I need to check if you are using some special environment like ADFS or others. If you are not sure, please contact the Office 365 admin to confirm if they are installing and configuring Windows Server Active
 Directory Federation Services (AD FS) for use with Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, in order to find a more suitable workaround for you, I would like to collect following information:</p>
<p>1.Please provide us the affected tenant information in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
private message</a>. </p>
<p>2.You mentioned this issue persists in 3 computers, please provide us screenshots of Outlook version information in three computers. See: File &gt; Office Account &gt; About Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding and cooperation is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<p>Thank you, but no. The issue is with the mailbox on Exchange online. It happens in OWA, it happens in Outlook, it's happened on my PC, on her new PC, and her old PC. It's happened even after reinstalling the OS on her new and old PCs. We've downloaded and
 installed Office a total of over 5 times, across 3 computers, two of which had to have the OS reinstalled.</p>

</p><p>It's not an Outlook problem. It's a problem with the <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>MAILBOX</strong></span></em>. There have been other people who have had this issue, and there only resolution has been to destroy the mailbox and rebuild
 it. I had hoped that reaching out to a Microsoft forum someone would know an alternative fix. It's a known issue to occur with Exchange Online mailboxes, albeit very rare, and your flagrant denying that it exists is beyond rude.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had hoped that someone within this community would have an alternative method to "reset" the mailbox without destroying all it's information, clearly this is not the case, since you keep deflecting the issue back to Outlook (never mind the fact that the
 EXACT same thing happens on OWA, or on 3 different PCs, and for several months and several different versions, nor that it's done it for the entire life of the mailbox. Nope, clearly a Outlook issue.).</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We totally understand your concerns. For resetting mailbox, there is no an alternative method to expect importing the PST file and create a new profile in Outlook. Regarding this, we can try our best to focus on your issue. Since we cannot reproduce this
 issue in our side and it does may be related to the user mailbox, it’s better if we can collect the information of the affected user and tenant in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
private message</a>. So that we can further analyze and check if there is a suitable workaround for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about “Sometimes, tasks not storing to Exchange Online when flagged for follow up.”. I understand you mean when you set follow up for some emails, you cannot see them under Task? If I have any misunderstanding about it, please provide detailed
 symptom of this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, regarding "Flagged for recipient" what you mentioned in your initial post, may I know if you are means when you composing a new email message, you click on the Follow Up button and select Flag for Recipients and click Send button?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's the mailbox on the exchange server... Rebuilding the Outlook profile will not fix the issue. Please stop responding to this as you clearly have no idea what the topic is about through your repeated disregard of the subject. It's a problem with the exchange
 online mailbox. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made it clear to you numerous times through private messages and through here that the issue is with the exchange online mailbox. Literally all I need to know is if there is a way to reset the mailbox on the exchange server without destroying it.
 How can it be so difficult for "Yes, you can reset the mailbox by doing..." or "No, your only option is to destroy the mailbox on the server and rebuild it."?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said. I desire no further troubleshooting on this thread. I sincerely wish that there was a way to report the Microsoft Agents who adamantly
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>refuse</strong></span></em>&nbsp;to provide actual assistance when it is needed such as you have...</p>

<h2>            ms access 2010 - searching for specific values within all queries&#39; sql at once</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm working on restoring a legacy, undocumented MS Acces 2010 database and application built on top of it.</p>
<p>We have 150+ query objects (mixed types), and in a few have found some critieria values that need to be updated to more current code# values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a utility or function in Access, that can be used for searching all 150+ queries for as specific string value?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the equivalent of what was provided in the Search - Entire Project function, for the VBA code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are providing referrals to external tools or add-on solutions, that are not included as part of base MS Access 2010, then please indicate that is the case clearly, and not just a link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA, and much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for code snippet.&nbsp; Will try out the next time the need arises.</p>
<p>We resolved the need this time already, by reviewing all our queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am curious, is there an equivalent to doing the same for querying and then being able to export all Report Layout objects, to look for a certain string value?</p>
<p>
</p><p>would it be the exact same code as above, but with these replacements?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Or..... is there a Search (or Find) function available in Database Documenter tool, that is somewhere AFTER the results are generated within it?&nbsp; I didn't see one.&nbsp; In the generated view, there is a control in the footer, for paging.&nbsp; There is also
 a control in the footer, for filtering, but it's greyed out and can't be used.&nbsp; Can that greyed out Filter function in the output somehow be enabled?</p>

<p>My first reply of using a new function allows you to view all of the SQL properties of your queries which should provide table and field names. You can copy and paste the query results into Excel or Word and then search the text for whatever values you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks dhookom</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the entire sequence of actions needed, is to do a combination of these 4 actions, to get what I was asking about, to see criteria values set in SQL statements, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. create and setup, debug, and test and successfully run a new customized VBA function, to populate mssysobjects (?)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; create and setup and then run succesfully, a new query to read those now populated mssysobjects</p>
<p>3. then use the Database Documenter functions already found in Access to generate an output list, which Access doesn't provide built in functions to search against</p>
<p>4. then export output from Database Documenter function out to another external application, in order to be able to use that tool's Search/Find function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I get all the steps, and in the right order?</p>

    <title>Can I create an event that recurs fortnightly in the calendar on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil.mc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I create an event that recurs fortnightly in the calendar on Outlook.com&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm currently trying to create a calendar via the services on Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to add an event that recurs on a fortnightly basis (i.e. every 14 days)?</p>
<p>I only seem to be able to find options for events to recur once, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My entire working life is based on a two-week rota, so if the calendar can't do this I'll need to find a different online calendar that I'm able to sync with my Windows Phone 8. Can anyone suggest a calendar that would work? I understand that the Google
 calendar doesn't work any longer, or soon won't be supported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neil.</p>

            <p>Hi Team, the reason Neil is asking the question is because the if you follow your instructions &amp; try to set the "How often" feature to "weekly", then set repeat to every 2 weeks you then get asked to nominate a day of the week which is logical for weekly
 but self defeating for a 14 day cycle once it clicks over to the following month because the day nominated won't correlate with the 14 day cycle ie. your instructions as I understand them don't work unless there's something unseen that happens to make the
 adjustment. I have the same requirement as Neil so please advise. Cheers Johnny</p>

            <p>Actually its reasonably straightforward: Add a new appointment. </p>
<p>In 'Repeat' first select the day of the week it needs to occur. </p>
<p>(The Repeat box will show the day you selected.) </p>
<p>Now select the 'Repeat' drop down list again and select 'Other...' </p>
<p>Here you can see the 'Every' box: enter 2 into for fortnightly meetings.</p>

            Can't you just go to the folder for each particular album and change the pictures there for a bigger picture using the same name. They're only .jpg pictures. By the way all my music has the 200 x 200 and always has. I don't think there ever was an 800

            <p>When you open a notebook on OneNote for Mac it automatically starts to sync all the contents locally so that you can work offline. If you click the arrow beside the notebook name on the notebook list you can see the last time the notebook finished fully
 syncing. You should be able to work offline and when you come back online your changes with sync.</p>

            <p>Is it really impossible, in OneNote for Mac, to create a notebook and keep it local?</p>
<p>Word and Excel do not have this problem.</p>
<p>But on OneNote when you click the list to select where the notebook is to be stored, the list only offers OneDrive.</p>
<p>If this is by design, it is a really bad policy choice.</p>
<p>Because it means even encrypted notebooks would go into the cloud, and the encryption is only 128-bit.</p>

    <title>Locked out of Skype account with credits, recovery keeps failing after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chai ozeri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of Skype account with credits, recovery keeps failing after providing all information</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've purchased 10$ of skype credits a few months ago.</p>
<p>I log into my skype account only once every few weeks. The last time I tried to log in, a prompt saying "it looks like someone is using your account" appeared. It suggested that I'll recover my account.</p>
<p>I've signed to Skype many years ago (over 10 years ago). Skype have never asked me to update my details, nor to replace my password, even when I first purchased credits, a few months ago.</p>
<p>It asked me an Email address to send the recovery link to, however, the Email I've registered with is no longer available (for a long long time).</p>
<p>Then, it suggested I'll fill a Microsoft account recovery form online. In the recovery form it requested many details from me, such as:</p>
<p>* Whether I've purchased Skype credits, the amount and the date of purchase</p>
<p>* The credit card I used to purchase the credits</p>
<p>* Numbers I called using this credits</p>
<p>* My birth date</p>
<p>* Contacts in my skype acount</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've answered the above answers precisely, and even checked for some of the facts using information I had (such as date of purchase).</p>
<p>However, Microsoft sent me an Email that the information was reviewed, and that there was not enough information provided to identify it's me. Look at all the information above I've provided! There's not a single question I've been asked and was unable to
 answer. Microsoft have also advised that the best thing I can do right now, is to send another account recovery form (no further contact information provided). I've done that again after checking and improving some of the facts provided, and got the same reply.</p>
<p>After the 3rd attempt (and definitely an attempt with perfectly accurate information provided by me), I've received a mail that since I had multiple failed recovery attempts, all I can do is open a new Microsoft account. Again, no further contact information
 supplied, and I was told not to reply to the mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>1. Isn't it ridiculous that things like credit card number and more information aren't enough to recover my account? I've most definitely provided more information than the "current user".</p>
<p>2. I don't really care about the account, I want my credits back. After the first mail, Microsoft stated the account was blocked because of my request, "until they can verify that I'm the account owner". So the credits are locked anyway (if somebody hasn't
 used them already). I think it will make sense to refund them to the credit card that purchased the credits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also think that Microsoft were&nbsp;Negligent for not asking me to update my Email or update my (very old, 6 digit) password, especially once I've purchased credits (I have no idea this is the mail address in my account- I haven't used it in over 10 years,
 and there's not a single account I'm using that hasn't requested to verify it since, except for Skype, of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what I can do? It's a really annoying situation and there's no address I've found I can contact.</p>
<p>I've opened a new account specially to ask this question here, so a response will be highly appreciated :)</p>

<p>Hi Allen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar problem. In fact, I had to open another account just to post on the forum. I have had my account for about 12 years with no problems. After logging in on my updated phone app, I came back to my computer and discovered it thought someone
 else was using my account. Went through the online verification (three times), provided fully correct information every time and was eventually told I had tried too many times and was locked out of account recovery! Not sure why this is happening but am finding
 this process very frustrating. Any advice? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot contact Support because it simply directs me to go through the online recovery process!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Tony</p>
<p>

<p>I'm having the same issue…locked outside the skype and there is no way to get rid of this endless looping.</p>
<p>I can see the hackers email, I received some emails from microsoft telling me of the actions that were been doing, such as my phone number was deleted from my own account, and even another user was added to my skype account.</p>
<p>I can't log in, … just canceled my credit card to avoid furhter problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's ridiculous that i can't get in touch with a person on the support to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please some SOUL help us</p>

<p>I tried everything, had two useless chat sessions, but dropped by both of them. I have given up and since the card originally used is no long live, they can't continue to charge me. I lost the $21, but that's better than having to deal with this awful site

<p>Same here too seems like there is a problem in my opinion with the accuracy of the data held by ms and the robot they use to parse it, i mean come on its microsoft right none of use expect them to actually do anything correctly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point the support is A1 waste of space and effort and may as well not be there at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure is A1 useless and i am seriously thinking about how i can take a legal fight in order to get my data back as i am being told to create a new account and based on the fact that MS has never forced me or informed my via skype to update this information
 then its on them in my opinion!</p>
<p>

<p>I am having the same problem. I was locked out because i was travelling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>reached dead end of recovery; i have had account for over ten years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have: </p>
<ol>
<li>the only two numbers i have contacted for a year, my parents and one number in china while i was travelling.</li><li>the credit card number, date, and amount of last deposit</li><li>the correct password</li></ol>
<p>This should certainly be enough to remove the block incurred while i was abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There needs to be a process to advise that i will be in a new location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been advised by chat to contact my bank to recover the funds. ha.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is a specific file that encounter this problem, if it's convenient for you, please send us a copy via
<a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fanswers.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fprivatemessage%2Finbox%3Ftm%3D1538545670395&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C96f41a5c7b8844ee710e08d629a99827%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636742205698906137&amp;sdata=dc3totcu6TuIJ6XOU6etjQ3tWLJ6q0OXTRqWmjTG8VU%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi nguyenalex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a tricky issue.</p>
<p>Since you have already tried to open this presentation on another PC and the other Office Online products are working fine. Please try login in
<a href="https://office.live.com/start/PowerPoint.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PowerPoint Online</a> in a private mode and new a presentation and check the result. If you can new a presentation, I think we can narrow down the issue on the files.</p>
<p>If when you login in this site with your work account, it's also blank. Since PowerPoint Online is free to every user, you can sign in with your personal Microsoft account and see the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it turned out to be a file related issue. It would be a great help if you can provide us a sample presentation that can't open in PowerPoint Online via
