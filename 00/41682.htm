    <title>XboxOne Rant - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XboxOne Rant</h2>
                    
<p>Figured I'd at least give forewarning that this is a rant.</p>
<p>I've been an xbox fan for years, but I'll go ahead say that all the launch games suck except for NBA2k14. And even that game is starting to suck because it seems to have more issues each day. As of right now, after having this console since the launch, I'm
 pretty disappointed. The controller does seem better, but I don't know if it's the material it's made out of or what, but it feels cheaper than the 360 controller. If I'm paying $60 dollars for a controller, it should at least feel like it's not going to break
 if I drop it on my carpet floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you go on IGN to read up on XboxOne news, you really don't read too much news, unless it's about something on the 360, most of it is pretty old news pertaining to the XboxOne. One of the top stories is XboxOne Vs. PS4, that's been up there for months
 it seems. Or perhaps you'll read about how many consoles they've sold up to this point in time, [Mod Removed] good for you Microsoft. I mean there really isn't much news to report on besides how bad the console blows and how bad the games blow. But I guess
 they aren't allowed to post articles like that because I've never seen them. They did feature a story about how NBA2k14 has had it's struggle on the new console, but there hasn't been much follow up on that and they continue to have issues. At least make your
 news stories productive.</p>
<p>At this point, I feel like I would've been happier with a PS4.&nbsp;But, who knows, maybe once better games come out and once/if they correct all these ticky tacky issues, it'll seem like a better console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think your points are very fair, sir.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm so underwhelmed by the improvements in the XB1 that I was driven away from it completely... I bought an XBOX 360. Games that suck and are ridiculously expensive to boot? No thanks. I'm enjoying my 360 for half the price, and games for 1/4 the
 price in most cases.</p>
<p>You say you "would've been happier with a PS4." That may still be true, but I think more importantly, you "would've been happier just sticking with your 360."</p>

            <p><strong>There are some valid points there, though saying a game "sucks" is more of an opinion piece, rather than a fact about the game. I'll admit that there aren't too many launch titles that have WOW'd me, but they aren't necessarily bad games.<br /><br />The biggest thing to remember is that just because it's a next-gen system, doesn't mean that we'll immediately be seeing next-gen content. I think as time goes on (much like with the 360 when it first launched), you'll see a great improvement in game titles, apps, services, etc. They have already addressed many of the concerns people have with the new console's system/dashboard, and hopefully we see some major improvements there in the next few updates as well. &nbsp;I can honestly say that the issues and concerns people have ARE being heard, and ARE being passed onto the powers that be.<br /><br />The other thing to keep in mind is that the 360 isn't dead to Microsoft. They are continuing to put out game content and apps for that system to

<p>I think that the XBOX One was just rushed out. but since it is next gen, like all gens I have seen, it will get better. the xbox one is a big console, so that means theres a lot of stuff that can be in it to give it a lot of potential. look at the 360, it
 evolved through time. the ps3, I have 3 ps3s, the first gen, the 3rd gen, and the 4th gen, and they all work the same since they launched. I have them for the blueray player, that's why I have so many, the point is, they all work the same way. and the newer
 they get, I personally feel the easier it is for them to break. the 360 on the other hand, its always done more than gaming. and when the xbox one was launched, I expected it to be laggy, but it wasn't. I guess my point is, the xbox one, given time like the
 360 was given time, it will be the console that Microsoft had the vision on. the console that would the One thing you turned on when you went to your living room. of coarse with the cable you still need your cable box but still, you can work it from your xbox
 one. </p>
<p>I do think that the forza 5 is a little rubbish compared to forza 4 though, the other games are cool, but the games are the games, some games will suck, some will be great. I just don't think the forza 5 deserved to be one of the games for the xbox one.
 the 360 is at its ultimate peak right now, so if it goes, I will be supermad. I have 2 360s now, and a few new games, and if the xbox one is not able to play or at least allow me to download the games that I have, I would even pay for some of them again, then
 I am in no rush to get the xbox one. but its still a solid device though, and its just going to get better. the 360 has so many things on that thing &nbsp;that I could just sit down and do things on it all day with out even playing a game and be having a blast,
 heck I can even order pizza from my xbox now, that's awesome. so look at all the things the 360 can do now from the time it launched, then look at the xbox one does now, and know that this is just the beginning.</p>

<h2>            How &#34;Quite&#34; Is The Xbox One X Supposed To Be&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How "quite" is the Xbox One X supposed to be? I have mine on it's stand placed on my desk, and I can hear the fans running. I can also faintly hear a low pitched humming noise. I just don't know if it's normal or not to be hearing this b/c I'm hearing people say that their Xbox One X is silent but I like I said, I don't know. Can anyone provide their experience with their Xbox One X&nbsp;and if your's is quiet or not please?</p>

<h2>            Screen Size locked at 112&#37; and can&#39;t reduce it further</h2>
                    After recent update, the lowest screen size is 112% and I can't reduce it to 100% so my screen is distorted.

<p>I'm referring to the standard screen nor the magnifire or zoom function (both which I checkled in vain efforts to fix or solve). When I go to 'Control Panel' and 'Display' the minimum size is 112%. This happened after a Windows update at the end of September
 2016. What I need is to be able to put my screen back to 100%. Thanks.</p>

            Thank you Micah Bat but this did not solve the problem. &nbsp;I did all the updates and each time was told that I had the most recent and best update. &nbsp;I also rebooted the system by my screen size remains at 112% without any ability to reduce it back to 100%.

            <p>Since updating the display driver didn't resolve your concern, we would suggest you to download the latest display driver from the manufacturer's website and then, install it to your device. To install it, kindly run the driver you have downloaded and follow
 the on-screen instruction. Be guided that before doing so, you need to uninstall first the driver&nbsp; by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Display</strong><strong> adapters.<br />

            My computer manufacturer says I have the most updated driver. So if I uninstall the driver I'll just end up with a blank screen. I know this because I did it and almost crapped my pants when I had zero display. Fortunately I restarted my computer it brought
 back the driver.

<div>I don't know if you went from 10130 to 10240 (release) and back to 8.1 or HOW</div>
<div>you went back to 8.1 or what you did as your description isn't very helpful.</div>
<div>Yyou probably should reimage your Surface from the downloadable recovery image</div>

<h2>            One of my keys types 2 characters every time.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
One of my keys is typing twice.&nbsp; It's the only one.&nbsp; I tested with another keyboard with same results.<br />
In DOS prompt, it doesn't occur.&nbsp; In Safe Mode, it also works fine!!!<br />
<br />
There is a glitch somewhere in Windows.&nbsp; Can you help!?!<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>If its fine in safe mode, then likely one of your startup/preinstalled programs is causing the issue and not win itself.</p>
<p>Try the<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> clean boot procedure</a> to identify the program causing the issue</p>

            Thank you for your prompt reply.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it still does it even in a Clean reboot environment.&nbsp; Could it be that the driver has been altered?&nbsp; If so, how do I reinstall?<br />

<p>In your reply I didn’t hear what happened to James’s idea to reinstall the driver and update the systems firmware. Please let me know about your keyboard driver and system updates and if that was any assistance.

<p>I get two characters in any language keyboard ( I tried many). I use the French Canadian Multilingual keyboard.<br />
<br />
So, here are the actual results: <br />
1) actual key (left square bracket): ^^<br />
2) shift + square bracket: ¨¨<br />
3) ctrl-alt square bracket: ``<br />
4) actual key (right square bracket): ç (yes, only once)<br />
5) shift+ right sqaure bracket: Ç (yes, only one)<br />
6) ctrl-alt right square bracket: ~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody can figure this one out.&nbsp; </p>

            Hi RobertHopper3.
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />To solve your problem you should try with:
<br />* Restart your pc:
<br />
<br />Restart the PC and then re-open Microsoft Edge. Select the Start button and then Start / Shutdown&gt; Restart. If you have pending
<br />* Windows updates, Update and restart will appear.
<br />Run Windows Update to help you solve problems by replacing obsolete files, updating drivers and correcting vulnerabilities.
<br />To check for updates, select the Start button, then Settings&gt; Update and security&gt; Windows Update and finally, Check for updates. If Windows Update says that the PC is updated, it means that you have all the updates.
<br />* Repair or Restart Microsoft Edge
<br />Repairing the browser will not affect anything, but the reboot will remove the history, cookies and settings that you might have changed. To find these options, select the Start button and then select Settings&gt; Applications&gt; Applications and features&gt; Microsoft Edge&gt; Advanced options.

<h2>            Premium Membership</h2>
                    I became a premium member some months ago so I would not have to look at commercials while playing games. However, in the last few weeks commercials have been appearing that say if you want this to end, click here and become a premium member. When I click
 it, it states that I already own this. The commercials and side ads don't come up all the time and sometimes I get premium bonus play and sometimes it is not offered. How can I fix this to end all the commercials all the time?&nbsp;

<br /> Try running the Store Apps troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Check if there's an Update for the game in Microsoft Store app, from the Settings at the top right ... three dots, then Updates.
<br />
<br />If not then try resetting the game at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Game Name &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Reset.  
<br />
<br />If those all fail then try uninstalling the game at the above location, restart PC, then reinstall it from Microsoft Store Settings &gt; My Library.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

So you want to access the internet from the Win 7 Pro PC through the Win 7 Start laptop with ICS?</p>
<p>If so that is not possible. Win 7 Starter edition can not be used as a ICS host computer by design...</p>
<p>Do you have an existing wireless router?</p>
<p>If so <em>Gordon's</em> advice is well taken. Purchase an inexpensive USB 802.11g/n adpater or connect the PC directly to the router via an Ethernet cable. Here are
<u>example</u> wireless USB adapters...</p>

            <p>The Files and Settings Transfer Wizard helps you move your data files and personal settings from your old computer to your new one, without having to go through much of the same configuration you did with your old computer. For example, you can take your
 personal display properties, folder and taskbar options, and Internet browser and e-mail settings from your old computer and place them on the new one. The wizard will also move specific files or entire folders, such as My Documents, My Pictures, and Favorites.
 Passwords are not moved with program settings when you use the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard. This is a feature of the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard that helps to keep your passwords confidential.</p>
<p>We recommend that you install a virus detection program on the new computer before transferring files over from the old computer. This can help protect your new computer from viruses that may be contained in the files transferred over from your old computer.</p>

<h2>            HP LaserJet 1022n not printing via Laptop. &#34;Error - Printing&#34;</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
I'm using an HP Probook 4530s. And for the past week have been trying to install a printer that i just bought. The name of the product is Hp Laserjet 1022n.<br />
Finally i was able to install the printer. But unfortunately it doesn't print anything. And after sending the command from my laptop, when i check the pending prints the print command is still there. BUt the status is "Error- Printing". Even the test page gets
 stuck.<br />
I have a genuine Windows Seven Home installed on my machine.<br />
I've tried using the same method of installation via The computers Add a Printer&gt;Control Panel and was able to install the printer on the Desktop. BUt unlike the Laptop, its prints.<br />
My problem is that i want to use the printer directly from my laptop and discard my desktop. Please help me resolve this issue. Thank You !

            Hello Amit,<br />
Thank you for responding and coming to my help. The USB connection driver didn't work. I kept facing the same problem over and over again. The driver never accepts the printer via USB connection.<br />
So i tried another way. I installed the driver via "Add a Printer" by going through Control Panel's Drivers and Printers.<br />
I was able to install the driver from there. As you can see in the following pictures. Now, shockingly even when i run the drivers setup the computer detects the printer and installs the drivers.<br />
<br />
But my problem still remains. Or atleast part of it does.<br />
Picture 2 shows the green check by the side of my printer. This is before sending the print command.<br />
<br />
once i send the print command via MS WORD or Notepad or Adobe Reader.... the command gets stuck, like in picture 1 and the error sign appears by the side of the printer as shown in picture 3.<br />
<br />
Hence the printer inspite of being installed, hasn't been able to print anything.<br />
This problem is only faced when a laptop is used. The printer prints using the same method via a Desktop.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31474693-47b3-4957-ac4c-fea7b762e189" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e154228b-8326-4ac7-aad4-650d1e3f32e5" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c29e3736-a6d0-4088-b759-4e12f13f49d9" />

<h2>            Run-time error &#39;4605&#39;&#58; This command is not available</h2>
                    I have Perrla for APA installed on my system. It has been working flawlessly for 2 years. Just recently installed an update for Perrla and am getting the above run-time error message.&nbsp; Geek Squad could not solve the issue.&nbsp; Advised it may have something
 to do with a <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">windows script</span></strong>.&nbsp; I've attempted to locate a fix but could only find a version for Windows 2000 and XP, but nothing for Vista.<br />
<br />
Perrla help site recommends:<br />
To reinstall your Windows Script, go to the following website:<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=c717d943-7e4b-4622-86eb-95a22b832caa&amp;displaylang=en
<br />
<br />
If you do not have Windows 2000 or XP, go to this site and follow the links. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/184739/EN-US/
<br />
<br />
I need help as my Perrla is not working properly and I need the program to complete my university papers.

<p>Hi ralph burroughs,</p>
<p>Do you have any previous versions of Turbotax installed on your computer?</p>
<p>If you have any previous versions of the software then I would suggest you to uninstall it and then check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>If that does not work you may copy the installation CD to your hard drive and then check if you can install it successfully.</p>
<p>You may try disabling the antivirus/firewall and check if it is working. If it works, please contact the security program manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p><em>Note: Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software’s after completing the troubleshooting and identifying the issue.</em></p>

<h3> rthbrady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Appears son is purchasing the same things over and over and my credit card is being charged</h2>
                    
<p>My son has an xBox 360 and he is using my account to play games since I do not know much about computers, and it appears he is purchasing the same things over and over and it is causing a lot of money to be deducted from my credit card.</p>
<p>I have a cousin who may be able to set it up so my son has his own account and cannot purchase anything without my approval, which he is going to help me in the next day or so with, but I was wondering, is there any way I can get the money back for the items
 he has purchased, if they are all the same things?</p>
<p>Any xBox support staff can look at my xBox profile and see the transaction history for this year and see what I am talking about.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;Unfortunately purchases are listed as non-refundable although, if you like, you can always try phone support. &nbsp;If you live in North America dial 1-800-469-9269.</p>
<p>What I would recommend for the time being is immediately remove your gamertag from the console so he can no longer purchase items from it. &nbsp;Otherwise, phone support can remove your credit card from the account as well.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;send to mail recipient&#34; error</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 7 Ultimate I've found the send to mail recipient option in the right click menu no longer works. I have set up my Gmail to work through the installed mail app but when I right click and select send to mail recipient
 I get the following error message </p>

<p>
</p><p>I've been to the default programs and set the mail app as default mail program but still keep getting the error message. Is the mail app installed with windows 10 not an email program?. Ive also been to the
<em><strong>"shell:send to"</strong></em> and dragged a link from the mail app into the folder but it still doesn't appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Classic Skype app is currently running on 7.41 version. To get the best Skype experience, my suggestion is to update your Skype app. Though, if
 the app is working fine on your end that’s okay. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how to disable automatic updates on the classic Skype app:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Go to
<strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> &gt; <strong>
Automatic updates</strong> click Turn off automatic updates. </span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.
</span></p>

<p>Thank you&nbsp;<span>Noevir_L,</span></p>
<p><span>I have already turned off Automatic Updates...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However I get an Opportunity pop up window that asks me if I want to allow Skype to Make changes to my computer... To which I answer No...</span></p>
<p><span>I then get a "Nag" opportunity Pop up window that Informs me that The Latest update for Skype is ready to install... do I want to Install and the Only negative opportunity is "Not Now" ....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I actually don't want the Update until I can be assured that I'm not going to lose all of the various "Contact List" groups that I have made to make life easier for me...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The first time I tried Windows 8 skype no longer had the ability to make sub Contact Lists and had a completely New Interface which I didn't like, which basically meant that I had lost a facility which
 had previously been separate from MS Windows, but which MS had made Non Functional, and I had the very dubious pleasure of having to Re-install many different Software Apps and try to find Old Passwords etc., etc., etc., I decided to stick with windows 7...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sometime later, I lost a hard drive and had to re-install everything anyway... So my IT Guru Loaded Windows 10... Same Problem with Skype... and even more problems with other software that Now had lost
 all relevance as it no longer worked because everything had to be Leased or Rented on a monthly basis from&nbsp; "The Cloud"... Not my style this "Never Never Own" business which keeps you tied to someones apron strings... Back I went, once again to Windows 7...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It might be time for MS to give it's customers a choice, don't you think?... Big Commercial Firms that are convinced they will be around in 10 years time and aren't afraid of losing all their Data on
 someone else's Server - "The Cloud", or, like has happened on numerous occasions already; sensitive Information has been Hacked and Lifted by Thieves from supposedly Secure Servers... Well, let them go with "The Cloud" solution... That's Basically where IBM
 was as The virtual Sole Player with Computers for Their Staff's use, way back when we started as "The Little Guys", using IBM clones which were the Cheap solution that IBM were convinced there was no Market for... Or, more likely, wanted to keep Computing
 Power out of The hands of the Proletariat, The common working guy or small businessman who had been squeezed out by Supermarkets and Big Chain Stores already...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes!... Well, how about it?... Is MS Hell bent now om doing what IBM failed to do?.... Or are they going to go back to their Roots, and start looking after The Little Guy again?... That's where they
 made their money?... Do they now think they can Desert their Base?...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Give us a Decent Choice to keep our own Data and Our Own Software and Not have to have GigaHertz Fibre Optic Connections up 100% of The time even if we're living in Darkest Africa at the
 end of a Copper twisted pair... What about the Undeveloped&nbsp;Nations?...&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please tell me how to stop the Nag screen coming up and also why Does Skype want to make changes to my Computer?.... Oh! I know!... That's how I got the The last Update that buggered everything
 up and I had to Roll Back that skype update and re-install the version I'm running now!... Yes The reason skype wants to make changes is because it obviously has to get rid of my choice to not have automatic updates!!... Well, maybe that's it!... Or maybe
 I was distracted by something else as my computer was rebooting? and Clicked on the Update Button instead of Not Now!...&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;I'm dreading that the same thing might happen again!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your help so far; it's good that you have answered the query, and hopefully my message about MS having Two Paths One For Big Business and Educational Institutions and the other for The Little
 Guy, like me... Hopefully we can get rid of that Query "Do I want to allow Skype to make changes to my computer" Pop up and also the Nag screen...</span></p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/fcfc3036-5d35-4d45-b4e2-6b1d880a81d1" title="PeterCullen-PGCGull">
<p>
</p><p>The Skype version you're using is indeed out of date. The new version of Skype for Desktop, Mac and Linux is
<strong>8.18</strong>, however, you can still install the classic Skype 7.41 and&nbsp;if you do not want to update Skype to 8.18 version, you can disable the automatic updates. But we cannot assure you that it will prevent the future updates in Skype, in the event
 you will receive notifications and prompts to update Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I suggest to uninstall Skype then install the classic Skype 7.41 version here:
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a> &gt; click the
<strong>v</strong> button then select <strong>Get classic Skype.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, updating the Skype version will not affect your contacts, I can definitely assure you that you will not lose any of your contacts. Just make sure that you sign in using the correct account, in most cases, users tend to use a different credential or
 provide their email address to sign in which cause the disappearance of their profile info and contacts. Please note that signing in using a Microsoft account is now possible due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the features in the classic Skype that are not present in the new Skype, we're already aware of those and we're working on updating the new Skype. Currently, if you wish to create 'contact groups', you can use the classic Skype, this option is not
 yet available in the new Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also take note of your comments, I'll forward it to our development team as feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

 where MS hides my Contacts and my contact lists The sub groupings within All Contacts that enable quick searching using the Old style of Filing That Humans use rather than the "Chuck it in The Bucket" style that makes the life of supposedly more intelligent
 "AI" computer systems with their limit of Binary at their Root Level on or off but never a "Maybe", which actually makes all the difference, but probably, if included as a possibility in answering questions, especially Multichoice, would put computer "AI"
 in the same quandary as Humans.... i.e. .. Not sure!.. Insufficient Data... Recognizing that fact of course makes for much slower decisions, but does have the advantage of not sending The World to War on False Evidence.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>But, enough of the Philosophy of "AI"...</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Information about where My Contact List and the Various Sub-contact Lists are stored would be good information to have once again... Just to make sure before I uninstall skype
 and go for the Classic Version.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>I would also suggest that MS/Skype makes a clear distinction in "English" between "All Contacts" , Contact List sub groupings for Filing and searching for particular types of
 Contacts... And of Course the further Sub Groupings from All Contacts that are used for Conference Calls of different Types.. i.e Different Projects that people may be working on or different groups of Friends or Family members that one may want to communicate
 with in a conference... Which is quite different from the Contacts sub lists that are used mainly for one on one Computer to phone or computer to computer individual private one on one conversations...</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Perhaps that is the problem with finding the solution to the restoring all possibilities to the latest MS Update... It isn't just a binary problem as the breakdown is three
 way?... Who knows?</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>That actually wa sthe biggest problem with understanding your Reply.... The problem at the moment is NOT a concern with Loss of ALL my contacts (Hopefully That will never be
 a Problem!)... The problem is with Losing The Sub-List of Contacts for searching in order to make one on one Calls to a Particular Bank or Engineer or... Whatever... I actually rarely use the Conference Call Facility at the moment though that could change
 if I decide to get Politicallyy active again...</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Thank you once again for your assistance; hopefully the distinction between the List groups is clear?</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>I look forward to your reply vis a vis the location of the "Contact Lists" of the various types.</span></p>

<p>Thanks Karen_E</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excuse me but... as I tried to explain, but maybe was not clear enough about... "contact group" does not cut it, as there are two different types of "contact groups" one that is a series of Contact lists containing the names of people that are say..."Family
 and Friends" which I use to select from to make phone calls to on an individual basis... Another Contact list might be "Bankers", which I use when I want to call a Bank Manager from say Westpac or The Commonwealth Bank or Barclays, once again on an Individual
 Basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Other type of "contact group", which is the one that MS/skype refers to in the update which installed itself and I explored before uninstalling it: This type of "contact group" is the type of "contact group" that is used for conference calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I, went, I thought, into great detail, in order to make the distinction... The reason Being that just being able to recover the "contact groups" from my Old Skype (When I install the new one that you are currently working on to solve this problem)...
 I snot enough if it just goes into a group that is usable only for "Conference Calls", which is the Type of Group that MS/Skype refers to whenthey say in the Blurb about the New Skype, that you can make your own groups for conference calls!</p>
<p>
</p><p>They do not mention and so far you haven't confirmed that you understand the Differentiation That I am trying to make!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please acknowledge and confirm that you understand that distinction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the file storage location of the Contact lists of the Two types that I have in my version of skype: Do you know where they are stored, and if you do or you can find out could you let me and others know where I can access them so that I have
 SAFE copies stored and know that whatever happens I can, if necessary restore them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is My Personal Data I do believe That it is best stored on my own Computer, although I do not object to MS storing it on Their Server, I believe it to be more secure on my own computer and backed up on an external drive Here at my home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem that you refer to with regard to different sign ons is known to me, and I have communicated with MS about it previously and recently noted a reply to that query which I sorted out by other means as the response didn't come to my attention...
 It was actually worse than just the Difference between signing on on a mobile phone and on a dsk top... The Problem was that Skype still worked with its own email and password for a long time... Then MS changed it so that signing in to Skype had to be the
 same as signing in to MS... which caused confusion if one was already logged in with Skype...MS made it appear that people had forgotten Their Password... If you changed your MS login email and Password Then Skype No Longer worked ... You couldn't sign in...
 A vicious Circle ensued... Until it became clear what was happening.... I sorted that one out!... Then came the Problem with Microsoft Outlook... Once again a problem with Passwords with the MS Servers for Email... Funny that was, because all the other Email
 addresses that I use from Google and from various Web Sites that I have email addresses associated with worked fine and outlook was picking them up without problems... Anyway once again it was a problem because of a changed Password for MS... That had to be
 changed... Why couldn't MS have made a reminder note with perhaps some instruction about reconfiguring the Email server logons?.... But never mind, all is now working fine... Fingers crossed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sooo, If you could just let me know where my Contact List is stored, and that you really do understand the distinction that I was making between the different types of "contact list groups", I will be really happy and we can call this issue closed...</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks again Karen_E,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes as I have stated previously, The version of Skype that I have that I posted previously is a "Classic Version" and everything is working I have all my Contact Lists up and Running!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thus do not want the Update as it doesn't have those Contact Lists, as you have stated, and as I have found out by bitter experience a number of times...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the moment I will stick with what I have and hope that MS soon finds out how to put the Old Contact Lists back Into The Updated but Downgraded Product....Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only question left outstandingly unanswered is: Where are the Various Contact Lists stored?... What is the Name of the File that they are stored in? ... and ... Where is that File Located?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem that it is now being stored on The MS Server or "The Cloud" by another Name... Since it is My Data, and I want it: Could you please tell me where it is? And If I don't have access to it on Your Server could you or one of your Technical Assistants
 please put it, and all of the Contact Lists into a Zip File and mail it to me? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Or... If that is not the case and it is still on my computer; please tell me where it is stored on my Hard Drive so that&nbsp; may Back it Up.</p>

    <title>How do I completely remove the windows update assistant&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcorolandi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I completely remove the windows update assistant&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, I have a windows 10 (home) PC that I use for unattended 3d rendering. Two days ago, during the night, windows killed an important job in order to install the windows creators update. It failed and erased the EFI partition in the process. I realised
 what happened only the day after, as the machine was unavailable on the network and it actually kept on resetting itself every 10 seconds. I managed to manually fix the EFI partition and got my PC running again but now every now and then, the update assistant
 tries again to download the upgrade and redo the process. How do I stop it?</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) killing the process through the task manager</p>
<p>2) disabling the windows update service</p>
<p>3) uninstalling the windows update assistant from the control panel</p>
<p>4) remove any scheduled task in the task scheduler</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it still happen. How can eradicate the offending service/app once and for all?</p>
<p>

wuapihost.exe<br />
wuauclt.exe<br />
wuaueng.dll<br />
wuautoappupdate.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could rename all of them by adding the string ".bad" to the end of their names. You can do it like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a bootable flash disk, using the command RecoveryDrive.exe. Do NOT copy the system files.</li><li>Use this disk to boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode.</li><li>Open a Command Prompt.</li><li>Find the Windows folder. It could be C:\Windows, D:\Windows etc. but it cannot be X:\Windows.</li><li>Rename the files.</li></ol>
<p>You might have to do the above both in the System32 and the SysWO64 folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If things backfire then you can repeat the above steps and undo the renames.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The renames are untried and pure guesswork.</p>

            BITS and Windows update services can be disabled by deleting their associated .dll files.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Open services through Task manager<br />
<br />
Find the BITS and wuauserv services and disable them<br />
<br />
Open windows\system32\<br />
<br />
Find qmgr.dll and wuaueng.dll<br />
<br />
Take ownership of these files using properties and move these files to another disk<br />
<br />
Now those services will never run.<br />
<br />
If you want to enable them again, transfer the .dll files back to the system32 folder.<br />
<br />
Note: In case you lose these files you cannot use dll files from another version of windows like windows 7 or 8.<br />
&nbsp;Instead you will have to repair the windows on the computer or reinstall it.
