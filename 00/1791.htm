<p>
</p><p><span>There’s a known issue with </span><strong><span>Version 1607</span></strong><span> that affects any Defender scheduled scan that runs under a
</span><strong><span>system account</span></strong><span> (including the daily </span>
<strong><span>Automatic Maintenance</span></strong><span> Quick Scan) – so the technical workaround is to either modify the
</span><strong><span>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan</span></strong><span> task (the Automatic Maintenance task) to run under the
</span><strong><span>local administrator</span></strong><span> account </span>– <span>
or </span>–<span> to schedule a daily Quick Scan with the </span><strong><span>Create Basic Task Wizard</span></strong><span> without invoking the
</span><strong><span>“system” alias</span></strong><span>;</span><strong> </strong>
<span>so that the task runs under the default </span><strong><span>local administrator</span></strong><span> account. Since the priority of the issue is relatively low, you can also opt to just ignore it; or to run manual scans occasionally. This recent thread
 provides a broader and more&nbsp;in-depth explanation of the issue:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/what-are-scheduled-windows-defender-quick-scans/0d33bf89-727e-4cca-9f05-8bddb8628c42"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/what-are-scheduled-windows-defender-quick-scans/0d33bf89-727e-4cca-9f05-8bddb8628c42</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The “arguments” that you append to the executable that runs the scan will specify the type of scan that the scheduled task runs:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/how-do-i-set-windows-defender-to-a-custom-auto/ec19aab4-10ce-4f41-9990-343056fd104f"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/how-do-i-set-windows-defender-to-a-custom-auto/ec19aab4-10ce-4f41-9990-343056fd104f</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As noted in the previously cited thread, any Defender scan tasks that are scheduled in Version 1607 should provisionally be scheduled without making any change to the default user account.

<h2>            Syncing Outlook 365 calendar with iCloud calendar</h2>
                    <p>How can I sync my Outlook 365 online calendar with Outlook on my laptop &amp; my default iCloud calendar?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My iCloud calendar shows up on my laptop, iPad &amp; iPhone but won't sync with my Outlook 365 online calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also need to sync my Outlook 365 calendar with my Wordpress website (Bookly) calendar, so it's essential that it's syncing with everything else for when my clients make online bookings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can help me :)</p>

            The icloud calendar will not sync with outlook.com - you need to import or move the events to the outlook.com calendar - then you can stop using the icloud addin to sync with the desktop Outlook. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />I also need to sync my Outlook 365 calendar with my Wordpress website (Bookly) calendar, so it's essential that it's syncing with everything else for when my clients make online bookings.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />This capability will depend on what Bookly supports. If it does not support syncing, you won't be able to sync.

Hi. Just to let you know that at the mo you cannot have TV on the 7710. It is being trialled by O2 at present and probably wont be readily available yet. So far only 3G handsets are able to view TV such as 6680, N70<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />

<p>Hi Jeffery Fuller,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is “Focused view” refers to “Focused Inbox”? You may let your admin try the following steps to disable this feature via PowerShell:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a> (please note that run as administrator
 and run the command Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned, choose Y).</li><li>Run the command to check the Focused Inbox status: Get-FocusedInbox -Identity
<em>User@contoso.com.</em></li><li>Run the command to change the status: Set-FocusedInbox -Identity <em>User@contoso.com</em> -FocusedInboxOn $false</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/481a8d97-5b1c-48f4-971a-07a680505d00?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/481a8d97-5b1c-48f4-971a-07a680505d00?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After set the status to false, please restart the Outlook client to see if the Focused Inbox has been disabled for your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

    <title>Office 365 - Saving Access files to OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alan_239  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 - Saving Access files to OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I have just started using Office 365 with Windows 8.1. In File Explorer I have SkyDrive which appears as a separate location. I also have a folder on my hard drive with the same name and folders. When I use Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher, opening
 the files from SkyDrive I can see that the sync with the files on my computer and I have an option in Save As to use the SkyDrive location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied my Access files to SkyDrive but when I open them I am asked to save a local copy.&nbsp; The changes are applied to the local copy but not to the SkyDrive and I do not have an option with Save As to save to SkyDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Access work differently? How do I sync Access files and make them available on other computers and ensure that I have local copies backed up on SkyDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you have changed the name of SkyDrive but nothing has updated on my computer. Is this a problem?</p>

            <p>Access does work different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel, or Word tend to be ONE document and work on <span>r SharePoint.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>is now editing "ePoint lists. If you do this, then you can place a copy of the Access</span>the WHOLE document at once. (so they make a “copy” to work on – Access does NOT make a copy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when you open Word docs a WHOLE copy of the file is pulled down to your local computer. You edit the document and then save the WHOLE file back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with Access is it not really designed around a “whole” file approach. In Access you often have many rows of data. If one user would to grab the WHOLE file. Then do some editing (but not yet save).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you then open the file (two people are editing). Then if you save your data (the whole file), then the other user saves (again the whole file), then the last person’s file will overwrite your
</p>
<p>changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And unlike word or Excel, Access saves data AS YOU WORK, not when you AT THE "END" exit and save. notice how when you exit Access there is no save prompt like word etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that using a “file based” approach tends to work for Word or say PowerPoint since you edit a document, and then save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive treats Access the same way – a simple file that you load + edit and then save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above quite much means that two people cannot edit data at the same time since the last person who grabs a copy of the file will upon saving will overwrite their copy on top of any changes made by others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it not really that Access is different but in fact we WANT SkyDrive to work differently. We don’t’ want a “whole” file approach anymore. Access is able to modify "parts" of the file and has no save when exiting Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we want something different then what is occurring with Word, Power-Point etc. And that “same” behavior we do not want is that&nbsp;saving of WHOLE document over the last copy and user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SkyDrive is “document” based. You can only save a WHOLE file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However Access is interesting because when using Access on a windows drive (as opposed to a web based one like SkyDrive), then Access is able to write “bits” and “parts” of the file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike Word or PowerPoint Access is the ONLY program in office that allows one to write BITS and PARTS of the file (in fact we call this a database record).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above explains why you can place an Access database on a windows file share and have MORE than one user open that file at the same time. As long as the “bit and parts” of the file they are editing is on a DIFFERENT PART of the file, then multiple users
 are allowed to edit data at the SAME time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explain this concept in detail in this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kallal.ca//Wan/Wans.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.kallal.ca//Wan/Wans.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So Access does not make it “too” easy to save the file to SkyDrive (OneDrive) because you have a high chance of overwriting changes made by other people if they also are attempting to save a whole file to SkyDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So windows networking allows “bits and parts” of files.</p>
<p>SkyDrive = whole file approach only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can certainly have users pull down a copy. Edit, and then copy the file back up. It likely best to have users work this way. And they should likely zip up the file before doing this as it will make the file much smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multi-users at same time?</p>
<p>You can do this. This means you have to migrate” or move the tables out of Access into what are called SharePoint lists. If you do this, then you can place a copy of the Access application on each desktop and link the Access application to the office 365
 system. The result is each user is now editing “bits and parts” that reside on office 365 or SharePoint. No sync is required, and the whole system becomes multi-user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way is to use the Access 2013 web publising and then "link" to the data tables on 365 (they will reisde in SQL Azure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in the case of Access, just have your users copy the file to local, un-zip. Then let them edit, and then zip up the file and place it back on OneDrive/SkyDrive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot use Access any other way with these shared 'web based' drive services because they are “web” based and they don’t allow the “bits and parts” changes to files but only WHOLE files and one at a time files.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your detailed reply but unfortunately I'm still not sure where this leaves me. I am just a home user and I am not trying to share files,&nbsp;I just want them available on all my computers and have a backup on SkyDrive. I have a Windows 8.1 and a MacBook,
 plus an iPhone with Office 365 installed, and I have only just started using Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the Word, Excel, etc files on both computers and the iPhone&nbsp;but only the Access files on Windows since Access is not available on the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can see when I edit a Word document it saves to SkyDrive and my local drive and this works with both computers and so everything is in sync, available off line and backed up on SkyDrive. This is what I expected to see with all the&nbsp;Office 365
 apps on Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Access if I open an Access database that I copied to SkyDrive I can only open it if I save a copy on my hard drive and it is then this copy that updates leaving the SkyDrive copy out-of-date. This is the worst situation possible when I have two different
 copies of the same database. I would be happier just working on the cloud version since I then have the security of the documents always being there, but there does not seem to be a way of doing this. Is this assumption correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct to say that I should keep Access documents on my hard drive and only copy them to SkyDrive manually as a backup option? This also seems unsuitable because I have to remember to backup my work. Keeping the Access files on my hard drive only and
 using the File History to back them up automatically seems to be a far better option.</p>

            <p>I have experienced the same problem with skydrive.&nbsp; I have a simple Access database.&nbsp; I am the only user.&nbsp; I use it to track my own hours.&nbsp; I have had this file in a dropbox for years and it worked fine.&nbsp; But since I was running out of space on dropbox I
 moved a bunch of stuff including this Access database over to skydrive.&nbsp; That was maybe a year ago.&nbsp; Everything was fine on skydrive until I got Windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now my changes don't sync half the time.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Actually, my suggestion is quite much the other way around. You want to take the file from SkyDrive, copy it to your local computer. You then work + edit and then when done copy it back up to SkyDrive. This approach means you always have a copy on SkyDrive.
 I also as noted suggest you zip the file before the copy to speed the process up if it is a large file.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this information. I replied to alderran(2) earlier. The default datebase folder was not set to SkyDrive. I have now changed this and can open databases from SkyDrive and they sync with my hard drive. I have only looked at two databases so far
 but this seemed to be the case. If this repeats with the others and consistently then this is what I am looking for.

            <p>Just keep in mind that while working, Access modifies the database file (not on exit like word or Excel). This means that the file is “open” while you are working. As noted if others open this file, then their work will overwrite your changes - you still
 going to wind up with the "last man out" changes being the only changes saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the end result is not a multi-user database that allows users at the same time to edit data. As long as you are aware of this limitation, then you should be ok.</p>

<h2>            How to disable anti-aliasing in Windows 10 Technical Preview&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been checking out the Windows 10 Technical Preview and even though I already disabled ClearType (both through the Tuner and through W8.1 Registry Edits), the fonts are still being anti-aliased in the start menu, on the Desktop and pretty much everywhere
 in the apps and especially in IE 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable it completely everywhere? I am very disappointed that Microsoft doesn't make that available as a working Setting. I know that they believe that ClearType and anti-aliasing is superior, but I just can't stand to have blurry fonts
 on my Screen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Sorry, this is wrong approach. Some people don't like blurry text. This is not technical problem. This is medical -
<span><span>ophthalmology</span></span> - problem. About 15-20% of people like me feel
<span><span>discomfort</span></span> with blurry text. And I am developer, I see text all my working day - in Visual Studio, in browser, in text editor, in emails etc. It's awful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, add setting to </p>
<div>
<p>"completely disable antialiasing" on text rendering level not dependent on the graphics card installed.</p>
<p>Moreover it will fine to have one more setting<br />
"ignore application settings" to force rendering level to ignore antialiasing flags on API rendering functions and always show non-antialiasing non-smoothing text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do that, it is possible and not so hard to implement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS As last resort I created special font for crisp reading</p>
<p>http://mbb-font.sourceforge.net/</p>
<p>but it doesn't work if Windows ignore antialiasing settings as it does in Modern (Metro) applications for example.</p>

            I wish that option too. On Windows 7 I was able to disable anti-aliasing by some registry modification, I wonder if that would work on Win10 too.<br />

            <p>Hi everybody,<br />
<br />
since other people had the same question, I wanted to contribute what I have been able to achieve (on a current version of W10, not the technical preview) since I posted this question:<br />
<br />
1. Uncheck Turn on ClearType in Control Panel/Fonts/Adjust ClearType text<br />
<br />
2. In the W10 Performance options, turn off the "Smooth edges of screen fonts"<br />
</p>
<p>3. Install the Dotum font contained in the Korean language pack (I am NOT kidding! It is one of the few fonts not smoothed by W10). Instructions are taken from this page: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/some-fonts-are-missing-after-upgrade/95839dfa-0df2-4bc0-875a-fd6b57e61fe4?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click the Start button.</li><li>In Settings, click System.</li><li>Click Apps &amp; features.</li><li>Click on the link, Manage optional features.</li><li>If "Hebrew Supplemental Fonts" is not listed among the installed features, click on the "+" icon next to Add a feature.</li><li>Scroll to find "Korean Supplemental Fonts". Click on that item, then click on Install.</li><li>Click on the back arrow in the upper corner of the window.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see the Korean Supplemental Fonts feature in the list as installed or in the process of being installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Create a .REG file (i.e. create a text file in Notepad and rename it, for example Font.reg)<br />
<br />
5. Copy the following text into it (credit goes to http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/change-default-font-windows-10):<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts]<br />
"Segoe UI (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Black (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Black Italic (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Bold (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Bold Italic (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Historic (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Italic (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Light (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Light Italic (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Semibold (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Semibold Italic (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Semilight (TrueType)"=""<br />
"Segoe UI Semilight Italic (TrueType)"=""<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes]<br />
"Segoe UI"="Dotum"<br />
<br />
6. Save the file on the Desktop, close it, doubleclick it, confirm the UAC prompt and the warning with yes to add the contents to the registry file.<br />
<br />
7. (Optional) Use the Windows 10 DPI Fix tool (download it at http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/windows_10_dpi_fix.html) and set it to Windows 8.1 DPI scaling<br />
<br />
8. (Optional) Lastly, for these being pained by IE11 font smoothing (and if you can't switch to a better browser), here is another piece of advice I found at http://superuser.com/questions/721149/is-there-a-way-to-get-rid-of-cleartype-font-smoothing-in-internet-explorer-11
 (if you don't mind when certain image characters are not being displayed):<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Tools/Internet Options/General/Fonts switch to the Dotum font<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then go to Tools/Internet Options/General/Accessibility and check 'Ignore font styles'<br />
</p>
<p>The end result is not perfect, but it gets rid of most of the anti-aliasing/font smoothing effects. Where these are not disabled, the font size is increased using DPI fix to soften the strain on the eyes by lessening the blurriness of the fonts. Each method
 described above can of course be applied independently to achieve various effects.</p>

            <p>UAC = User Account Control -&gt; the annoying little pop-up box you receive when you try to change system settings in Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have created the registry file (simply a text file that you have renamed), you only have to doubleclick it and confirm the two security questions. That's it!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, one last thing, you might have to restart the computer to see the effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            you need to ensure that its actually unlocked this can be an issue with 3 sometimes<br />
check that your message centre number is correct<br />
and we take it from there<br />
there is a p[ossibility that the phone was reported stolen where did you get it from?

if you have tried many sims and its the same the internal antenna could be gone and it will need to be sent to a nokia care centre to be replaced

            that dont really matter you need to ring 3 and ask if the handset is unlocked or still under contract which i doubt<br />
then you can go about getting it to a nokia care point if they confirm it has been unlocked<br />
the only person that can unlock it is the original owner by contacting 3 and that they also have fulfilled terms and conditions of whatever plan they were on

<p>Hi - We have also been getting this issue with any check box, even with documents \ forms that have not been updated for some time (as in 6+ months). I found that if there is a space straight after or before the box and you choose 'Checked' the box will
 not disappear. Any check boxes that do not have a space before or after 'disappear' after being checked. I hit Undo to get it back unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all started happening around the end of April 2014 as well - I am wondering if an office update was responsible as it occurs across the network. Snip it of check box below.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I really do not feel like going through a stupid amount of documents and placing a 'space' with each check box!</p>

    <title>PowerPoint 2016 for Mac language bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guy_932  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2016 for Mac language bug</h2>
                    <p>There is a bug present in version 15.33 (170409) of Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac, and all previous versions of the 2016 release as far as I'm aware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any pasted English text will override the default language setting to English (United States). &nbsp;This will ignore the local macOS language setting, and the language of the text being copied from. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if the text "This is a bug"&nbsp;from a plain text file (i.e. UTF-8 encoding) is copied, and then pasted into any slide, the language will change from the default language to English (United States) for that object. &nbsp;If the word "Colour" is copied
 from a plain text file and then pasted into any slide, it will change the language, and then suggest a spelling mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling Office, and removing all residual Application Data and Library files, and then reinstalling using a freshly downloaded install file from Microsoft does not resolve the error. &nbsp;There is no option to turn off automatic language detection in the
 Preferences menus. &nbsp;Microsoft support are unable to help, and don't appear to acknowledge that this is an issue for non English (US) users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft has no portal that allows users to register bugs for Office, short of social media, this seems to be the only way to notify them of the problem.</p>

<p>Not just all previous versions of the 2016 release, but all previous versions of PowerPoint as well as the other programs in the Office suite, Mac or PC :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jim is correct - Language is not a global <em>document</em> setting, it's an attribute of the text, itself. The OS X Language setting has no bearing on anything other than the default for new files you create, the new slides you insert, &amp; any new Placeholders
 or Text Boxes you create in the file. Further to that, programs will not arbitrarily change the Language property of pasted text any more than they will alter its other formatting attributes [although there are some possible exceptions, such as font color
 controlled by Themes].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Language is not a <em>visible</em> attribute, such as Bold or Italic, so it's impossible to determine simply by looking at the characters or the spelling. Also, in most programs that support multiple languages you can format any text string
 you choose as being any language you want it to be... The word <em>colour</em> - spelled exactly that way - can be "tagged" as being Chinese, Slovak, Hebrew, or just about any other language you choose to apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Automatic Language Detection</em> in Mac Office pertains only to an aspect of the Spelling &amp; Grammar checking machinery. The machinery
<em>detects</em> the language formatting of the text being checked, then uses the corresponding Proofing Tools [if available] on the fly. If no Proofing Tools are available for that language the text is not checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid the behavior you either can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>Paste Options</strong> button which appears after pasting to select
<strong>Keep Text Only</strong>, but the down side to that can be that <em>all</em> formatting will be removed.
<em>Or</em>,</li><li>Use <strong>Edit&gt; Paste Special</strong> [<strong>Command+Control+V</strong>] &amp; choose
<strong>Unformatted Text</strong>. <em>Or</em>,</li><li>After pasting, select the text or its container, then go to <strong>Tools&gt; Language</strong> to apply the preferred language.</li></ul>

<h2>            Emails no longer display on iPad</h2>
                    About a week ago my Outlook app on iPad stopped displaying emails. Any images are shown as an empty box with a little box in the middle. I guess an update started this issue as I've made no changes. Some emails have a view in browser link, many don't.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There are some reasons why your Outlook on iPad stopped displaying emails in your account. To isolate this issue, kindly provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you checked if there's an update available for Outlook in the App Store?</li><li>Have you tried removing your account on the Outlook app?</li><li>Does the issue occur if you reinstall the Outlook app?</li></ul>
        </p>

<p>Update was available which I installed. No change.</p>
<p>Account was removed and re-added. No change.</p>
<p>App was deleted, iPad restarted and app reinstalled. No change.</p>
<p>Interestingly my iPhone displays images with no issues on the Outlook app.</p>

            Thank you for the information. If you can see your emails on your iPhone using an Outlook app, we could validate that the issue is not on the account or on the Outlook app. Have you checked if your iPad runs the latest software update?

<p>iPad is up to date. Still not sure what the problem is, could be an Apple issue but they can't fix it either.</p>
<p>I shall just have to rely on my phone for emails.</p>

    <title>Preview Expiration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob_b.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preview Expiration</h2>
                    <p>I signed up for the Insider Preview program on 2 of my 4 computers. One, running a 6-core Xeon 24/7 downloads and installs all new versions without any intervention from me at all. The other, a Lenovo SL500 laptop was doing the same until about 3&nbsp; versions
 ago. It would download and then get errors during the install. Many retries, stopping the download and deleting the files, still failed. I wasn't aware that the preview builds had an expiration date. I started getting the warning messages while I was on vacation
 and the message that it would stop booting a couple days before I returned home. When I got home I set the bios clock back to the date I last booted. I figured I could just install the last public released version. I found it would not save any files or programs
 because the install version was older than the one running. No problem as I had saved a couple Acronis backups that I could use to restore an earlier version. That failed with an error about corrupt bitmap table. I am now running on an old drive with Windows
 7 installed and still trying to salvage a previous Win 10 install. I think a better warning should have been given that there is NO going back after you signup for the Insider Program.</p>

            <p>Once you have installed a newer build than the public build, the only way out is either to keep upgrading until the next Insider build becomes the next public build (probably Spring 2017) or to backup everything and reinstall the public build. This means
 restoring all of your data from backup and reinstalling any Apps. &nbsp;Otherwise it is like trying to "upgrade" from Windows 10 to Windows 8 without reinstalling anything. You just can't install an older version of Windows over top of a newer one. &nbsp;However, it
 is possible to shrink your C: drive and clean install Windows public build to its own partition, if you want both Insider and the more stable public build on the same PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is one reason that they say not to install these Insider Builds on your primary computer and that you should "feel comfortable reinstalling Windows from scratch". &nbsp;But I definitely agree that the warnings could be more clear.</p>

</p>
<p>Just as we’ve always done with pre-release versions of Windows, Insider Preview builds have expiration dates. Starting tomorrow September 15th, PCs running really old Insider Preview builds will start to see build expiration notifications once a
 day. Then on October 1st, these PCs will start rebooting every 3 hours and then on October 15th – these PCs will stop booting all together. If your PC is running one of these old Insider Preview builds, please make sure you update to Build 14926 via Settings
 &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update. Build 14926 has an updated expiration date of May 1st, 2017. If your PC is running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (Build 14393) in the Slow and Release Preview rings today – this does not apply to you and you will not
 be notified of your build expiring</p>

<p>I was involved in test the pre-release version W8, W8.1 &amp; W10, have been a Insider since day 1.</p>
<p>During the free upgrade to W10, which they state will be maintained &amp; support for the life of the device, I&nbsp;legit &amp; conformed with all requirements, upgraded 5 PC devices, 3 of those have remained&nbsp;on General release, 2 enrolled in the Insider Program.</p>
<p>The 2 devices (1 desktop &amp; 1 Laptop) have been continually upgraded and currently running the latest Bld. 1607 Ver. 15941 with an expiry date of 02/05/2017.</p>
<p>Now if I decide to opt out the Insider Program on any one of the PCs, I may have re-install the original OS from original source, this I feel is an injustice as I originally had a authorised&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;legal copy of an eligible&nbsp;&nbsp;OS, then I&nbsp;upgraded to the free W10,
 (which as stated -will be maintained &amp; supported for the life of the device) then opted&nbsp;join the Insider program.

<p>I intend to sacrifice one of my general release PCs and subscribe to the Insider and later opt out,&nbsp;so that I have an idea what happens.</p>
<p>

            <p>Do not leave anything to chance. What I did, was to first ensure that a clean install of the public build would activate properly, before deleting my currently activated install. You can also image your activated install to a WIM file, using DISM. Restoring
 it retains activation status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean install the public build of version 1607 to a small partition before deleting what you have. If this auto-activates, without the use of any Product Key during install, then that proves that you are safe to wipe your disk and clean install the public
 build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is a method to backup the activation status to a small xml file, using gatherosstate.exe from the Windows install media, that works. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a rather easy one for a PC that is genuinely activated with W10.&nbsp; The PC is permanently activated for that edition of W10.&nbsp; I can freely swap hard drives that contain W10 of the same edition.&nbsp; In other words, if a PC dies, just put the hard drive
 into another activated W10 and good to go.&nbsp; I have a couple of hard drives from dead PCs that I keep up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been clearly stated here that you cannot just roll back to a prior O/S without a clean install.&nbsp; The public build is a prior O/S.&nbsp; We were warned that if we wish to get out of Insiders, then we must clean install back to public build.&nbsp; A clean install
 drops all apps and settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal files may survive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have killed my W10 twice at 14942.&nbsp; The PC had zero control.&nbsp; I just popped in the bootable USB from the Media Creation Tool with a BIOS load and this got me to 14393.???&nbsp; Since I still want go be part of Insiders, I just signed up for the Fast Lane again
 and within hours, I was back to the latest Insider, now 14951.</p>

            Thanks Don &amp; Mel, some great advise &amp; hints,&nbsp;I was reasonably aware of what you have mentioned, I guess I was more interested in other users experience, MS are making sure no one gets a free ride to easy, got to keep the profits up for the shareholders

            Office Outlook is the paid for version...<br />

<b>Therefore there is nothing to pay for.</b><br />
<br />
<div>
<div>Current recommendations for minimizing junk mail<span>&nbsp;</span><b>in Outlook.com.</b></div>
<div>1. Sign in to&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072C6">Outlook.com</font></a></strong>.<br />
<div>2. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the&nbsp;<strong>Cog</strong>&nbsp;icon, and then click on<strong><br />
More mail settings</strong>.<br />
3. Under&nbsp;<strong>Preventing junk mail</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>.<br />
4. Under the&nbsp;<strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>, click on&nbsp;<strong>Blocked senders</strong>.<br />
5. In the Blocked senders list, add the name or domain (the part of an e-mail address that follows the @ sign, such as outlook.com) that you don't want to receive mail from, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Add to list &gt;&gt;</strong>.<br />
<br />
You can create rules to delete incoming junk mails.<br />
1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the&nbsp;<strong>Cog</strong>&nbsp;icon, and then click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>More mail settings</strong>.<br />
2. Under&nbsp;<strong>Customizing Outlook</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Rules for sorting new messages</strong>.<br />
3. Click&nbsp;<strong>New</strong>&nbsp;and then under&nbsp;<strong>Step 1</strong>, click the drop down arrow on the first box and choose<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Sender's address</strong>.<br />
4. Under&nbsp;<strong>Step 1</strong>, type in on the third box the email address.<br />
5. Under&nbsp;<strong>Step 2</strong>, choose&nbsp;<strong>Delete these messages—don't even put them in my Deleted folder</strong>.<br />
6. Click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
<font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font color="#000000">You may also</font>&nbsp;set your Junk email filter to&nbsp;<b>Exclusive</b>.<br />
If the Exclusive level was set, messages from senders not on your Contacts or Safe senders lists will be sent to the Junk folder.<br />
By default, the Junk folder will automatically delete messages after 10 days.<br />
This is more convenient as we don't have any control if senders are randomly changing their address.</span></font></div>

<h2>            Page Can Not Be Displayed</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having an issue when trying to access a DoD site. I warn you this may get a little deep.</p>
<p>System One:<br />
Win 7 (64 bit) running with all the latest patches.<br />
IE 8</p>
<p>When I access the DoD site, I get a cert. message. I click continue anyways and I get a second cert. message. I once again click continue anyways and I get into the site that I am looking for.</p>
<p>System Two:<br />
Win XP (32 bit) running with all the latest patches.<br />
IE 8</p>
<p>When I access the DoD site, I get a cert. message. When I click continue anyways, I get "This Page Can Not Be Displayed" message.</p>
<p>Differences:<br />
System one has a DoD root cert. installed on it (even though I never downloaded and installed it). System two has NO DoD root cert. installed.</p>
<p>Solution:<br />
I install the DoD root cert. and the everything works just like system one. Why do my users have to install the DoD root cert now, and they have not had to do so before?</p>
<p>Issue:<br />
I have been able to access the site in times past on system one with no issues. Why am I suddenly no longer able to access the site. Why will system one no longer load the site like it has so many times before? Why does system to have the DoD cert. installed,
 even though I never installed the root cert. Both machines are my personal machines and are not property of DoD.</p>
<p>This issue is not just related to me, it is affecting my users who are accessing my site from outside of DoD. Any help sure would be appreciated.</p>
<p>P.S. I am having the same issue with another site that I support as well.</p>

<p>Still think we don't need to restore those Bush era&nbsp;tax cuts?</p>

<p>Je veux que telles colonnes de Planification se remplissent en allant chercher dans Equipe A
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">et</span> dans Equipe B pour la valeur requise. Parce que je ne sais pas laquelle des deux a l'information que je veux.</p>
<p>J'ai tenté un truc qui ne fonctionne pas: =OU((RECHERCHEV(B178;'Equipe A'!B:AG;2;FAUX));(RECHERCHEV(B178;'Equipe B'!B:Y;2;FAUX)))</p>

    <title>format percent within a formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennifer71  say:</h3>
<h2>            format percent within a formula</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using a formula to populate column headers so measurement guidelines can be updated easily.</p>
<p>My chart heading reads:</p>
<p>="&lt; "&amp;c12</p>
<p>where C12 is&nbsp;95% (and formatted to read exactly like this)</p>
<p>The cell, and subsequently the chart, populate with</p>
<p>&lt; .95</p>
<p>I really prefer it to read:&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp;95%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I do this without having to delete chart labels and reenter each time there is a change.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try the TEXT function which is aimed to format text :</p>
<p>If Range A1 contains 0.12</p>
<p>and if in Range A2, I enter the following formula =TEXT(A1;"00%") the result should be in cell A2&nbsp;: &nbsp;12%</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>E90 English-Spanish firmware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robmir---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E90 English-Spanish firmware</h2>
                    I bought 2 months ago a E90 in Miami which came with english/spanish firmware but right away I complained with the dealer because my E90 has the keyboard in english but the characters as I typed were as I had a spanish keyboard and led to confusion even
 if I set the language to english.<br />
<br />
He replaced the firmware again with the only another he got which used the keyboard as it came but had English, Philipino and Indonesian languages !!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I need to know which firmware has english as the default language but also spanish and when I switch it to spanish, it will keep the stock english keyboard.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            All QWERTY keyboards are regional ones, or not? It can be set to work well with only one language! At least that seems the correct idea:(

            Well for example I am writing now with a english qwerty keyboard on my computer which has Windows XP in spanish as to give you an idea of what I would like to do with on my E90 english QWERTY APAC keyboard.<br />
<br />
If I switch the language to spanish I know It will be a little dificult to recreate letters like ñ but I don't care.

    <title>PRE-LOG-ON PHOTOS, WINDOWS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pamsaxby  say:</h3>
<h2>            PRE-LOG-ON PHOTOS, WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>ESPECIALLY FOR LAWRENCE CRUMB, who responded to my first query about this puzzling phenomenon by suggesting I select a log-in photo of my own, possibly assuming I don't know how to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your input, Lawrence - but my issue is with the way we're expected to 'like' or 'not like' pictures sent to us without any information on what's being planned. How are the pictures selected? What's being done with information on the choices
 we make? How will they be used? And how come I was stuck with a picture of a palace i some possibly computer-generated urban 'paradise' for three or four days before being asked it I 'like' it (which I don't - it has gone now, thank goodness)? Instead of simply
 doing my own thing as you suggest, I want to know the thinking behind these very often beautiful suggestions of pre-log-on photos. Maybe I'm just one of those people who questions everything, but I think we should all wonder why instead of just accepting things?</p>

            <p>Hi Pam - having participated in a number of threads about the lock screen images (and Windows Spotlight) I think the most knowledgeable regular poster is
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a7410605-c912-43dc-b8ed-3fc8ce8c0caa" title="zachd [MSFT]">
 are receiving info about the images (title - location etc.) whereas others (you included it would seem) are not. If you select one of your own images (Lawrence's suggestion) that will work on the lock screen but you may still get the most recent spotlight
 image pre-log in.</p>
<p>As for what MS are doing with the like/dislike info you guess is as good as mine! I can advise you where you can find the daily images on your pc (it's probably in several of Zach's threads anyway) but you seem to be primarily concerned with the privacy
 issue and that's one I can't answer! - Cheers, Ric.</p>

    <title>Can I continue to use Office 365 after my subscription lapses&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john isner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I continue to use Office 365 after my subscription lapses&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp; am a home office user who has never needed high-powered office productivity tools -- until now.&nbsp; I recently came into possession of several Excel spreadsheets (xslb files) containing VBA macros that will
<em>only </em>run in Office.&nbsp; I need to use these spreadsheets (simply by plugging in data), but I have no need to edit the spreadsheet or create new ones.&nbsp; I'm wondering about the best (and cheapest) way to accomplish this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I studied the Office 365 subscription options.&nbsp; A month-to-month subscription to Office 365 Personal would allow me to install and activate Office 365.&nbsp; Then I'll be able to use the spreadsheets.&nbsp; My question: if I let my subscription expire at the end of
 the month, can I still use the spreadsheets?&nbsp; Or will Excel be disabled in some significant way?&nbsp; I understand that I will not be able to edit documents or create new ones unless I re-activate the subscription.</p>

            Yes you can install it an use it but after a month later of stop paying you won't be able to edit, that means keep outing more data on it
