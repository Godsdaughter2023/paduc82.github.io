<h3> joseph amoako junior  say:</h3>
<h2>            how can i format my write protected pen drive&#63;</h2>
                    I have an eight gig SanDisk cruzer blade pen drive.I gave it to a friend,when he returned it,it has two folders in it containing applications.When I tried to open it,it didn't open but rather started spreading the application in it.When I restarted the
 matchine,i got a message from one of the application(killer.exe) the program cannot start.When I do ctrl+alt+del and invoke the task manager,I found this application and one other application(mylover.exe) running by the administrator and I ended their processes.When
 I tried to delete the folders,it tells me its write protected.I tried to format the entire device it tells me the same thing.I also tried the registry stuff but the same thing.Am beginning to conclude that it is spoiled.Pls help me.<br />

Any idea how to fix? </p>

<p>I had this problem and discovered a solution that helped me. I don't know if it will help you, but something to check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, when the Sign window came up and I clicked <strong>Change</strong>, I found I had two signature options to choose from. I selected the more recent one that reflects my Outlook email address (rather than the default one that came up).
<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f37cf7f-c358-4129-affb-b0dba2942f87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f37cf7f-c358-4129-affb-b0dba2942f87" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It gave me a message about not being able to verify my address, but I said to use it anyway, and it worked!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the message I clicked <strong>Yes</strong> to:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecb2a322-755c-44d6-95f9-1cc6749d3ce5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecb2a322-755c-44d6-95f9-1cc6749d3ce5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, I don't know if there is something about "unlocking" a table or cell that it is in, but that's what a co-worker suggested before I stumbled on the solution that worked for me (she was using Excel, and I was using Word, so I don't know
 what she was talking about). Smile.</p>

    <title>Public Folder Categories - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardangus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Public Folder Categories</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company runs a MS Exchange 2013 mail server and utilizes the public folder feature. Recently, in order to process resume submissions, HR has asked for multiple users (managers) to be able to "flag" these emails using categories. The issue we are experiencing
 is certain managers' categorizing is not appearing to HR's users. I have given everyone participating publishing editor permissions on each respective folder for their department. In this regard there are separate public folders for each department and each
 department's manager has publishing editor permissions on their specific folder. HR's users have publishing editor on all folders. I have read numerous posts, forum discussions, tips, etc. that have very differing answers on this functionality, ranging from
 this functionality does not exist to follow these steps to get it to work to public folders are just buggy and don't expect much. I would really like to hear from the community if people have gotten this to work and what steps they took.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>If it´s a public folder, not a shared or delegated one, everyone should see the category name. You can verify that by opening the item. In order to also see the color of the category, you need to add the category name with a color to each person´s master
 category list (MCL)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There´s no built-in mechanism to sync the MCL between the users´ mailboxes. You can manually create the same list on each computer, or try the

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some components of your Excel might be corrupted and it can be one of the reason as to why it is not printing properly. You mentioned that you already used different printers and the Header/Footer does print. Did you try to update your printer driver? Kindly
 have it updated for us to check further. </p>

            <p>I assume when you say you have no driver you meant to say that you have no CD/DVD drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can buy a portable CD/DVD drive or a better idea is to buy an external USB hard drive or USB stick and copy the Publisher 2010 disc to the USB drive on another computer that has a CD/DVD drive, then copy the program to the new computer from the USB stick
 or drive and install from the hard drive. Do not try to install directly from the USB drive/stick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am curious every time this question comes up as to why you didn't think about this when you opted to buy a computer without a CD/DVD drive? What was your plan? A rhetorical question...</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this approach will work. You can use a formula on Sheet2 that pulls the data from Sheet1 like</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Sheet1!A1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then copy that formula across and down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, when the data in sheet 1 changes, the formula in sheet 2 will immediately reflect that. You can't use formatting to see any&nbsp;changes, because there is no difference between the two sheets. The changes don't leave a trace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a copy of the sheet by right-clicking the sheet tab and selecting "Move or copy". Then select "Create a copy" and hit OK. Now you have an exact copy of the original sheet. You can now apply conditional formatting to highlight cells that differ
 between the two sheets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select cell A1 the copy and use conditional formatting with a formula along the lines of</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Sheet1!A1&lt;&gt;A1</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note that there are no $ signs in the formula). Select a color fill for the format and apply that conditional format to all cells in the copied sheet. Now, when you change a value in the original sheet, the copy will highlight the cells that differ from
 the original.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Hitechtoys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there are two ways you can do this but they're very "MacGyver"</p>
<p>
</p><p>How you would accomplish this is by doing what was suggested by teylyn, create a sheet that has the following formula in each cell up to the length and width you'd want:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=if(isblank(Sheet1!A1),"",Sheet1!A1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply replace Sheet1 with your front sheet's name and then place this formula in cell A1 on the back page and copy-paste the cell or use the fill handle to drag it to the desired width and height.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then do one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Simple Non-Macro solution:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Go to file&gt;options</li><li>Navigate to the formulas tab</li><li>Under Calculation Options see Workbook Calculation</li><li>Select the Manual radio button and check or uncheck the recalculate upon saving box as desired (seems you would want this to be unchecked)</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You will now be able to have your user make changes to the front page and they will only be reflected on the back page when you press F9 to recalculate the entire workbook. This solution of course has a number of limitations including no calculations
 on the front page updating either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. More complex macro-enabled solution:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Save your workbook as a macro enabled workbook (and never again save it without ensuring you're saving as a macro enabled workbook)</li><li>Unhide the developer tab on the ribbon</li><li>Go into the macro editor on the developer tab by selecting the visual basic button</li><li>You should see a new window open up that looks more like a code development environment</li><li>On the left side of the screen there should be a project browser in which you can see the sheet name of your back page, front page, other tabs, and "ThisWorkbook"</li><li>Double click ThisWorkbook</li><li>Paste the following code in the editor:</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Private Sub Workbook_Open()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Application.CalculateBeforeSave = False</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Calculation will be set to manual any time the document is opened and prevent saves from recalculating the workbook</li><li>Now go back to the macro editor and double click on your front page tab's name, the one that should update as the user interfaces with it</li><li>Paste the following code in the editor for that tab:</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worksheets("Payroll").Calculate<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Now when any value is changed on the user-facing tab it will recalculate only itself, preventing the back page from changing while the user is free to work on the front page that will act normally and recalculate on any change made.&nbsp;</li><li>All that is necessary to update the back page to match the front page when you're ready is to press F9, which forces a recalculate on the entire workbook.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if either of these options ended up helpful to you or if you need more assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

 a line return at the end of the field. I'm trying to get either tab or return to move to the next field.

            There is a method, but it requires macros. If your users don't have macros enabled, then the Enter (Return) key's function won't change.<br />

            Tabbing in a text form field moves the insertion point to the next field. To force the same behavior when pressing Enter, you will have to make use of a macro. See

                    <p><em><strong>Copy and Paste Problem</strong></em></p>
<p>I am trying to copy a photos with a caption and border in a Word doc, but when I paste the border is gone. Is there a way to keep the border? Doc is set to match destination formatting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used a table format&nbsp;for the borders because there are single images, as well as groups of two and four that need to remain the same throughout the doc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I copy and paste the tables with&nbsp;multiple images the frame/border copies. When I do it with the single image, the frame/border does not copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working on the document in Word 2010, for use with someone who has Word 2007.</p>

<h2>            Using a Fillable Word Form on iPad</h2>
                    <p>My office uses several fillable Word forms that are locked with checkboxes. The forms work great on the computer, but we are starting to use iPads in the field instead of laptops and are finding that the the checkboxes do not work on the iPad. Is there a
 way to make fillable forms in Word with checkboxes that can be easily filled out on the iPad?</p>

<p>Yes, it's really poor UI-design in so far.<br />
It bothers me by the day and the hour as this display appears with<br />
everything one sends to ON (especially things from a web-site).<br />
Therefore I rather often still use "Unfiled Notes" and sort things later<br />

<p>Thanks for the workaround!<br />
The "unique" name of a sections is a prerequisite. Thos is fairly often<br />
not case with my notebooks :-(</p>
<p>In addition to bmac's suggestion for a user selectable option to show<br />
the notebooks collapsed:<br />
It would be nice to add the option to "remember" the last selection.</p>

    <title>Spinning pinwheel and delay when searching for emails in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Spinning pinwheel and delay when searching for emails in Outlook</h2>
                    I am running Mountain Lion, on a top-of-the-line Mac Pro - 64 Gigs of memory, solid state (SSD) hard drive, fastest possible processor. I am connected via Outlook 2011 to an Exchange server. I've noticed that recently, when I search for emails in the "magnifying
 glass" field at the top right of the window, I get the color pinwheel spinning and a slowdown, as it tries to search. Yes, I have a lot of email, but my machine is very fast and it should not be slowing down like this (and it did not, until recently). I've
 checked my disk using Disk Utility, I have plenty of free RAM and disk space, and I have rebuilt my identity and rebooted. None of this helped. Any idea what I can do to prevent this slowdown when searching for emails?<br />

            Rebuilding on an exchange server is not something that you should do it often.<br />
How does a general search on the system work?<br />
Did you check a new user account and see if the same happens there as well?<br />

            NEVER rebuild an Identity with Exchange account.<br />
<br />
How big is your Identity? Do a Get Info on the Data Records folder in your Identity.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/your identity<br />
<br />
Since you have rebuilt your Identity, you might try starting over in a new Identity.<br />

Exchange Basics<br />
<br />
The Inbox syncs more frequently than any other and should be kept as clean as possible. (this is the number one cause of problems with sync). Do NOT make subfolders under the Inbox.<br />

            &gt; NEVER rebuild an Identity with Exchange account.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oops... Ok.&nbsp; In one case previously, it told me I had to rebuild and would quit immediately if I said No. I can always start a new identity and re-download stuff from Exchange server, but then I lose signatures, view settings (which columns shown in which
 folders), and all local folders. Not only is it a pain to re-set everything, but if I can't get in (it quits if I don't rebuild), how to I grab my local folders to re-import them to the new identity?&nbsp; Is there a better process that preserves those things when
 I start a new identity?<br />
<br />
&gt; How big is your Identity?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; it is now 696 Mb, but before the rebuild, it was 2 Gb. It looks like everything is there, but why is it so smaller now - did I lose data in the rebuild?&nbsp; I'm surprised it's this small anyway, because I have a LOT of email. Weirdly, I didn't see any of these
 search delays until last week - it used to work fine. I don't know if it was an update that caused it?<br />
<br />
&gt; Do NOT make subfolders under the Inbox<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; my Inbox is almost empty and there are no subfolders.<br />
<br />
thank you,<br />

            If you can't get in, then you will have to rebuild, but put Outlook into work offline mode after the rebuild so nothing uploads back to Exchange server. Delete the Exchange account and export the local data as .olm as described in the link to move to a
 new Identity.<br />
<br />
While it might be a pain to reset preferences, isn't it more a pain to have an Identity that has corruption and will most likely fail again in a few weeks?<br />
<br />
You can make a copy of your Identity with the basics like signature and settings then if you need to start over, use a copy of your base to start new.<br />
<br />
With Outlook you shouldn't see so much difference after a rebuild like we did with Entourage.<br />
<br />
There is a third party product that can be used to recover emails. It has a demo so you won't be out anything but time to try. You select your Microsoft User Data folder to export as .mbox file. Move out any old Identities you don't want recovered first. You
 can see the .mbox files in the Finder. Each .mbox file represents a folder.<br />
<br />
If the demo work, you will need to purchase and rerun the process. It will not be able to convert the demo files to usable files.<br />
<br />
The app will convert the .mbox files to .olm file for easy import back into Outlook.<br />

<p>Things were going swimmingly until I noticed that of the 238 Outlook contacts I had on my Toshiba, 21 contacts added over the past month did not appear in the contacts list of my iPAQ- even though I synced weekly without any indication of a
 sync error.&nbsp; Then I missed an appointment that was on my Toshiba but didn't get moved to my iPAQ either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No error messages or anything in the troubleshooting log that I could see.&nbsp; Nothing in either the&nbsp;Microsoft or Webroot web sites to indicate that there were any known problems with my desktop security programs and Activesync.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Performed a "detect &amp; repair" on Outlook 2003 on my Toshiba.&nbsp; It was successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Tried the trick of doing the sync one folder at a time. Result:&nbsp; still missing calendar appointments and the recent additions to my contact list.&nbsp; No joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Deleted the activesync partnership on my Toshiba, followed by a reboot.&nbsp; Then deleted the partnership on the iPAQ, followed by a soft reboot.&nbsp; Then reintroduced the two devices to each other followed by a sync.&nbsp; Result:&nbsp; No change on the
 calendar, but now I was down to 25 contacts on my iPAQ!!!&nbsp; Almost 90% of my contacts disappeared from my iPAQ.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I uninstalled Activesync from my Toshiba, rebooted, and reinstalled it.&nbsp; Then I deleted the partnership on the iPAQ and did another soft reboot.&nbsp; On an impulse, I manually deleted the remaining 25 contacts on the iPAQ on the theory that if
 there were no contacts at all on the iPAQ, and I told the reconnection wizard to move data from my laptop to the iPAQ, that the contacts would HAVE to be moved over.&nbsp; Much to my chagrin, the result was no change to the calendar appointments and no contacts
 moved to the iPAQ.&nbsp; Now&nbsp;there doesn't seem to be a&nbsp;way to move any contacts from my laptop to the iPAQ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I have a 5 month-old iPAQ that began silently misbehaving a month ago.&nbsp; I took the corrective actions I saw that worked for others but they didn't work for me.&nbsp; The two functions most important to me are unavailable.&nbsp; I am mightily annoyed
 at both Microsoft and HP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So...any ideas on how to fix this?&nbsp; Or is my only option to revert to an old "Mark One" day-timer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi all-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the guy who started this particular problem thread (just browse the forum to see that lots of people are experiencing this problem), I've been very frustrated by the silence from both Microsoft and HP regarding sync problems. The stock answers
 ranging from re-establishing the partnerships to doing a hard reset, reinstalling and trying again just doesn't cut it- it seems to work for some people, but it didn't work for me. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when reinstalling ActiveSync, I took the time to read the leagalese disclaimer and what I learned from that was shocking- Microsoft distributes AciveSync
<strong><em><u>"AS IS"</u></em></strong>; which I take to mean is that they may or may not fix any bugs found.&nbsp; I don't know about you folks, but the only reason I bought a PDA is so I can sync information from my laptop with it.&nbsp; To me, this is a core feature-
 without it the device is useless to me.&nbsp; I find it unacceptable that the vendor responsible for such core functionality executes it with software that he may or may not support unless he feels like it.&nbsp; The failure to sync is a bug and so far, apparently,
 Microsoft isn't doing anything about it even though this very forum has threads reporting this problem that go back over&nbsp;a year at least.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I started looking around to see if there was other sync software out there that worked with Windows Mobile 6 devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, I found references to a product called <strong>XTND Connect PC</strong> by
<em><strong>Sybase</strong></em>.&nbsp; I sent them an email asking for more information and got a reply from a Ken Nicholson, a support engineer for their iAnywhere group.&nbsp; He patiently answered my questions and addressed my concerns.&nbsp; I downloaded a copy of it
 to evaluate.&nbsp; After playing with it for two weeks, I can tell you all that, for me, &nbsp;it works like a champ.&nbsp; So I bought it off their web site for $59.&nbsp; My PDA is no longer a brick and now does what I need for it to do.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, XTND Connect PC still requires the use of ActiveSync. But it only uses it as a conduit between the device and your PC.&nbsp; It apparently does not use any of ActiveSync's buggy synchonization code.&nbsp; This puppy runs fast and accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The documentation is a bit sparse- a FAQ file on the web site and a help file within the product.&nbsp; While I'd like to see a "real" manual, I was able to puzzle out how to use the product properly without too much trouble. Again, SyBase's tech
 support was quick, polite, and responsive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sybase claims that it will also sync your Win Mobile device with ACT!, Lotus Notes, and Lotus Organizer as well as with Outlook. Since I use Outlook, I did not test these capabilities.&nbsp; Supposedly, some time this summer, a new version of XTND
 Connect PC will come out that supports Vista's calendar and tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dislike having to pay an additional $59 to get the functionality that was supposed to be included in the purchase price of the Win Mobile device.&nbsp; However, without it, my PDA was a brick and since I already had it for 5 months before the Active
 Sync problem manifested itself, it was long past the time when I could return the PDA for a refund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please understand that I'm no crusader and I'm not trying to pick a fight with anybody.&nbsp; I had a problem with a product I bought, the vendor responsible for the problem was unresponsive, I found a solution with a third party that solved my particular
 problem- that's it.&nbsp; No agenda.&nbsp; And I'm not getting anything from Sybase for this.&nbsp; My experience with them was positive and I'm sharing this with the rest of you who are frustrated with ActiveSync as a possible solution.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck to you all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Publisher 2013 - Automatically Update Linked Images</h2>
                    <p>Wondering if there is a way to automatically update a linked image if the original file is changed and overwritten?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is our biggest problem with Publisher as there doesn't seem to be a way to do this efficiently unlike the standard application in Adobe InDesign. Any input would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>"Linked to file"&nbsp;images are updated&nbsp;through the Graphics Manager&nbsp;in the View tab. Once an image is altered, the Graphics Manager changes the status of the linked image from "linked" to "Original is modified".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue is that you have to check every image by hovering over the thumbnail in the Graphics Manager to see if the original has been modified and needs to be updates. Similar to Adobe InDesign standard, image updates should be highlighted or automatically
 updated when the program is opened or reloaded. Despite this design flaw, it is&nbsp;comforting to know that Publisher does have the ability to link and "manually" update images. Its a step in the right direction.</p>

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors. If Feb 10, 2016 update (KB3114717) is installed, this should be uninstalled.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-Office-and-your-computer-with-Microsoft-Update-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5<br />
<br />
2. Perform Quick Repair of the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
6. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
7. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
8. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
9. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
10. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
11. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
12. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />

            I've resolved the issue. &nbsp;Despite doing a Clean Boot, I found that Webroot SecureAnywhere was still starting up. &nbsp;When I shut that down, IE would then open and work fine. &nbsp;WSA was somehow blocking IE. &nbsp;Uninstalling/reinstalling WSA resolved the issue.

            Dear Nicola,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Try to use another browser, and In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can block authorization and cause problems. It is also recommended to clear cache and cookies from time to time. In this article you will find the way how to delete the cache and cookies for most of the browsers <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies</a>
<br />
<br />It is better to avoid Safari, Firefox and Chrome for this as there are lots of problems with browsers recently <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a> That is why please test this in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer in Private (CTRL+SHIFT+P)
<br />
<br />Please login to your Outlook.com account in Private and try to send email to your primary account. If you will get the same message, please login to your webmail for connected account and try to send  email to your Outlook.com account. Can you send it without an error ? Also please check if you will receive it. Do you know if your connected account provider has changed any email settings recently ?

<p>Hi LA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to write.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set Microsoft Edge to private and tried to send an email from my connected account to my primary account but it made no difference. I received the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already cleared cache and cookies in Chrome (my default browser) and again, no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send an email from my connected account (via webmail) and I can receive it just fine within Outlook.</p>

</p><p>I checked with my&nbsp;<span>connected account provider</span><span>&nbsp;last night and there has been no change to any email settings.</span></p>

            Dear Nicola,
<br />
<br />That error suggests that you do not have permissions to send emails from that account. This can be because of recent password changes or changes from email provider. 
<br />
<br />Go to connected account page <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/accounts/connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/acco...</a> and see the actual status of connected account at the moment. If it says that there is syncing issue, try to sync it manually by clicking on green arrow. If this will not help remove the account and connect it again <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/remove-a-connected-account-from-outlook-com-0b9a6b95-ff1b-46c1-bf60-d6b3b82c5ac8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/remove...</a>
<br />
<br />Also please check this article for more suggestions with syncing issues for connected accounts <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-connected-accounts-in-outlook-com-a99a1f0b-700d-4b3b-8f9a-28d463ff07f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubl...</a>

<p>Thank you again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under 'manage your connected accounts' is 'update failed' - next to the name of my connected account. When I go into 'edit', the settings look fine (but i will double check again with email provider). The odd thing is that when I click on the Refresh button
 next to my connected account, it doesn't even appear to try to refresh.</p>

            Dear Nicola,
<br />
<br />There may be delays, however your error message suggests that you do not have access to connected account. 
<br />
<br />I have double checked my connected accounts and I am able to send the emails, also there is nothing in recent issues <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a>
<br />
<br />If you suspect that it can be an issue with your account, I would advise you to contact In-App Support. They are fully equipped with tools needed to check your account and to deal with this issue.

<h2>            Any disadvantage or limitation of using MSAccess 2010 Runtime on an MDB created with MSAccess 2003&#63;</h2>
                    I have been reluctant to fully convert my front end/back end application with full workgroup security to accdb file format, because of the loss of ability to restrict access to my design and code. &nbsp;I have recently been experimenting with opening the .mdb
 file and distributed .mde file with 2010 runtime, and include the startup options to connect to the secure system.mdw file.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Are there any known problems in continuing to use 2010 runtime this way? I have even made some design changes to the .mdb using the full copy of msaccess 2010, and would also like to know if that will present problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you so much.</div>

            A couple of points. If your goal is to restrict access to design and code, then converting to MDE/ACCDE will do that without the need for workgroup security. Using the runtime also prevents uses from getting into design mode.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Access 2010 is less forgiving of syntax errors than 2003. So its possible that code that runs fine in 2003 may crash in 2010. Anytime you use an mde/accde or runtime versions you need to use a lot of error trapping so errors can be properly identified.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And Albert is right on, do not do any design changes in 2010. Use 2003 for designing.</div>

            <p>I would as a general rule make ALL changes to the database with Access 2003 since that is the version the application was developed with. And if you going to use 2003 or the 2003 runtime in any case then you MOST certainly do not want to use 2010 to modify
 the application.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you stick to the above, use late binding, then you should be able quite well to run + use the access 2010 runtime.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However if NO machines are going to use 2003 (full or runtime), and you simply require/use access 2010 runtime in all cases? Then you likely can risk/attempt doing design + modification work in Access 2010. In other words, if Access 2003 (full or runtime)
 is going to be used at any time then I strongly suggest you do not edit/design with 2010. As noted, if all machines will use/run 2010 runtime then you can risk using access 2010 for development.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&gt; reluctant to fully convert my front end/back end application with full workgroup security to accdb file format, because of the loss of ability to restrict access to my design and code.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Actually, you don't need nor want to use security for the above. Security is to restrict what users can open what tables or forms. To restrict DESIGN changes you should simply distribute a compiled version of your application. When you compile your application
 (an mde) or now an accDE, then the VBA code and design changes to forms are not possible.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So security never really was designed to prevent changes to code and all these years you really never did have to use security to prevent such changes. To lock down your application then just use a compiled version. A few settings in the startup options
 and users cannot make changes to the application you distribute.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So don't confuse the security&nbsp; issues and requirements of that of preventing the user from making changes to forms/code or reports - they are two different goals and the latter does not require Access security to achieve.</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Serious problems with Windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>After download and prep, Windows started install,&nbsp; Get Error C1900101-20017 and installation failed.&nbsp; When I try to check the problem Windows starts downloading Windows 10 again. stopping with error code 80072EFE.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;But somehow the installation has deactivated my Virus protection&nbsp; (F Secure) and has messed&nbsp; up my passwords to access financial files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a hell of a mess.</p>

            When doing a upgrade it is good practice to turn off virus programs until completed then reinstall or turn back on, this has been posted by Microsoft under before installing Windows 10.&nbsp;

            I have tried all the suggested remedies but it always come back to having to start the download again.&nbsp; I am beginning to wonder if the program actually resides on the computer or is somewhere in the cloud.

            <p>I got this error also on an HP 8100 Elite Minitower computer; 32 Bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After numerous attempts, I finally went back to the original machine RAM installation; and then the Windows 10 install worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then re-installed the desired additional RAM after the install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If additional RAM has been installed on the machine, might try going back to the original RAM installation and then re-try installing Windows 10.....</p>

            What amount of Ram are you using as a 32bit will only use 3gig at the most.

            <p>Joe- the PC originally had 2 GB of RAM; I had upped it to 4 GB after I got it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept the original HP RAM that came with the machine; and re-installed it as another 'shot in the dark' to try with solving this upgrading issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No explanation why, but it worked; and thusly now on about the tenth attempt Windows 10 is now installed on this HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now reinstalled the 4 GB RAM and Windows 10 recognizes it OK; it is slightly less than 4 GB recognized; as you mention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I liked Windows 7 better, I do quite a bit of work from the Command Window environment; and have not been duly impressed with Windows 10 and its legacy Command Windows implementation......</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Windows 7 days are numbered; so go with the flow as they say......</p>
