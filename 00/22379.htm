<h2>            outlook on mac - changed profile and now cannot access old emails</h2>
                    <p>Trouble shooting a problem in Outlook on Mac, I changed profile and identity. Now when I &nbsp;use Mac search to find an old email, Mac search finds the email, but when I try to open it, I get the error message:</p>
<p>

Outlook cannot open the file because it is not associated with the default identity
</p><p>
</p><p>This means that years of emails I need access to are not available. What are my options?</p>
<p>

            <p>In my post previous to yours, Lance, I posted exactly what I and the MS tech did and the end result.</p>
<p>The tech came onto my computer and exported the 'sent' messages from each of 3 previous profiles into an archive. He then changed the default profile to the correct one, and then in the tnow current default profile, he imported the sent messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The end result is that I have 3 different sent folders, each with a series of sent messages matching the dates when previous profiles were active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After he did this, Finder could not access any sent folders. The tech told me to wait 24 hour for indexing to be complete. (I had several GB of sent messages.) After 36 hours, Finder could access and open all the sent messages -- which is the result I wanted.
 In addition, the earlier problem, where the sent messages displayed only with my name in the viewing panel, rather than with the name of the recipient, no matter if the panel was set to 'to' or 'date sent' or anything else -- that problem was also fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I can say that, with the help of MS community techs and with the additional help of MS techs reached by telephone, who came onto my computer to do the fix, my problem was solved.</p>

            I&nbsp;can't add it to my home network too. But, why would anyone need it? I've read somewhere that MS doesn't see a reason why anyone would need it.

<h2>            Barcelona map is not updated</h2>
                    
<p>Dear all,รง</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I have updated my map of Catalonia where is located Barcelona. In Barcelona the last summer the city council changed the direction of Craywinckel street and part of&nbsp; Passeig Sant Gervasi. Today, 3 months later this map is not updated and the route
 that the phone is suggested to do in car tries to put you in opposite direction. It could be dangerous!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you update this map?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>King regards,</p>
<p>Jordi</p>

<p>I have realized that NAVTEQ has the map updated. You can see the sense of the street

<p>You can see it in <a href="http://mapreporter.navteq.com/#report/road/change/?pvid=64360233&amp;isFromMap=true&amp;clickLongitude=128.36824966929328&amp;clickLatitude=2484.7698213824547&amp;a[longitude]=2.1399382716056&amp;a[latitude]=41.41243220339&amp;b[longitude]=2.1378518518526&amp;b[latitude]=41.41406779661&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>But, if you see at the Nokia maps (<a href="http://maps.nokia.com/services/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maps.nokia.com/services/#</a>|41.4118674|2.1394409|19|0|0|normal.day) the same street is not updated.</p>

<h2>            How to keep email in sync between 3 computers</h2>
                    I have a Windows 8 desktop, Windows 7 Laptop and a Windows 8 tablet. If I use Office 365 (outlook 2013) and Skydrive, can I keep my outlook data in sync between the three computers? Or, if not Office 365, what applications would work. I do not expect the
 computers to access the data concurantly.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Office and providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will help you to synchronize Outlook with other devices. However I need more details:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is the email account setup on all the devices (POP3/IMAP/MAPI or Exchange)?</p>
<p>Do you want to synchronize all the contents from Outlook to other devices?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide more details to assist you better.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Aravinda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me. The 5 email accounts are all POP3. I do not segregate them in outlook, in other words I only have one Inbox, etc. I would like for all of the devices to "see the same thing, so that when I move from one device to another my
 emails will be current and the contents of the various folders will be the same on each machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help manage the size of the data file (I believe it is a PST type file in Outlook which is currently 5 plus GBs), I can keep the archived data on my home desktop only.

            <p>I would also like to see that answer to that question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&nbsp;am running&nbsp;Windows 8 on my desktop and my Samsung ATIV Pro tablet, but Windows 7 on my laptop</p>
<p>I am using Office 365 and I have moved most of my files to the SkyDrive.</p>
<p>I find that&nbsp;access to the SkyDrive is usually almost as fast as having those files on my computer.</p>
<p>Is there some way to&nbsp;direct Outlook POP&nbsp;emails to all go to&nbsp;my SkyDrive?</p>

            <p>I think it is not possible to have it save to SkyDrive since Outlook Locks up the .Pst file which will prevent another program in opening it or being synced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest that you switch to IMAP for all your email accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that is not possible, try a web email account (Gmail, Yahoo, AOL)&nbsp;that pulls all the mail from your POP accounts which you can use IMAP on your 3 Computers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use EAS since you have all Windows then use Outlook.com.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other way is to buy a third party software that does it which I don't know of any.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the simple solution is to use IMAP or Exchange ActiveSync (Outlook.com/Exchange Only)</p>

            The pst won't sync while it is locked, that causes errors in skydrive. At one time skydrive did not allow pst files at all - not sure if that changed...&nbsp; dropbox does allow pst but it's better to use imap. If anything goes wrong in the sync, you could
 lose everything&nbsp;in a corrupt&nbsp;pst. &nbsp;

            Syncing.net does a great job of keeping two POP3 E-Mail accounts mirrored to one another, I have been using it for a couple of years.&nbsp; BUT, I have not tired it yet with Outlook 2013.&nbsp; It certainly allows interaction between two computers pst files and
 mirrors individual E-mails without sending the full large pst file<br />

Anyway, if you can not find it, remove memory card from phone and connect it again to PC -&gt; do you get a same message?<br />

if you get the same message, open Conrol Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs &gt; uninstall Nokia USB Driver and then select Nokia PC Suite &gt; Change &gt; Repair)

    <title>Office 2010 SP2 kms activation error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mstraet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 SP2 kms activation error</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Recently I deployed SP2 via WSUS to all my Office 2010 clients. After that the problems started. All my Windows XP machines with Office 2010 do no activate anymore. Somehow I think the XP machines don't detect the KMS server anymore.<br />
I googled around I saw someone else had this problem too and he solved it by using the 2 following commands<br />
<br />
<br />
1) cscript.exe "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs"&nbsp; /sethst:<br />
2) cscript.exe "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs"&nbsp; /act<br />
<br />
This way you manually activate your office but I cannot start doing this on 50+ clients. Is there anyway I can fix this problem?<br />
<br />

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lumia 635 is running on windows 10 mobile and when I try to&nbsp;purchase any app, there is an error... Anyone know how to fix it?</p>

            <p>I got it too and also only while trying to get an app (well known and often used) you have to pay for. First I contacted its developers, because the website of MS Store also shows "not available for your phone" (Lumia 640, Windows 10 mobile). The guys tried
 to help (thanks again!) but did not find any problem in the app and its prerequisites.</p>
<p>For the error "PUR-PrerequisiteProfileMissing" you can find only one hit via web search (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oaccount-oother/microsoft-account-getting-error-pur/5325207d-9821-4ef5-8950-ab692be1a493?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oaccount-oother/microsoft-account-getting-error-pur/5325207d-9821-4ef5-8950-ab692be1a493?auth=1</a>
 ) - it seems not to be related to our problem - but it shows the rigth direction: the error is related to the AVAILABLE mode of payment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At my MS account, I did not configure any other payment than the mobil contract. This works for all people I know... - so I believed that this cannot go wrong.</p>
<p>With bad grace I first create an agreement for MS to debit from my bank account - and now I immediately did not get the "PUR-PrerequisiteProfileMissing" anymore!</p>
But I still could not buy the app - the MS Store now said something like "We cannot verify your mobil contract.". - ??? The bank account also was not provided as mode of payment.
<p>So I tried to add the mobil contract again for this - and now the reason for all the trouble was visible: MS seems to have wrong mapping information between mobil numbers and their providers: for my number a foreign provider is shown, and there's no way
 to change it! The payment via mobil contract could not work with this.</p>
<p>At least, I add my credit card and immediately I could buy the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Changing the open upon start up.</h2>
                    When I set up Skype I decided to not have it open and sign in upon turning on my system. I have since decided I would like it to do so as I too often forget to open it. However I cannot find a setting to change that. Anyone know how too?

            Microsoft has its own internal Blacklist, but it also subscribes to other Blacklists out there for analyzing inbound email. So I'd imagine, as the error say, it's one of the other Blacklists.<br />

<p>Reasons why a phone cannot update:<br />
<br />
1. It is a country variant - country variants often get the updates later, or have updates skipped altogether. A Turkish country variant product code for example, skipped v40 and updated from v31 straight to v50.<br />
<br />
2. It is network branded - phones acquired from network providers or these providers' stores SIM free are branded, and will not get updates until the networks approve and modify the updates to their liking.<br />
<br />
3. Special editions - These special editions are chartered editions and may never get updates unless taken to a Nokia Care center.</p>

<p>Yeah, my phone is not 'special edition', nor is the software that I want to update to.</p>
<p>I update via my PC, so if I change my PC's IP to somewhere like USA, the thing should update?</p>
<p>Also, I live in Slovenia, but I use the English variant of the software, so I don't see why the delay...</p>
<p>And, if I take my SIM card out of my mobile, will (would) that solve the problem of the operator?</p>
<p>AND, why doesn't Nokia leave these Software Updates on their site, so we can download them from the site?</p>
<p>It would be very helpful...</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer!</p>

            It doesnt matter if you're in Timbuktu, if your phone is Slovenian and the SLovenian update still isnt approved, your phone wont get updated even if everybody in Timbuktu already got the update. The phone has a recognition system which allows the Ovi Suite
 to determine which country the phone was supposed to have been sold in. Each batch of phones have product codes that tell Ovi Suite and the servers if its a Black Slovenian C5 version or a White one, or if its a White French version or what. It doesnt matter
 what language you are using the phone in. Its the unit's product code which determines if its eligible for the update or not.

    <title>Is there a way to hide your name from emails&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> .   .  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to hide your name from emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just to confirm, there have been a few questions similar to this but the answers seem to ignore this and focus on the fact that aliases cannot have their name hidden while the main account is showing the profile name.<br />
(I have aliases but I would be okay with hiding the name from all the accounts)<br />
<br />
So far the best reply I have found suggest&nbsp;you should just edit your name to "." or "-".<br />
<br />
And there is a post about windows-live indicating such a feature existed from before 2009 but the feature seems to be removed.<br />
<br />
And to make it slightly more infuriating, if you try to edit and remove your profile name, there is the following error message:<br />
<br />
"<strong>Please enter your first and last names - don't worry, you choose who gets to see it.</strong>"<br />
<br />
I have searched for a few hours. I can't find this option.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Can anyone confirm this clearly/put me out of my misery</strong></span>,<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;. .<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*edit*</strong><br />
<strong>A list of "answers" that don't seem to answer my question (so I hope no one else will repeat them)</strong><br />
- You can edit you name out to become symbols<br />
- You cannot hide the name from JUST aliases (does not specify that you can't hide at all)<br />
- You cannot have your name as empty or white space characters (generates error message claiming you can hide your name in settings)<br />
- There is a way to hide your name while using microsoft outlook the program (while I am asking about outlook.com and/or if using the email account from my phone, other apps, etc)<br />
- There was a reply with a guide on how to just edit your privacy settings (but it is outdated from a 9 year old post, seems to be only for windows live)<br />
<br />
ps (if you can't do it, please just say "<strong>no you can't hide your name when using outlook.com</strong>" and also someone please change the misleading error message you get when you try to just remove the name from the profile)</p>

            <p><strong>About my concerns:</strong><br />
<br />
outlook.com is different from using microsoft outlook (the program)<br />
<br />
or are you saying that i have to get the program and edit it that way to hide my name?<br />
<br />
or would following these steps only hide the names when using that program, but not while in browser or using other apps/devices/phones/etc?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>About the other threads:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>those threads are 4-6 years old, and none of them seem to answer any of my concerns unless they have something like "this is not possible"<br />
<br />
rather than linking me to those threads, can you just tell me if it is still impossible like i asked in my original post?</p>

            <p>Yeah. I know this.<br />
As stated in my original question as well as the links that the first reply gave me.<br />
<br />
So the whole point of my question is to ask:<br />
<br />
"<strong>Is there no way to hide my name?</strong>"<br />
</p>
<p>(because having symbols as a name seems a bit unprofessional and bothers me a tiny bit)<br />
<br />
The replies in the other threads are either unrelated or suggest this but how come everyone is just avoiding the actual question. Is it actually impossible?<br />
Is the error message that they give misleading/outdated?<br />
Unfortunately, everything seems to compound and make me more annoyed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The whole point of me asking is to confirm all this because, although I have already changed my name to ". .", I feel it is a bit unsatisfactory. (I have aliases because I send emails for my parents who don't speak English well and/or are not familiar enough
 with technology to want to learn how to use an email account. I have been doing this for years but only recently did I realised that the settings have changed and now all those emails I have sent have my name attached to them).<br />
<br />
<br />
ps I'm sure I am just repeating myself and going in circles at this point but the silver lining seems to be that at least your reply seems more human and less robotic than the ones I see in this forum..</p>
<p>...even though I would have to assume you just read the title of this thread but ignored the content/context&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am not asking about (just) hiding my last name. (Did I mention anything about a last name? o.O)<br />
<br />
1. when trying to remove the name the error message says you can control your privacy settings. The fact that you can't makes me annoyed since they changed the settings sometime in the last decade and I only realised recently.<br />
<br />
2. even though I can and HAVE changed my name to ". .", I still don't like the fact that all my emails will have those dots. I send emails on behalf of my parents from the same account so it seems like in the future I would need create multiple email accounts
 constantly log in and log out to avoid this issue.<br />
(an email that says John smith but the content is jane johnson seems more suspicious. and right now ALL my emails with have 2 dots. even if the system does not consider it spam, people might. do you see why I don't find this as an ideal solution?)<br />
<br />
3. I get that it gets ambiguous sometimes but when I asked in the original question about "hiding", from the context given I guess I was trying to imply if it was possible to still have my name as my name but just hide it from all emails that i send regardless
 of if I am using an alias. &nbsp;Or maybe based on the error message when removing the name, there could be an option to not hide my name from people in my address book.<br />
<br />
(..and yes I mean using a browser because I don't have access to the microsoft outlook program 24/7, unless using that program will override the privacy settings across all platforms, but it seems like the first mod will never reply me on that and those other
 follow up questions) <br />
<br />
<strong>At this point, I don't even know why you are replying with even more questions that ignore my question. I am just waiting for a "no you can't". Simple answer to my question. It is all I am expecting at this point...<br />
</strong>... are&nbsp;you actually curious about my intent? Are you being defensive? Is this all considered an attack on microsoft or something? I asked a simple question about if something is possible because I found that all the given threads/solutions don't actually
 answer the question and provide alternatives that I find unsatisfactory. (just like that first reply)<br />
<strong>If there are other alternatives I am happy to listen, otherwise please just say there is none.<br />
</strong>Not looking for an argument.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps I take the humanity thing back. Your posts seem human but your topic seems completely bot-like. The closest thing to a last name would be the error message that i encountered saying I can't remove the first or last name or the first mod reply with a link
 to a thread asking about only displaying the last name in emails or something. <br />
<strong>Are you a re-purposed spam bot that just searched random trigger key words to generate replies?</strong><br />
(Not trying to be mean but I am treating this forum as a joke because the replies seem like a joke.... and a small part of me is seriously thinking that the replies are made by bots)</p>

            Doesn't really matter because at any time people could have stopped using an account and could be hacked by a bot.<br />
It also isn't that hard to copy basic speech/typing patterns.<br />
And I am not really invested enough to check... and I feel like I have even less reason too because I feel like everything I write is being ignored.<br />
<br />
Given than your name and picture makes me think your first language is English, I can't place you under "one of the minions people tend to hire from overseas who can't speak english and just follow a script". Then aside from being a bot it seems the only other
 conclusion I could make but I did not want to is that you don't actually care about my question since all your replies in no way shows that you have even read it and understood it.<br />
<br />
So instead of saying yes, no, maybe or I don't know.. your replies just seem to want to make me argue about tangents and other things which is not actually contributing to the answer I am looking for a confirmation for.<br />
<br />
So the easiest thing I can do is just assume you are a bot.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
(The only reason I am replying is to vent off some steam which might also increase the stress a bit but it also makes me feel a bit better in the short term. The more unhelpful replies there are... the more of a joke this forum seems to be. Seems like you can
 only roll the dice and hope the trigger keywords happen to generate the right solution link and/or copy &amp; paste set of instructions... otherwise your question will be ignored like mine seems to be.)
<br />
<br />
<strong>Special bonus question:</strong><br />
Have you actually read my question at the top? (Just everything between<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Just to confirm"</span> and

<br />
A few more feedback:<br />
<br />
1. Some of the older threads have a similar reply with a link like that but the link is broken.<br />
2. You should really put an search function in that submission otherwise there might be 100 similar ideas with 10 votes each<br />
3. I hope I don't have to explain why I am replying here instead of that suggestion site (since i found multiple similar suggestions already and i just voted on 1 ... but given point #2, I don't have much hope for it to actually go through)<br />

    <title>O365 Import service for PST files - is there a recommended maximum no. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> all it needs  say:</h3>
<h2>            O365 Import service for PST files - is there a recommended maximum no. PST files per import batch&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to import a big number of PST files to the O365 mailboxes of&nbsp;our organization. Think about more than 20000. I have read the support article about the O365 Import Service, with the upload of PST files with AzCopy, the CSV file to define the
 mapping between PST and mailbox.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>My questions</p>
</div>
<div><br />
1. Is there a (recommended) maximum number of PST files we should take into account when:</div>
<ul>
<li>uploading the PST files to O365 (Azure blob)</li><li>importing the PST files in the mailboxes</li></ul>
<div>
<p>2. Or should we look at the total volume of the PST files per job?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>3. What happens when a certain PST file cannot be uploaded, will it be skipped or will the complete job fail?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to&nbsp;estimate&nbsp;the workload for an administrator who needs to perform this job. Will it take his attention for a few full days or just a few moments per day?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thanks!<br />
Danny</div>

            <p><span>Hi Danny,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no official article describing that there is a limitation on the number of the PST files.</span></p>
<p><span>But the maximum size of&nbsp;one PST file 10 GB. If one file&nbsp;is larger than 10 GB, please break&nbsp;it up into smaller files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a certain PST file cannot be uploaded</span><span>, this one will fail. It will not affect other PST files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It only </span>
<span>takes the adminโs attention for just a few moments per day.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Monique</span></p>

<h2>            Click to dial stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Using Outlook for Android, clicking on a phone # used to bring up the dialer. It stopped working so I went in the Outlook app to Help &amp; Feedback to "contact support" and the technician who I chatted with said that "click to dial is not a feature of outlook
 mobile".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working fine and then stoppod out of nowhere. Anything else I can do? Not for my phone but for a user of mine.</p>

            Hi pstoric,<br />
<br />
Like mentioned by engineers from our related teams, itโs not feasible to click to dial a number in Outlook for Android. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
In addition, your best bet for the most expert help with Outlook for iOS or Android is right inside the app. I suggest you

communicate with the in-app support</a> for any other issues related to the application. Thanks for your time and cooperation.<br />

<h2>            Open one note folder on network folder from iPad</h2>
                    Can you open a one note folder that is on a network location from an iPad. &nbsp;Company policy does not permit publishing One Note files to web. &nbsp;However, I can publish to company shared folder. &nbsp;And I can access the shared folder on the iPad from within a
 VPN from the company Internet.

<div>Can someone advise if the iPad One Note version can open this group file? &nbsp;Or does the iPad version only access files from Sky Drive?</div>

<p>See if this helps: <a href="http://www.onenote-tips.com/tips/on4iphone.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.onenote-tips.com/tips/on4iphone.html</a></p>
<p>If you really need those notes, and you have Internet connectivity,&nbsp;you could maybe use a remote desktop app on the iPad to access a desktop PC running OneNote 2010 that can access your network share.</p>

<h2>            Cortana on Build 14342 Keeps Popping Up</h2>
                    I upgraded my test computer which is a laptop to build 14342. Anytime my cursor is anywhere near the Cortana Icon on my task Cortana keeps popping up. I tried to hide the icon, which I cannot seem to do on this build. It is very annoying. Previous builds
 came up with a search icon. It keeps asking my how can I help you or jumps to a web search. I did send feedback. On regular computer that has a non insider build of 10536.318 and I don't have any issues with Cortana. It just is on the test build.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Office 2007</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a downgrade of MS Office: Office 2007. When I try to double click on a file to open it directly in Word 2007 I keep getting a window telling me that I need to buy or activate it. I enter my license key but it won't accept it and it keeps
 telling me that I don't have Office 2013. Well...I don't. I don't have Office 2013. I have Office 2007--which I legally paid for. If I open Word 2007 and then open the file, everything is okay but there are times when it is more convenient to open one of my
 files directly in Word 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA,</p>
<p>kk</p>

            There maybe a trial version of a later version (2013 or 2016) of Office on your machine.&nbsp; Remove that via the Control Panel and&nbsp; then repair the Office 2007 installation.

            <p>Totally, AGREE! Tonight, I lost over 6k LINE items on my spread sheet due to MS Excel 2016! All I did was, create a new SS in my work book, copy and paste. then, I edited the new SS by deleting some items. Guess What? Excel, deleted ALL the items on both
 spreadsheets. After 14 crashes of Excel in the last 6 weeks, and now this, ready to package up 2016 and ship it back to MS in an empty box because, I got, an empty PRODUCT! This entire episode with MS 2016 everything, at $250, has been a frigging nightmare!
 Crashing WORD; CRASHING Outlook; can't access Outlook because MS changed access pathways, Outlook assigned an ADMIN automatically ( and you CAN NOT ACCES THIS ONE folks!); and so on, and so on. Where was the fine print, before I paid the BIG BUCKS, to get
 this ****? Yes, I am peed off! Should, I not be after all this???? To recover from this latest episode, will take me 2-3 months, to rebuild the SS as I have saved the SS from teh 14 CRASHES from Excel 2016 from the last 6 weeks. Sucks, the entire MS 2016 sucks!
 If you are thinking about buying it, DO NOT, The last time I posted a bad review about MS 2016, my comments got removed; so this may too be removed as MS does not want to hear " bad things". Sick, really sick, of EVERYTHING MS 2016, crashing, loosing thing
 I had before, etc. This program, really sucks! NO wonder, it was free. Should have gone with the golden rule: if it sounds to good to be true (free!), then walk away. Walk away folks; go to another option.
</p>
<p>BTW, MS, I gave you my issue-s above.&nbsp; If you have to ask, what specifically, I was doing at the time of my issues:&nbsp; is that enough to MS to say, I should not have had issues?&nbsp; And, does that restore me back to the 600 hours I put into building the SS in
 the last 3-4 moths I had MS 2016?&nbsp; I go through "updates" from MS 2016 2-3 days a week - that alone tells me, MS 2016, ain't right and ain't working.</p>

            <p>I have used Mac Excel since 1.0 &nbsp;- you know when Mac had Excel ( made for the Mac) for 2 years while PC's were still using VISI-CALC</p>
<p>
</p><p>2016 represents the worst I have ever seen in a Mac program - maybe it's acceptable or the PC world to only work on ONE spreadsheet at a time and have corruption all the time. but not for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 simple spreadsheets open, I run a subtotal on one - I KNOW I am working on THAT one because the dropdown of WHAT to subtotal match THIS spreadsheet and NOT the other spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Excel shows INSERTING SUBTOTALS on the other spreadsheet and fails and crashes</p>
<p>
</p><p>OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN - with different spreadsheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do a MOVE of a sheet to a NEW workbook and it gets inserted in another spreadsheet</p>
<p>
</p><p>why have you released such an inferior, buggy piece of software</p>

            <p>Let's begin on a positive note. For years I've said that Excel is the finest product Microsoft makes.&nbsp; Except for Excel 2016 for Mac, I believe that.&nbsp; If you factor this version in however, the charm drops fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For starters, when you do a find (I do this a LOT) the default is the little search bar at the top, not the full search interface window like other versions of Excel. So... I have to manually open the window and tell it all the stuff I need to tweak (search
 by columns, find/replace, search entire cell contents etc.).&nbsp; I unlike seemingly many excel users work with data and a little quickie finder bar has no use for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I cut and past rows in 2016 Excel for Mac (from here on out - Excel), it seems to go out to lunch for 10-15 seconds. I can literally read the line where it was and think I missed cutting part of the content.&nbsp; I don't get this in my other versions on
 the same spreadsheets and no, it's not a hardware resource problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight I'm being bugged by in inexplicable inability to insert a column. I get a message that if I do so would overwrite content and I have to remove the content to the right of where I want my blank column. I have no hidden columns, it just won't do it.
 I'm not about to cut/paste columns D thru BD... I'll wait until I get to the office on Windows and insert the column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Excel seems to have a really hard time sorting complex numbers and simply fails. I have products with ID's like this&nbsp; 10-3001, 10-3002, 11-2005, 12-3000 etc.&nbsp; It constantly strews the 10's throughout the rows and I have to manually cut and paste rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connected to the above, clearly Excel thinks some of these funky numbers want to be dates.&nbsp; If I format the column as General, it gets confused and sometimes converts a cell to a date. If I change it to a number with no decimal and no comma, not all the
 cells convert and I get little message flags throughout the column. I have resorted to changing the columns to TEXT but naturally that has it's downsides as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not being able to customize the top tab bar is a real looser.&nbsp; Since I work with a lot of data I like having a custom section that has all the insert/delete commands as big buttons - insert row, delete row, insert column, delete column, insert cell, delete
 cell.&nbsp; I have to bludgeon with the two buttons provided which adds clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are times when I try to highlight a row and it simply won't highlight. I've found if I save and close the workbook and open it again it's happy... I think it's trying to text while driving and has forgotten me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I can think of right now but there are other things. This roll out has made me nuts. I think perhaps the dev team is working on stuff that is cool but doesn't help core use (e.g. macro's or something).&nbsp; What about just plain ole functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, it beats whatever is #2 is this market.... is there a #2 in this market?</p>

Our staff of 15 accountants is ready to throw Office out the window. &nbsp;It routinely crashes 4 or 5 times per day. &nbsp;You are working along and then the screen goes white and reboots and you lose your work. &nbsp;It is a very unstable product. &nbsp;I sold all of my Microsoft
 stock this year after realizing this company is going down the tubes!

<p>It's not weird, it just stinks,&nbsp; The pencil necks at MS just, like they always do, just change functions and tools without thinking.&nbsp; Case in point, when you try to open a file and would like to go to a recent folder, guest what you can't.&nbsp; When you get
 a CSV file and open from the folder the options for opening do not include Excel.&nbsp; Typical oligarchy.&nbsp; They get big, drive out the competition and then just lay our ****.</p>

<p>I have been using Excel for the past 20 Years, and it has never been as bad as it is now in office 2016 and 365. It crashes so often, at first i thought i had too many formulas, so i removed all formulas and pivot tables but still it crashed. I changed machines
 from core i5 to core i7 still was having the same problem.</p>
<p>Now I gave up and &nbsp;have gone back to office 2010, and not only is it faster to work with all my</p>
<p>&nbsp;formulas, it just doesn't crash at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wish this was the experience I am having. I've had mine crash because it glitches swapping between a few open spreadsheets. When it does it just closes. You don't see an oops screen or Excel has crashed, just it closes like you told it to close yourself.
 I suspect memory leaks as the behaviour is that of a program running low on memory. I've lost hours of work due to this happening. Do you think the next time I opened it it asked if I wanted to recover.........nope. I went looking for the files because I thought,
 surely some form of this exist on the PC.......nope. Maybe you're working in Office 64bit. Maybe that one is stable. Mine is a joke. It's 32 bit (not my choice, the company I work for decided this even though we have 8GB RAM laptops) and has the power of a
 small hair dryer. On a modern i5 processor with the 4GB it can address and an SSD it brain farts when trying to copy data from a website, even when pasting text only(as in ignore formatting). Sometimes it won't let me click any menu items until I switch tabs
 and go back. Earlier I used a Conditional Format and the program went totally unresponsive for a few minutes. I finally was able to save it, and all other sheets because I've learned my lesson there, and close it. I was in IT and I'm familiar with problems
 and all programs have them here or there, but I have to agree with most on here that this version is a huge step backwards. I'm sure I can go from desktop to laptop to phone to tablet and eat beef jerky at the same time and think "Wow this all looks the same
 on this device and the others" but in its current incarnation I wouldn't trust it no matter what screen it's on. I won't even start on the eyesore they labelled Outlook and then insulted us with themes called Colorful and White. It's funny go back 20 years
 and Microsoft was bailing Apple out and saving them by putting office on a Mac. Now look who's having trouble... Sometimes CHOICES influence these things. Ignoring customers is one such choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Restoring Windows 8 Problem</h2>
                    On my Asus tablet M81C, I installed the windows 10 insider preview on it since February, when build 10122 was released, I installed it with lots of problems like the issue of lack of hard drive. So I decided to reinstall the windows (build 10122) to basically
 start afresh, but now when I want to revert back to windows 8, or upgrade to windows 10130, it won't allow me. So what should I do?&nbsp;
