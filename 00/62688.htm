<h2>            Win 7 calendar gadget shows only orange background</h2>
                    
<p><span>Recently the Win 7 Calendar gadget lost its data. I now only get a plain orange background with no date. I have already tried registering the VB Script DLL as suggested
 by another forum. (regsvr32.exe vbscript.dll ) It announced the registration was successful but had no effect.</span></p>

<p><span>Hey on_glide,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you restart the gadget after registering the .dll?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the registration to be effective, close the calendar gadget and re-open it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are other things you may try.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Uninstall and re-install the calendar.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Here’s how:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open
<strong>Programs and Features</strong> in the Control Panel. </span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong> in the left column of the Programs and Features window.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Uncheck
<strong>Windows Gadget Platform.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Restart Now</strong> to reboot the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Place checkmark for
<strong>Windows Gadget Platform.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run the gadget and see if date is displayed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Refer:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Run System File Checker (SFC) Scan</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above steps fail, it could be possible that some of the system files are corrupt leading to this behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run SFC scan to check for any integrity violation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It could be that your external hard drive may be faulty. &nbsp;I recommend plugging it into your PC to see if it recognized on there. &nbsp;If it is try it again with your Xbox One. &nbsp;If it is not try returning it for a replacement.

<p>It works fine on the pc. I tried another external hard drive I have. A WD 1tb and I don't get any message at all. Nothing. At least with the Seagate it says Try a Different Device. With the Western Digital I get nothing.</p>
<p>Is there a way to force the xbox one to detect devices?</p>

<p>Not that I am aware of. &nbsp;If it is not detecting the External HDD's (with the spec's met, which you are aware of in your OP) then your Xbox One may have an issue. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a HGST Touro S 1 tb drive that wasn't detected by my Xbox One. I tried everything that you did. I was able to resolve the issue by replacing the USB 3.0 cable. For some reason the Usb 3.0 cable that came included with the drive does not work with Xbox
 One. It worked fine with my PC and everything else, just not with my Xbox One.</p>

<p>I was also able to resolve the issue be changing the cable. For some reason the cable that comes with the Seagate Backup Plus is not 100% compatible with the xBox One. In this case i have a 4TB&nbsp;Seagate Backup Plus</p>

    <title>Windows 10 issues&#58; Sleep when closing lid - Screen resolution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevengreenstein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 issues&#58;  Sleep when closing lid - Screen resolution issue - Recent Search - WiFi</h2>
                    <p>Notebook, Lenovo Helix 64-bit Windows 10 Pro with i7 Processor and 8 GB RAM and plenty of reserve disk space on a SSID drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Sleep- I will close the lid once, and it will resume fine, but typically upon resume, but everything seems slightly out of focus. &nbsp;Close the lid twice, the whole system will start to be goofy. &nbsp;For example, I will go to add a file to an email, and I
 really don't know what I am clicking on because the mouse pointer will disappear, so I am blindly selecting files to add. &nbsp;Another example, icons on the Screen, like Acrobat PDFs, native ones the icons will be normal, but saved as ones, will appear as black
 boxes. &nbsp;For all of this, my fix is a restart. &nbsp;Sleep has been an ongoing problem with Windows in general, and drives me crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Screen focus resolution. &nbsp;Randomly, the Screen will just look like it is not at the native resolution of 1920 x 1080, and be out of focus, but it is. &nbsp; Restart will fix, but, I should not have to do it. &nbsp;Updated drivers from Intel, no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Windows 8.1 and less, always, remembered immediately the last file and folder I saved a file into. &nbsp;With Windows 10, it will remember eventually the most recently saved. &nbsp;The loss of this feature is hindering my workflow, and slowing me down. &nbsp;Any workarounds
 out there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;Network WiFi - Again after sleep, it will not find available WiFi networks, or recognize my built-in SIM with Mobile Card. &nbsp;Restart is only fix. &nbsp;Updated drivers from Intel, no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a complete clean install 3 weeks ago and updated Windows with the November major update. &nbsp;No changes to the above. &nbsp;The rest of the goofy behavior that resulted after updating 8.1 to 10 went away. &nbsp;I did determine, a clean install versus the upgrade
 made a huge difference. &nbsp; All drivers are up to date from Lenovo. &nbsp;Updating drivers did not fix video issue, Wifi issue or display issue.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your suggestion, I figure I will deal with one issue at a time #1 #2, which seem to be related, first the fuzzy Screen resolution after closing the lid, have it go to sleep, and reopening and signing back in. &nbsp;I went to the Intel website, downloaded
 the latest graphics driver package, clicked on Compatibility Tab, the drop down did not include Windows 10, only up to 8. &nbsp;I decided to let it run the compatibility test, and came back with XP. &nbsp;I decided to override that and went for Windows 8 choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result, the Screen is sharper after restart on my remote monitor, and as a standalone Notebook, but closing the lid, and then bringing it back from sleep, same result, fuzzy. &nbsp;Fuzzy on the Notebook monitor, fuzzy on the remote monitor. &nbsp;Also, as before,
 it does not remember the proper resolution for either the Notebook monitor or my remote display. &nbsp;Only fix still is shutdown completely, and startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I try reloading the driver in XP compatibility mode? &nbsp;Would not hurt, I will try. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Also, on #1, I have correction, and I think this this a separate issue, but stated it wrong:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"For example, I will go to add a file to an email, and I really don't know what I am clicking on because the mouse pointer will disappear, so I am blindly selecting files to add. "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What I meant is I am seeing the pointer from the mouse movement, what I am not seeing is it highlighting different files I would select. &nbsp;It should highlight the one I have the mouse
 pointer on. &nbsp;If do a Ctrl- Left Click and select two files, I have no idea what files I selected. &nbsp;Down in the dialog box it says I have selected two files, but no clue which ones. &nbsp;See attached Screen shot. &nbsp;I made up a test folder, put 3 files into, selected
 with the mouse pointer 2 of them, but they should be highlighted, so I know what I selected. &nbsp;This happens randomly, sometimes after waking from sleep, or even after a complete shutdown.</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/047615dc-2c9c-4df1-8ff9-6a5d6a143089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/047615dc-2c9c-4df1-8ff9-6a5d6a143089" /></a></p>

            <p>Thank you! &nbsp;I ran sfc /scannow and ran&nbsp;dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth. &nbsp;That fixed the issue with the mouse pointer disappearing randomly and after sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also, if possible ran in compatibility mode the updates to address the screen focus issue after sleep, but it suggested to run in XP mode??? &nbsp;Did not seem correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues left in Windows 10 Pro:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;After Sleep (close lid) randomly Fuzzy screen and some loss of functionality, like WiFi stops working. &nbsp;Only fix is restart or shutdown.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;If I unplug from ThinkPad Dock, Display settings were at 100% for my 21" monitor and change to 150% for my 12" laptop display. &nbsp;But, many applications that are open like Chrome or Acrobat Pro remain at 100%, which is tiny for my 12" display. &nbsp; Only fix
 to get Display settings to be correct for my 12" laptop display is a restart or shutdown for the applications that don't respond. &nbsp;In Windows 8.1, I could unplug, plug, sleep, and everything would adjust accordingly.</p>

            Hi  iMohiX
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Flight simulator was last released in 2006, so, it is not certified compatible with recent versions of Windows. 
<br />
<br />Your best option is to set up a dual boot configuration with an older version of Windows, such as Windows 7 32 bit and install it there. This is if your hardware can still run Windows 7. Most modern computers especially those with Skylake and Kabylake processors or AMD Ryzen don't support Windows 7. 
<br />
<br />If yours does, then here is how you do it:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-dual-boot-windows-7-or-windows-8-with/9ac7acc1-2152-4907-a9de-bd507273a57d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Another option is compatibility mode, but many Flight Simulator users have seen limited success with it, but its worth a try as a first option:

<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, the System Event Errors are occurring on 3 Windows 10 Pro PCs ( 1 32 Bit and 2 64 Bit). Sorry, but I find it hard to believe that I have 3 corrupted user profiles. This reminds me of the Windows 10 Pro v1511 update where&nbsp;networked
 PCs disappeared &nbsp;and regedit failed.&nbsp; Microsoft Support had persons like me jumping through hoops for problems created by the Windows Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many web searches, I found&nbsp;a&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;solution as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Open regedit,and navigate to the following key:</em></p>
<p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SubSystems\Windows</em></p>
<p><em>Find the following value: "Windows SharedSection=X,Y,Z".</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Where X,Y and Z are the values you'll found there.</em></p>
<p><em>The Desktop Heap Is the the "Y" value.</em></p>
<p><em>Double this value, and then reboot the box.</em></p>
<p>

    <title>HDMI-Windows Vista problem&#47;No sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chinamonk  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI-Windows Vista problem&#47;No sound </h2>
                    I have sound problems with a new system build where a Panasonic Viera tv is linked to the system via an HDMI cable. On start-up, Windows will play a truncated version of the Windows welcome sound at the Windows logo screen appearing before the password
 screen. (The first part of the welcome sound is cut-off, but the rest of the welcome sound plays through to the end.) No system sounds will generally play after that point, and tests in the Sound part of the Control Panel will only play one or two very muffled
 beeps (i.e. not the full register of tones that should play if the test is working).<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, iTunes runs beautifully, and I can get full audio from audio and video programs run on iTunes. So long as iTunes is running and has played at least a short clip from an audio or visual program, Vista's system sounds (and the test sounds
 in the Control Panel) will also play. If iTunes is closed, though, Vista's system sounds no longer work properly.<br />
<br />
1. I have updated all drivers to the latest version recommended by Asus (the manufacturer of the motherboard). When that didn't work, I installed the latest version of the drivers published by NVIDIA for the motherboard chipset, GPU and HDMI sound and the latest
 version of the drivers published by Realtek for the onboard sound chip.<br />
<br />
2. When that didn't work I reinstalled a clean version of Windows, and reinstalled the latest version of the drivers recommended by Asus for the motherboard.<br />
<br />
3. In the sound control, I have tried SPDIF out, digital out, Realtek HDMI out and NVIDIA HDMI out settings. The NVIDIA HDMI settings have gotten the only positive results to date (see description above of current limited capabilities, only available under
 NVIDIA HDMI settings).<br />
<br />
Since this problem does not seem to affect iTunes (but affects Windows Vista by itself), I suspect that this is a problem with the way Vista handles the sound drivers. Moreover, I have scoured the Internet to find a solution, and the problem of Vista not properly
 pushing sound over HDMI (while third party programs process sound correctly) seems to show up in a lot of forums.<br />
<br />
System specifications:<br />
<br />
Motherboard: P5N7A-VM, with onboard GeForce 9300/nForce 730i, bios version 0514<br />
CPU: Intel E7300<br />
Memory: 2x1GB Corsair XMS2 800DDR2<br />
OS: Vista 32-bit, SP2, Home Premium edition<br />
PSU: Antec Earthwatts EA380<br />
<br />
I have posted this at the bottom of another thread, but suspect that thread is dead.

<span>Hello Chinamonk,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting to Microsoft Vista Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may try to follow the steps below and try to enable and set the digital output HDMI device as default. It might help us fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp; Click Start, and then Control Panel.
<br />
2.&nbsp; Click Hardware and Sounds, and then click managing audio devices.<br />
3.&nbsp; Click on Playback tab<br />
3.&nbsp; In empty space of playback devices right click and use the option to show all disabled devices, you should get a&nbsp;popup up with digital output HDMI.<br />
4.&nbsp; If you find digital HDMI output Device, right click on it and set it as default communication device</span></p>
<p>
<span>Following the above steps might help us fix the audio issue with HDMI.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the issue persists, reply back with the following details:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Did you install any third party software for sound?</span>
</li><li>
<span>What are the applications did you install after performing a clean install?</span>
</li><li>
<span>Have you tried to set the HDMI device as a default device without installing any third party application (like itunes) and only by installing sound drivers and display drivers.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Does it work fine if you use external speakers?</span>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Hope it helps.
</span></p>
<p>

            Thanks, Srinivas.&nbsp; I have previously checked all disabled devices and tried each one as the default device to see whether that would made any difference.&nbsp; (Apologies if this was not clear, but that was the reference to trying "SPDIF out, digital out, Realtek
 HDMI out and NVIDIA HDMI" in my prior post.)&nbsp; In response to your questions (numbering tracks your numbering):<br />
<br />
(1)&nbsp; I do not have any third party software specifically for sound other than the drivers recommended by the motherboard manufacturer.<br />
(2)&nbsp; The only applications on my system are Internet Explorer, Firefox and iTunes.<br />
(3)&nbsp; I do not think I have previously tried the HDMI device as a default device before installing third party applications.&nbsp; I will try this in the next couple of days (need to find some time to go through the process of a clean install).<br />
(4)&nbsp; The system worked fine with external speakers before it was hooked up to the TV.&nbsp; Since that time (and since going through the steps outlined in my prior e-mail) I have not hooked the system up to external speakers again, but I will do this and report
 back.<br />

            It took me awhile to reinstall Vista, but even if the HDMI device is selected as the default device before installing third party applications, the Vista system sounds still do not work.&nbsp; The system works fine with external speakers in analogue.<br />
<br />
With the new install of Vista (without installing any third party applications), I have also run some tests on the sound using software packages built into Vista.&nbsp; Like iTunes, Windows Media Center works fine with HDMI and, when Windows Media Center is running,
 system sounds will also work over HDMI.&nbsp; The minute Windows Media Center is closed, though, Windows Vista system sounds no longer work.&nbsp; This is exactly the behavior that I was getting with iTunes.

<p><span>Hi Chinamonk,</span></p>
<p><span>If your system is Windows Vista, what you&nbsp;do is&nbsp;you copy this file name: STacSV64.exe, paste it in the search bar in the start menu, press enter, right-click on the file with the same name,
 click on&nbsp;<strong>Open file location</strong>, and double-click onto this file: suhlp64. It will&nbsp;download and install the correct&nbsp;driver&nbsp;software to&nbsp;activate your audio. (Create a shortcut of it for a backup&nbsp;in case you lose your audio again.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Chinamonk,<br />
just to make sure I am up to date...you may have tried this already, but these are my thoughts.<br />
I would uninstall Itunes, WMP, and any media player you have. Do a clean boot and disconnect the HDMI and reset settings.<br />
Do you hear all sounds?<br />
If so, try adding HDMI...can you hear sound?<br />
Next add back WMP and check sound.<br />
Lastly add back ITunes.<br />
Did u still run into issues? If so, at which point?<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Eddie B.<br />

 files will also fail to produce any sound.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>However, playing AVI files, MP3 files or even off Youtube is fine. In fact, when playing such files, testing the Windows sound effects actually works. i.e. if I play an MP3 file using WMP and I try to test-play the Windows login music, both tracks will
 play over the speakers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is only the Windows sound files that will not play correctly.&nbsp;</div>

<h3> scoy99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replacement Product Key for OS Reinstall</h2>
                    I have an Alienware M15X R2, that came with Win7 Home Premium 64bit. &nbsp; My HDD crashed and I have a replacement.&nbsp; The sticker on the laptop is worn and I cannot see the product key.&nbsp; I have the install disk that came with it, but how can I get a copy of
 the original product key to reinstall the OS on this machine?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any assistance.

            <p>Assuming that you are trying to reinstall the same Edition&nbsp;of Windows [Home premium etc] that was preinstalled when Dell sold you the computer:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should have skipped the dialog that asked for the product key during installation [I think the button is labelled
<em>Do this later after installation completes</em>].&nbsp; The message you are getting implies that you tried to enter something - what did you try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Dell is not an Alienware.&nbsp; When I changed my HDD,&nbsp;I was able to install and activate using Dell's reinstallation DVD without entering any product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you now have no choice but to repeat the installation procedure and click on&nbsp;<em>Do this later after installation completes</em> when it asks for the product key.&nbsp; When installation has completed, you can go to&nbsp;Control panel,&nbsp;System page to&nbsp;click
 on activate&nbsp;- it should do so without asking for a product key.</p>

            The recovery disk should work but the OP changed out the HDD. That may have been enough that the OEM key won't work anymore, e.g. it's not the same computer.&nbsp;

</p><p>That is incorrect.&nbsp; An HDD change does not make it "not the same computer", only a CPU or motherboard change would do so.</p>

            Just saying that there are a lot of accounts where just changing the HDD out due to crash has resulted in inability to normally activate OEM windows. Not that it is right or anything. I think if the OP calls, he should be able to get it activated.&nbsp;

<h2>            SD Card reader not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SD card reader has stopped working. It was working fine with Windows 10 and its only recently that its stopped. I cant say exactly when, I don't know. It's built into my Acer Aspire 5750z and would rather not have to use an external USB convertor.</p>
<p>When I try using the troubleshooter, it doesn't see a problem.</p>
<p>In Device Manager, it only shows under SD Host Adapters if I select the option to see hidden devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has the most up to date driver available, I just don't understand why it's hidden and I can't make it work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> melv1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#58; 7001, No Programs will run,</h2>
                    <p>This started a couple days ago on Thursday. When logging into windows as normal, sometimes it hangs up on the welcome screen and I have to force shutdown. If I do log in, I can't open any programs. If I try to open Firefox, for example, Firefox won't open,
 but in the Task Manager it will show up under Processes, but not under Applications. If I try to open something from the Run box, like msconfig or cmd, nothing will pop up. Although cmd works if I press windows + r get to it. Sometimes the whole start menu
 will freeze. When I try to restart or shutdown, the computer hangs on the logout screen and goes no further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in safe mode right now, which works perfectly fine. Things I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Updated Malwarebytes and scanned</li><li>sfc /scannow </li><li>chkdsk c: /r</li><li>Windows Memory Diagnostic</li><li>Clean boot with no start up items selected</li></ul>
<p>Nothing showed any errors with the computer or fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my event viewer I have some errors, and this one appears to show up dozens and dozens of times:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">The Computer Browser service depends on the Server service which failed to start because of the following error:
<br />

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Security Accounts Manager</li><li>Server </li><li>Computer Browser</li></ul>
<p>are not started. I can't start Security Accounts Manager in safe mode, but I can't get to the services window in normal mode since the window just won't appear. Do I need to start&nbsp;Security Accounts Manager and can I start it from the command prompt somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't do a system restore since the last restore point is from January.</p>

<h2>            Rainbow Six Siege Thoughts, Ideas, and suggestions</h2>
                    
<p><span>What's happening everybody? First and foremost, I just have to say that it's about time this game comes out! I've been playing Rainbow Six franchise on the Xbox 360 since Rainbow Six Vegas 1 and 2. My gamer tags were: guff3dgfan, IGuFF IMaIN, H3K Snake
 Eyes, H3K Ep1D3M1C, H3K L3G1ON, and MARVEL PUN1Sh3R. I played Rainbow Six Vegas 2 religiously at least, 2 to 20 hours a week since Rainbow Six Vegas 2 came out on March 18, 2008.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>I really want to thank you for the code to start testing in the closed Technical Test from September 21, 2015 to September 23, 2015. My friend and I, have taken turns since September 21, 2015. I think my level 30 rank and all the operators can justify
<span>I really want to thank you for the code to start testing in the closed Technical Test from September 21, 2015 to September 23, 2015. My friend and I, have taken turns since September 21, 2015. I think my level 30 rank and all the operators can justify
 that, my friends are Rainbow Six enthusiasts. But enough about me, as I have beta tested games in the past, let's get to my rating, thoughts, ideas and suggestions.</span><br />
<br />
<span>The servers although are better than 343 servers at launch and currently for Halo: The Master Chief Collection are significantly better, there are some issues I'm experiencing. Over the course of the week, I ran into the following error code 0-0x00000206,
<span>The servers although are better than 343 servers at launch and currently for Halo: The Master Chief Collection are significantly better, there are some issues I'm experiencing. Over the course of the week, I ran into the following error code 0-0x00000206,
 which is a Ubisoft Server Connection error and will kick you back to the main menu. This happened periodically, but most recently on September 25, 2015 at 7:33 PM Eastern.</span></p>
<p><span>The weapon mechanics are pretty spot on, although I do have some issues with the shotguns and shield. The range on the shotguns need to be increased a bit, the weapon damage decreased and the shields are extremely overpowered, I chucked two frag grenades
 in a multi player match several times and still couldn't kill someone behind the shield. The shield fix could be, as simple, as just allowing a spot to shoot the feet, or gun so it lowers the shield.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>I really like the drone, it is extremely cool and a fresh gadget. I just want to be able, to snake cam a door, if this is at all possible for both the attackers and defenders. I would also like to see the ability to hug the wall, and shoot in the door
<span>I really like the drone, it is extremely cool and a fresh gadget. I just want to be able, to snake cam a door, if this is at all possible for both the attackers and defenders. I would also like to see the ability to hug the wall, and shoot in the door
 or window while having limited cover. I realize this can create camping and for new comers, not a balanced experience but all the Rainbow Six Vegas 2 veterans use this tactic and incorporating it into the game would be awesome.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Attackers and Defenders concept is a great addition. If it is possible, please make during the game launch the ability to choose an attacker or defender for every player, so if you like a class you don't have to be bummed, if you don't get that operator.

 When the game launches, if you could add the ability to customize an operator or custom class, so you can choose the weapon best suited for you would be an awesome add on. IF it is possible, I would like to see a radar like the Rainbow Six Vegas games had.</span><br />
<br />
<span>As far as gadgets, I would like to see the following: C4 (candy bars), motion sensors, radar detectors, etc. Hopefully, there will be night vision and info red vision at the game launch, but if it isn't this should be added in.</span><br />

<span>Here is some suggestions I have for those on the Xbox 360 still playing, it would be nice gesture. I think since there are several hundreds of players still playing on the Rainbow Six Vegas 2 servers, it would be incredible, if you offered a discount
<span>Here is some suggestions I have for those on the Xbox 360 still playing, it would be nice gesture. I think since there are several hundreds of players still playing on the Rainbow Six Vegas 2 servers, it would be incredible, if you offered a discount
 to those gamer tags still playing or even better a free game and base it on time played on the Rainbow Six Vegas games. I have a lot of friends who I played in the Team H3KT1K KN1GHTS sqaud (H3K service tag), friends, regular hosts, and players, but they don't
 have funds or incentive to switch to the Xbox One.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I realize some of these thoughts, ideas, and suggestions may not be available at launch, however any add-on or improvements would be incredible. Keep up the great work and please come out with this game by end of this year. It has been exactly 7 years,

<p>I have received an E-mail giving me a code to download Tom Clancy's rainbow six siege beta. Nowhere on the e-mail does it say only for X-box One, PS4 and PC. Since I have entered the code and attempted to download it and spent almost 2 hours with tech support
 to find it can't play on X-box 360 my question is.... Will it be available on the X-box 360?</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege is a PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Being that, if you preorder the game they give you backwards compatibility for Rainbow Six Vegas 1 and 2, there really is no point to have it on the Xbox 360. The beta is well done and with a release date of
 December 1, 2015, which is in time for Christmas of 2015.</p>

<p>I wanted to give an independent review on the Technical Test and Closed Beta. I had a great time overall and was sad to see it end on October 4, 2015. My friends and I really enjoyed the Technical Test and Closed Beta. Before I start with the overall review,
 please put some of my thoughts, suggestions, and grade of the Beta into fruition for the game.</p>
<p>Over the course of the Technical Test my friend and I were taking turns from September 21, 2015 to September 23, 2015. We were rotating playing my Xbox gamer tag, EpH3s1aNs. My friends actual gamer tag is TH4T RAND0M GUY who really played a lot of the Technical
 Test on my gamer tag. The Technical Test I must say, went smoother than expected, because in the past Technical Test or unrolled game updates for other games including Rainbow Six were less successful.
</p>
<p>What we liked about the Technical Test was it seemed very realistic, however there were glitches. bugs, and connection to server issues. In the Technical Test it was realistic, because the Classic Multiplayer mode and players playing were more tactical.
 There was more an emphasis on either: defending or attacking correctly in a team objective mind set. The mechanics were good and the cover system seemed to be working properly. It felt pretty realistic and you could take cover in areas, that you were suppose
 to be able to take cover at. The drone feature made a level playing field when it worked and the defending mechanics were spot in, when they worked.</p>
<p>There seemed to be some on going issues to address with the Technical Test. The major issue was 0-0x00000206, which was a Ubisoft server issue and seemed to be an ongoing occurrence in the actual closed beta as well. When this error code happened, either
 the following would happen: you were in a delay placed back to the main menu page, or had to quit the actual game and restart it. In the game while using the drone, it would get stuck, disappear, or be under the map so you could not use it. The party system
 and inviting squad members didn't work for the technical test, as I ran into people in the lobbies who I wanted to play with again and couldn't invite them to my squad. There seemed to be some issues in breaching the walls or shooting through walls, that were
 able to be shot through and downing other players, although they could down you.There was an instance in a match, where a body part (the foot) glitched thorough a wall and I was shot at, which cost us the match.</p>
<p>Overall I would rate the Technical Test, as being successful and rate it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Although there were additional issues, the above seemed to be the hottest and most common problems in the menu and during games. I really liked the attacking and
 defending concept and the drone for the attacking was spot on, while shooting the drone during defending worked most of the time, to disable the attacking team the ability to spot players or the bomb.</p>
<p>The closed Beta started originally on September 24, 2015 and was set to end on September 28, 2015. This was later extended to October 1, 2015 and then ending finally on October 4, 2015. I liked during the Technical Test and during the closed Beta, all your
 renowned credit earned and operators carried over. With the help of my friend, we were able to unlock every operator and the majority of their weapon sites, grips, and accessories. We played a lot, emphasis on A LOT (way too much!), because my rank was a 31
 and all the operators were unlocked before September 28, 2015. </p>
<p>We liked the attacking and defending concept, because it made the game more balanced and made the game more enjoyable. The operators on both the attacking and defending team were balanced armor and equipment wise. I would have to say though the shields,
 were Extremely over powered in the game. When someone was using a shield, it took multiple grenades and the majority of the time, if the player was setup on a corner almost impossible to kill him, as the shield when you dropped it was like Captain America's
 shield and was able to with stand bullets, and grenades. </p>
<p>Our favorite operators had to be the following: Twitch, Sledge, Thermite, IQ, and Pulse. Twitch's shock drone was hilarious to taze a player or terrorist, but was more a nuisance then an attacking perk. Sledge's breaching special using the sledge hammer
 was awesome, but should be unlimited. Thermite's exothermic was useful, as you were able to see where the main battle was coming from, but we would like to see another primary, perhaps the M41C on the recruit class. IQ's detection of C4, jammers, and IEDs
 was a great asset to have, but would like to see her have G36C for a weapon and a better understanding of the electronic device, as more specific what the device is actually. Pulse was a fun character, but his light armor and UMP seemed at times, as if we
 were shooting rubber bullets, because the damage was for the UMP was way under powered.
</p>
<p>The attacking and defending equipment was a nice touch. The C4 was lacking a punch with blast radius. We ran into a issue where a shield guy had his back to the C4 and still live when it was detonated. The reinforced walls was a nice perk, but should not
 have nails sticking through the other side, because then it was easy to spot where the objective was and terrorists were hiding in classic terrorist hunt. The nails through the reinforced walls is realistic, so we have a difference of opinion. Planting disrupters
 on the wall would be a nice touch. Defenders should have frag grenades, to level the playing field and while we are at it, just give all the operators all grenade types to select, as this would be a more balanced enhancement to the equipment setup. The shield
 needs to be fixed by allowing the opposing player not using the shield, to either: shoot exposed body parts or, when a grenade or C4 is chucked to damage or kill the shield user.</p>
<p>Classic Terrorist Hunt was enjoyable and a nice touch to the Beta. Realistic although frustrating, had us playing it over and over again. One thing to fix though is the Aug and the 552 commando shooting through reinforced walls and walls the player wasn't
 able to shoot though was frustrating. We were killed multiple times through walls that the terrorist could shoot through, but we couldn't. The bomber terrorist class was a nice touch, but trying to kill him was difficult at times. Hitting him in the body,
 didn't kill or wound the bomber, only shooting in the head repeatedly killed the bomber. I realize you are wanting to challenge the player, however it is really unrealistic, because if you get shot in the torso multiple times or the head once you should be
 killed. </p>
<p>Overall the closed Beta we would rate a 4 out of 5 stars. Although at times, there was a 2 to 15 minute wait for a game, server connection issues, or the game freezing it was a solid Beta. A functional party system was spot on and inviting people to the
 game was user friendly. The graphics were great for a beta and the overall lighting, seem to go well with light or dark areas of the maps. The multi-player and terrorist hunt servers worked the majority time and your squad seemed to stay in your squad, versus
 Betas and multiplayer updates on different games, as where you either lost your squad members completely or were on the other team. Although this was a beta, the weapons damage, sights, silencers were extremely balanced and I liked the holographic or red dot
 site the best. While aiming down the site, being able to tilt your gun was a nice feature and more realistic. The ability to shoot or breach walls or doors was a nice addition and really enjoyed trying to shoot through or breach anything wood or plywood. I
 would like to see in the finished process, the ability to use cover on the walls and ability to shoot through shields.
</p>
<p>With this said, this was a Technical Test and a closed Beta, if you could call it that. I have an assumption, because playing Ubisoft updates, Alphas, or Betas in the past this is more of a demo and learning experience. The emphasis on the games being called
 Classic multi-player and Classic terrorist hunt has us suspecting the game has a lot of enhancements and implementations to be available, once the game comes out on December 1, 2015. I would like to see the multi player having a death match and elimination
 feature and the ability to host a private or public lobby. The operator classes available at the beta was a total of 14, but in tweets, developer videos, and forums there will be at least 20 operators. In the Beta there looked, as there might be video bios
 of each operator, but having a side mission for each operator would be a nice add on.
</p>
<p>Story mode or a campaign would be nice down the road, but it looks as though like most games, you are wanting to make this more of a multi-player and online friends enjoyed experience. It would be nice to have the ability to have someone sign in, as a guest
 but Rainbow Six Vegas 2 didn't have this feature. I would like to have the ability to fully customize a operator, as far as their equipment and guns. Having duplicate operators would be cool, as I really enjoyed some operators and was bummed in a match, when
 I was stuck with a operator I didn't like. </p>
<p>I am excited to see the finished product and would like to play more, until the game comes out. We extend our hand in helping improving the game, exploiting glitches, flaws, and offering positive feedback before and once the game came out. I had my copy
 of the game pre ordered at Best Buy, but recommend everyone who has it pre order to read the order description carefully, as the Best Buy pre orders don't have the backwords compatible codes for the Rainbow Six Vegas 1 and 2. The Microsoft store on the Xbox
 dashboard, their website have these backwords compatible codes, as does Gamestop pre orders do also. I recommend if you want the best bang for your buck, to get the Rainbow Six Siege Gold Edition, as this comes with the following: Rainbow Six Siege, Season
 pass for the downloadable maps, Weapon skins (varies depending on Xbox pre order, versus Gamestop pre order), and backwords compatibility codes for Rainbow Six Vegas 1 and 2. The Rainbow Six Siege Gold edition, is $89.99 excluding taxes and shipping, but is
 well worth the price, because you get 3 games versus one at Best Buy.</p>
<p>I realize this franchise has in the past 7 years had its issues. Rainbow Six Patriots being announced, then cancelled and with Tom Clancy's death it didn't seem right in releasing another Rainbow Six game at first. Ubisoft traditionally doesn't like to rush
 games and my expectations for Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon games are finished products and they don't require a lot of patches or updates to fix their games. The loyal Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon fans do have to wait, until December 1, 2015, but what is waiting
 another 1 month and 18 days. Who's counting though? I am eager to see the finished product and look forward to playing it on December 1, 2015. The anticipation is killing me!
</p>
<p>In the interim, as I sold my Xbox 360 in May of this year waiting will be spent playing other games. I might even get an Xbox 360, just to play Rainbow Six Vegas 2 while counting down to the release of Rainbow Six Siege. My gamer tag is EpH3s1aNs and don't
 hesitate to add me or play some games in the interim, so we can wait patiently together! Was my review helpful? What would you like to see improved, or thought was enjoyable in the Technical Test and Beta?</p>
<p>I would like to hear from you. I can be reached at my gamer tag EpH3s1aNs. My twitter is @eph3s1ans and my email is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Have a blessed day and look forward to playing with or against you soon enough.</p>

<p>I couldn't agree with you more about team killing, except if it's your friends, then it's ok lol. Just kidding. I look forward to this game coming out, but I really hope they allow hosting lobbies both: private and public, because this game would be sick
 in a elimination and old school team multiplayer death match. There is no school, like the old school. In the interim, if I do play video games before it comes out, I will be playing Halo 5 guardians and Star Wars Battlefront.</p>
<p>Have a blessed day.</p>

<h2>            How to unblock images in safe websites in child account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have a Windows 8 computer with our children using it under a child account. &nbsp;We like the features of family safety but are having issues with images. &nbsp;Our children use these computers for school (they attend virtual school) and family safety sometimes
 blocks images that they need to be able to see in order to do their school work. &nbsp;How can I unblock images for these safe websites without changing their account from a child account to a standard account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>When you purchased your copy of NCAA Football 13; was an EA Sports Online Pass, that came with your before-stated copy (if any), used on an older Xbox Live account (not on your new Xbox Live account that you recently created)? If so, for your new Xbox Live
 account, you must purchase and use a new EA Sports Online Pass in order to play NCAA Football 13 online [with your new account]. Otherwise, you can use the [un-used] EA Sports Online Pass, that came with your before-stated copy, on your new Xbox Live account.
 Hope that helps you out, and good luck!</p>
<p>P.S. - A new EA Sports Online Pass can be purchased for 800 Microsoft Points, from the Xbox Live Marketplace.</p>

    <title>Windows Live Mail will not send emails on VirginMedia account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail will not send emails on VirginMedia account &#40;Edited inc more info&#41; Windows Live Mail Error ID&#58; 0x8007007A</h2>
                    <p>Windows Live Mail will not send emails on VirginMedia email account !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that VirginMedia email accounts are hosted by Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WLM receives email on this account OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WLM has worked perfectly with this account for the last four years, and then suddenly this problem appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p>An Unknown error has occured</p>
<p>Server: 'smtp.blueyonder.co.uk'</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x8007007A</p>
<p>Protocol: SMTP</p>
<p>Port: 465</p>
<p>Secure (SSL): Yes</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried telling it to "Repair all Windows Essentials" Programs, allowed the very first Test email to be sent, but then the problem reoccurred for all subsequent emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling and reinstalling WLM did not solve the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be most grateful for suggestions on how to fix this problem please.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think this solves the issue because: </p>
<p>WLM will not send plain text emails, </p>
<p>and WML will not send photo emails; </p>
<p>and this error is on an email account that is not Outlook/Hotmail; </p>
<p>WML has worked successfully on this email account for several years without problem.</p>

            <p>You must remove any unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane) before being able to send new messages. When the outbox is empty, compose a new test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself (i.e. from the offending
 account to the same account). Post&nbsp;any new error message in your reply. </p>

            <p>My client had this issue recently.&nbsp; I identified the cause was due to a <strong>
Photo Email attempting to get sent using Windows Live Mail (WLM)</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>
<em>The user did not have a OneDrive account.</em></strong>&nbsp; Because the Photo Email requires OneDrive and the email in question was the oldest of the items in the sent box, immediately WLM got hung up on it.&nbsp; Backing up and deleting the photo email, pressing
 Send/Receive proceeded to send the remaining emails without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround is to attach files to the email message and don't use a Photo Email (using albums).&nbsp; Otherwise, sign into OneDrive and test if you must use Photo Emails.</p>

<p>A few months ago I was able to send pictures / attachments via Windows Live Mail but can no longer do this . The email goes into my Outbox and stays there . I can't send anything else until I delete this email .&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get this message :</p>

<p>This fault only arises if you try to send a message with a <em>photo album</em>. It doesn't arise if you&nbsp;insert or attach pictures to a mail message.&nbsp;The photo album will be created automatically if you use some external function to start a new message;
 this will happen, for example, if you select a&nbsp;photo&nbsp;in your <em>Pictures</em> folder and then use a 'send by email' function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do see a photo album in a message you're composing, you can get rid of it and attach the photo(s) in the normal way by clicking on a picture, then on the
<em>Format</em> tab that appears click the paperclip.&nbsp;You'll find this and other tips in this article:

            <p>I had tried Firedog's suggestion and it initially didn't work . After going back and forth with Microsoft , I couldn't get a solution . I re-tried Firedog's suggestion again last night and had success . Thank you .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe my problem is the fact that somehow "One Drive" was deleted / removed from my computer which I am the Owner , etc . I wonder if one of my grandkids may have done this by mistake . Anyway , in order to try to get One Drive back I had to go to<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
 gpedit.msc</span> and had no luck there as it could not be found .</p>
<p>

</p><p>So , thank you Firedog . At least I can do what you suggested !&nbsp;</p>
