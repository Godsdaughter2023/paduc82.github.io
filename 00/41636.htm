<p>The Problem is that you can't save any Highscore. So you can't compete with others when you play Lips with friends (okay i can write it on a paper xD).</p>
<p>Did somebody try to delete the update? I think the Onlinescores came with the big Update in 2009.</p>

<p>Ok so after some tinkering I found a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With two folders displaying this error (0x80070186) I performed the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1:</p>
<p>1. Start in safe mode.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to the inaccessible folder</p>
<p>3. Right click and click "Properties" then "Security" and you should now see all the security properties that were missing before. Click "Ok"
</p>
<p>4. Move the folder by cutting and pasting. I moved the folders to an external hard drive</p>
<p>5. Now the folders should be accessible as they were before! I moved them back to the original location in "My Documents" without further issues.</p>

    <title>Norton file insight will not open from the taskbar. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cletuscook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Norton file insight will not open from the taskbar.</h2>
                    I have a HP&nbsp;Pavilion&nbsp;dv7-3085 Entertainment Notebook (64 bit) which is upgraded from Win7 to Win8. I downloaded Norton 360 as I was tired of the lack of features with my old antivirus suite which had no performance monitoring and was archaic in the way
 it told you what was going on. I was running Second Life (SL) (a very resource intensive program) and received the expected resource usage warning but it did not show up on top of the window (perhaps an issue with Norton) but... After closing logging out of
 SL I went to check what the warning was about that came up after the expected warning which mentioned SOMETHING about a windows sound problem (I think it had to do with isolation?) and when I clicked the icon on the taskbar the window would not display. On
 mouse over the popup does show that a File Insight window is available but it will not open the Window to the desktop. I tried to click on the popup window and nothing happens... upon playing with it during the writing of this post I find that by clicking
 on the "X" that the first warning does display concerning the use of 100% of at least one CPU to run SL but the second warning does not display at all. Furthermore, on mouse exit both the popup window and the window for the first warning disappear. I cannot
 see the second warning what so ever. Additionally, when I right click the icon for the File Insight window and try to close the window from the context menu... It DOES NOT close. I have seen this behavior with another program so I am tending to think it is
 indicative of an OS issue rather than a Norton issue. From reading how Metro Apps do not close but are suspended in the memory unless closed manually I tend to think that this "New Mindset" is a bunch of garbage and perhaps a bit of garbage collection is in
 order as it is not working properly. I have used this computer with the Win7 OS since new and have deved programs on it with multitudes of browser windows, programs and the like open and running at once. It seems that computer is shot for deving in the future
 and I'll be keeping the Win7 OS on my (now only) dev computer until someone realizes there is a flaw in the design of the metro app thinking. There must be garbage collection to keep things like this from happening to power users! In the mean time I will make
 sure to close ALL applications possible when using SL for certain and closing all metro apps when I am through with them.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for your time and consideration.</div>
<div>HH</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. the other app that hung up in this fashion was Outlook as I now recall. Outlook, SL, Skype, KeePass, MS Messenger (not running but open), the People metro App and Norton 360 were the only applications open. Thanks again. :-)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.P.S. When I tried to open Norton 360 directly it opened to the task bar but not to the window. When I tried to close it I got a message box telling me that the Norton Service Framework was not responding and had to close it. At this point there is nothing
 left but to reboot as I don't want to be exposed to malware.</div>

            <p>For a number of years Norton File Insight appears to only recognize the safety verification measures from premium software companies. Norton File Insight often erroneously flags a downloaded file as having no
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Digital Signature</a> and no version number and therefore a potential threat.
 Larger, more-established software companies appear to be able to avoid these problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelisting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
whitelisting</a> a file (i.e. having Symantec investigate software and classify it as safe) is ineffective because developers will have to constantly reapply for white-listing status each time they publish revisions of their software. This is particularly a
 problem for small software developers with small production teams who constantly publish revisions and updates rather than have an extensive internal development cycle before releasing updates.</p>

</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These problems hinder an industry of small business software developers from having equal market access since they lack the resources to comply with Norton File Insight's demanding and unclear requirements to avoid being flagged as a potential threat to
 users.</p>

            Thank you for your reply but I am certain this was a MS file that was flagged. Additionally a simple reboot seems to have fixed my problem with the stuck Norton program in question. As far as I can tell the program in question was not black listed. Instead
 Norton File Insight was simply alerting me to the fact that the file was a high user of system resources. The solution I am seeking is to prevent a repeat of the problem. This seems to be a problem with the OS rather than with Norton itself from my observations
 of the problem. A taskbar context popup should open the window when clicked and the exit command should close the window rather than open it. Additionally the context menu should close the window when the exit command is clicked rather than do nothing but
 close the context menu. From my understanding of MS languages this is the basic programming pattern for such things.
<div><br />
<div>As to your observation that large companies tend to make every attempt to lock out the small business development community, I cannot agree more! This however goes well beyond programming and has been a staple of large corporations for a very long time
 and is one of the many hurdles that small businesses need to navigate no matter the business they are in. A case in point is the current state of the patent/copyright system which favors large corporations with teams of lawyers going up against the small business
 who can go broke defending a patent or copyright.</div>
<div><br />
<div>While I do appreciate your input I do not think this fixes the solution. It may have already been fixed with the 26 updates I received on 12/12/2012. I'll keep my fingers crossed and should it arise again I will re-post the problem here with screen shots
 if possible.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No matter how big the development team bugs are a reality of any&nbsp;truly&nbsp;innovative program.</div>

    <title>U.S. to U.K. downloadable content - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            U.S. to U.K. downloadable content</h2>
                    
<p>I've recently moved from the U.S. to the U.K. and while I fully understand that there are in fact region codes in effect for both discs as well as what is permissable to download what I find disheartening is the fact that the downloadable content that I've
 already purchased and played in the States is not allowed in the U.K. I'm not attempting to download content that isn't allowed for U.K. players rather I'm just trying to re-download the stuff I've already paid for. It'll download the item up to 98 or 99%
 and then it'll say that it can't download the item any further. Any idea why it is that I can't play what I've paid for...</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Spazcool</p>

<p><strong><em>region locked content will not work out of region</em></strong></p>
<p>i pretty well explained it</p>
<p>when you try to download something out of region even after purchasing it</p>
<p>it will fail at 99%</p>
<p>region locked content will not &nbsp;work out of region</p>
<p>i'm not sure what else you are asking you can also refer to the offical post</p>
<p>&nbsp;If<strong><em> your account region no longer matches your physical location and your country is not one of the newly added regions, you would have to create a new account to reflect your location.</em></strong></p>

Are you sure? Positive? 100% certain that you don’t fall into any of the scenarios listed above?<br />

<strong>Yes!</strong><br />
Alright, please create or find a thread in this forum that describes your specific issue. Please include the following information:<br />

Account region.<br />
Physical region.<br />

<h3> garywieder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - computer freezes after 10 minutes after start up</h2>
                    <p>Couple weeks ago I’ve been having issues with the computer freezing. 4-5 weeks ago, it would randomly freeze after being idle for around 5-10 minutes if I don’t mess with the mouse or keyboard every few seconds. I couldnt figure out what the hell was going
 on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told it could be my BIOS. I checked it before and it was a 2013 version. Maybe thats it? I dont know and I can’t fix it now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, today my issue was the moment i turned on the computer after 5-10 minutes of being on even with me moving the mouse, it would randomly freeze like before and i would have to hold the power button as i did before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first issue turned into another issue and now I can’t even do anything on this damn computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don’t know what to do. I tried factory resetting but it freezes the moment it reaches 40-50%. I can’t do anything and its ridiculous at this point and I don’t know if it’s the BIOS or not but I didn’t even know how to update it anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help I made this on my iPhone due to the issue of not being able to be on my pc for more than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only specs of my pc i know off the top of my head is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i5-3350p 3.10GHz&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>750 GTX Ti</p>
<p>
</p><p>16 Gigs of ddr3&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>please help :(&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for updating us. Since the issue is not occurring in Safe mode state, we can imply that this is a software issue and we need to further isolate what specific application or system file is causing the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you perform a clean boot, just like Safe mode, this will start your PC with a limited set of files and drivers but with this one we will be able to pinpoint which programs or services are allowed to automatically run and see if it's causing
 the issue. Kindly follow the detailed steps provided in this support article on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a>.<br />

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you confirm the exact Skype version that you’re using? Is this happening to all of your Skype contacts?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What happens when you click the <strong><em>Camera icon</em></strong> on the bottom of the Skype screen during a call?
</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your reply - As I'm new to skype , I've only got a couple of contacts with Skype at the moment and the problem occurs with both of them.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm informed that I have the latest version and no I haven't clicked the camera icon yet (Mainly because I didn't see it :-(</span></p>
<p><span>I'll try that next time and see what happens - will keep you posted</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>That's one.&nbsp; Also, sometimes an uninstall program is incomplete leaving active bits behind, so then you would need to get the manufacturer's cleanup program for that.&nbsp; I don't know if that case applies to yours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility would be a DNS problem or a too slow redirect, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if this is happening when you are installing a download from the catalog what is it trying to do?&nbsp; You may need to dig into the logging more to figure this out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>Bonjours tout le monde!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alors voilà, j'ai un souci depuis l'achat de ma console. J'ai une 360 Slim 250 que j'ai acheté en Juillet 2010 en métropole et j'habite à la Réunion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>J'ai donc réussi à me connecter en wifi. Le problème c'est que pratiquement toutes les 3 minutes ça se déconnecte... Du coup je n'ose pas prendre le Gold, étant donné que ma connexion est limitée...</p>
<p>Je pense que soit c'est ma console qui a un problème de wifi, ou alors c'est mon abonnement internet qui limite mes actions....</p>
<p>Enfin voilà, j'aimerais savoir si d'autres ont ce problème, et si oui, quel connexion avez-vous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merci bien :)</p>

            You would need to determine if your computer can run Windows 7.
<br />You need to purchase a license for Windows 7
<br />You would need to perform a custom install.

<p>Before you think about installing Windows 7 on your computer, you should consider ...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does Windows 7 have drivers for your computer's hardware?</li><li>Are you okay with losing all the additional that was installed on your computer?</li><li>Are you okay with voiding your computer's warranty and losing access to technical support?</li><li>Are you satisfied with your technical skills to perform a clean install?</li><li>Are you willing to pay for a Windows 7 license?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If your answer to all the above is 'yes' then you might as well go ahead and install Windows 7. But if all the answers are 'yes' I would wonder why you're posting here in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else you might consider: For all its faults - real and perceived - Windows 10 is considerably more secure than Windows 7. For example:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15665488/wannacry-windows-7-version-xp-patched-victim-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Almost
 all WannaCry victims were running Windows 7</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you really want to know how to have Windows 10 running correctly on your computer, it's no secret, and has been explained here many times. Rather than repeat what has already been written, I'll summarize it for you. Here are the keys to Windows 10 success:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Hardware that is supported on Windows 10.</li><li>A clean install.</li><li>Installed software that is supported on Windows 10.</li><li>Learning how to use Windows 10 correctly and wisely.</li><li>Daily backups.</li></ul>

<h2>            Save datas gone after the newest update</h2>
                    
<p>I got a big problem here: After I recently updated my Xbox 360 with the new update, suddenly all of my savegames, DLCs and online passes were deleted from my hard drive, and it says that the hard drive has to be formatted. Has anyone encountered this problem
 ? Can someone come up with a solution for it ?</p>

<p>If you are on the beta dashboard update, you'll need to ask all questions in regards to the beta in the private dashboard forums &nbsp;at
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/beta-2013/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Please remember that you're under NDA (Non Disclosure Agreement) and you cannot ask others opinions as those folks may not have the beta. It's best to discuss things in an area where you're sure everyone has the beta as they have access to that private area.
 In the meantime, please check out the Beta FAQ that can be found here, it might answer some questions you may already have.</p>
<p>If you are not on the Beta Dashboard, the hard drive may have become corrupt and the only solution I am aware of it to format it. &nbsp;I, myself have my save games saved to the cloud. &nbsp;Remember, it is not a matter of if a hard drive will fail, but a matter of
 when.</p>

    <title>Product Activation key - Windows 10 beta user - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Product Activation key - Windows 10 beta user</h2>
                    <p>I opted to be an early user of Windows 10 and installed the beta version of the product on an activated copy of Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the product was available for general release, an upgrade asked for my product key, which I did not have. Now Windows 10 fails to even boot up with the message - 'winload.exe' has expired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Where can I get my old key?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the way early users are to be punished :(</p>

            <p><span>Hi Sidharth,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing your query in Microsoft Community. I would like to have some more understanding to the issue so that we can work on the issue faster. Kindly provide me the following information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">How are you trying to install Windows 10?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Did you clean install?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>We understand your concern however, you won’t get a product key in free upgradation. It’s the same product key of your previous OS. All you need to have is a legitimate Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 or Windows 8.1 with all Updates.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">There are only a couple of reasons for asking for a key.&nbsp; A clean install before upgrading, or an OS that does not qualify (enterprise, etc.)</span></p>

    <title>Disable auto-connect to unkown Wi-Fi networks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucm444  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable auto-connect to unkown Wi-Fi networks</h2>
                    <p>My computer automatically connects to unknown open wifi. For example, when I work in a coffee shop, my computer selects any open wifi and connects to it. Then I disconnect from the network (and make sure auto-connection to that network is NOT selected).
 However, my computer still reconnects to this unknown open wifi about 10minutes later. I tried to look if this was due to
<em>Wi-Fi sense</em>, but I do not have the corresponding menu for that (under <strong>
Settings/Network &amp; Internet/Wifi</strong>). I looked also for the option "<em>manage internet settings</em>" in the control panel under
<strong>Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Centre&nbsp;</strong>but that option is not available... So I have only the option of turning off my wifi connection when no known secure wifi is in range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is an ASUS and runs Windows 10 Home version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> The problems happened several times since the post of this question. However, today, my internet at home disconnected for some reasons. My home wifi was still visible and my computer could connect to it (though no internet connection
 was there). However, what my computer did is to connect to a random open wifi in my area... without my action. When I disconnected it, it reconnected to another open wifi... that behaviour is very annoying and non secure... If anybody (including someone from
 Microsoft, as they should care about security -for once) has a solution that would be great.

            Hi&nbsp;LucM444
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor And I'm here to help you!!
<br />How you doing today?
<br />
<br />Try Reset Network
<br />
<br />Select the Start  button, then select Settings  &gt; Network &amp; Internet  &gt; Status &gt; Network reset.
<br />On the Network reset screen, select Reset now &gt; Yes to confirm.
<br />Wait for your PC to restart and see if that fixes the problem.
<br />
<br />You can also check this microsoft link, for problems with the network

<p>Hi Wilfredo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer. However, my problem is not that I can't connect to the internet. My wireless connection works fine on known wifis. My problem is that my computer connects automatically to unknown open wifi when no known wifi is in range. It has been
 doing so since day one, so I don't think resetting my network will change that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>

<h2>            windows store apps will not download wghen app says &#91;get&#93; but will work if says &#91;install&#93; but its a windows 10 unstable issue</h2>
                    <p>this problem started a few weeks ago for me. i have a pure fiber connection all data filled in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>reinstalled clean install windows 10 , 12 times now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>microsoft support have spoken to several of them and not one has fixed this error.</p>
<p>i have had one support officer delete vital files and my entire system had to be reinstalled again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>every single support officer has tried to sell me pay for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>well i should not need to do this as i paid for windows. it is a standard feature windows store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anny app that says get and not install will not load onto my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>they are fully compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am so fed up reinstalling and trying again</p>
<p>i am on latest build there is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>its a problem that microsoft should fix but no one will fix it or take responsibility for a unstable operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i found out if i make a new user and then i can download the apps for awhile and the same thing then happens again a few days later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>no reason seen except &nbsp;that user profiles must be getting corrupted by windows app downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as each new user created can download get apps and then they stop a few days later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i originally went through sfc and dism and resetting apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>done just about everything that can be thought of.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>problem is windows 10 is not stable and user profiles get corrupt after just a couple of app downloads using get and not install.</strong></p>

            <p>tried troubleshooter. tried dism trid sfc. tried rest tried refresh tried clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>each microsoft person tried to sell me azure. told me its a virus.</strong></p>
<p>now i just done a clean install and nothing else on system</p>
<p>run the autobat that they said showed virus.</p>
<p>had a very long conversation with each support person that only wanted to charge me money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is the bad news folks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows 10 is not stable as&nbsp;gathernetworkinfo.vbs is corrupt on download using mediacreationtool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry but this is not good enough microsoft. stop having what should be technical support but what actually is sales to promote
<strong>selling service agree or azzure.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>if windows 10 comes with this error it should be corrected by microsoft.</strong></p>
<p><strong>now i been looking at lots of technical&nbsp;forums&nbsp;and there must be thousands of people with same issue here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>and its simple why because the release of windows is corrupt.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for contacting Microsoft support, my name is Mariel N.<br />
13:08<br />
So glad to have you back!<br />
13:09<br />
Can you double check if the issue with still occur?<br />
13:09<br />
yes will try. we did try this with another advisor and only had video drivers loaded on main boot<br />
13:10<br />
It seems that the issue still occured so here's what we are going to do you can either Subscribe to our Subscription which is Assure Plan, &nbsp;It covers not only this issue but any future issues you may have with Windows, Office, Viruses and Malware … and also
 includes PC Tune-up services to ensure your system runs as efficiently and protected as possible; for one FULL YEAR you can contact Answer Desk to resolve any of these issues with the peace of mind that experts like myself that know your Microsoft products
 better than anyone will offer complete end-to-end support. Or we can do Inplace Upgrade this will refresh your Windows 10 and fix its corrupted files.&nbsp;<br />
13:11<br />
same error as expected. error is either unstable windows 10<br />
13:11<br />
13:11<br />
already done a reset and a refresh and restore and a image restore and this is a clean boot. done it twelve times in two weeks. issue is there as soon as system is built.<br />
13:12<br />
Okay, thank you for letting me know.<strong> So let's go ahead to the Assure Plan?</strong><br />
13:12<br />
its unstable windows and thousands of users have same issue#<br />
13:12<br />
May I show you something?&nbsp;<br />
13:13<br />
<strong>i dont see why i would want to pay extra money just to get windows store working as it should as a standard part of windows.</strong><br />
13:13<br />
yes show me something if you like. remember this reinstall is write down to basics.<br />
13:14<br />
Okay, thank you!&nbsp;<br />
13:14<br />
remember its not as if i am cause of problem or if i don't have it knowledge its the product. ok what are you trying to show me???<br />
13:18<br />
You will be seeing a Yellow line here, <strong>meaning its a Virus that is causing you some Applications not working</strong> while the
<strong>pink one was the infected one.</strong><br />
13:19<br />
i have the best anti virus and that is onedrive. i have not loaded anything onto onedrive new. has same files for a long time. symantec nortons virus is good and shown no erros. only time it was switched off was when microsoft advisor did it last time.<br />
13:21<br />
Then I highly suggest for you to do a full scan.<br />
13:21<br />
i do then regular and there was no virus. now last engineer switched virus and spam malware all off.<br />
13:22<br />
i only reinstalled this from your sight today. so i am now concerned that a member of microsoft has put a visrus on my system when they switched it off<br />
13:23<br />
which i will be writting to microsoft about.<br />
13:23<br />
Can you just check the yellow line please?<br />
13:24<br />
Let me just delete them for you.&nbsp;<br />
13:25<br />
ok but let me see what they are as i will still be writting to head office about last advisor that switched virus software off and access onedrive<br />
13:26<br />
Sure, no problem.<br />
13:26<br />
Its now deleted.&nbsp;<br />
13:27<br />
it was a microsoft file get package component<br />
13:27<br />
Yes, I believe so.<br />
13:28<br />
So let's do the In place Upgrade for you, it can fix corrupted files.<br />
13:28<br />
We will be re-installing Windows again.<br />
13:28<br />
so ned to check which advisors i been online with recently. so use other number that was not users out of two case numbers i gave<br />
13:29<br />
reinstall number 14 or 15 lost count<br />
13:29<br />
so if i got this and there are several other****** thousand users just from tech forums i looked at. it means they may of all got this from microsoft as all sat started in last two weeks<br />
13:31<br />
Okay, no problem. So here's what we are going to do for a resolution for this matter.&nbsp;<br />
13:32<br />
if it was not advisor but one of your updates then i may go back to win 8.1<br />
13:32<br />
ok continue<br />
13:33<br />
I will be downloading a Tool that can fix your system. This will fix your issue with your Windows Store.<br />
13:33<br />
ok<br />
13:33<br />
You will be just needing to wait until this one gets done. This might take awhile.<br />
13:33<br />
is it windows toubleshoot that is on microsoft site<br />
13:33<br />
No its not, I will take over and show you.<br />
13:34<br />
ok<br />
13:34<br />
i used that and created a iso and also used that to do fresh install a day two days maybe ago<br />
13:35<br />
This one is another tool.&nbsp;<br />
13:35<br />
There's a two option on here, we can do the In place (This one) or purchase the Assure Plan, that I am talking about.<br />
13:36<br />
<strong>but i will just get virus again as its coming from microsoft. so microsoft gives us a virus and then sells us a virus removal services. not really legal that</strong><br />
13:38<br />
No, I can assure you that once you have our Assure Plan it can covered anything.<br />
13:38<br />
why doesnt microsoft just remove the virus from there own systems. as microsoft is one spreading the virus. i will need to imform symantic about this and a formal report will go in<br />
13:39<br />
<strong>deliberaly giving users a virus is a capital crimje cyberhacking</strong><br />
13:40<br />
<strong>Mariel N is typing...</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Yes, that Is correct.</strong> You don't have to worry, I will be sending you an Email regarding on what we have done here, and incase you might have encountered big problem than this you can always contact me and my colleagues, we are so willing to
 help you out.<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i have <strong>norton symantec</strong> and of course files that have <strong>
correct hash tag and system files from microsoft are expected to be ok.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT&nbsp;gathernetworkinfo.vbs which is stalled by mediacreation tool done by microsoft staff. is the virus and affected file which goes on and affects rest of system over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>so microsoft is in fact put out a build that has a virus in it.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>so no recall of software</strong> or removal but <strong>just sell us anti virus software</strong> after
<strong>giving us infected files</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>yes if i pay i get windows that would have viruses removed otherwise i pay for windows and then need to pay again to have viruses removed but each time a update happens i stand the chance of microsoft giving us another virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>this is ridiculous.</p>

<p>It is crucial that I be able to an em-dash (simple on the macs I usually use) in the case of blogging. I get slapped on the wrist by my employer if I type two hypens.</p>
<p>I see that you are supposed to type alt-0150 (I believe that's the right number; I don't have a reference in front of me). But this is supposed to be done using the numeric keypad only. I don't have a numeric keypad on my Dell Vostro.</p>
<p>How do you produce an em-dash on a laptop without a numeric keyboard?</p>

<p>Most laptops have numeric keyboards "overlaid" on top of normal keys, usually in another color. &nbsp;For example, every Dell laptop includes a number pad where the number 5 is the same as the J key, written in a blue font on the key. &nbsp;On these laptops, you can
 use the Function (Fn) key to access these blue numbers. &nbsp;Because it is all engaged at the hardware level, Windows and other programs interpret this as actual number pad presses, meaning you can use it to type such characters.</p>
<p>If your laptop does not have such functions, you can also use the Character Map program. &nbsp;You can either search for it by name in the Start menu, or type the program name<strong>charmap</strong>&nbsp;into the Start menu's search box and hit Enter to access the
 program. &nbsp;Once there, you can find and select the character to copy/paste into your other program.</p>
