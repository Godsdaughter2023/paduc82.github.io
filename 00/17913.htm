<h2>            SharePoint - Receiving Shared Files</h2>
                    <p>I see that I can easily share files with whomever I need to using SharePoint.&nbsp; What I really like to know is if I can do the opposite?&nbsp; Can I send a link to someone to invite them to share a file with me at the link location by uploading it?&nbsp; Essentially
 mimicking drop box features?</p>

<p>Hi RA_Phillips,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description this seems to be a specific feature on Dropbox, and no, it does not exist in SharePoint Online/OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there are two ways that can be a workaround:</p>
<p>1. Create a folder and share the link to the recipient (allow editing), and ask them to upload files that he wants to share with you. You need to send an email manually to ask the recipient to share the file(s).</p>
<p>2. If your colleague has access to the file, and you copy the link, you will get an Access Denied message and the option to request access to the owner/site administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>
        </p>

            If the sharepoint library is synced with onedrive to your desktop, you can share a link to the folder and anyone with the link can upload. This works with both sharepoint and onedrive for business folders.

<h3> ratsneve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I Sync Chrome Bookmarks And IE9 Favorites On Same PC&#63;</h2>
                    I like using Chrome and IE9 for different reasons at different times on the same PC.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>**Is there any way to Sync Chrome's Bookmarks with IE9's Favorites including the Bars automagically/unattended? &nbsp;Manually?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Right now I do 90% browsing in Chrome and only use IE9 when I need to print something out using double-sided printing and/or when I need to Print Preview and change appearance before printing something.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h2>            How to get Outlook app to sync with Android calendar and contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Outlook android app on my Samsung S7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync set up to sync calendar entries (added it to the calendars in use) and contacts worked fine too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our corporate mail has just moved to Office365 and I've set up the Outlook app just fine, but now I can't get contacts or calendar to sync. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to add Activesync to the calendar, it says the email account is already in use. &nbsp;But I have no way of telling it to use the existing account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, I can't find any way of getting the contacts to sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a severe limitation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft have any ideas? &nbsp;Can you make your mail app connect with the services on the devices the app is designed for? &nbsp;Anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi GeoffS_1958,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you configure an Office 365 account on the Outlook for Android app, the calendar and contacts in your Office 365 account will appear on the Outlook for Android application.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, the calendar and contacts in your Office 365 account will not be synced to the Outlook for Android application. Try updating the Outlook for Android app to check if it helps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the problem is related to Outlook for Android application, we recommend that you seek help from in-app support and told them the information I mentioned. They are more familiar with the Outlook for Android application. Here is an article for your reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-in-app-help-for-Outlook-for-iOS-and-Android-218a22d1-9fa5-4889-b689-de1c63493243?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Create a contact using a phone number &#40;that is not a skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulkasanda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create a contact using  a phone number &#40;that is not a skype user&#41;</h2>
                    <p>IN previous versions, I could create a contact as a phone number. There were lots of ways to do this.&nbsp; I could dial a number and then save it as a contact after the conversation... Or I could create a new contact just with phone number. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly this is not possible.&nbsp; The create contact button only lets you search for users who have skype accounts.&nbsp; Thsi makes Skype pretty useless for making phone calls and saving contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the intent is that users invite more users to join skype.&nbsp; Its a bad idea to make it impossible to add a phone number as a contact.&nbsp; Everyone has been telling me to switch to Discourse.&nbsp; I'm starting to agree.&nbsp; Evey skype update makes the product
 harder to use and with less features.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Making a group call is incredibly difficult now.&nbsp; you use to be able to just drag a contact into the conversation.&nbsp; Now you have to click a button in the top right and search for contacts.&nbsp; If I have a contact with multiple numbers, I can't choose which
 number.&nbsp; I think only the skype contacts can be added.&nbsp; Its almost impossible to put together a conference call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These issues should be fixed before users like myself give up completely out of frustration over the difficulty and shrinking utility of skype.</p>
<p>

</p><p>With <strong>new Skype (v8.30)</strong>, you can still save a phone number as a contact after a call: Right-click the number (you wish to save) in your chat list. &gt; Select
<strong>View profile</strong>. &gt; And then select <strong>Add on Skype</strong>. <br />

<p>

            <p>I believe you are describing a hanging indent. Select the affected paragraphs and click the dialog launcher button (the little arrow on the bottom right) of the Paragraph group on the Page Layout tab; this displays the Paragraph dialog box. (Alternatively,
 you can right-click the selection and choose Paragraph from the context menu.) On the Indents and Spacing tab, make sure that "Special" is set to "(none)" and that "Left" and "Right" are both zero. To transfer the modified indent settings to your template,
 click the Set As Default button before clicking OK in the dialog box.</p>

<h2>            Onenote iOS must sign-in every 2-3 days won&#39;t sync</h2>
                    <p>A long time ago – maybe a year – MS introduced a bug which requires iOS OneNote users to sign-in repeatedly. For me, it's been every 2-3 days for the past 9-12 months - I'm not exaggerating!. My notes won't sync on my iPhone or iPad until I sign-in again
 and again. I've removed 2-step authentication to speed-up up these annoying demands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My PC app works fine and never asks to sign-in; sync everything just fine. It's only on iOS. All devices up to date and so are all my apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is something wrong with authentication on my iOS apps and I've spent hours scouring the net for a solution, writing posts, sending my logs to MS through the app, requesting help and I have found none so I'm asking here: can anyone help? Has anyone
 been able to defeat this bug?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>This is a known issue and has been for over a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are wasting our time trying to fix it. There is currently no solution if you are affected by the repeated sign-in problems plaguing Onenote since Oct 2016. MS knows there is a problem but the only advice they give is what you've read above (100% useless),
 to send in your logs &amp; your Cid but this is not only 100% useless, it is a considerable waste of time and you will never get an answer from MS Support. I've been doing it for a year and have not received any help at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a problem IN the app, not our notebooks, this I was able to check. I reinstalled the app on my iPad, CREATED A BRAND NEW MS ACCOUNT and added ZERO notes to it so there's nothing to sync, right? Well, like clockwork, 2 days later, the app wouldn't sync
 unless I signed in again. It's baked in that way, it's essentially working the way MS designed it to.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since MS refuses to address the issue seriously, I'm moving to Evernote. It syncs without fail and honestly, it's every bit as good as Onenote, now.</p>

<p>User TFF006 isn't alone with this problem. There are several threads about this stupid OneNote problem. It's amazing that you reply 4 weeks later to his last post and refer to an Microsoft article which contains besides false information hardly any useful
 recommendation. </p>
<p>It would be at least of some help if only experienced Microsoft staff would reply to this annoying OneNote issue, who are personally using OneNote on an iOS device for years, understand the old-school-synchronisation design of OneNote and are aware of the
 specific user authorisation process in OneNote, because this problem can not be solved by any kind of configuration or re-installation of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just some examples on your referred article:</p>
<p><em>"Check and make sure OneNote is running in the foreground."</em></p>
<p>Requiring an app to run in foreground for synchronisation would be a very stupid design. OneNote Version 15.x synchronised perfectly in background. This pseudo UWP-design introduced with OneNote Version 16.x does not (probably because this function never
 worked reliable on Windows 10 Mobile).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"There are no options to force sync a notebook in OneNote for iPad or iPhone."</em></p>
<p>Absolutely wrong! Of course there is a force sync possibility for OneNote on iOS devices. Month ago I have informed Microsoft to change this error without any success. After another complain at least it got corrected a couple of weeks ago in this self-help-article:</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Resolve-the-0xE0000007-error-We-ran-into-a-problem-syncing-your-notebook-in-OneNote-b303eed4-4c9f-45af-bc52-810ddca86e83?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line: This sign-in issue exist definitely for more than 6 months without any improvement provided by Microsoft. Originally I have been asked every 24 or 48 h to sign-in again. Since Version 16.6 this is precisely maximal 24 h.</p>
<p>For the last 4 months none of the Microsoft support staff answering in this community take this issue seriously and just providing time wasting, useless recommendation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Sorry for this negative statement.</p>

<p><span>Kurt,</span></p>

</p>
<p><span>Thank you for expressing your frustration and following it up with proof that MS Support’s ridiculous way of doing things is a colossal waste of time for us users. They don’t even have the decency to read our detailed posts. I would
 rather be dealing with Comcast customer support. Until I ran into this MS team on this site, I could not imagine a more stupid way of interacting with other humans but here we are.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Onenote is currently dead but it’s been broken not for 6 months but for well over a year! It’s time to ditch this platform as far as I am concerned. We must vote with wallets. I would cancel Office 360 if I subscribed and I will certainly
 never buy another upgrade to Office.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>The real fix:</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Google Keep. It’s completely free, too. For anyone who needs notes sync - text, pictures, links, voice notes - Google Keep is perfect and far superior since... it works. Zero frustrations. It also has a terrific, clear interface which
 makes it more “fun” to use.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Another huge plus: when you use Google Keep, you don’t ever have to interact with MS Support!</span></p>

<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>
</p><p>With iOS OneNote version 16.9 (180108) the problem that OneNote is requesting every 24 to 48 h to enter the password seems to be solved. Since installation of this version on Jan. 22nd. the issue didn't reoccur once on my iPhone. Hence, I assume the problem
 finally got solved. Thanks to the Microsoft developer who found and fixed the reason for this annoying problem.</p>

                    Hi everyone, I am really stuck on something that I think is fairly simple but haven't been able to figure it out yet. So if I have a cell with a number in it like 478...how can I create a formula for excel to convert that number-for-number to letters?
 For example, I want it to not see the number "478" I want it to read it "4", "7", "8" .....4=D, 7=G, 8=H....so the cell output with the formula would be "DGH"....thank you for your help!!

<h2>            Disable editing for documents on sharepoint lists</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have set up a document library on sharepoint for company templates. The documents are set to be read only on word settings and document properties. However, when I open the documents, it allows me to edit them and saves changes. It does the same for site
 members, not just for me as site owner. The list permissions for members are set to read and download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously it is essential that nobody can make changes to company policy at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there a way to ensure this?</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my first reply, the reason why the file cannot be shown up with Read-only permission depends on the Document Library permission level instead of "read-only" in&nbsp;<span>content type
<span>setting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could follow the steps below to set the unique permission for your members.</p>
<p>1.Access the document library you want to set</p>
<p>2.Click the gear in the upper right corner &gt;Library settings &gt;Permissions for this document library &gt;Stop Inheriting Permissions</p>
<p>3.Delete all previous permission groups</p>
<p>4.Grant Permissions &gt;Invite the users you want to assign with Read-only permission</p>
<p>5.Select a permission level with Read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, if the users access the document library and click the file to open in Word Online, the files can shown up with Read-Only for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eli</p>

<h2>            Office 365 rebuilding index won&#39;t fix outlook search</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just my last attempt to fix the broken outlook search function. My system is Windows 10 and Office 365. Repeated rebuilding the index didn't repair the search function. The outlook only returns e-mails today and that of the year 2016. Even&nbsp;Microsoft
 level 2 was not able to fix it. She has checked the Registry but found the setting was correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 sets of pst.&nbsp;data files&nbsp;coming from the same mail box. They are the same. In one notebook, the outlook&nbsp;search&nbsp;is normal while in another notebook the search&nbsp;didn't work.&nbsp;The systems of the 2 notebooks are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;want to know if&nbsp;there is any chance to avoid wiping out the system through recovery and start to rebuild the system again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>This fix worked for me:</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/no-search-results-for-pop-imap-or-exchange-accounts-51c9d2c7-a3db-4358-afdf-50d3a9e57039</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Office 365 32-bit version installed on my main PC. As of the latest November 2018 64-bit Windows 10 updates and/or Office updates, all searches in Outlook stopped working. Symptoms: Either no emails would result from keyword searches in Outlook
 OR no emails later than November 14 would show up in search-results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So followed the 32-bit troubleshooting steps in the article at the link above, and deleted the two 32-bit Registry keys, rebooted Windows, and low and behold, the Indexing Options app started showing it was building more indexes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm getting lots of results in Outlook searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does it again! They always manage to SCREW THINGS UP -- ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR OWN SOFTWARE!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck folks!</p>

            <p>Windows 10 does not have a license key now. It is digitally activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>What did you update from to 15063? What version of Windows? What build of Windows 10 Insider?</p>
<p>If you simply installed Windows 10 Insider b.15063 and want to activate it, you must purchase Windows 10 first.</p>

<p>As already covered in a recent reply, W10 does not have a Product Key.&nbsp; If you came over from a qualifying W7 or W8.1, then the PC is permanently activated and you can clean install as often as you wish.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the early stages of a clean install, you may be asked for a Product Key but you are also given the option to SKIP.&nbsp; This can be easily overlooked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have 2 options - 1 - your W10 PC is permanently activated - 2 - buy a W10 key.</p>

            <p>A "clean install" can mean different things to some. I interpret it as booting from Windows 10 install media, removing all partitions from the disk, and installing to the now unpartitioned space. This allows Windows 10 setup to partition the disk according
 to defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you use the same Edition of Windows 10 (usually Home or Pro) as you had activated previously on that device, and do not use any Product Key during install, you should normally be fine. It should auto-activate after install, once you connect to
 the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before a clean install you should choose Factory defaults or Optimal defaults in BIOS and enable UEFI and Secure Boot, if available.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I am running a VM (Parallel Desktop) and had a licenced version of Win 10 Pro, but have subsequently lost it. As the upgrade loop trashed the original VM version.</p>
<p>Looks like the only answer is to buy a new version of W10.&nbsp;</p>

            If you had (have) a licensed version of Windows 10 Professional, all you need to do is re-install Windows Insider Preview again. Just skip the point where is asks for a key. At the end of the install it will (should) auto-activate. Check that you are still
 permanently activated.

            <p>Save your money, you can fix this!&nbsp; I did something similar and spent a week trying to fix it before I found out what I had did and it was as simple as what Davy-Delliott is saying.&nbsp; I even found a program that found my product key for me and when I put
 it in it still wouldn't activate my version, because I had installed the wrong version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was accidently installed the Anniversary version instead of the Home version.&nbsp; Seriously it was a week before I figured out I had clicked the wrong button, a week before I simply clicked the "Troubleshooter" button in the Activation screen, and
 it told me I had the wrong version installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I found out what was wrong I re-installed the Home Version and everything was back to normal.</p>

 can do to save your Insider activation for that <strong>deleted vm.</strong> Whatever build you will install on a
<strong>new vm,</strong> you will need a valid product key to activate it. <strong>
In other words you need to buy a Windows 10 license for the vm.</strong></span>

<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to have automatic connection for a Bluetooth headset?</p>
<p>My Plantonics Voyager Pro worked fine with my E71 just enable bluetooth on the phone and it connected.</p>
<p>On my N8 I have to manually connect to the headset everytime, which is a pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong?, or is this feature not available on the N8?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that system locks up and Thunderbird is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Do you receive any error message when you try to use Thunderbird?</li><li>Do you have any other issue with other programs?</li></ol>
<p>You can upgrade to latest build and check if it helps.</p>

I tried to do the update to update to 162 and followed directions, went to Windows Update, then Advanced Options, Checked Give me updates etc, Selected Fast.&nbsp; Directions stated it would update automatically which it didn't so I clicked Check for updates received
 message that device is up to date.&nbsp; Rebooted same thing.&nbsp; Shut pc down for couple of hours, tried again, same result.&nbsp; I hope the answer isn't to install 162 from scratch.&nbsp; Hopefully there is another way of updating 130 to 162.

            Is this an issue for the Home Version vs the Pro version. I installed Windows 10 and I cannot get Thunderbird to work. I can get email from the POP server but then Thunderbird goes into the not responding mode. This is very frustrating. It worked on Windows
 8.1 with Norton360 and now it doesn't with Norton360. My default browser was IE and then I changed it to Firefox to see if that would make a difference. Nope, no joy. The version of Thunderbird is 31.7. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

                    <p>I'm using a basic SharePoint 2010 approval workflows.&nbsp; I noticed recently (within the last week) that the workflows have stopped running--email reminders have not been sent to the remaining approvers.&nbsp; The example I'm looking at right now has the following

<h2>            I-Preview 18305.1003 - Cannot see screen after wake-up from sleep</h2>
                    <p>When my desktop wakes up after going to sleep, the <strong>screen contents are not visible, except for the cursor</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>They are there, as I can see the mouse cursor on screen, and as I move it around it changes shape and I can type characters in.</p>
<p>But I have no idea what I am tying into. Only the mouse cursor is visible.<br />
Ultimately the only recourse is to <strong>either reset the PC, or power off and on</strong>.</p>
<p>This is extremely annoying, as the system is set to sleep after 3 hours or so, and I do not feel like shutting down the system after I veave it for a few hours.<br />
This fault only started after I upgraded to the current "fast" Insider preview 18305.</p>

<p>Something you could try is hitting the F5 key which is the Shortcut to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Refresh the Active Window</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe the hold the Windows&nbsp; logo key &nbsp; and tap the &nbsp; D&nbsp; key which is the Shortcut to&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Display and hide the desktop Screen</span>.</span></p>

<p>Thanx.</p>
<p>But no. -&nbsp; F5 merely refreshes the active screen.<br />
And Win-D hides all windows (akin to moving the cursor to bottom right corner and clicking)</p>
<p>In my case, the whole screen is hidden- icons, task bar and background.&nbsp; ONLY the cursor is visible.</p>
<p>Until the next IPreview update is issued, I'll try to live with this. If it becomes too annoying, I will attempt to revert back the ithe previous&nbsp; Build 1829x or whatever it was.
<br />
<strong>Alternately</strong> I'll try a <strong>Ctrl-Alt-Del </strong>and</p>
<p>- <strong>Press Tab key NINE times&nbsp;</strong> this bring focus to POWER in bottome right corner.<br />
- <strong>Press Enter once</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This activate Power menu</p>
<p>- <strong>Press DOWN key twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> This will move focus to RESTART.</p>
<p>- <strong>Hit Enter </strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The machine should now shutdown properly, and do a restart. <br />
<br />
I'll try this after I send this message!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<strong>As well</strong>, after a reboot my WiFi does not connect to internet. I must do a "troubleshoot Problems" which determines that DHCP is not activated.&nbsp; Fortunately, this troublesshooter fixes it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll post this problem in another thread here.</p>

            I've been living with the same problem through most of the 19H1 series of builds to date. I don't use the sleep feature, but I do use the automatic monitor shut off feature which has resulted in the exact same problem that you are having. My monitor would
 power back up okay only to have just the mouse cursor showing up on a black screen. Like you, I can move the cursor around and see it change on different parts of the screen. A hard reset was my only way out too. I've tried a number of suggestions found here
 to try and fix the problem with no luck. I have traced the problem back to the display driver. If I remove the proper driver for the graphics adapter from the Device Manger and let Windows run on the default basic display driver, the problem goes away. Unfortunately,
 in doing this, you will also lose features and capabilities of your graphics adapter. I have reported this problem to the Feedback Hub a number of times and suggest that you do the same.&nbsp;

<p>THANX!</p>
<p>Nice to know I am not alone. I figured it was something to do with Graphics driver.<br />
Mine is on the mainboard- an old Gigabytes board, with an AMD&nbsp; Phenom X2-560 processor..</p>
<p>The built-in graphics is an <strong>ATI Radeon HD 4250</strong>. I'll try playing around with alternate drivers if any.<br />
This problem only surfaced in the latest <strong>Insider Preview 18305</strong>. </p>

            My graphic card is an ATI, Radeon x1800 series. I have been able to run it using compatibility mode on it's last available drivers written for Windows Vista/7. This has worked for me throughout most of the Insiders Program going all the way back to 2014.
 Whatever Microsoft has changed, it no longer works the way it should, even when I update just the display driver only. Unless AMD decides to rewrite the driver that I need for my graphics card, it looks like I might be out of luck to continue using it for
 Windows 10.

<p>LOL!&nbsp; Thanx!&nbsp; Basically you're saying I should give up on my MBoard graphics, and think about buying an Nvidia card.&nbsp;
<br />
I HAVE considered this, but I'm not into game playing where the average graphics card starts around $gazillion and needs water-cooling, etc.
</p>
<p>Perhaps I can find an inexpensive graphics card on eBay - "Inexpensive" to a retired geezer like me means &lt;$60!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;
<br />
Bonus!&nbsp; I can run a 2nd monitor on it (HDMI + DVI) <br />
Nah- I'll wait- and see if Donna et al have fixed this problem in the next update.</p>

            A few more builds have come and gone. It's been many builds for months now with the same problem.&nbsp;I'm still having to use the Microsoft Basic Display driver to get my screen to work properly when my monitor comes back on from the monitor auto shutdown
 when not in use feature. Definity something to report when the Bug Bash starts up on the 23rd.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Well, I'm now on <strong>Build 18317</strong>, and the problem with Black screen except for cursor has still not been fixed.</p>
<p>Perhaps MS has finally <strong>dropped support for the ATI HD Radeon 4250. ?&nbsp; </strong>
</p>
<p>So my recourse after awake from sleep is still the following:</p>
<p><strong>Press Tab key NINE times&nbsp;</strong> this bring focus to POWER in bottom right corner.<br />
- <strong>Press Enter once</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This activate Power menu </p>
<p>- <strong>Press DOWN key twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> This will move focus to RESTART.</p>
<p>- <strong>Hit Enter </strong>. (twice)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they still have not fixed the <strong>"DHCP Not enabled"&nbsp; after a reboot.</strong>&nbsp;

<p>Here is a workaround I have found on another thread that you can try. It seems to have worked for me on my system. You will need to&nbsp;run the following command on you system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm /v EnableFrontBufferRenderChecks /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Note: The command runs very quick that you might miss it when it goes in. I did a reboot as a precaution and checked the registry afterwards.&nbsp;The entry did show up when I did a search for it&nbsp;using regedit.</p>

<p>The NSU program warns you multiple times to decrypt your memory card/phone and remove any passwords you had set
<strong><span>before</span></strong> you install the new firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try putting the memory card into a cardread in your computer. But I don't think the PC will read it since you left it encrypted.&nbsp; I think you're out of luck.</p>

<p>@xuandna,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You "MAY" be lucky because you stored the encryption key. But I'm unsure just how to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First understand that each E-Series &amp; the software that is used for creating encryption is unique (E66 &amp; E71; other encryption software for E90 etc). Because of the billions of possibilities for creating Encryption and of course the correct cypher needed
 to Decrypt a key being unique to EACH implementation you may just have a useless encryption card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. you cannot even use a BlackBerry Curve/Pearl/Bold/Storm (devices that have imbedded encryption software solutions) to decrypt but its worth a quick curiousity for trying but don't bet on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Best possible chance is to roll back your E71's firmware to the same one you had previously - again I'm unsure how to do this and given the unique nature of encryption it MAY or MAY NOT work - but I'm hoping it will since you saved the key - praying you
 wrote it down (case sensitive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I no longer have my E71 but is there a menu allowing you to decrypt the MicroSD card using the stored key??&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly you may try another E71 with the original firmware shipped (hoping yours wasn't branded; if so you'll need the same branded firmware).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep digging and trying you may find a solution, if not contact Nokia and pray that they can help you. The very nature of Encrypting a MicroSD is to secure the data on it - making it non-recognizable in a memory card reader (formating may not be possible;
 maybe but I've tried it on corporate T61 laptop with a company that prides themeselves on data security and I couldn't format it with WinXP SP2).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did a similar thing with my E71 the other day, however, I did not install new firmware and my phone had encrypted the card automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I say automatically, it will encypt the card with a <strong>random</strong> password if you set the remote lock and you have not set a memory card password before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have backed up the entire phone with the Nokia PC Suite Content Copier application then restoring the full backup may restore the encryption password, and then you may be able to access the card
<strong>in the device only</strong> if you have access then you can copy the content to a PC then format the card in another Nokia Device, because another Nokia Device will ask you for the random password that you do not know. By formatting it you will remove
 the password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can then copy your stuff back onto the card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shunts...</p>

            This is an interesting forum and i just joined.<br />
<br />
I really wish i can help on this topic. I also have an issue with my E71 which started yesterday.<br />
I noticed that some application in my installation folder were wiped off, solitaire, worldmate etc.<br />
<br />
tried to play music but the files seem all corrupt, couldnt use the camera and couldnt access my messages.<br />
<br />
But after restarting the phone and re-inserting the memory card, everyother thing normalised but those applications have been lost.<br />
<br />
can anyone explain this.

<p>From the sounds of it you had installed the application on the memory card itself.&nbsp; I have done that as well and it would just 'disappear' whenever I removed the memory card.&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer to that is to just install programs on the phone memory itself and
 not the memory card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had some corruption on my lexar 4gb card. It worked out of the box so I never formatted it in the phone. But then I noticed some corruption starting to happen.&nbsp; So I formatted the card in the phone itself and have not had any problems with the memory
 card since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have anything important on the memory card then you need to back it up first
<strong><span>before</span></strong> you format the card in the phone! Otherwise it will be lost.</p>

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I been wondering about **bleep** keeps encrypting my card.&nbsp; Well, just upgraded FW w/card encrypted because I wasn't even aware it was encrypted.... Where is a pop-up when you need one!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just restored the backup, still asks for password... I hope I can re-format the damn thing in the phone or else it will be a very, very tiny 4GB doorstop...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Tries hard to remember what was on it, probably nothing I can't re-install.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well.&nbsp; If only this FW update lets me use the camera without needin to turn off the flash every time, I will find it's worth it ;)</p>

<p>So far I have had a few instances where my memory card has become 'corrupted'. At least according to my E71..&nbsp; This happened several times after I've install the new 200.* firmware and I have not even touched the remote lock feature OR the memory card encryption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I think 'might' be happening is the phone setting a random password on it like has been mentioned earlier in this thread.&nbsp; What I have done is turn on memory card encryption.. go through the prompts to create a key and SAVE it onto the phone and also
 copy the key file to your computer via PC Suite.&nbsp; But CANCEL out before it actually encrypts the card and then also leave memory card encryption turned on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this sounds strange.&nbsp; But my phone and memory card worked fine like this for a couple weeks then just a few days ago my E71 said the memory card was corrupted AGAIN..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I went into the encryption menu and it said the card was encrypted and asked for the pass key and phrase to decrypt the card.&nbsp; I pointed it to the key file and put in my pass phrase and VIOLA!&nbsp; it read my memory card just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far so good this has worked for me.&nbsp; I don't know what might happen if I upgrade the firmware... but since I saved the key file to the computer I think I might be safe.&nbsp; I don't have anything important on my memory card so It isn't a big deal for me.
 I would probably just turn the encryption off if I had to. or&nbsp; reformat the card.&nbsp;</p>

            I had the same prob too last time. To solve this prob, go to Tools &gt; Memory &gt; Options &gt; Remove password. It may ask your password. Problem solved! Good luck! :smileyhappy:
