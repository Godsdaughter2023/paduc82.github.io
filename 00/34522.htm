<h2>            Explorer.exe-Application Error</h2>
                    <p>Hey, </p>
<p>I have this MASSIVE PROBLEM with my Windows 8 PC.Things started like this: I was coding in C for an assignment and therefore the computer was a lot of days in sleep-mode. After i restarted it i am keep getting the following error:<br />
<br />
"explorer.exe-Application Error<br />
<br />
The instruction at 0x483382d7 referenced memory at 0xffffffff.The memory could not be read.<br />
<br />
Click on Ok to terminate the programm"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst is that everytime this message appears the whole desktop reloads herself not letting me have access to anything but task manager and cmd.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<p>
</p><p>The last time I knew it was in my computer was my disc clean-up trying to clear out my windows updates, today when I closed all the browsers it was there again! Somebody online said it was an ip address from bing.com.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes as BulldogXX explained that Ip address is resolved to the Microsoft Corporation, location in the USA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 uses a lot of technologies that require your system to contact Microsoft servers, Windows Automatic Update, telemetry, usage statistics, error reporting . . . etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is nothing to worry about, all the lookups report it as being safe, try it for yourself, google whois&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">204.79.197.200</span></p>

    <title>Printer not found on server, unable to connect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luckyluke1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer not found on server, unable to connect</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>at our company we have an XP computer with SP3 setup with a network printer (HP LJ P3015). A brand new staff that joined our company is unable to print to this or any other network printer. I can install printers fine in the admin account and test printing
 works. But once I log into the new staff's account, I'm unable to print. Printing works fine using other user accounts. All accounts are domain accounts, not local. Inside the Control Panel &gt; Printers and Faxes, the "Status" says "Opening". After double-clicking
 on the printer, "Status" changes to "Printer not found on server, unable to connect" but another staff can print to this printer using another computer just fine. Something is wrong with the new staff's profile!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<p>- restarting the computer</p>
<p>- power-cycling the printer</p>
<p>- deleting and reinstalling the printer on the computer</p>
<p>- restarted Print Spooler service</p>
<p>- I can ping the printer's IP fine</p>
<p>- added user as a member of the local Power User group</p>
<p>- added user as a member of the local Administrators group</p>

            As you can see from the questions below, I'm having a hard time picturing your "network."
<p>
Is it correct to assume that you have a small company with no dedicated IT department and are using the same basic workgroup networking setup that typical home users have?&nbsp;
<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>If you're using a real network server, your question is beyond the scope of this consumer-oriented forum and you would be better served by asking for help in the appropriate TechNet forum --&gt;
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please describe how your various printers are connected.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the LaserJet P3015 connected via USB to the XP sp3 computer?<br />
</li><li>The P3015 has an embedded HP JetDirect print server, so is it connected by Ethernet?&nbsp; If so, to what is it connected (e.g., a router, something else)?</li><li>How and to what are the other "network printers" connected?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Is the computer with the problem the XP sp3 computer or does it have some other version of Windows installed?&nbsp; If so, what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say "printing works fine using other user accounts," are those on the same computer?&nbsp; If not, what version of Windows is installed on the computers where printing is not a problem?</p>

<h2>            Words or numbers being randomly deleted while typing.</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 Home Premium on a Dell laptop that is about 1.5 yr. old. I am having a problem of words or numbers being randomly deleted as I type. For example if I want to place a bid on eBay for $55.00 as I type, the 1st 5 will disappear as soon
 as I type the 2nd one or while typing a website in my browser as soon as I type about 1/2 of it the 1st part is deleted. What puzzles me is it's random, not just one certain program or software that is causing the issue. I tried using the insert button when
 logging on a certain website. I can type jawen but as soon as I type the next letter for my password, everything disappears.Hopefully someone else has had similar problems and can suggest a simple fix!<br />

<h2>            How to fix DX Error 0x8007000E when start webcam on skype</h2>
                    <p>When starting a skype webcam call or checking the video settings&nbsp;in tools/options in skype, the error message DX Error 0x8007000E appears and prevents normal video function on skype although sound/audio function still seems to work ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously have had no problems but this started after using&nbsp; a portable skype program on another remote computer some time previous to starting skype on my normal home desktop computer when the error appeared. The portable skype program worked ok at the
 time on the other&nbsp;remote computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The webcam is integrated into my ASUS&nbsp;VK222H &nbsp;LCD Monitor and after attempting to install an updated driver for the webcam another error message in DOS stated that this could not be performed and now the webvam does not function at all.</p>

                    I changed my email ID in my Microsoft account/Skype account on March 11, 2018 and realized that I had entered incorrect email ID. Upon trying to fix it, I get error "You've already renamed this account. Please try again later". I searched online and found
 that there is 1 month cooling period for changing the email ID, that has already passed. What next? how do I change or verify my email? I have my user ID and password but not able to verify the account due to type in my verification email id. Please help and
 advise what to do?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your answer is incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional and Windows Media Player 12 natively support AVCHD files.&nbsp; That's the entire reason I bought the professional version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I have a similar problem.&nbsp; Windows Media Player 12 used to play AVCHD files just fine.&nbsp; Now, every time I try to rewind a video, it crashes.</p>

<h3> rontruman  say:</h3>
<h2>            black screen on HP Pavilion laptop</h2>
                    After installing an update from Microsoft, my HP Laptop suddenly went black and would not reboot.<br />
Have tried to reboot in safe mode and can get to the point where I choose "start in safe mode" but the laptop will not start.<br />
The screen stays black but there seems to be some activity in the hard drive.<br />
Is there a way to fix this without going to the recovery disks and losing all my data?

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>

You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>

It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.

<h2>            HP Color Laserjet Pro MFP M281cdw printer problems</h2>
                    Just got this HP Color Laserjet Pro MFP M281cdw printer and set it up and am having problems.&nbsp; I've chatted with HP and they took control and checked all the settings and it prints fine with the HP apps.&nbsp; It also prints okay with Windows 10 Notepad.&nbsp; But
 from two different computers, one with Outlook 2013 and the other with Outlook 2016, trying to print an email gets a 'Printer not ready' even though the printer from the dropdown list shows it as Ready.&nbsp; Several other apps, such as Quicken, Word, TurboTax,
 etc. all show the print job for just an instant in the print queue but nothing is ever printed.&nbsp; Of course HP says it's a Microsoft problem so here I am.&nbsp; Like I said, HP uninstalled and reinstalled and configured the printer correctly so the only thing left
 is what to do from the Microsoft side.

            Thanks, but I've done all that.&nbsp; The troubleshooter doesn't report any problems found.&nbsp; And I've uninstalled and installed multiple times and had the printer configured by HP support.&nbsp; I'm very sure there's some kind of Windows problem with this specific
 printer model that needs to be tracked down.

            None of that helps.&nbsp; Does anyone else have an HP Color Laserjet Pro that CostCo is selling and have it working with Windows 10?&nbsp; None of the apps except Notepad are able to print to the printer.&nbsp; I can use an app to create a PDF and then use the HP specific
 tool to print it but that's an extra step.&nbsp; I can't use Adobe to print a PDF, it just flashes in the spooler but nothing is ever printed.

            I've done a repair of the Office install and Outlook still says the printer isn't ready when it is.&nbsp; Is anyone else reporting problems with this printer that CostCo is selling?&nbsp; I suspect there's an issue between HP and Microsoft with this particular latest/OEM
 model that I just can't get either of them to admit to!

            I've had the printer for about a month or so.&nbsp; It initially installed and worked.&nbsp; A couple of days ago it started acting funny.&nbsp;&nbsp; I started getting a message saying Module Not Found.&nbsp; I uninstalled the printer and tried reinstalling.&nbsp; No such luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Have the same problem as you guys.&nbsp; I have a Surface Pro 3 which should work as well with windows 10 as anything.&nbsp; The only thing that I changed on the printer since it's initial installation was to turn of wifi direct because it was causing interference with
 security cameras.&nbsp; The printer does work with my wife's Chromebook, so am reasonably sure the problem is Windows.

            Is your mouse battery powered? If so try replacing the battery with a new one as this symptom would be typical of a weak mouse battery. (Could it be that simple? Often yes).&nbsp;

<h2>            windows 8.1 quick startup</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp; recently had a Norton update and when I went to restart my computer the quick start option{I think it is called hibernate} did not work two times in a row. It took my computer a very long time to start and when it finally did I had 5GB less of hard drive
 space on my computer. I turned off quick start and restarted my computer still 5GB missing from my hard drive. Could someone please tell me how to get that 5GB of hard drive space back? Thanks</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temporary files or cache can take up a lot of space in your hard drive. Under normal conditions, these files are closed and deleted by Windows when you quit a Windows session. However, if you quit Windows in an irregular way (for example, restarting the
 computer or turning it off during an active Windows session) the files will not be closed nor deleted. Let us try to bring back that 5 GB by freeing up some drive space on your PC. For instructions and more information, kindly visit these links:</p>

<p>I went into the links and the only one that Ihought that could help was disk cleanup and that only removed a little bit. I am thinking it may have to do with the hiberfil.sys file. My computer has always been set to run on quick start and it has always worked.
 However,that day I lost the 5GB MY quick start malfunctioned. It took a long time to start when it finally started it was 5GB less he'd space. Do you think that the 5GB got stored in the hiberfil.sys? If that is the case how do I manually empty that file?
 Open for suggestions!</p>

<p>We appreciate you for getting back to us with the said information. We understand how frustrating this situation may be for you, that's why we are doing our best to investigate your concern so can provide you with the most appropriate resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is possible that the missing 5 GB on your computer was taken up by the Hiberfil.sys file. You can find the Hiberfil.sys hidden system file in the root folder of the drive where your operating system is installed. The Windows Kernel Power Manager
 reserves the said file when you install Windows. The size of this file is approximately equal to how much random access memory (RAM) that your PC has. In that case, disabling hibernate mode on your PC will allow you to delete this file and reclaim valuable
 disk space.<br />
<br />
Note: When the hybrid sleep setting is turned on, your computer uses the Hiberfil.sys file to store a copy of the system memory on the hard disk . Without this file, your computer cannot hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you want to make hibernation unavailable, you can follow the steps below:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then type <span>cmd</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.</li><li>In the search results list, right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</li><li>When you are prompted by User Account Control, click <strong>Continue</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <span>powercfg.exe /hibernate off</span>, and then press Enter.</li><li>Type <span>exit</span>, and then press Enter to close the Command Prompt window.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To make hibernation available, please refer to the following steps:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then type <span>cmd</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.</li><li>In the search results list, right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On the other hand, since it all started after updating your third-party antivirus program, we recommend that you perform a System Restore from a date prior to the installation of the said update. This is for us to isolate if it is the one causing the issue.

<p>So I got back the 6gb when I emptied the hiberfil.sys .I turned back on my quick startup on windows 8.1 and the 6gb left. Is this the price to pay for having quick startup enabled? Meaning I have to be willing to let go of 6gb?</p>

Have you been able to do backups in the past, or is this your first backup?<br />
If you have Backup set to automatic, turn it off, and test backing up again.<br />
This can be done through the Backup Status and Configuration. Click start -&gt; in the start search type:
<strong>Backup Status and Configuration</strong> , press enter. Click Change Backup Settings.<br />
<br />
Have you changed any of your disk partitions?<br />

<h2>            Your PC has run into a problem and needs to restart</h2>
                    <p>Doing a discussion because I am upset enough to not be very nice in a chat. &nbsp;WHY does this keep happening?, and on such a regular basis?, and how can I get it to stop?! &nbsp;I work at home a lot when my boss is traveling. &nbsp;Here I am working away, and BOOM, "Your
 PC has run into a problem and needs to restart". &nbsp;WHAT problem? &nbsp;I am really upset. &nbsp;This happens at least once a week and sometimes every 3-4 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And on another note - File Explorer opening when Windows starts. &nbsp;It's not in my start menu, I checked the registry, I rechecked the start menu, I rechecked the registry - zero zilch. &nbsp;I don't like it but I can live with that better than having the blanking
 PC restarting on me. &nbsp;And personally?, "my PC didn't run into a problem" - WINDOWS did!</p>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you post a screenshot of the "File Explorer opening when Windows starts".</p>

            Not without a valid e-mail address. &nbsp;Why is that so hard? &nbsp;I KNOW I am not the only one with the problem. &nbsp;I hate to think of how many hundreds of people are just staying quiet. &nbsp;We have to register with a valid e-mail address, you have that, our phone
 numbers, our addresses ... &nbsp;We buy PCs, we buy Microsoft software, yet when there is a problem with YOUR products we're not even given a valid e-mail address to send problems to. &nbsp;It doesn't have to be YOURS. &nbsp;Surely someone there has a second e-mail account
 they use for Facebook or eBay or Amazon or ..... &nbsp;Lord.

    <title>BOOTMGR image is corrupt. The system cannot boot. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#35;johnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            BOOTMGR image is corrupt. The system cannot boot.</h2>
                    Hello fellas, Good day!<br />
Can you help me with my issue. "BOOTMGR image is corrupt. The system cannot boot."<br />
I have a laptop HP Probook 6560b, I upgraded my hardware(RAM &amp; HDD).&nbsp;<br />
RAM- from 4gb(2pcs 2gb),1333mhz ddr3 to 8gb(1pc),1600mhz ddr3.<br />
HDD- from 250gb to 1tb.<br />
<br />
First I remove and <strong>replace my old RAMs</strong>. And my computer seems fine since I used my computer to create a bootable device. After I finished creating a bootable device I
<strong>replace my old HDD</strong> and install an OS(windows 7 pro). I follow the steps properly: select a country and a language,accept term and condition, do a partition until I wait for the final steps: Copying Windows Files, Expanding Windows Files, Installing
 features, Installing Updates, and Completing Installation. Before the progress bar in "Completing Installation" part finishes my computer needs to restart. Then this stressful ERROR occurred, my computer did not load to windows logo, instead it prompts a message
 "BOOTMGR image is corrupt. The system cannot boot."<br />
<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot the issues.<br />
I tried installing other OS (Win 8.1, Win 10) and still I have the same error.<br />
<br />
I have done installing OS in my new HDD using other computer and the installation is successful without any flaws.<br />
<br />
I have used my new RAM(alone) with my old HDD and it is running good.<br />
<br />
I checked my laptop's supported RAM and HDD in HP website. it supports up to 32gb RAM(2pcs 16gb) and 750gb HDD.<br />
<br />
Since my new HDD is 1tb, I try my other 500gb HDD(good) just to checked if the issues arise from HDD compatibility. I installed an OS in my computer with my 500gb HDD&nbsp; then BOOM!!! same ERROR!!!<br />
<br />
I already changed boot mode in BIOS from legacy to UEFI and vice versa.<br />
I already changed SATA device mode from IDE to AHCI and vice versa.<br />
I already restore my BOIS to default settings and Reset BIOS security to factory defaults.<br />
I already checked current date and time in BIOS.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me where is the problem.<br />
1.My laptop is good since it boots when I use my old hardware.<br />
2.My new HDD is good since OS will successfully installed when using other computer.<br />
3.My new RAM is good since it runs using my laptop with my old HDD.<br />
4.My OS is good since it is genuine.<br />
<br />
Note 1: I have brought my laptop to 3 technician and 2 programmers but none of them can solve the issue.<br />
note 2: I need to upgrade my RAM cuz I have heavy works.<br />
note 3: I need to replace my OS to x64 cuz my 8gb RAM would be a waste since my OS in my old HDD is x32.<br />
<br />
Please help me guys.. any solution is much appreciated.

<p>Hi Johnson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the issue is caused by corrupted Windows installation files or could be hardware-related. How did you reinstall your Windows 7? I suggest that you download Windows 7 on a working PC and create an installation media using a USB flash drive.
 Please refer to this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to download Windows 7 ISO files. For Windows 10, please refer to this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be best to reinstall Windows, for more information on how to perform a clean installation of Windows 10, please follow the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">forum article</a></strong> created by
<strong>Greg Carmack - Windows MVP</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update us with results for further assistance.</p>

<h2>            change default backup location to another drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got a new laptop and I think I've particioned the wrong drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got WIndows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My C drive is 60gb and D is 393gb</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I've got is my system backups are going to my D drive when I wanted them to go to my C drive (the smaller particion).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way I can change my default backup location to my C drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the backup options it only currently shows my D drive to backup to and external device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There must be a way!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            It can backup everything.&nbsp; Typically (but there are exceptions) it will create both a
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-a-system-image" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system image</a> and a separate backup of your data files (so in effect your data files get backed up in two ways).&nbsp; By default the system image backup only includes the drives required
 for Windows to run (including all data on those drives) but that can be changed as discussed in:&nbsp;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-your-programs-system-settings-and-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-your-programs-system-settings-and-files</a><br />
If it was me, I would be doing a backup that includes both your c and d partitions and the backup destination would be an external drive.&nbsp; One of the most likely reasons for needing to restore from the backup is a hard drive failure and if that happens both
 partitions are lost and any backup stored on those partitions would be gone.&nbsp; I would also be doing a second backup that will be available in the event of a fire or theft of your computer equipment.<br />

I'm afraid you'll need to contact Ubisoft Support again, as this is not &nbsp;an item that codes were sent out for. Purchasing Just Dance 2016 should automatically unlock unlimited. We are unable to assist with this matter.</p>
<p>Apologies for any frustration caused so far, but Ubisoft Support is your best route to take.</p>

<h3> russhawkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is my computer being hacked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My ex wife is a very cape able to do any thing she wants to on any p/c she lives about 60 miles away but that does not stop her from watching every thing I do .I cant print,scan,or email,load photos, every thing&nbsp; i do type or say she has a copy. I have just
 started to use and learn to use my p/c so I am novice . I use my p/c in my business what I do is work on bank repos,I repair and maintain a # of homes .and I am sent new properties all the time, We cleanup load up all debris that are left on propertys and
 complete repairs so the properties can be sold again. I am required to take up to 1500 photos on&nbsp; each property that I go to we have to take before photos of all debris every room,every angle . and then I need to show work completed. my ex wife is taking photos
 before I can even get sent to my clients so I can get paid. I have all ready lost a major client because I will go to type up an estimate and she has removed some part of my quick books file so that i cant use I am not good enough to figure out exactly how
 to reverse what she has done. the worst part is I went and bought a new p/c thinking that would keep her out, I changed all pass words several times,opened up new email account, and before I know it she has taken over and has herself and new boyfriend on my
 p/c doing what ever they want.. from going in and changing my match .com profile, She will&nbsp; put warts on my photos or just edit my photos making me look different.. We are going through a divorce and she is the one who started it she is the one who left me.
 I even have a restraining order on me,&nbsp; to not have contact in any way with her and I still don't know what i have done to have&nbsp; that and no one can tell me any thing more than its there something about verble abuse I dont know we were together 15 years in
 that time no nothing in my entire life any thing said that I did any thing including my wife infact she was loving and I did not know she was even leaving. back to issue she has a file for every file I have and she has it set up to automatically take a copy
 of everything I do right after i send email or scan something I will here my printer about&nbsp; 2 minutes later working some times I will be walking by and look at printer screen and it will say copying and I can here it working.I will be on my p/c working and
 I see a set of eyes with eye brows nose and defiantly female. She loves to Harass me knowing that if I called her I would get thrown in jail .I did not want to share all my private problems and I am not trying in any way to get sympathy or her in trouble I
 just want to live and let live with some privacy,I found out that shortly after my wife left she ran off with another man so I have both of them on my p/c. Is there any thing I can do with all the preasure from my clients not being able to get estimates from
 me or photos from me because she is taking before i get stuff out to my clients.she Has cost me upwards of 10.000.00 in three months in work that I completed and then took all photos or would remove parts of my software so that i can not do any thing she uses
 note pad to change text and then puts passwords on where I cannot get into if I could I dont know enough to figure outany way. I can not afford an attorney like she has thats another thing she skimmed off some 30.000.00 as close as i can figure over the last
 couple years yes it was all planned out .What I found out was that I was working 14-16 hrs a day 6-7 days&nbsp; per week for the last4 years thinking I was doing the right thing working hard for my family so my wife did not have to work , and she could devote more
 time to our two children,I have lost one client one other one has stopped sending things and my biggest client is not sending me much of any thing in the way of work any more she is wolf in sheep's clothing and she has and is making my life less than the lowest&nbsp;
 &nbsp; feeling I can think of she Is doing all it appears to me through windows .<br />
