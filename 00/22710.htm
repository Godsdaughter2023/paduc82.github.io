            Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For you to regain access to your account, please proceed with the Online Account Recovery Process as it will enable you to receive the unblock code/password reset link on an email address of your preference as long as you can prove ownership of the account
 by passing the validation process. Please refer to the steps below on how to go about it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Go to the Reset your Password Page (https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx).<br />
<br />
2. Click on the third option: I think someone else is using my Windows Live ID.<br />
<br />
3. Select the Reset your Password option.<br />
<br />
4. Enter your Windows Live ID.<br />
<br />
5. Enter the characters you see on the picture, and then select Next.<br />
<br />
6. Click on Customer Support.<br />
<br />
7. When Customer support link appears, select it.<br />
<br />
8. Enter the Windows Live account you are trying to recover.<br />
<br />
9. Enter your working alternate email address on the ‘where should we contact you’ field (make sure that you can access the alternate email that you’ll be providing here so we can correspond to the said address if there’s any problem with the validation process.)<br />
<br />
10. Click on Continue.<br />
<br />
11. Validate your identity by providing as much information as you can on the Windows Live account recovery page then click on Continue to submit.<br />
<br />
12. A page that says “Your information has been submitted” will appear, follow the on-screen instructions thereafter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please get back to us after you have regained access to your account, we will then be able to ask the Experts from the Microsoft Account Support Team (formerly known as Windows Live ID Team) to change the alternate email address associated with it.

<h2>            OneDrive - sharing full access without Microsoft Account.</h2>
                    I am trying to use OneDrive to share a folder with someone. I want that person to be able to upload documents to it. I have set share permissions for edit capability and password security. The person who is accessing them can view the files and download
 them. But an attempt to upload a file is met with a screen to sign in with a Microsoft Account.

            Hello. I love OneDrive. Unfortunately, this can't be done if the person you emailed a link to does not have a Microsoft account. I just tested to confirm. See my screenshot. The workaround I personally use myself, in this case, is to use Dropcanvas which is free.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0654d3f9-bce6-4c9b-8d1f-8db881481efd?upload=true" />

    <title>Change in Windows Defender&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ocat49  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change in Windows Defender&#63;</h2>
                    <p>About a week or so ago, Windows Defender stopped telling me that no threats were found and started saying "Windows Defender scanned your PC at . . . , and took action against malicious software." &nbsp;If I open the program and look at the history, which is not
 really history anyway, it shows nothing found, nothing quarantined. &nbsp;Scanning with other anti-malware programs does not find any problems, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick google search turned up postings by other people asking (elsewhere) about the same phenomenon. &nbsp;Is this a deliberate program change, from a clear and meaningful message to an unclear and alarming one? &nbsp;Or a bug in the program? &nbsp;Or what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh. &nbsp;I did look around here for a posting about this, and didn't find anything. &nbsp;Doesn't mean there wasn't anything to find. &nbsp;If this is a duplicate, sorry, I'd be happy if I found this already being discussed.</p>

            <p>Windows Defender regularly scans your PC and when there is no malicious software, then it just show message that it has scanned and nothing find but if there is any malicious program, it also show message like malicious software detected and it is being
 removed. If you won't see message about malicious software and History won't show anything, it means no malicious software has been find and probably your PC is clean.</p>
<p>If you believe you have malware and Windows Defender couldn't detect it, you may post a new question and explain your issue.</p>

            The phrasing of this message is pretty bad, though. It says something along the lines of "Windows defender has taken action against malicious software," which strongly implies the presence of malicious software. Is this a recent change? I'm fairly certain
 that I've seen messages in the past that were to the point of "We scanned and found nothing." That message was much more reassuring and also more accurate.

<p>Yes. &nbsp;Except that I replaced memory, and that problem went away. &nbsp;My last BSoD was Nov. 30, according to the dumps. &nbsp;So I'm pretty sure that there's no connection here.</p>

<p>Exactly what I was asking. &nbsp;It used to say, consistently, "no threats were found". &nbsp;Suddenly it says it's taken action against malicious software. &nbsp;I have every reason to think that in fact there never was any malicious software--the program doesn't show
 that any was found, and other anti-malware software doesn't find any, and this message is what now shows up in the announcements each every time Defender runs. &nbsp;Is this a message that is now being erroneously triggered (in other words, a bug), or is it a change
 from a clear, accurate message to a murky, misleading message? &nbsp;If the latter, WHY?</p>

<p>7a. December 11, 2016</p>
<p>7b. No. &nbsp;This was SDRAM, not a disk. &nbsp;(And this is a desktop, with the system on a HDD.) &nbsp;Since the system came with Win7 installed, and no installation disk or anything, and MS updated to Win10 (without asking me), I'll be hard up if I ever do have to reinstall.
 &nbsp;I have no idea what I'd have to do.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;I do back up a lot of personal data (daily) to an external HDD, but almost never restore anything. &nbsp;And when I do, it's one personal file that I've somehow garbaged and copy back by hand, not any kind of wholesale restore.</p>
<p>9. I don't use either IE or Edge, so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to answer this question. &nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Firefox, no. &nbsp;(I have the program installed, but haven't used it in a long time. &nbsp;Looks like it's 43.0.4.) &nbsp;Chrome version is&nbsp;56.0.2924.87. &nbsp;(That's what I use.)</p>

            <p>I get the all clear message most times. However, occasionally I get the message that a malicious software was found and removed. I even sometimes get the message to restart my PC to allow a threat to be completely removed. Occasionally I'll go to the quarantined
 settings and see there are some threats quarantined. I know Defender automatically deletes these threats every 30 days but if I'm feeling paranoid I will remove them myself. I used to have McAfee and Norton prior to Defender and prior to Windows 10. However,
 I am very confident the Defender is doing it's job. But as a precaution I also have SuperAntiSpyware and run it every so often too. I also run the free (not trial) version of Malwarebytes just to ease my mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I'm confident that Defender takes pretty good care but nothing is 100%. I am like Reagan, "Trust but verify".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helped.</p>

<h2>            No junk mail being received into the Junk mail folder in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I am using Outlook 2016 and never receive any spam e-mail into the Junk folder. I have checked my e-mail on the web browser and the spam folder fills up with e-mails.&nbsp; I do not have any filters set in the junk email options. It is set to No Automatic
 Filtering and&nbsp; the no safe senders, safe recipients, blocked senders tabs have nothing in them. Have you any idea why the Outlook Junk folder is not duplicating what is in the web browser Spam folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore every now and again I log into my e-mail on web browser to check if there is any mail that has gone into spam which I want to retrieve which is a pain.</p>

<p>Hello Clive, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about your concern regarding the Junk folder in Outlook. Have you checked if the spam emails available in Outlook in the web is in the Inbox of Outlook 2016? Are you using the IMAP configuration in Outlook 2016? When did the issue
 start?</p>
</blockquote>
I found that the 2 PC's I have, one had Outlook 2013 the other Outlook 2016 were set up slightly different one as a POP account the other as a IMAP. I removed both accounts from the PC's and re installed them both as IMAP's. The Spam now fills up the Bulk Mail
 Folder.

<p>1) You can do this by setting the correct permissions on the additional mailbox and then add the additional mailbox to your own mail profile. See<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/permissions.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/permissions.htm</a></p>
<p>2) Make sure that you have Send As or Send on Behalf Of delegate permissions on that additional mailbox. Also, make sure that you create the meeting in the calendar of the additional mailbox.

<p>When I edit a cell, and press Tab, Excel says "Excel not responding" and takes 2-3 seconds to allow me to edit the next cell and then again takes 2-3 second to refresh. But this only happens on the first sheet, when I edit cells on the adjacent sheet, editing

            I'd suggest trying to repair the installation.

    <title>Installed Latest W10 Mobile update on Lumia 950 XL and GPS stopped - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholspc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed Latest W10 Mobile update on Lumia 950 XL and GPS stopped working</h2>
                    <p>OS Build: 10.0.10586.107</p>
<p>Firmware: 01078.00038.16025.39005</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed latest version of Windows 10 Mobile on Lumia 950 XL and now GPS stopped working.&nbsp; The MAPS software loads, I can input the address, I get driving options, select go and the route is displayed.&nbsp; However, as I drive my location doesn't move and I
 do not receive voice instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the install, I could tap on the route and the voice automation would reply with a location update.&nbsp; This too is not working.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you perform a soft reset. Press and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button
 until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:<strong>Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt;
 about &gt; reset your phone.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Make sure to back up all of your files before performing a hard reset.&nbsp;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Go to Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; Update and security &gt; Backup &gt;More options &gt; Back up now.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows 8.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Go to Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Backup &gt; Apps + settings &gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Back
 up now.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If performing a soft reset and hard reset didn't work, we suggest to use the<strong> Windows Recovery Tool</strong><span>. Please see the following steps below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by downloading and installing&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(for Windows 10, 8.x and 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the installation has finished, start the application and the main screen will appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c64ac75-7339-47a6-813c-b9cec3e2c900" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure to restore your phone using&nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect&nbsp;the phone to your PC (using the USB cable that came with the phone).</li><li>After a few seconds the PC should find the phone and you'll see the Phone Selection screen. Click your phone in this screen to select it.</li><li>After a few seconds more the latest available firmware version for your device will be shown. Click the '<strong>Install software</strong>'/'<strong>Reinstall software</strong>'&nbsp;button to flash your phone</li></ol>
<span>Windows Device Recovery Tool will then download and install the latest firmware + OS available for your phone.</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> </span>Your phone will be reset to factory status when using this tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted for further assistance.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>https://repairavoidance.blob.core.windows.net/packages/WindowsDeviceRecoveryToolInstaller.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you have done a back up under settings to be able to retrieve everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This One worked for me and got the GPS up and running again.</p>
<p>A little long winded as you have a fresh sweep and the program apps all need settling up again.</p>
<p>Make sure you know all your password setting as you will be asked to supply these once again.</p>

<p>Hello there. I don't know about you mates, but I think my problem is way too serious! My Lumia 950XL stubbornly keeps on installing update Windows 10 Mobile (10.0.14393.1066) from the original Version: 1511 OS build: 10.0.10586.318 Firmware revision number:
 01078.00053.16236.35033 with Hardware revision number: 4.0.1.1. Problem is every time it does that, the phone comes back useless. Sad smiley face and all. Paper weight, really! All I do now is to postpone update until it no longer waits and does it by itself.
 A big nuisance. Then, all the way back to WDRT&nbsp;and it starts all over again. Really angry! As I am in Brazil and there is no assistance for this model, I'm alone. Any tips?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail drop-down menu problems for printing, forwarding, moving emails, identifying senders,</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This relates to constant, everyday issues experienced for past few weeks when using ‘Hotmail’ email.&nbsp; When first open Inbox, things sometimes okay for first email, or for a few minutes. After doing
 something initially, I find I'm then unable&nbsp;</span><span>to view ‘real senders’ of emails by hovering cursor over “From” details of ‘supposed source sender’.&nbsp; Does not matter order in which I do it.&nbsp; Delete several 'junk' emails without opening; &amp;
 report some as ‘phishing scams’ or select 'block. Then after opening and reading one or sometimes two genuine emails, am unable to get ‘drop-down’ menus to print, forward, or move to folders.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;Then,
 even in Inbox, unable to identify email 'sender' source for any emails by hovering over sender. Alternatively, if I open a genuine email, print it, I then can't forward or move to a folder.&nbsp; If I sign out, and sign back in, it works okay for a short time,
 sometimes for one email, sometimes a few, - then back to the problem again.&nbsp; Similarly, I think it also happens after I’ve downloaded attachments (usually Word documents), saved &amp; printed them, and returned to the email, and tried to either print, forward
 or move the email.<span>&nbsp; </span>Won’t give the ‘drop-down’ menus!&nbsp; I’m not sure, but think this might have started after I had tried the 'Beta' version, then after deciding I didn't like it, I reverted to the ordinary previous version used.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I had tried the ‘Beta’ version as I had lengthy problems with the email &amp; Internet connection frequently breaking off, - the infamous ‘Aw Snap’ messages!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These 'disconnections' have started again in last two days after a good spell without
 them.&nbsp; My desktop is less than two years old, and has Windows 10.&nbsp; Can anyone help with advice please?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Which Internet browser do you mainly use to access your Hotmail account?</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Mainly use Chrome.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Have you tried using a different browser?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Same issue?</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Occasionally used <strong>Edge</strong> since issues started, but was not keen on it, had issues signing in, plus printer issues.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Tried <strong>Firefox</strong> late December 2017, easier to sign in, - but had printer issues. Tried the
<strong>Beta</strong> version of Hotmail, for a week or so, but did not like it, and reverted to previous version&nbsp; on 20/01/2018.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Last few days have been using <strong>Edge</strong>, and have not had the same issues, but not so straightforward for logging in; printing process is ‘clumsy’ compared to previous; and cannot seem to be able to ‘highlight
 &amp; copy’ from, and in, emails now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Still a big problem when using Chrome.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Is this the drop-down menu you were referring to? No, but doesn't make any difference which of the drop-down menus I use.</span></strong></p>
<p>Have tried to paste in screen prints of the drop-down menus, but doesn't work.&nbsp; Doesn't seem to matter whether I use either of 'Reply', 'Move to', '...' choices along the top, or the recently added 'Reply' drop-down option to the right
 of the email concerned.</p>

<p>Hi Douglas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you have mentioned that in Microsoft Edge it is working as expected, it can be a browser related issue. We suggest that you reset the browser that you want to use and check if the issue will still occur. We also want to have the screenshot of the issue
 since it is not visible in the post above. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would appreciate an update about how it went. </p>

    <title>Outlook does not obey rules - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hashem barudi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook does not obey rules</h2>
                    <p>I have been having this issue for some time now.</p>
<p>I have rules set to send all messages and all future messages from junk to a folder, but they just end up in the junk folder anyway.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of this junk filter if it is going to take important messages and put them in junk and mix them with junk anyway.</p>
<p>Loading times extremely slow on high spec pc and high speed (20MBit/s) internet.</p>
<p>Email messages contine to come from that same sender I made the rule for back in the junk.</p>
<p>Even if I add to safe list and click not junk, the safe list is as if it does not exist anymore and all my time training the junk filter to work for me doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>Last, when I click the send all future messages I always get error something went wrong, what is that glitch and why Microsoft does not fix this glitch?</p>
<p>Please help this issue has been annoying ever since the latest update in 2017 for the live.com email.</p>
<p>I want a representative to reply to this support question.</p>

<p>Yes they are in the safe list the emails I want to get.</p>
<p>The junk filter itself does not have many options (which is why I have to use rules to "train" it), but it is set at the maximum level. But why don't the rules function and outlook continues to give limit errors for rules?</p>

<p>Hi Hashem,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may happen if the rules were overlapping. To ensure that this isn't the cause of the rules not working as expected, we suggest that you delete all the applied rules then recreate them. This way, we can refresh the commands and it should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the results.</p>

<p>This is how Microsoft processes email.</p>
<ul>
<li>If an item is identified as spam it is put into the Junk folder and then all processing is stopped at that point.</li><li>If an item is not spam, then your rules are run against the email.</li></ul>
<p>If you find items in your Junk folder that shouldn't be just move them out and back into the Inbox. Over time the backend system should realize you want that as legit email.</p>

(A paragraph can look "normal" because of direct formatting but have a heading style.)<br />

            <p>Hello Deb,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me further assist you with your concern about being able to un-synchronize your two accounts. If I understand your issue correctly, you have added your accounts using a mail client and you have configured it using an automatic configuration and wanted
 to know how to remove the work email from the email client. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I can think of other possible situations where you are accessing your account using web browser and you have enabled the email forwarding feature on your account and as a result, all the emails that is being sent through your work email have been redirected
 to your personal account. If this is the concern, do not worry we can disable this functionality by following the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. Sign in to your account.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>2. Click on the <font><b>gear icon</b> located on the
<b>upper right</b></font> corner of the screen.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3. Choose <b><font>More mail settings</font></b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>4. On <font><b>Managing your account</b>, choose
<b>Email forwarding</b></font>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>5. Click on <b><font>Don't forward</font></b>.
</font></span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>6. Click on <b><font>Save</font></b>. </font>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I hope that this was helpful. Do not hesitate to respond to this post if in case I misunderstood your inquiry.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Thank you.</font></p>

<h3> john connett cmt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add external user with Microsoft Account to UnifiedGroup&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying for some time to add an external user with a <strong>Microsoft Account</strong> (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) to a
<strong>UnifiedGroup</strong> (mygroup). The platform is <strong>Microsoft Office 365 Plan E2 - First Release.</strong></p>
<p>Attempts to add the external user via the <strong>Office 365 | Outlook</strong> web interface
<strong>Add Members</strong> option allow *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to be selected but then produces a pop-up "You can only add individual people who are inside your organisation".<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>All sites in the <strong>SharePoint admin center</strong> are set to "Allow external users who accept sharing invitations and sign in as authenticated users".</p>
<p>I have also tried using <strong>PowerShell</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add-UnifiedGroupLinks –Identity “mygroup” –LinkType Members&nbsp; –Links *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>which complained that "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** isn't a mailbox user". I then tried to make them a mailbox user with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New-Mailuser -Name "Davey Hathorn" -ExternalEmailAddress *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>which complained that "You can't use the domain&nbsp; because it's not an accepted domain for your organization".</p>
<p>I have managed to add the same external user to a distribution list.</p>
<p>The cmdlet documentation seems to suggest that it should be possible to add an external user with a Microsoft Account to a UnifiedGroup but after much web searching I couldn't find a way.</p>

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>yes, it’s correct. to add external users in the group, you’ll need to add the external users as members of the office 365 distribution group. but before that, you need to add the external user as a “<strong>mail contact</strong>”. in your situation, you
 need to add the outlook.com account as a “mail contact”. here are the detailed steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;sign in to the <a href="https://outlook.office.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
exchange admin center</a>.<br />
2.&nbsp;click <strong>recipients</strong> &gt; <strong>contacts</strong>, click the “<strong>plus</strong>” symbol to add the outlook.com account as a “mail contact” of your office 365 account.</p>
<p>based on my test result, after adding the outlook.com account as a “mail contact” of my office 365 e3 account, i can successfully add the outlook.com account as a member of the unified group. here is a screenshot:</p>

<p>Many thanks for the swift reply. It is reassuring to know&nbsp;that what I am trying to do should be possible!</p>
<p>I was trying to add the external user to a private UnifiedGroup rather than a public one as you used. However, I still see the a pop-up "You can only add individual people who are inside your organisation" for both private and public UnifiedGroups.</p>
<p>The external user is a "Mail Contact" and appears in <b>Office 365 | Outlook</b> Exchange Admin Center under contacts and is found by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Get-MailContact<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alias&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RecipientType<br />

<p>It also appears in <strong>Office 365 | Admin Center preview</strong> Users as:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>User Name:</strong> *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Status:</strong> Unlicensed</p>
<p>The same user name appears in the output of the cmdlets <strong>Get-User</strong> (with
<strong>RecipientType:</strong> User) and <strong>Get-MsolUser</strong> (with<strong> isLicensed:</strong> false).</p>
<p>Is there any other information I can supply to help diagnose this problem?</p>

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>thanks for your update.</p>
<p>to better help you, i’d like to confirm whether the private unified group refers to<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> outlook web app (owa)</a> group (modern group, a private one).</p>
<p>if so, i have run a test and found <br />
1.&nbsp;if i add a mail contact, the original quantity of the group member keeps the same.<br />
2.&nbsp;if i add a mail user (the one under “mail contact” in the exchange admin center), the quantity of the group member increases 1 immediately.
<br />
so, it is feasible to add the mail user in the office 365 modern group but not the mail contact.</p>
<p>if the issue persists with “mail users”, please upload a screenshot about the error message you get for further troubleshooting. to upload a screenshot:</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed information.</p>
<p>I wonder if the Unified Group you created is a modern group (Office 365 group). If yes, it’s not feasible to add the external user as a member of modern group. &nbsp;</p>

<p>i have limited experience with office 365 but i thought that this <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
outlook web app (owa)</a>&nbsp;screenshot identifies it as a unifiedgroup / modern group (office 365 group):</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=986b42c0-1ad4-4f6d-baf2-d07ec1a5c546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d986b42c0-1ad4-4f6d-baf2-d07ec1a5c546" /></a></p>
<p>the <strong>get-unifiedgroup</strong> cmdlet only returns one group, with the alias "enghouse", which i assume must be this one. the
<strong>get-group</strong> cmdlet returns a fourteen&nbsp;groups. the first twelve have
<strong>grouptype = "universal, securityenabled"</strong> and appear to be system related, the last two have
<b>grouptype = "universal</b>" are for "enghouse" and my "test distrubution group". is this sufficient to confirm that "enghouse" is a modern group (office 365 group)?</p>
<p>i'm a volunteer systems administrator for a museum (charity, non-profit) and was hoping to use
<a href="https://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">onenote</a> as a multi-user collaboration tool between our
<strong>office 365</strong> licensed users and external users identified by email address. my hope was to allow this collaboration in a well-controlled manner. my preferred option in<strong> office 365 | admin =&gt; sharepoint admin center =&gt; sharing</strong>
 was <em>allow external users who accept sharing invitations and sign in as authenticated users</em> but i could live with
<em>allow sharing only with the external users that already exist in your organization's directory</em>. it appeared that the only requirement for an external user to participate would be a
<strong>microsoft account</strong> linked to their email address. these are freely available and i anticipated that external users with an existing&nbsp;<strong>work or school&nbsp;account</strong> or an office 365 account would also be able to participate.
<strong>onenote</strong> clients are freely available for a variety of platforms (although i couldn't find anything for<strong> linux</strong> apart from the web interface). it sounded like an excellent solution!</p>
<p>however, it appears that <strong>onenote</strong> collaboration with external users with a
<strong>microsoft account</strong> is aspirational not operational! the documentation appears to be ahead of the implementation.

office 365 | sharepoint</strong> to select an existing site, finance, and then used
<strong>share your site</strong> to send an invitation to the email address. the invitation was accepted and web access to the site was confirmed. i surmise that this added&nbsp;the new user to the directory.</p>
<p>it was then possible to add the new external user with a<strong> microsoft account&nbsp;</strong>to the
<strong>unifiedgroup</strong>, enghouse.</p>
<p>strangely, this doesn't work with my original external user with a microsoft email address, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. this may be a side effect of various other things i tried ...</p>
<p>with the successfully added external user i was able to access the documents part of the unifiedgroup via the web interface. i don't know if it is possible to have the
<strong>onenote app</strong> find the associated notebook?</p>

<h2>            OneNote sections&#47;pages disappeared</h2>
                    <p>Dear OneNote team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened OneNote today to find that several sections from several of my notebooks have disappeared. I did not delete them, and they were all synced the last time I used OneNote. There is nothing in my recycling bin, nor any sign of them in the OneNote Notebooks
 folder in Documents in Windows.&nbsp;I am using Windows 10, and this is OneNote 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to remedy this, or recover these sections?&nbsp;I don't understand how this could have happened, and I am both appalled and disappointed. Please provide assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Several hours later, it seems that the lost sections have reappeared on their own, slowly repopulating their respective notebooks. And a new section appeared ("Quick Notes 2") along with two section groups ("OneNote Recycling Bin 2" and "OneNote
 Recycling Bin 3")--not sure how that came about, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though this has been resolved, I would still like to know why this happened, and how to prevent future occurences. I see in some forums that other users have experienced this issue as well, but have not yet found a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: A day later, the same thing happens again--except to even worse effect. Only one section remains in each of my notebooks--the rest have disappeared. I'm banking on them reappearing again on their own, but this really can't go on. Is this a cloud
 issue? Again, how can this be prevented?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p />

<p>Dear OneNote team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have similar issues but with worse results. Since yesterday I regularly lose all my content of all my OneNote (2010 on PC) books stored on OneDrive. Yesterday this even happend during a meeting while taking notes in OneNote. A few minutes later after initiating
 a new sync the sections showed up again slowly syncing the content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please have a look on this issue soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way: when losing my notebooks I'm also not able to connect to OneDrive usind OneNote, meaning I can't open my books from OneDrive. Accessing online is not a problem, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way 2: something similar seems to happen on my iPad.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. But this is not the problem. My notes are not "lost" as described by the linked reference. The notebooks disappear, OneDrive cannot be opened from OneNote (also sync not possible) and after a few minutes (sync possible again) all my
 notes are automatically back in OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using OneNote since a long time. And I've "lost" my notes before (as described in the linked reference). But the current behavior is new, very strange and very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The describes issue happened since yesterday until early afternoon today. I did not lose the notes anymore since then.</p>

<p>Hi Catherine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons is that you're experiencing a sync issue on your <strong>
OneNote</strong>. We suggest that you check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. This page contains helpful information

<p>This solution does not work. &nbsp;There seems to be a new bug that was introduced into OneDrive within the last few weeks that is causing problems with users of OneNote 2010. &nbsp;There's significant discussion about it
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_win10/onenote-why-does-this-message-keep-coming-up-there/8a8a1a5c-b29a-4d66-8313-6a6d94bb4dca">
on this thread</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully one of these days Microsoft will learn about this issue. There doesn't seem to be a way to submit bug reports easily.</p>

<p>That solution does not work. &nbsp;And given several people have been experiencing this problem recently as Homestar pointed out (see
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_win10/onenote-why-does-this-message-keep-coming-up-there/8a8a1a5c-b29a-4d66-8313-6a6d94bb4dca">

<p>
</p><p>If I turn off the automatic syncing, my OneNote becomes stable and not flaky with the following error message appearing time to time and all my notes temporarily disappearing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/048c531c-608f-45f5-b378-8a13c7f6ce79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/048c531c-608f-45f5-b378-8a13c7f6ce79" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote eventually repopulates all my notes, with emphasis on "eventually," sometimes within 15 sec, sometimes it takes me several minutes where I have to seek a workaround. &nbsp;It impacts my business if I'm on the phone taking notes based on my conversation
 with my client and all my notes disappear mid-conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft looks into this issue that is effecting several people. &nbsp;BTW, I use Office 2010.</p>

<p>As far as I know COMCAST is a service provider.&nbsp; What actual Email application do you use?&nbsp; If it is a Web Based mail application (it runs in a web browser such as Internet Explorer), then if you want to send a Word document (or any other file for that matter)
 by email, then you will need to start an email message in the way that you normally do, and in the email application, click on the facility to attach a file and then navigate to the file that you want to attach to the message.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>To correct a MAPI related error: restart the MAPI e-mail program (for example,Outlook) or save and close the document, and then restart Word after restarting your MAPI e-mail application. Word will establish a new MAPI session, allowing the document to be
 sent.&nbsp; To correct a problem with the fax configuration, review the configuration settings for your fax software and make the appropriate changes.&nbsp; &nbsp; I HAVE COMCAST E-MAIL, I DO NOT HAVE OUTLOOK.&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting frustrated and ready to return this product.&nbsp; Thank

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also experiencing this issue. I access my account from several different computers and use IE and Firefox. I have the latest versions of both and my horizontal scroll bar does not appear when I read emails, the right hand side of the message is cut
 off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this issue would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Jessica</p>
<p>I'm having the same problem - I can't read many of my emails because I can't move without a horizontal scroll bar.&nbsp; A problem that MSN caused, by the way, when they changed out hotmail to Outlook and put all the ads in the right hand pane, causing our emails
 to shrink.&nbsp; MSN has never been very customer oriented, but I hope someone fixes this soon.</p>

            <p>Hi Jessica,</p>
<p>I'm the person who started the thread about this problem.&nbsp; After corresponding with Microsoft for several days, these "workarounds" are the best solutions I can think of.&nbsp; The first solution was suggested by Ron at Microsoft.&nbsp; The others
 below I've come up with in an attempt to read my cut off emails.&nbsp; Hope this helps!&nbsp; Gary</p>
<p><strong>RON (Microsoft):<br />
</strong><strong>Note:</strong> I can create your problem by dragging the divider between the folder pane and the Reading pane to the right.<br />
<br />
Drag your divider to the left to reduce the width of the folder pane.&nbsp; You may have a long folder name or subfolders that you are trying to show the full name.&nbsp; Some folder name will show the first part of the name.&nbsp; Hovering the mouse over the folder name
 will display a popup with the full name.<br />
<br />
<strong>GARY</strong>:<br />
OK.&nbsp; By dragging my divider to the left to reduce the width of the folder pane, I am able to increase the width of emails in my inbox.&nbsp; This enables me to read previously hidden information in most of my emails that were previously cut off on the left-hand
 margin of these emails.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Dragging the divider will work as a good substitute for a horizontal scroll bar in all but my widest emails with images.&nbsp; When I have an extra-wide email with an image that still is cut off, even when I drag my divider to the left as far as possible, I have
 come up with the following workarounds in order to view the "hidden" parts of my email:<br />
<br />
1. Reply to a message that has an extra-wide image.&nbsp; There is a horizontal scroll bar in drafts when they are in the composing mode (but not in the saved mode).&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can not click on any links in the composing mode that may be hidden in my inbox.<br />
<br />
2. Forward this email with an extra-wide image to my emergency Google email account.&nbsp; So far, I have been able to view the entire image that was cut off on the left margin as well as click on its links when I forward these emails to Gmail.&nbsp; But this requires
 opening another window, logging into Gmail, etc.<br />
<br />
3. Use a flat-screen computer monitor.&nbsp; I use a cathode ray tube computer monitor on my primary computer.&nbsp; Most flat-screen computer monitors are much wider than cathode ray tube computer monitors and offer a wider viewing area when the window is totally enlarged
 (maximized).&nbsp; But this would mean going to my local library or a friend's/relative's house that has a flat-screen computer monitor to read the part of emails that remained hidden in my Outlook inbox.&nbsp;

<h2>            Data export via https&#58;&#47;&#47;secure.skype.com&#47;my&#47;data-export does not work properly</h2>
                    <p>I tried to export my Skype messages for archiving purposes, as my company requires mandatory archiving for 10 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded my history via:</p>
<p><a href="https://secure.skype.com/my/data-export" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/my/data-export</a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>and clicked all messages as well as all files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This did not work for one contact, with which I have had conversations on a daily basis for over a year. The exported file only contains the last 60 messages, which is less than a week. It worked for some other contacts, but I need the full history, including,
 files, for this contact as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this be solved?</p>

<h2>            Pen input in OneNote 2016 doesn&#39;t appear until i lifting the pen</h2>
                    <p>hi there</p>
<p>I'm using wacom bamoo writing tablet on onenote 2016.</p>
<p>sometimes when i'm writing in onenote i got a weird lag that making the ink to appear only after i lift the pen up and the ink does not appears smoothly and continuously as it would have appeared if i wrote it in a real pen.</p>
<p>i noticed that this delays happens when I'm using one of the buttons in my wacom pen(in my case its the upper button that uses me to scroll the page),</p>
<p>i mean that i can write smoothly until i pressing even once on the scrolling button and then problem returns for some time and then disappears. sometimes the problem don't appear even if i using the button,but sometimes does...</p>
<p>

            Hi <strong>Eliav</strong>, <br />
<br />
You may experience issues with using <strong>OneNote</strong> app on your device if there were recent changes that triggered a system conflict or if the app itself is outdated. To isolate your concern, I'd like to verify if you were only experiencing this on
 OneNote app or it also happens to other applications installed on your device. Have you made any recent changes prior to the issue? Also, have you tried logging in to your OneNote account online to check if the issue replicates?
<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I'd suggest installing the latest version of OneNote app and check if it helps to resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
We'll be looking forward to your response. <br />
        </p>

<p>Hi Gal,</p>
<p>-I experiencing the problem only on the office program and not on the onenote desktop store app.</p>
<p>- onenote is up to date(both office and the app). </p>
<p>- i don't experiencing this issue on any other app on my computer, this issue is specific to the office onenote.</p>
<p>- no any hardware or software change prior to this problem. this problem appeared from the start when i started using my pen two years ago and never solved.</p>

            Thanks for providing us the information. You've mentioned that the issue is not happening online and your OneNote app is up to date. To further isolate your concern, I'd like to know if you've tried using the pen or device on a different computer. If so,
 did you get the same result with using OneNote? <br />
<br />
In addition, I'd recommend updating your device driver to ensure that all latest driver updates were installed. This will also help in resolving any incompatibility issues that may have caused the issue. You may follow the steps on how to update a driver on
 this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update drivers in Windows 10">link</a></strong>.
<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes after performing the suggested steps.

<p>Hi Gal, i did not meant to the online onenote app , but to the onenote dektop app, there the issue does not appear.</p>
<p>to your question, i tried the pen on different computer(but the same brand and model- lenovo thinkpad T440p) and tried different pens(and tablets) on my computer and the problem continues.</p>
<p>this is a truly bag of the onenote and for my opinion it not related to my pen or computer.</p>
<p>Onenote it's a great and powerful tool but unfortunately has a lot of bags(this is the not first bag i experienced).</p>
<p>all drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>there is nothing i can do to fix this issue?</p>

            Since the same issue occurs when trying to use other devices, I'd suggest that you provide us a feedback via OneNote's UserVoice. We’re constantly improving the app and your feedback helps influence what we’re working on next. You may upvote an existing
 feedback or you may create a new one to let other users upvote it as well. By doing so, this will increase the priority for our engineers to create a fix or an option regarding the problem. Please click on this

<h2>            Microsoft Lumia 950 Touch Sensitivity and weird behavior.</h2>
                    <p>For one, My phone will barely sense my fingers, which is unusual compared to my other phones. There is no option for me under the touch menu. Older phones have a sensitivity setting, while this one doesn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, While my phone is laying down and not held, the screen is untouchable. No matter who or what touches it it is unresponsive, but as soon as it is lifted up, it starts sensing again. What the heck..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info would be great. Support cant find the issue.&nbsp;</p>
