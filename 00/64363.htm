    <title>WIndows 10 Driver Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WIndows 10 Driver Error</h2>
                    <div>I have an ICOM 7300 Amateur Radio Transceiver which has a USB port, for computer connection. Am currently running Windows 10 Operating System on an HP Desktop computer.
</div>
<div>I intend to use the USB cable for rig control using the Ham Radio Delux software, as well as digital modes, which all require a functional USB connection to a computer.
</div>
<div>I am experiencing problems with the installation of a Virtual Port (VP) to connect my USB to UART. I have installed recommended Silicon Labs CP210x driver, downloaded from the official Silicon Laboratories website. I am using the recommended CP210x drivers
 version 6.7.0.0 for the VP and give an error message Code 10. it won't work. When l click on device manager the com virtual port allocated for the USB to UART bridge has a yellow exclamation mark. I have also reset the VID and PID as recommended in some forums.</div>
<br />
What is interesting is that the installation has created two OEM.inf files (OEM28.inf and OEM40.inf) and both seem to be in use. I have noted that the system registry does actually recognize both files as active drivers for the silabvcp.inf. I have further
 tried to uninstall the Silicon Lab drivers and delete these OEM files with silabenm.sys and the associated files and fails to delete as they are in use.<br />
<br />
I am using an HP 280 G2 Minitower business PC running Windows 10.<br />
<br />
I have also tried to uninstall the silicon lab software/program and cannot be located in features and programs so that l could delete the above files manually.
<div>Please can you advise me how you resolved this vexing problem thatI have been grappling with for the past six months.</div>
<div>
<div>So, the problem appears to be essentially one of Windows not accepting or loading the driver, when this is done and the com port created, the rest should (hopefully), be relatively straight forward.</div>
<div>Please note that I have, over the past six months, attempted to install the CP210x driver on various laptops and desktops, on Windows 10 as well as Windows 8.1, and always experience the same problem (driver installation failure).</div>
<div>Please find attached herewith, a number of computer screenshots, as well as the CP210x driver, which I hope you may find useful in ascertaining the exact problem and providing a solution.</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have installed TeamViewer and am quite happy for you to log in remotely and have a look at the problem.</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Compatibility is a possible reason why this issue is happening. We suggest getting in touch with your device manufacturer because we might be looking at a hardware compatibility issue.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have other concerns.

<h2>            MS Retail Store &#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Many - too many times I encounter the advice to contact your local Microsoft Retail Store for help with the Surface Book and other MS hardware products.</p>
<p>Many times, I hear comments about how helpful MS staff proved to be and how easily hardware could be replaced - by the real McCoy and not refurbishes.</p>
<p>This is all very nice and very commendable.</p>
<p>BUT:</p>
<p>For all of us who are not in the vicinity of such a store - certainly the vast majority of Microsoft users on this planet - such advice is at best useless. Personally - and I am certainly not alone - I feel annoyed, not taken seriously as a customer and
 left standing in the rain without an umbrella.</p>
<p>For those who are lucky enough to live near to such a store, this advice is so obvious that they probably feel like reprimanded schoolchildren.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, dear and well meaning advice givers, please refrain from giving worthless and insulting advice just because you need to fulfill a quota or you are collecting credit points for published responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the same goes for the answer:</p>
<p>"Have you installed all the latest updates? If not, please do so and see how it affects your problem!"</p>
<p>Perhaps we are not all members of MENSA or child prodigies but we are not morons either.</p>

            <p>Most of the folks posting here in the English forum ARE in the US. I can't speak for others, but I always say IF YOU ARE IN THE US.. when I send folks to the store. The sad truth is that when someone needs to swap, especially a brand new device, exchanging
 online = a refurb while going to a physical store MAY get a new device. Otherwise I tell folks to return and repurchase. For other issues, that may not require a swap, I might tell folks to visit a store if they appear to be having difficulty.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a volunteer, I get nothing for trying to help others. I rarely suggest that updates will resolve the issue unless I know someone is way behind on updates. There also were issues in 8.1 that were addressed in10, not that Windows 10 doesn't have issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's rare that enough detail is posted to really triage anyone's problems. And sometimes advice is posted that helps a large number of people with similar issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if you have a specific issue that needs to be resolved or if you are just commenting on a past issue that was not resolved satisfactorily. With the initial launch of the&nbsp;SP4 and Surface Book, there certainly were enough people reporting issues
 out of the box that there were lots of replies to return and repurchase, go to a MS Store, etc. Which is what I personally would do with a new machine that exhibited some of the issues being reported.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't speak for the PAID staff (Forum Moderators, Support Engineers that have Microsoft badges). I can say that as a MVP, I try to do what is best for each individual situation and don't use scripted replies (I do post boilerplate on how to do a two button
 reset if I think that might resolve an issue - which gives exact steps). </p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you have an overall issue with the quality of the support overall in these forums.

    <title>Windows 7 issue &#63; , Desktop Icons all move to left side afer every - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimdirt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 issue &#63; , Desktop Icons all move to left side afer every reboot</h2>
                    <p>I had this issue before i reformatted , with a 7 upgrade (Vista Ultimate to 7 Ultimate) , so now i have Windows 7 Pro 64 bit , and my PC has been up and running 1 day&nbsp; , everything is FRESHLY formatted and a CLEAN install&nbsp; , it was doing this before i reformatted
 as well , , its not a virus or anything else I DID , its a Microsoft issue ,&nbsp; but EVERY TIME i reboot for any reason , all the icons i placed where i wanted them (games and programs) , ALL are crammed over to the left side&nbsp; , i had them on the top and along
 the left and right side (at the moment , 13 Icons total so far , so not a lot)&nbsp; , then restart the pc or just shut down , then restart , and every time&nbsp; , they are back to the left side again , all jumbled together&nbsp;&nbsp; , i have been searching Google and it seems
 this is a common issue </p>
<p>
</p><p>My Vista PC does not do this , nor did my XP PC , so this seems to be a 7 above , issue&nbsp;, and what seems to be the "answer" from my Google search is to download some third party software to "solve" the issue ??&nbsp;&nbsp; , i would like to know how to make Windows
 not decide where it wants the icons i put where i wanted , to go , every time i reboot , this is VERY annoying !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a Windows <strong>FIX</strong> for this issue without downloading some&nbsp; non Windows band aid&nbsp; ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for Windows 7 Professional 64 bit SP1 freshly installed last night , on a BRAND NEW 1tb Western Digital hard drive with a 25" HP HD LCD Wide Screen Monitor
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated , but i want a FIX for the issue , not someone asking me what i did wrong to cause this&nbsp; , since it was NOTHING i did , its been a issue since i installed 7 and put the icons where
<strong>I</strong> wanted them&nbsp;&nbsp; , every game or program i installed , Windows put the Icons to the left side&nbsp;&nbsp; , it did this before doing any updates , and after&nbsp; , i just rebooted before posting this , and all my Icons were crammed over to the left&nbsp; , the
 only "Windows" Icons i have on my desktop are , My Computer , My Documents , and Recycle Bin , it seems to move them&nbsp; (reverses My Documents and Recycle Bin) when it crams all the others to the left&nbsp;&nbsp; , My Computer Icon (at the top left) stays put</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not find any setting to keep them where I put them&nbsp; , I have&nbsp; , Auto Arrange Icons and Align Icons to Grid , both unchecked , Show Desktop Icons and Show Desktop Gadgets , both checked&nbsp; , and Medium Icons , for Icon size</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again&nbsp; , a FIX would be nice&nbsp; , i have tried everything i can find in Windows settings to stop this , but there is no "keep Icons where i put them" box to check</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing related to the Desktop&nbsp; , the Screensaver sometimes does not work&nbsp; , it will just sit there on the desktop , then the next time i am done it will work&nbsp; , i have it set to 5 minutes , and have all the power saving shut off so they dont make
 anything go to sleep , i have the screensaver set to pictures , but sometimes it works&nbsp; , sometimes it just shows the desktop like the screensaver is off , i never know when its going to work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp; , Jim</p>

            Well i have a "sort of" fix&nbsp; , it seems if you click align to grid , it will leave the Icons to the closest "grid" point that is on the desktop , so it won't be exactly where you put the Icon , but it will be close and will stay in place after reboot&nbsp;&nbsp;
 , kind of dumb , but for some reason Microsoft did not think i needed to put Icons where I wanted them&nbsp; , but just close to where I wanted them<br />

            No&nbsp; , i can refresh and they stay put , it only happens when the computer is restarted &nbsp; , it makes no sense&nbsp; , but at least now i don't have to rearrange them every time i restart&nbsp; , i just can't put them exactly where i want them

            Yea i don't get why i can only keep them in place if i lock them to a grid&nbsp; , if i uncheck that , they all go to the left side after every reboot&nbsp; , it does not do it in Vista&nbsp; , so i am guessing its a Win 7 issue only&nbsp; , why would they keep something
 in Vista , take it away in 7 and put it back in 8 ??

            <p>Hi...most likely your system will not 'activate' because of the new mother board.</p>
<p>The only thing you could try is to do a 'Clean Install' using your Microsoft account and it might activate...other wise you would need to buy a new Windows 10 key.</p>
<p>I have done a clean install on an non Windows 10 machine and it activated...but that was last year {August}....you can only try...</p>
<p>but your old hard drive will most probably not work on the new machine...sorry.</p>

<h2>            Halo Reach System Link</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so I recently got together with some friends for Halo Reach System Link Play, modded some maps, etc.&nbsp; Once we all got together and tried connect, we couldn't join each other.&nbsp; So did the system cache clear on all 3 boxes got the newest update for the
 game, and wala, we were connected and in the same game.&nbsp; Now the next part is what confused me.&nbsp; According to the load screen, the levels with the stars are the ones I have on the xbox, and the ones without the stars I have to purchase from Marketplace.&nbsp; I
 edited the maps with the stars.&nbsp; Rather trying to play the stock levels with the stars next to them, or my modded, my other two boxes load the map, but with me being the host, my box fails to load content.... How is this possible?&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Load falures are a problem in Reach.It happens in online multiplayer a lot.Keep trying.Also make sure all 3 consoles have the EXACT same maps.In other words be sure the other two consoles are updated with any recent changes you made on your primary console.</p>

<p>You used the word modded twice, what type of mods are you talking about exactly?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Modded in this context just means modified maps using in game tools. Reach allows for map modification to make custom&nbsp; maps, or you can take an existing map and change iot around. You can save and share these maps and play with them even online as long as
 everyone has that map.</p>

            <p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you tried to connect your USB drive with every USB port on your system?</li><li>Are you able to install all Windows updates.</li></ol>
<p>As you have tried to choose the option <strong>Always install the best driver software from Windows Update
</strong>already, I would suggest you to once click the radio button for <strong>
Yes, do this automatically (recommended), </strong>save the changes and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would suggest you to try to remove and reinstall all the USB controllers and check with the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, clicking
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>, clicking
<strong><span>System and Security</span></strong>, and&nbsp;then, under
<strong><span>System</span></strong>, clicking
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></li><li><span>In the list of hardware categories, find and expand
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Universal Serial Bus controllers</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></li><li><span>Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong> to remove them one at a time.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer, and let the USB controllers get reinstalled.</span></li><li><span>Plug in the removable USB device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            How do you pin a &#34;System Setting&#34; to the start menu&#63;</h2>
                    I use the "Night Light" in the system settings but I like to adjust it during the night. Can I pin it to the Start Menu as a shortcut? If not, can this be a feature request?

            The quickest way you can get to it at this point is to to Pin the Display tab in Settings to Start.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System
<br />Right click 'Display'
<br />Click 'Pin to Start'
<br />
<br />Click Yes.
<br />
<br />It would at least reduce the 4 step process to two. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />You can install F.lux, which is similar to Nighlight and would add a quick control to your Taskbar notification area you can easily turn on.

    <title>Abuse of power by Enforcement Team - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chudderick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Abuse of power by Enforcement Team</h2>
                    <p>Is there no one out there watching the enforcement team to make sure they're not abusing their power? I have been targeted by one or more of these corrupt, power hungry, chip on the shoulder, little man syndrome, low skill, backstabbing little rats. Somone on the enforcement team has made it his/her mission to prevent me from enjoying xbox live. I have a lot invested in games, console, add ons, xbox live, controllers and headsets. A low skill kid with a grudge on the enforcement team needs to have the power taken away and get his console banned. So who monitors these "like a woman scorned" kids who are crapping on the integrity of Microsoft, XBOX, and the Enforcement Team? I'm completely disgusted by my experience in receiving 3 back to back to back communication suspensions for 100 days each time. My console gets tagged and no one in my family can play online. Someone has a close eye on my account and console because the suspensions get worse as the days go on. What can be done? Why do

You can always submit your case for review (see: <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howTo#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howTo#sub-topic0-6</a> ) if you feel you were unfairly treated. I will add, however, that if someone sends you a message filled with abuse or gives abuse over in-game chat why not report them or ignore it rather than respond?

<p><span>Hi shortstop1,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thanks for posting your question in
</span>Microsoft Vista Community Forums. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The term
<strong>”compatibility”</strong> refers to whether the manufacturers or software publishers have stated that the product or software is supported on Windows Vista. With advances in security and reliability in Windows Vista, thousands of products have been updated
 for compatibility with Windows Vista to provide a superior PC experience.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The term
<strong>“Certified”</strong> for Windows Vista indicates that the products or the softwares have undergone Microsoft tests for reliability, security, and compatibility on PCs running 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Windows Vista. Certified for Windows Vista products
 help make activities like enjoying photos and music, setting up wireless networks, connecting with friends, and completing business tasks faster, easier, and more secure.</span></p>

There are no legitimate sources from which to download the application. <br />
One buys media-less Product Keys only when one already has the <br />
installation media on hand and requires an additional installation license.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Home will not boot or restart with USB Storage Spaces pool - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgetaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home will not boot or restart with USB Storage Spaces pool drives attached</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, my Windows 10 Home will no longer boot or restart if my USB Storage Spaces drives are attached. It hangs on the initial "Toshiba" splash screen and never loads Windows 10. If I unplug the USB cord to the Storage Spaces drive, and reboot,
 everything loads fine. At which point I manually reattach my USB cord for the Storage Space drives to the computer and it goes through the process of reading the drives and bringing the Storage Spaces back on line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is related to my growing pool of 16 USB Storage Spaces pool drives (about 50TB), or if there is something else preventing my computer from rebooting with the pool drives attached. When I first was building my Storage Spaces pool, and
 had only a handful of drives, there was no problem. I now have waited as long as 30 minutes for the computer to reboot with the 16 current drives attached, but it just hangs. Only takes about 1-2 minutes to load without drives attached, then another 2 minutes
 to recognize the Storage Spaces pool drives when reattached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this problem? Any thoughts as to a solution? Obviously, not too hard to boot everything manually, but would certainly prefer not to have the system hang after every restart when the drives are attached. Thanks for any comments.</p>

<p>I would recommend running a Refresh, accessible via the Charms/Settings/PC settings/General. Your personal files will be safe, but you'll need to reinstall anything you've added to the Windows 8 PC.

            It is far more than a "pain". It is several hours (10-20) of lost work - and may be unnecessary. I discovered that my System Mechanic tune up program made a change to the registry. I undid its registry change and all apps work fine.

Hello BNeil, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Mechanic is a 3rd party program, and if you read that post carefully, it is what caused the problems, not what helped the problem.

    <title>Play of MP4 attachments to emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darylfoster1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Play of MP4 attachments to emails</h2>
                    <div>I got no hits searching the internet for an answer to this problem. Did not even find anyone reporting the same problem.</div>
<div>I have a problem playing MP4 videos that have been sent as attachments to emails. This is a new (to me) problem and I cannot connect it to any changes or updates etc. Usually they will play for 5 to 20 seconds and then freeze. If I download them to my
 videos and try to play them I get the same result. The time line keeps running. I’m using Win 10 and Windows live mail 2012. Default player is VLC Media layer. Videos from all other sources play fine on VLC and on other players installed which I assume rules
 out a player fault. I have no other problems with sending, receiving or opening emails etc. I have a second email service via my internet service provider. Again everything works fine with it except playing MP4 attached videos. I get an error message saying
 “this site cannot provide a secure connection, shaw cable sent an invalid response”. I don’t use this email service so that is not a problem but there is more. If I try to download the attachment from here to my videos it gives the same error message. I tried
 converting some of the videos that I had downloaded to my videos from windows Live mail with my dependable Corel Video Studio 9. Without changing the format one then played properly, others had the same error. Some I could not load on Corel with an error message
 saying “file format mismatch”. Confusing as they are all MP4. All other types of attachments work normally. Links in emails to videos work properly.</div>

            Hi Daryl.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This could have to do with WIndows Live Mail being discontinued years ago and now actively having its features shut down.  See here:  <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3067121/email/microsoft-to-windows-live-mail-2012-users-switch-now.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3067121/e...</a>
<br />
<br />I would use WIndows 10 Mail app which is an easier way to access your mail with a huge inbox that lets you merge all of your Office and Web Mail account, and an even larger ad-free reading pane.  See here how to get started:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-get-started-mail-app-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-get-started-...</a>
<br />
<br />Then test sending emails without WLM involved to see if the MP4's play. 
<br />
<br />If not try playing them in VLC which is the best alternate player:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for the reply. A good thought but MP4's&nbsp; from <strong>sources other than email attachments</strong>&nbsp;play fine on all my players. That would rule out codecs as the problem would it not. Drf</p>

</p><p>As noted in my original post I do have an alternate&nbsp;email app and it has a similar problem. In all other respects Win live 2012 works great and we like it better than the new one.</p>

            Daryl -
<br />
<br />May I ask why you gave me a bad rating before I had that chance to help you further?  Please don't shoot the messenger.  Did you not want me to tell you Microsoft is shutting down Windows Live Mail?  I am not Microsoft, just someone trying to help.
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it.  
<br />
<br />In WIndows 10 Mail app usually just removing the account, restarting PC and then adding it back will fix such problems.  What Mail app are you using?

<div>Greg,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bad rating? Don’t recall doing any rating or a place to rate. I’m 84 so some things go astray. Sorry. Is this about the “did this solve your problem yes or no”?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Being old school I always like to find out what is the specific problem rather than just accept the currently popular solution of replacing the whole thing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am and was aware that Windows Live is going away and that is one of the reasons I have Shaw Mail as a backup to Windows Live Mail 2012. We did not like the 2019 version. I do not use the Windows 10 mail app.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If I remove Windows Live Mail 2012 and re-install do I lose my files and folders?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            As I said, Windows Live Mail is being shut down right now.  If it still runs then it won't for much longer as it is no longer supported as discussed in the article announcing this which is over a year old now.  
<br />
<br />I suggest trying Windows 10 Mail app which is an easier way to access your mail with a huge inbox that lets you merge all of your Office and Web Mail account, and an even larger ad-free reading pane.  See here how to get started:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-get-started-mail-app-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-get-started-...</a>
<br />
<br />I put it on my 85 year old Mom's desktop as a backup and noticed it's all she's using now.  She said she likes it much better than accessing mail on the internet at several different sites.  So I recommend trying it and will be here to help you get it set up as needed.

            It can depend on which program created the video as to which codecs are used, some have their own codecs, hence why I mentioned downloading these, I recommend trying the suggestion at least before you marked my post as not answering your question.
<br />Are you playing the videos directly from the email or saving them first?
<br />Are the videos all from one sender or does this affect all emailed videos?
<br />Can you upload one of the problematic videos to OneDrive or another media sharing site so I can test it?

<div><span>Thank you for the reply.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Q. Are you playing the videos directly from the email or saving them first?</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>A. Have tried both methods and the result is the same.&nbsp; </span>
<span>After saving tried to play on up to 4 different players.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span>Also tried re saving in same format via Corel Video Studio. This fixed one of three tried. (so far) I found some of these videos on Youtube or elsewhere and they would play.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Q. Are the videos all from one sender or does this affect all emailed videos?
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>A. Videos are from at least 5 senders who are the senders that I receive most of this type of mail from. About six months ago when this started it was only the odd one that either would not play or would start to play and then freeze. In
 the last two weeks it has been almost all that start to play then stop while the time line continues to run.. Some did play normally.</span></div>
<span>
<div><br />
Q. Can you upload one of the problematic videos to OneDrive or another media sharing site so I can test it?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</span>
<div><span>A. Here is a link to a file of videos&nbsp; that start to play and then stop..&nbsp;

<h2>            Xbox one keeps randomly shutting off </h2>
                    <p>What's up.&nbsp;</p><p>My xbox one keeps randomly shutting off while I'm playing games. It can't be a ventilation problem, as just now I turned it on and was playing a game for 20 min before it shut off. I've tried restarting, resetting wireless router, resetting the power supply, and nothing is working. Anyone know what's going on? My xbox is 3 years old. Any help is appreciated. Thanks </p>

            <p>Hey GreatDane8610! Sorry to hear about the power issues you're running in to! To start off, does this issue occur with specific games and apps or across all of them? Additionally, was the console purchased in the same location that you're using it in currently? Post back and let us know!</p>

<p>I have had this problem happen with my Xbox one S. Heres how I fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your Xbox have a wan, or vents? If so,move your xbox to an area that isn’t very tightly closed in, if your xbox is in a very tight and small area, it will catch lots of dust. If that doesn’t work, do a hard reset, the steps for the reset are: hold xbox
 button for 10 seconds-Turn Xbox back on. The hard reset won’t reset your account or delete your progress, as far as I have experienced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don’t know about power bricks/supplies, as I havn’t used them in a long time, but I hope this helped.</p>

            Could be a ventilation issue, male sure its not in an enclosed area. You may also have to send it in for service if the vent doesnt clear up

            Hi,<br />
<br />
A clean install of Windows 10 on your computer doesn't require install 8.1. You can install Windows 10 directly on your computer and still use the existing digital product key. Click this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">Forum Article</a></strong>
 by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> for steps on how to perform a clean install. We recommend deleting all existing partitions and create a new partition.<br />
<br />
If you need a Windows 10 ISO file, you may click this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to download a Windows 10 ISO using a USB drive.<br />

<p>You would use the Windows 8.1 product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span>Windows 10 Digital License</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be
 stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through
 the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>you
 already own&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>

<h2>            iTunes was not installed correctly. Please reinstall iTunes. Error 7</h2>
                    Windows 7 64 bit fresh install (although I did use laplink to transfer files and some applications) installing iTunes 64 bit version.&nbsp; Does all the installation, says it is finished. However when I load iTunes I get an immediate error stating "iTunes was
 not installed correctly. Please reinstall iTunes. Error 7".<br />
<br />
If it matters .NET Framework isn't happily installed either (that will be&nbsp;adifferent thread).<br />
<br />
I've tried 'Byetunes.exe" and Revo Unistaller as Final Uninstaller to clean the system of Apple/iTunes files and registery entries.<br />
