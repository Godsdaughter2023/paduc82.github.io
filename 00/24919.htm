<h2>            Incoming Skype call does not wake sleeping PC &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    I set properties of Realtek WiFi adapter power management to wake PC, but this did not help. Online support agent says I need to change Skype settings, but I don't see how.

<p>Very few PCs that I know of will do anything while asleep even if you set your network or Wi-Fi adapter to wake the PC. The Wake on LAN feature you might be looking at is probably used in the corporate world to power on or wake PCs using what's called "Magic
 Packet" so the PCs can be supported after hours or patched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dozen computers and only one (a dell tablet) will get notifications while asleep. It's a special Intel Atom Z3740D CPU designed for low power usage. Newer and newer chips are coming on the market that support what you're talking about. Antivirus
 scans, Windows Updates, and notifications while asleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your PC?</p>

<p>Hi Rahul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why an issue occurs, sometimes this may be caused by some files or components that are broken or missing on the system. To sort out your concern, we suggest that you restore deleted email messages in your Outlook.com account. To
 do this, you may follow the steps provided on this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Restore-deleted-email-messages-in-Outlook-com-cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com">link</a></strong>.

            It just lists the email till Oct 2016. And to add to that the select all while holding the shift + ctrl doesnt seem to work when i scroll down. Why am I getting a feeling that I have lost all my emails?&nbsp;

            This has to be my worst experience with my email account. For years i have carefully managed my inbox. Deleting every single one that i don't need, marking senders as spam to avoid further cluttering. However, thanks to this issue I had to recover all
 the emails that I deleted on purpose to restore my Others inbox deleted because of this issue. To add to this, there wasn't a select all option to selected all of the deleted folder and restore it. I had to select 20-25 (whatever the limit) at a time and click
 on restore.The "Select all" seems to be reserved for just clearing off the inbox. I have managed to restore emails unto Oct 2016 and am not sure if the ones before that exist. I have already spent an hour clicking buttons and highly frustrated because of this
 experience.&nbsp;

    <title>Search not working in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterfacey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search not working in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Search was working fine for a year until last week. Then it went to finding nothing and saying "find more on the server" (I only have POP3 accounts).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that search is actually done by windows indexing. I tried rebuilding the index but no improvement. I find that if I remove Outlook from windows indexing then when I search in Outlook it says "the search could not be completed because of an error"
 but then it goes on and actually finds some matches (I assume that Outlook does a slower search if windows indexing isn't working?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc /scannow finds no errors.</p>
<p>Repairing Outlook does not solve it.</p>
<p>Running Outllook in safe mode doesn't solve it.</p>
<p>Searching in Windows Explorer works ok, suggesting windows indexing is still working.</p>
<p>Scanpst produces many errors, not all repairable on my 1GB PST. However, if I create a completely new PST file using Outlook, receive a few emails, then the search problem still exists. Thus it doesn't seem to be a function of the PST file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note that scanpst finds "errors" in this completely new PST file. If I then import a 94KB CSV file of my contacts, scanpst finds a lot more errors. If you want to see those two scanpst logs they are at http://www.brisk.org.uk/pics/psterr.zip I have read
 the posts about scanpst reporting spurious or unimportant errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also looked at Event Viewer but am not expert at interpreting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I haven't tried is to use a new Outlook profile. The reason I can't do that is I have 76 POP3 accounts. It would take several days of work to re-enter them. As far as I know, Outlook has no automation and no import/export facility for POP3
 accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I do please?</p>

            Thanks. I had actually noticed that the PST file type Filter Description only said "File properties filter", but had assumed that was normal. Changing it to "Index properties and file contents" solves my issue. No idea how it got set wrongly in the first
 place.

<h2>            Granting an active directory group permission to a sharepoint library using powershell&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Here's what I'm trying to do with powershell/Sharepoint Online Management Shell:</p>
<p>Grant an Active Directory group: "group 1"<br />
a custom permission I created in SPO "custom permission"<br />
to a library "library 1"<br />
in my site collection "site1"</p>
<p>I can't figure it out, but I'm sure it's possible. I found some articles detailing processes that would effectively allow me to do this, but involved adding an AD group to SPO group, which would necessitate creating a SPO group for every library.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>You can do everything you are asking. What you ll have to do on the library level after you click on Share you ll need to stop Inheriting permissions. then you ll be able to grant you AD group (make sure it is a SECURITY group as it wont work otherwise)
 access using the custom level permissions you created.</p>

<p>hi thedl,</p>
<p>to assign a sharepoint group custom permission level, we are able to run the following command to make it:<br />

<p>however, for the ad security group, it’s not feasible to find it via sharepoint management shell. we may consider adding the ad security group to the sharepoint group via csom, then use sharepoint management shell to assign sharepoint group related custom
 permission. to add the ad security group to the sharepoint group via csom, we have a dedicated support forum which focuses on the related customization queries, you can post in our

    <title>Default email paragraph formatting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jetcat33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default email paragraph formatting</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook version 15.31. &nbsp;I just installed it. &nbsp;In my signatures preference, I pasted from Word my preferred signature text. &nbsp;After this point, all my new emails have awkward font and paragraph formatting. &nbsp;When I compose a new email, all my font is
 Times New Roman even though in the preferences section, I changed the default email font to Calibri. &nbsp;Also, all my paragraphs have 0.5" indentation and 12 point space after the paragraph. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I delete my signature preference, the font in new emails is back to what it should be - Calibri. &nbsp;By the paragraph indentation and spacing doesn't revert back to no indentation and no space after the paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume the signature screwed up whatever default template Outlook uses for composing emails. &nbsp;I wasn't able to find a "normal.dot" or something similar when looking at the Outlook.app contents. &nbsp;Anywhere else I might fix this apart from deleting and reinstalling
 Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you guys (Microsoft) fix this? &nbsp;Add a preference that allows me to set default paragraph styles (not just font) for emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Jetcat33,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience the fonts and indentions applied on the signature will be applied on the whole email body. I suggest when
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Create-and-insert-a-signature-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-f4d21492-0956-4429-95ad-2769745b539c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
creating the signature</a>, make sure the fonts and indentions are correct on word before you copy and paste the signature into the Outlook client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding “finding normal.dot”, go to Finder and type <strong>Normal.dotm </strong>
to search this template file.</p>
<p>Or you can manually locate the folder Path: ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding “set default paragraph styles”, you can refer to this article to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Format-email-messages-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-cb35806b-4174-41d2-9cba-b6b624d988b3?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to post back if you have further questions.</p>

                    I purchased one year of 365 and the email thanked me for "choosing autorenew." Of course, I made no choice. When I went to commerce.microsoft.com, I saw no way to turn off autorenew. I don't like autorenew as I always want to be reminded and select if
 I really want to renew. How do I turn it off?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since you have subscribed for annual Office 365 home premium subscription the renewal process would be automatic. Hence there is no option for manual renewal.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want to stop the automatic renewal, you need to cancel the subscription.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since you have set up an annual subscription, you will be notified before you are charged.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information refer to the Question:
<strong>Will I be notified before I’m charged? </strong>which is mentioned<strong>

            I decided to start over from scratch, formatted the disk and reinstalled &nbsp;build 10049, but this time I used express setting, not knowing exactly what those were, and boy, am I glad I did. I have dual boot with Win 7 on another HD, but I had no idea that
 those settings would be used on Win 10. I then downloaded and installed 10061, and now everything is perfect. Am I imagining that everything is faster? I am a happy camper. Thanks to the people here, who tried to help me.

    <title>Limited connectivity with wifi, no connection with ethernet &#40;or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr.drifter.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Limited connectivity with wifi, no connection with ethernet &#40;or when phone tethered&#41;</h2>
                    So, I was following another thread, but figured it might be easier to make my own, considering my difficulties were a little off, and I do kinda need it fixed soon.<br />
<br />
But anyway, What's happening:<br />
It'll see a wifi connection, it will connect to the wifi connection, and it'll say limited.<br />
I'll plug my phone in (It'll see the phone), I'll then tap it into tether over usb, to which it gets the usb removed sound (as per usual), then nothing happens. It doesn't show up in the ethernet options at all, or as a connection.<br />
<br />
What I have done:<br />
From the beginning. I had win7 home premium 64bit. Upgraded, so it's retained all my settings and programs.<br />
<br />
-I've tried the troubleshoot, it'll tell me there may be issues with the ethernet driver and wifi driver.<br />
-I've then tried downloading new drivers after uninstalling the previous ones (going from the win7 64bit to win 8.1 64bit)<br />
-I've tried resetting ip via cmd prompt<br />
-I've tried manually assigning an ip<br />
-I've tried resetting the router (as the win 8 guide said that could be the cause)<br />
<br />
Now, I checked ipconfig in cmd prompt, and it doesn't show any ip, so, I'm a bit confused. The win8 guide said it might not be getting an ip assigned. So, it's looking like driver issues and/ or router issues (laptop works fine, although that was fresh install.
 What I'm currently typing on)<br />
<br />
Specs:<br />
Amd 955 black edition cpu<br />
Gigabyte 970a-d3 (very first gen/ early revision)<br />
Msi 7850 twin frozr gpu<br />
Corsair vengeance ddr3 16gb ram 1600mhz<br />
Samsung 840 evo 128gb ssd<br />
Seagate 2tb hdd x2<br />
Tp-link WN881ND wireless card<br />
<br />
Phone I'm using for tethering is my samsung galaxy note III<br />
Worked fine on 7, but now doesn't.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on what to try?<br />
Am I perhaps not getting the right drivers for it? I would have thought 8.1 64bit drivers would be better than 7 64bit drivers, if it's not liking them.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
And sorry for the new post, figured it was worth.&nbsp;<br />
I'm probably overlooking something stupidly simple, but, any help would be great.&nbsp;<br />

            Early on I had to roll back one of my drivers from what Microsoft had installed.&nbsp; Not WiFi but one of the others, so I would check your drivers to see if they match the Win 7 drivers.

            <p>Anybody got any other thoughts? It definitely looks like driver issues, but it's not looking like it likes any of the drivers thrown at it.</p>
<p>don't really want to wait till late july to be able to use the computer again. Also don't want to fresh install win7. Reinstalling everything is a bit of a pain tbh, hah.</p>

            <p>I did try that i think, but same deal. It is weird though, as soon as I uninstall the network drivers, they disappear from the list, and I have to use an exe file to install them to see them (vs seeing the thing with missing drivers, and showing it the location

            All good. I ended up reinstalling win7, and using that. It wasn't working properly, and I couldn't roll back, or upgrade.<br />
If I do it again, may have to fresh install 10. Seems that works a lot better. Otherwise will wait until it's been out for a while, so I know there are drivers and what not

            I did a clean install and it worked.&nbsp; I am concerned about upgrading my primary unit from Windows 7 if this is the solution.&nbsp; The upgrade process should not have this problem.&nbsp; A clean install means hours of additional work to reinstall apps and move data.&nbsp;
 The network adapter drivers are the same, so it is unclear why they did not work in the upgrade, but work on a clean install.

            you try mHotspot app? http://www.mhotspot.com/&nbsp; this works very good just make sure you start up app in admin and unblock in properties,.... go to network settings and check the boxes and make sure its registering on virtual adapter but on local area connection#....?
 this has been a great way for me to connect via wifi and the tethering&nbsp; is cool with a combo of mobogenie http://www.mobogenie.com/ as you can do all kinds of other stuff.... basic but works! good luck

                    <p>I have a new computer with Windows 7 installed from the factory.&nbsp; I have the original disks for Office 2003 and the Office 2007 upgrade with a business license for both.&nbsp; I've installed both successfully on my new computer.&nbsp; Each and every time I attempt
 to send a message from Outlook 2007, it remains in the "Outbox".&nbsp; I click on "Send/Receive All" and get the error message, "The Operation Failed.&nbsp; An Object Could Not Be Found."&nbsp; I have searched the forums.&nbsp; I removed the two email accounts I had installed,
 created a new profile as suggested in the forums, but still the same error message.&nbsp; To be noted is when I originally added a new email account, I inadvertently added an IMAP email account (not sure why that happened) when my email accounts should be installed
 as POP3 accounts.&nbsp; Again, I'm not sure what the difference is, but I do know my two email accounts need to be POP3.&nbsp; So, now I've removed the two POP3 accounts but the IMAP email account does not show in the listing for accounts (see pic below), BUT I still
 have it receiving email.&nbsp;&nbsp; See 2nd pic below.</p>

            If this were to happen to me, I'd remove all traces of Office, reboot, then install Office 2007, putting the Office 2003 CD in the optical drive when the installation process attempts to find the previous version of Office.&nbsp; You should not need Office
 2003 installed first before installing Office 2007 as long as you have the disk for the qualifying product.

<p>Hi David, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my experience, the issue should not be related to the Outlook for Mac client. You can set up your colleague’s account on your client and send test emails to the external address to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you narrow down the issue, please let me know the following points:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 . Does this issue happen to other colleagues in your organization?</p>
<p>2 . Check if the issue only happens when you send emails to some specific domains, or happens to all other external addresses.</p>
<p>3 . Please upload the mail header and NDR together via private message for further check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>
        </p>

                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"Outlook 2011 Mac - Database problems"</div>
Hi, I had to redo my MacBook Pro (OS X Lion) with Office 2011 installed. I was able to make a clone of my HDD before I did the re-install. My Mac is now up and running again and I re-installed Office 2011 Mac and all updates. I renamed the newly created Main
 Identity and Copied my old Main Identity into the correct location. Then I run the Database Utility to rebuild the Database. The Rebuild shows successful but a lot of my mail is missing. The original size of my Main Identity was 11,96GB after the rebuild it
 reduced to 4.7GB I understand that the size should reduce but it seems like a bit much. I just wish I could get a way of getting the old identity into a single .olm file or some other means of importing.

    <title>Office Home &#38; Student 2010 Product Key Card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randalwilliams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Home &#38; Student 2010 Product Key Card</h2>
                    I have just loaded Office 2010 Home &amp; Student, expecting the " Free Trial" of Outlook, Publisher &amp; Access to be available.
<br />
<br />
All I keep finding is the 'Product Key Activation' page when I try to open any of these three programs..<br />
<br />
How do I set up so that the 'trials' will run?<br />
<br />
Office without Outlook is pretty useless as I cannot send or receive my ISP routed e-mails.<br />
<br />
As Office Home &amp; Student 2010 was advertised with a trial of Outlook in it I assumed it would run with the activated programs (Word, Excel, One Note &amp; Powerpoint all run OK).<br />
<br />
I also assumed that I would be able to upgrade Outlook from within the programme.<br />
<br />
It has not been my experience before that the individual items within the package are separately available.<br />
<br />
I expect to add-on Outlook as it is essential (and why on earh Microsoft decided to leave it out of the basic Office package beats me).<br />
<br />
I clearly cannot do this from within my purchased programme (it was part of the package from Samsung pre-loaded with my new Laptop)<br />
<br />
Help, please.<br />
<br />

            During the installation of Office Home and Student, you should have been given the option to install the trial.&nbsp; Did you see that choice?&nbsp; I know for DVD installation, the choice is there and it's the default choice (i.e., you have to deselect it if you
 don't want it).&nbsp; Did you install from a DVD or from a downloaded installation?&nbsp; I don't know if you have the trial on a downloaded version, although I thought you did.

            <p>Too bad you used the Product Key Card. You would have been better off reselling it and buying Office Home and Business (which has Outlook). Now that you have used it to activate office on a computer you cannot transfer the license to another computer. You
 are stuck with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Outlook is “Missing” </div>
<p><span>You probably bought Office Home and Student which is the only version of Office that does not include Outlook. If that is the case you will have to buy a license for Outlook. You have the option of buying it standalone or in Office Home and Business.
 If you do the math you will find that the total price will be about the same. I suggest going with Home and Business. It will be easier in the long run. You will only have to keep track of a single product key and installation CD/Box/file. You will be able
 to resell Home and Student. You can try for a refund on your Home and Student, but I doubt you'll get it:<br />

</span></b></span></p>
<p><span>If you bought something other than Office Home and Student, you can go back to install just Outlook alone. follow this general procedure:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span>I have Office Home and Student. I Need Outlook. Now What?</span> </div>
<p><span><span>You have to buy a product key that is valid for Outlook.<span>&nbsp; </span>
O</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The simplest apparent solution is to buy Outlook standalone for rougly USD$140. However, I have been told that this may not be the best overall approach for a couple of reasons. The obvious reason is that you'll have to manage 2 separate Office
 installations: separate install files/CD's and separate product keys. The other reason I've been told about is that when you install a standalone Outlook it does NOT fully integrate with the existing H&amp;S. Apparently spell checking dictionaries are maintained
 separately and a few other things.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you do the math, retail H&amp;S has list price USD$150. Standalone Outlook has list price USD$140. Home and Business is USD$280. So, if you have the option, buying H&amp;B makes best sense all around.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you bought the Retail/"FPP" license for H&amp;S, you have the option of uninstalling it and reselling it to someone else. If you have an OEM or Product Key Card license transferring the license to someone else is NOT an option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>PS: prices assume Retail/"FPP" license (my only recommendation). The product key card name "equivalents" are slightly cheaper on the surface. But if you understand the implication of license terms, you instantly realize that for most people the
 PKC is effectively a scam IMO (because most people are not aware of the downsides of the the PKC when they buy it)</span></span></p>

</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Of course, for home users who don’t have to connect to a MS Exchange Server, you may simply want to go with a freeware equivalent to Outlook. One of those is Thunderbird</span></span></p>

<p><span>I think the problems go beyond themes. I believe they may also include:</span></p>
<p><span>Automatic formatting of bulleted and numbered lists <br />
Automatic formatting of tables <br />
Proofing tools like the dictionary and thesaurus <br />
SmartArt graphics drawing, charting, and diagramming tools <br />
Captions <br />
Equation Builder <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to why Outlook is not included with Home and Student, I'm guessing that basically since Outlook works best with an Exchange server backend and most homes and students do not have need to connect to Exchange, it made sense to continue to offer an edition
 without Outlook. </p>

<h2>            Proofing tools problems</h2>
                    <p>I've got a problem with my spell check and proofing tools on Office 365's latest build (1004). My version is installed in Dutch on my computer but I regularly use English UK spell check as I live and work in the UK. That had been working fine until I tried
 to spell check something today: I got an error message saying that this language (English UK) was not installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this was very odd as it patently had been installed but to be sure, I clicked on the link provided and installed the English proofing tools again. But the error message still comes up, and in the Options &gt; Language screen it says that English proofing
 tools are not installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t save changes to my Excel spreadsheet on my phone&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure where this question should be posted. So many technologies are involved. I hope I get an answer here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got Office 365 Home Edition. And I've saved an Excel spreadsheet to OneDrive. I can easily find that spreadsheet on my phone (a Lumia 640). I edited it a couple of days ago and saved the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or so I thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I got back into it on my phone to make some additional edits and what did I find? But all of the edits I did two days ago are gone?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What in heck in going on??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is having Office on the Windows Phone just a tease? All anyone can do is merely look at Office documents on the phone, but they can never actually edit them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is something else wrong?</p>

            <p>I just tested it this morning. Yesterday I created a new Excel spreadsheet on my desktop, and saved it to OneDrive. This morning, before doing anything else (i.e.: before logging onto my desktop or in any other way accessing my OneDrive) I got onto it using
 my Lumia 640 phone. I opened the Excel spreadsheet and made a simple edit. I moved off of the cell, which as I understand it saves the changes, and then I got out of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fifteen minutes later I logged into my desktop and checked the same spreadsheet. I didn't see any of the changes that I had made earlier today. So this seems related to Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to go over it again, I've got Office 365 Home Edition installed on my desktop. And of course my Lumia 640 currently has the Denim update on it and Windows Phone 8.1 comes with Office, so I presume I can edit any changes I create in Office 365/Excel
 2016 with my phone, but clearly that isn't possible. It isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not?</p>

            <p>Hi Prabhavathi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry its taken me so long to try what you've suggested. My work schedule often affords me little time to do anything other than the basics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I've tested what you suggested. I got into OneDrive and made a copy of my new Excel spreadsheet. Then I waited 15 minutes (I wasn't sure if I needed to wait or not, so I just did anyway) before going on. After 15 minutes had gone by I got onto my Windows
 Phone and got into Excel. I found the copy of the new Excel spreadsheet there. I opened it and edited it, putting in a few simple words. Then I moved off of the cell, which should have saved the changes. After that I waited another 15 minutes, again to allow
 everything to sync up. Then I went back to my desktop Windows 10 machine, opened the same new Excel spreadsheet. None of the changes I made using Excel on my phone, showed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what's going on? Why isn't this working?</p>
