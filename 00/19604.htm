<div><br />
<span>It is a Fake Call.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>The scam always starts the same way: the phone rings at someone’s home, and the caller –&nbsp; asks for the householder, quoting their&nbsp;</span><span>name and address</span><span>before saying “I’m calling for Microsoft. We’ve had a report from your internet
 service provider of serious virus problems from your computer.”</span><br />

 saying "Always ask before opening this type of file" and it's grayed out. This is on Outlook 2010 on a computer running Windows 7 when trying to open Excel sheets.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Now I have see plenty of post explaining you have to make it open in Admin mode and unchecked the box. I have done this but it opens up my email instead.</p>

    <title>confused about what I need to use Skype fully - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william_porter  say:</h3>
<h2>            confused about what I need to use Skype fully</h2>
                    <p>I've given up on Google Voice and am trying to use Skype now for business. I'm a one-man company and I don't spend the day on the phone; I do spend the day at my computer. So Skype seems to be a good choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm finding the account setup options a bit bewildering. Here's what I need:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I need to be able to RECEIVE incoming calls from anybody, like I can (say) on my mobile phone.</li><li>I need to be able to CALL OUT to anybody (in the USA at least).</li><li>Would be nice to be able to receive and send text messages via Skype, so clients could text my Skype number.</li></ol>
<p>I think that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've now gotten a Skype phone number and I can receive calls (so long as the Skype app is open on my computer). But it looks like I can't send texts or make outgoing calls without also putting credit into my account, so that means more money, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked but can't find a clear simple explanation of what I need. Be grateful for any guidance or for a link to the help article that I have so far missed.</p>
<p>

<h2>            vba IE automation&#40;Excel&#47;Access&#41; in Window 10 wrongly launch maxthon browser instead of Internet explorer</h2>
                    What is good is Window 10 send out questionnaire from time to time that ask if you will recommend it to friends. Answer No and state your problems.<br />
<br />
Like this one,&nbsp;<br />
Before I can run IE automation with the codes (in any office , say EXCEL, ACCESS ) below to launch internet explorer.<br />
But after I install Maxthon browser, it launch Maxthon browser instead.<br />
After uninstall, it still cannot launch internet explorer.<br />
So how can I fix it to launch internet explorer again?????<br />
<br />
Solutions I expect:<br />
<br />
1. explain how we can refresh the registry of IE alone ( don't refresh the whole computer please ) so that it is like a new installation. Also keep my logon cookies. So that it launch internet explorer.<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
2. how to fix the&nbsp; launch problem in Window 10 and let us try it again and again(XD), and I find these online real time supports is time consuming/wasting and useless<br />
<br />
Private Sub IE_Autiomation2()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim i As Long<br />

            Maxthon may have overwritten some registry settings. That is why Window 10 no longer launch the internet explorer. Try to find out where!

<h2>            Changing MicroSD card</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys</p>
<p>I have a Nokia Lumia 720 running on Windows Phone 8.1. I've installed most of my apps on my 16 GB MicroSD card. I'm planning on replacing that one with a new 32 GB card. Is there any way I can make this change without losing my apps? I mean can I transfer
 apps from my old card to the new one? If so, please tell me how to do it. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello RPJ3337:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the question you have about changing SD cards.&nbsp; From my findings and experience there is not going to be an easy way to do this.&nbsp; There is not going to be a way to move these apps from one card to the other, at
 least in a working order.&nbsp; That leaves you with essential two ways to get these to the new card.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can move the apps from the card to the phone storage and then remove the card, enter the new card, format the card and move the apps to the new card.&nbsp;
</li><li>If you cannot move all your apps to the phone storage the next option is a bit more labor intensive but will get the job done.&nbsp; You can move one or two apps to the phone storage.&nbsp; Safely remove the current card,

http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/phones-and-hardware/use-an-sd-card-to-add-space</a> .&nbsp; Add the new card to the phone and format this card.&nbsp; Move the apps on your phone to the card and safely remove the new card.&nbsp; You can then repeat the above steps
 until you have all the apps transferred from one card to the other card.</li></ol>

<h2>            Confirming Software version</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I own a Nokia 3250 with software version number V 04.21. I recently checked the Nokia web site to see if there was any new version and found that the version available is&nbsp; V 03.24 . I would like to know if this is more current ( newer) than the one I am
 currently using.</p>

<p>A similar thing happened to me with a 6300 that I used to own. I updated to v6.0, then later NSU said v5.5 was the latest. It turned out that they had pulled the v6.0 from some product codes due to an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you bought the phone second hand, it could also be the case that the previous owner has hacked the phone using unauthorised software in order to update to an unavailable version.</p>

As PatSend said te Marketplace will hide applications if it finds they are not copatible with your device.
<br />
<br />

<br />
"When you are not logged into the Marketplace the interface shows you applications that don't have certain requirements set (example: Applications that don't require GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi&nbsp;or a hardware keyboard).&nbsp; Applicaitons like this would work on a majority
 of Windows Mobile phones. If an application requires a certain capability then it will only display when you are logged in and a compatible device is associated with your account. An application may disappear when you log in if the application has some requirement
 that conflicts with your device.&nbsp; One example is Monopoly. It works on QVGA and VGA devices but does not work on WVGA and WQVGA devices (those are the compatibility restrictions at the time of this post, that may change in the future).&nbsp; In the USA market you
 can see Monopoly without being signed in but if you sign in and have a Touch Pro II on your account it will disappear from view."

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without an error code, it is hard to specifically target a solution. I will therefore provide a generic solution for update-related problems and if you want to reply with the entire and exact error message word-for-word including the CORRECT code and any
 other codes, I'll see if I can amend the instructions to better fit your specific situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is just this one definition and all others are working fine (and Windows Updates are also working fine), then I'd try the following to see if it resolves the problem. If so, we're done unless it continues to occur or happens to more definition updates
 or begins to affect Windows Updates - then post back explaining what's happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the following compliments of Stephen Boots - MVP:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Update FAQ - </span></b><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/mseupdate/thread/74e507b8-f6da-4eca-8ce7-d1aca7d3f1ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/mseupdate/thread/74e507b8-f6da-4eca-8ce7-d1aca7d3f1ba</span></b></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*********************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, check the system date and time as they often cause update-related problems. Make sure it is as close as possible to the real time - and don't forget to check the year and whether or not it is daylight savings time as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't help, then try the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are your Windows Updates working? Is it only the MSE updates that aren't working?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow these recommendations compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Also, verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial product that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid),
 etc). Then, use the cleanup tools here:</span></strong><span> <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a><span>.You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product
 you install later including MSE.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that Windows Defender is uninstalled (if XP), or Disabled (if Vista/W7).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are using version 2.0.657.0 or 2.1.1116.0 of MSE.</span></strong></p>

<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>. If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to
 reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product. You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the
 desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you
 shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S. If the problem is with all updates and not just MSE definition updates, then check out the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>In C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution, find and delete the contents (but not the folders themselves) of
<b>ONLY</b> the following two folders: Downloads and DataStore.<br />
</span></p>
<span>
<p>And this MAY help resolve the problem if it is caused by an incomplete or stuck update - but it is not guaranteed to fix the update problem because at this point we don't really know the cause. This is one cause and there are many others that this procedure
 won't resolve.</p></span></span><span><span><span><span>If the above doesn't help, then I recommend the following in the order presented:</span></span></span></span>

            <p>Actually, the rule here is pretty simple, and one you should have learned in school:&nbsp; Find out what answer they want and give it to them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A perfect example just today asked what 2015 movie did Drew Pearce write.&nbsp; Answer:&nbsp; "Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation."&nbsp; Wrong!&nbsp; Check hint.&nbsp; Says that Tom Cruise starred in it.&nbsp; So, "Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation," and this time I very carefully
 double and triple check spelling and punctuation.&nbsp; Wrong!&nbsp; Check second hint.&nbsp; Says movie based on sixties TV show.&nbsp; Hmmm...getting a clue here, plus this is my last chance before I get stuck with zero points, which are worth actual money.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, "Mission:&nbsp;
 Impossible," just like the TV show [and NOT the movie].&nbsp; Correct!&nbsp; Yay, though I am also a bit ticked off since this destroyed my already bad game stats [which I didn't know they were keeping until just recently].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second example from a few months ago asks for a steelworker folk hero.&nbsp; I put&nbsp; Joe Magarac, a steelworker made of steel according to Wikipedia, ie. the perfect answer.&nbsp; Wrong!&nbsp; The answer they wanted was John Henry, which was the first name that popped
 into my head, but was quickly dismissed because he was a miner NOT a steelworker.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; Don't argue.&nbsp; Just give them what they want, or no points for you.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, who discovered America?&nbsp; Columbus, 1492?&nbsp; Leif Ericson, 1000 AD?&nbsp; St. Brendan ca. 550 AD? Or, of course, the first Americans to cross the Bering land bridge, maybe 15,000 years ago?&nbsp; You know the answer now.&nbsp; Find out what they want and give it to them.&nbsp;
 Nothing more,&nbsp;nothing less,&nbsp;and nothing else.&nbsp; Easy [sort of, anyway].&nbsp; </p>

            <p>That's hardly the worst offense (though that one got me too)<br />
Today's question about negative numbers is outright wrong... and they're answer is off by well over a thousand years!<br />
Who "invented" negative numbers indeed...</p>
<p>Their answer was a contemporary of Newton, in the 1600's... whereas the Chinese wrote of utilizing the concept during the Han Dynasty (about 200BCE - 200AD). Even if they were looking for a specific author, the Chinese had one in the 3rd century, who wrote
 up rules for dealing with them. India also started using the concept of negatives (somewhere around the 7th century, I think)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess they were looking for when "Western Civilization" figured it out.</p>
<p>(Nope, couldn't even have been that... Islamic scholars were still centuries before that German guy)</p>

            you are correct the trivia challenge is bunk and BS <br />
today it asked for the person who invented Monopoly in the recent news a women created the game<br />
yet the trivia did not give her name as the option just the man who stole her idea and marketed it first.<br />
Elizabeth Magie created the original idea for Monopoly.<br />

            <p>Today, the trivia question is "What kind of bear was Knut?", and the provided choices for an answer are: Polar bear, Kodiak bear, Brown bear, and Grizzly bear, well the correct answer should be Polar bear, but selecting any or all of the answers it gives
 a "<span>Nice try, but that's not the right answer</span>"... What gives?</p>

<p>I agree with you Colin.&nbsp; 17054 it will be.&nbsp; Buildfeed stopped at 1754 too.&nbsp; I just checked.&nbsp; So that would give selfhost Monday and Tuesday and release on Dona's schedule.&nbsp; I think the only question is sooner (Wednesday) or later (Thursday).</p>

                    <div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to create a database in Access 2007, saving it as *.mdb. &nbsp;The idea is to create user-level security for some objects of the database. &nbsp;The problem is after I set user-level security Access closes down, and when I try to reopen the database it
 tells me "You do not have the necessary permissions to use the 'C:\....mdb' object. &nbsp;Have your system administrator of the person who created this object establish the appropriate permissions for you."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It never prompts me for username/password, it just gives me this error message.</div>

            <p>Hi Roney,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My assumption would be that when you secured your database you either were too restrictive with your permissions and have locked yourself out of the database or Access is
 not connected to the proper .mdw file when you are opening the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you used the wizard to secure the database, which option did you choose when it asked what you wanted to do with the new workgroup information file that was being created?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>+&gt;I want to make this my deafault workgroup information file.</p>
<p>+&gt;I want to create a shortcut to open my security-enhanced databse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose the second option, then make sure you are opening your database via the shortcut that was created.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you chose the first option, then I would check to ensure Access is using the proper .mdw file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can go through the steps in the KB article below to make sure it is connected to the proper .mdw file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>918583<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>How to use the Workgroup Administrator utility in Access 2007</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;918583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;918583</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you link Access itself to this .mdw file, then every database you open on this machine will prompt you for a username and password.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you only want to open specific databases with this .mdw file, then you need to create a shortcut that points to the custom .mdw file to open the file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The article below explains this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>305542<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Understanding the role of workgroup information files in Access security</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps don’t help, then are you able to open the backup unsecured copy of the database that the wizard creates when securing the file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully these steps will help.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But with this being said, is there a reason you want to use user level security?<span>&nbsp;
</span>The reason I ask is because you are using a feature that has been deprecated and is only available in the old file format.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I bring this up because I would hate to have you develop a new application and make use of a feature that has been deprecated from the product.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The article below explains this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happened to user-level security?<span>&nbsp;

            Skype software is free of cost with your Windows 10. Skype to Skype calls are free – but to call a mobile or landline from Skype, you need a little Skype Credit or a subscription. 
<br />
<br />The price you pay depends on the country you're calling to, not the country you're calling from.

</p><p>Vivarious is not referring to an error message. This appears to be the new expected functionality (changed a month or two ago) when a user clicks "Outlook Mail" in the upper left corner of the desktop version of the Outlook mail app (outlook.live.com/owa).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a user clicks "Outlook Mail," expecting it to take them back to a home screen (presumably to the inbox, top of the list, no search filter, etc.),&nbsp; it instead displays a non-functional button that says "Skip to message" as shown here:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b489901-f156-41fb-b1d9-9ae3656943f8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b489901-f156-41fb-b1d9-9ae3656943f8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking this button does nothing. Nothing at all. It is both ambiguous and pointless. Clicking anywhere outside of the button changes it back to the normal "Outlook Mail" logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This functionality is the same when accessed from a desktop computer on the latest versions of Edge, IE, Chrome, and Safari. This is the current version of the OWA, not the "beta" version that is also available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To restate the original question: Is there a way to restore the expected functionality of returning to the Inbox when you click "Outlook Mail"?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to add to that question: What is the button "Skip to Message" supposed to mean/do anyway?&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hello! Surely, this "newest feature" should&nbsp;<em>do</em> something though, right? What is it supposed to
<em>do?&nbsp;</em>Or was it Microsoft's intention to provide a button that doesn't do anything?
