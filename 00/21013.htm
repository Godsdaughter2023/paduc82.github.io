<h2>            footnotes beneath text but would like them at bottom of page</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I'm working on a document which came to me already formatted. The footnotes appear right below the text but I would like them to appear at the bottom of the page. Where can I change that?<br />
<br />
Thank you. <br />
<br />

            Hi Mayla:
<div><br />
<div>It should be Insert&gt;Footnote and change the Location to "Bottom of page".</div>
<div><br />
<div>All of your footnotes should move as soon as you make this setting on the first one, provided that they ARE footnotes, and not typed text.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sadly, in Word 2011, the command does not seem to work. &nbsp;If you can get it to work, please tell me!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

    <title>field code in equation editor changing unicode formatting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            field code in equation editor changing unicode formatting</h2>
                    Hi, has anyone tried inserting an equation field (Ctrl + F9) into the equation editor (Alt + =) ?&nbsp; I ask because using the equation field in tandem with the equation editor allows for some serious flexibility in writing equations.&nbsp; However, I noticed some
 unicode characters get changed when I save and exit a document, then reopen it.&nbsp; For example, try placing the italic mathematical unicode '<span>ùëé</span>' character 1D44E inside
 an equation field code (Ctrl + F9) which is inside the equation editor (Alt + =).&nbsp; Save the document, then reopen it.&nbsp; The '<span>ùëé</span>' character will have been replaced by
 the 'a' unicode character 0061 upon reopening the document.&nbsp; Any thoughts on this dilemma?&nbsp; Are they options I can check to fix the problem?&nbsp; Thanks
                </div>

            Hi thanks for the response.&nbsp; I can try to be more clear.<br />
<ul>
<li>Open a new docx document.</li><li>Insert an equation by either shortcut (Alt+=) or on the ribbon Insert -&gt; Equation.
</li><li>Inside this equation insert a field code by pressing (Ctrl+F9).&nbsp; You should see a set of curly braces for the field code.&nbsp; Define this as an equation field code: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/field-codes-eq-equation-field-HP005186148.aspx</li><li>Insert some particular unicode characters in the field code, like for example { eq ùõºùõΩùõæùõøùúî }.&nbsp; You can toggle these characters to their unicode values by highlighting and pressing (Alt+X).&nbsp; In my example the unicode values for the greek letters are ùõº=1D6FC,
 ùõΩ=1D6FD, ùõæ=1D6FE, ùõø=1D6FF and ùúî=1D714.&nbsp; Toggle the field code to its display setting by (Shift+F9).&nbsp;</li><li>Save the document and close it. <br />
</li><li>Reopen the document and examine the greek letters in the equation field code inside the equation editor.&nbsp; Now in my example the greek letters have subtly changed to Œ±=03B1, Œ≤=03B2, Œ≥=03B3, Œ¥=03B4 and œâ=03C9 .</li></ul>
<p>Though the change in characters is subtle, it is still very annoying when trying to keep technical papers clear and consistent.<br />
<br />
I tested the problem today in Microsoft Office 2013 on my school's computers.&nbsp; The problem appeared there as well, so it is not unique to my computer and has not been corrected in Office 2013.<br />
<br />
Thanks to anybody with an explanation.<br />

            <p>I'm trying to reproduce your problem in Word 2007, and am finding that when I save the document, close it, then reopen it, the new symbols are not displayed at all within the equation. If I toggle the field code out of its display setting (by Shift+F9) or
 if I toggle the whole document out of field code display setting (by Alt+F9), then I see the string of Unicode values. But the symbols won't appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to learn about this issue because I am trying to find a way to insert two Unicode characters into my MSWord equations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Up-Pointing Triangle (Unicode 25B2)</p>
<p>Black Up-Pointing Small Triangle (Unicode 25B4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I am unable to do this. Any help would be welcome.</p>

            First, I had the same experience as you if all I entered was { EQ&nbsp;ùõº }<br />
<br />
However, I do not think { EQ } is intended to be used that way, even though at first sight it appears to work. In fact, if you look at the If you look at the description of EQ again, it says { EQ instructions }, not (e.g. { EQ [text][instructions] }. SO it
 is a reasonable assumption that everything inside an EQ should be preceded by one of the \letter instructions.
<div><br />
<div>In this case, if you use { EQ \l(ùõº)} it seems to work rather better, but I would proceed with caution before committing to this approach. e.g. Word 2013 has (or had) a number of problems dealing with nested fields including EQ fields - it is possible
 that they have been fixed or are scheduled to be fixed, but my general experience of Word's field language is that new errors are not fixed unless they are critical (e.g. if it was a problem with { PAGE }, a fix would be far more likely.<br />
<br />
You can do e.g. { EQ \l(<span>ùõº</span><span>ùõΩ</span><span>ùõæ)} to get a string of characters.<br />
<br />
I would be interested to hear how you get on with this one.</span></div>

            &gt;&nbsp;but I would proceed with caution before committing to this approach
<div><br />
<div>And in fact, when I look at the Unicode saved for&nbsp;<span>{ EQ \l(ùõº)}, the encoding is still not right for the character that I actually entered - the alpha is encoded as 0xCEB1 which is the UTF8 for the standard alpha character at
 0x03B1.<br />

            FWIW If I use { EQ \l()} and do 25B2alt-X between the (), the character is not displayed correctly in the field code, but the field result looks OK and appears to survive save/close/re-open. But I would be cautious using EQ and fieldcode/equation editor
 combinations. For one thing, EQ is a "display field" which means that its result is in essence an image rather than a character, which means that it definitely won't play well if you want to put your text up on a web page or some such.&nbsp;

            I also wonder whether having "East Asian Languages" enabled in Word makes a difference to all this, because I see that when I enter the 25B4alt-X outside an equation object, the font used is MS Mincho and the Asian font option. (Word chose SimSun for 25B2).
 Inside the equation object/EQ field, Word insists on using Times New Roman to display the character

            <p>Peter, thanks very much for the tip. Following your lead, I am now able to get a black up-pointing triangle into an MS Word equation. (Word 2013 in compatibility mode) I don't use MS Word to generate text to be put on the web as html, so I can't comment
 on whether the symbol survives that conversion. But I do use MS Word's built-in "save as PDF", and the symbol does survive that conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are my steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to get a Unicode Black Up-Pointing Triangle (Unicode 25B2) into MS Word equation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Create equation: [Alt]+[=]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Create equation field inside equation: put cursor inside equation, type [Ctrl]+[F9]&nbsp; A pair of empty curly brackets { } will appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) There will be spaces in these curly brackets. Delete them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) Inside the equation field type: EQ[space bar]25B2 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(5) Toggle the characters 25B2 into their symbol equivalent by putting the cursor right after the 25B2 and typing [Alt]+[x]. This will appear to be unsuccessful, because a box with a question mark in it will appear where the 25B2 characters had been. So
 it will look like {EQ [?]}.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(6) Toggle the field code into its display setting by putting the cursor somewhere in the {EQ [?]} region and typing [Shift] + [F9]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result will be a Black Up-Pointing Triangle</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>How to get a Unicode Black Up-Pointing Small Triangle (Unicode 25B4) into MS Word equation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow steps (1) through (6) above, but in step (4), type 25B4 instead of 25B2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result will be a Black Up-Pointing Small Triangle IN ITALICS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(7) Highlight the small italics triangle and type [Ctrl] + [i] to toggle out of italics.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result will be a Black Up-Pointing Small Triangle</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your query in this community. </p>
<p><span>Per your description, you can't update the Office 365 after revert it to a previous version. Did you encounter any message when you click on the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Update Now</span><span> button? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reproduce this issue on my side, after I revert my Office 365 to a previous version and try to update. It shows my Office has been updated to the latest version. If this is your scenario, there is a quick way to fix this issue, please follow the
 steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Open the Office Deployment Tool folder, there should be XML files named like Configuration-Office365-X86/64.xml, if these default XML files are not listed, please re-download the ODT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.Run CMD with Administrator privilege, go to the ODT folder and run the following command:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">setup.exe /configure </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Configuration-Office365-X86.xml</span></p>
<p>Please adjust the xml file's name based on your own files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Wait until the Office is completely installed, check the Office version, it should be at the latest version.</p>
<p>If this method doesn't solve your question, please let us know, we will be here for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex Chen</p>

<h3> jayzza  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I delete old messages using a rule or automated process&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have over 55k old email messages in my Outlook.com inbox.&nbsp; I setup a rule to delete all unflagged messages &gt; 60 days yesterday (1/14/15) but it does not seem to work - nothing has changed in my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will a rule like that work on old existing messages?&nbsp; </p>
<p>When does this rule run and how often?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other ways to auto delete the old messages so I don't have to manually delete them - it will take a long time to delete by hand 55k messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<div>I would like to know how to set my own default &nbsp;hyperlinks with my own size, font type and color.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Currently when I insert a hyperlink the font size is set to 5.6 Ariel and underlines the link. I'm fed up of having to edit the link every time I insert one into my spreadsheet or workbook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to have my own setting as a default but don't know were to go to find this option to be able to do this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried looking in FILE, OPTIONS but cannot find the option to set the hyperlink to a default setting of my own. It must be applied accross all excel workbooks, so I'm looking for a general setting to be able to do this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please could someone direct me to how this can be done.&nbsp;</div>

            I am using Excel 2013 and also followed the steps described in the SuperUser.com link. However, I continue to get the washed-out or anemic blue default that came with Office 2013 when I create hyperlinks in new workbooks. I really need to find a way to
 get back to the pure blue which has been the standard for hyperlinks as long as I can remember.

<h2>            Why are misspelled words in Canadian English not corrected by Spell Check&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using Office Home &amp; Student 2007 on Win7. &nbsp;My documents are set to save in .doc format (NOT .docx.). &nbsp;The default language setting for all documents is Canadian English. &nbsp;Yet, when for example I type "color," "favor," "honor," etc. (you get the point),
 the text is NOT marked with red underlining as a misspelling. &nbsp;Also, Spell Check does not select it for correction when used.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have checked Word options, and "Do not check spelling, etc." is NOT checked. &nbsp;It is unchecked. &nbsp;So, Word should be checking the spelling. &nbsp;I have also tried the "Fix It" solution offered by Microsoft for Office 2010 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970826)
 on the off-chance that it might work for me. &nbsp;It did not, of course. &nbsp;Also, the text is NOT formatted to not be checked, i.e. the box "Do not check spelling" in the Language pop-up is not checked. &nbsp;I've also checked Word's Add-In's for disabled items (Office
 Button &gt; Word Options &gt; Add-Ins &gt; Manage: Disabled Items). &nbsp;Nothing is listed as disabled. &nbsp;There are no third-party spell checkers on this computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea what the problem might be?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            I should have specified: I'm an American writing in U.S. English for a source that uses Canadian English. &nbsp;Hence, I write: "color," "favor," "honor," etc. in the text, which should be marked as incorrect according to the standards of Canadian English spelling.
 &nbsp;If I type "honoor," for example, it's marked as wrong and offered for correction in Spell Check.
<div><br />
<div>This never happened before. &nbsp;Whenever I spelled words incorrectly as per Canadian English, these were previously marked as misspellings. &nbsp;Now, they're not . . . and, no one can seem to tell me why. &nbsp;I can only guess that there was some update along the
 way that added the American spellings as legitimate possibilities -- which all of my Canadian friends will tell me emphatically is NOT the case.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, for another example: The same problem happens when I write "center" or "theater" or "counseled" (i.e., no marking at all that it is misspelled as per Canadian English and needs correction.)</div>

            Text formatted as Canadian English will accept either spelling. As Doug has indicated, some English language options will accept either spelling. If you want to enforce a particular spelling standard then you could either apply the English UK language
 (at least while creating the document), which will flag the quoted examples as incorrect, or create an exclude dictionary for the words you consider misspelled.<br />

            Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;I do appreciate it.
<div><br />
<div>I can only repeat that this is a new issue. &nbsp;Previously, in my documents formatted as Canadian English, American spellings, such as "color," were flagged as incorrect in the text and offered for correction to the Canadian English spelling in Spell Check.
<div><br />
<div>If text formatted as Canadian English will accept either "color" or "colour," then -- please -- what is the point
<i>at all</i> of having those language options in the Dictionary and the Spell Check.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The point is: There is something WRONG here. &nbsp;I've lived in Canada for several years. &nbsp;I know that "color" and "center" and "check" are NOT acceptable alternatives to "colour" and "centre" and "cheque"&nbsp;-- anymore than the U.K. English "tyre" is an acceptable
 alternative to Canadian English's "tire."</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am indeed trying to enforce a particular spelling standard: Canadian English. &nbsp;I should not have to do all the things that you are recommending as a work-around. (Although, I appreciate the suggestions.)</div>

            <p>We found that installing Office service pack 1 breaks the non-U.S. English dictionary and adds the U.S. English spellings as acceptable.&nbsp; We've had to uninstall sp1 but even then we've found that there are still some words that it doesn't correct such as

            I am having this problem also and it is driving me crazy.&nbsp; As far as I am concerned the correct spelling in Canada is "honour" "neighbour" etc., and not honor and neighbor.&nbsp; Just because people recognize the word because of our close proximity to the US
 does not mean it is correct here.&nbsp; And, word used to be able to correct this for me.&nbsp; I should be able to use the Canadian dictionary, AS I USED TO, to correctly figure out the difference.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Matthew, my company has offices all over the world, including Canada.&nbsp; One of our employees has had similar complaints as yours.&nbsp; The problem is the arrogance of "well it is spelled both ways in the dictionary, so either way is correct."&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; I have
 done some research and figured out how to create the Canadian dictionary (which contains the list of spellings like colour, favour, etc.) and&nbsp;an&nbsp;exclusion dictionary (which contains the corresponding "misspelled words" like color, favor, etc.) and install
 it (sorry...it just occurred to me that I am using Word 2013, but it didn't seem like it was much different in most of the posts--check
<a href="http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/ExcludeWordFromDic.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/ExcludeWordFromDic.htm</a>, the file extension is different for earlier versions).&nbsp; It really doesn't take very long and now that I've figured it out, it is actually pretty easy.&nbsp;
 I'd be happy to give you the instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create two lists and save them in the UPROOF folder (locate the folder on your system--probably in a Microsoft directory)
</p>
<p>1. Canadian spellings [set the proofing language to English (Canada)]--save as DictionaryCanada.dic</p>
<p>2. American spelling--save as ExcludeDictionaryEN1009.lex</p>
<p>(NOTE: in spite of all documentation saying use only lowercase words, you need to use upper and lowercase forms--I created one list, then copied and pasted and changed case)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you save the files, open word, go to File tab, selection Options, Proofing, then Custom Dictionaries...</p>
<p>Choose Add in the dialog box and select the DictionaryCanada.dic and click Open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you just have to make sure that your proofing language on your document is set to English (Canada) and it will use the appropriate dictionary and exclusion list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps (the reason I'm on here is to find out why they say it is not case sensitive).</p>

<p>2. Haven't tried any third party ones. Been using Windows Defender + Windows Firewall combo.. and they haven't failed for me.</p>
<p>3. Windows Defender takes charge automatically after uninstalling 3rd party antivirus and rebooting.. which you can verify via&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Control Panel\System and Security\Security and Maintenance

<p>1. No. They would conflict with each other and none could do its job efficiently.

            <p>I'm having a very similar problem and have read through the suggestions.&nbsp; As far as I know the only malware program I have in addition to Defender is Malwarebytes, which I have to manually activate because I have the free version which doesn't run in real
 time.&nbsp; It's basically a backup to Defender for scanning occasionally.&nbsp; I've both running on my system since upgrading to Windows 10 with no problem.&nbsp; This seems to have started since the last Windows update on March 8.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm getting the popup from Defender saying my computer is at risk.&nbsp; When I go into Defender to turn it on, it times out and fails to turn on.&nbsp; No amount of time I wait after restarting makes a difference.&nbsp; I've been on the computer for&nbsp;half an hour,
 and it's still off according to Defender.&nbsp; However, when I look at my security panel, it shows everything on.&nbsp; So...this is what I see:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Which screen is correct and what can I do about this?&nbsp; It's becoming very frustrating not knowing if my system is really at risk or not.</p>

<p>The free version of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware does not conflict with WD. So that's for sure not the problem.</p>
<p>Is this happening always?</p>
<p>Did you reboot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you also try - not only read - all the different advices/suggestions in all the prior supplied links? What were the results?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing in all those links works for you, then I don't know what else to suggest besides looking for another AV product or perhaps resetting your Windows 10...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue may be caused by an improper Windows Update installation. For example, a Windows Update installation interrupted by a crash may result to a corrupted system file. A third-party
 program conflict can also be the reason for this error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us narrow down the possibilities why your PC encountered this issue. You can follow the troubleshooting steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Temporarily disable your antivirus program before running the Windows Update.
</span></li><li><span>Visit the article on </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">how to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong></a><span>.
 This helps eliminate software conflict that occurs when you install a program or an update. You may also determine what conflict is causing the issue by performing this method.</span></li><li><span>Fix Windows Update errors. Since you are using Windows 10, you can do this by running the Windows Update Troubleshooter. To download the Windows Update Troubleshooter, click on this

</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: After doing the steps above, you can enable your antivirus program again.</span></p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Im in Bali for a holiday and used wifi, you then suspended my account and sent a code to my back up account which you then suspended also. I submitted the recovery forms with both passwords but couldnt remember who i emailed or what i emailed as thats
 in the locked accounts. So those forms have come back saying not enough info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the talk to someone option but it requires i log in. So i logged into an unlinked third account which you also suspended but I was able to unlock by text message code. Your talk to someone libk just sends me into my inbox woth no one to contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i need this main account back as everything is linked back in to it. Its the main account ive had for ever. I did the right thing by having a recovery email address but you suspended that as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please unlock my accounts</p>

            Hello NathanTrenberth,
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that you are having difficulty accessing your Outlook.com account. I know frustrating this can be, rest assured, I will try my best to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />I find that this article may be relevant to you: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/17875/...</a>
<br />
<br />Based on your description, I can understand that:
<br />
<br />1. You have tried to reset your password but it was futile;
<br />2. You have tried submitting the recovery form (ACSR) but you could not pass the verification;
<br />3. You have contacted Microsoft Support by telephone but it was helpless;
<br />4. Your temporary email address (recovery) is suspended as well.
<br />
<br />Whelps! You must have spent a lot of time sorting this out. Have you tried appealing to Microsoft Support by email with this link?
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I am just a Microsoft user like yourself. Most of us here do not have access to user account information. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft Community brings together consumers and expert users in product-focused online communities, so they can post questions, share answers, and solve technical problems. However, inquiries that involve privacy, user data or otherwise billing &amp; payments issue has to be reached with Microsoft Support directly. 
<br />
<br />Appeal to Microsoft Support by email: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12401</a> (it may take up to 30 days or more)
<br />
<br />While I know that you have already contacted Microsoft Support by other means, but most likely they were not from the correct department. The above link leads you to the correct Microsoft Support department that can possibly help you with this issue. I am doubtful if there is any other shortcuts other than the email support link above that will take up to 30 days or more.
<br />
<br />I am sorry that I cannot help you to resolve the issue, but I hope I have pointed you the right direction.
<br />
<br />Sincerely,
<br />Sutharsan

                    <p>We are having issues with several of our new accounts (9 actually) not being able to access OneDrive and OneNote applications.<br />
We logged in with one of the accounts online and clicked the "OneDrive" icon. The user's personal site attempts to load but then it diverts to the "Delve" application on the screen. The users are not able to log in as the account seems to be not there.<br />
</p>
When clicking on the "OneNote" icon, the following error comes up:<br />
Sorry, we can't get your notebooks right now. Please try again later.<br />
Reference number: 7546979d-fd6a-4163-b605-fa72e543126c<br />
<br />
We log into our Office365 Admin account and pull up the user's account and the following error shows under "OneDrive Settings":<br />
OneDrive is not provisioned for this user<br />
<br />
It seems access to the other applications work fine with no errors showing.

<h2>            how do I set crew sizes in MS Project 2010&#63;</h2>
                    Different tasks have different HR requirements, whether it be the installation of a Door frame or the installation of the wall framing. It may require one person or twenty. Can &nbsp;I set this in the Resource Sheet? Or should I make a resource for each crew
 member or group of crew members. I want to get rid of the over allocating&nbsp;

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>In Project you can either create individual resources (i.e. Joe, Fred, Tom, etc.) or groups (i.e. carpenters, bricklayers, electricians, etc.). For the former you could also declare a generic resource so instead of Joe, Fred and Tom, you might designate
 each as carpenter, bricklayer and electrician, meaning that the carpenter might be Joe or it could be Ben or any other carpenter in the crew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For individual resources the Max Units indicates the availability of the individual. So if Joe is a full-time carpenter, his max units would be 1 (100%). If he only works half-time, his max units would be 0.5 (50%). If Joe is assigned to work more than his
 max unit level (i.e. two full time tasks simultaneously), then Project will flag that as an overallocation. However the threshold for overallocaiton can be set from anywhere from minute by minute to month by month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say you set the overallocation basis to week by week and your calendar is a normal 40 hour week. Then you assign Joe to work two tasks on Monday such that he puts in 10 hours instead of the normal 8. Same thing Tuesday and Wednesday, such that by Wednesday
 quitting time, he has 30 of his 40 hours. On Thursday and Friday, Joe is assigned 5 hours each day. Even though Joe worked overtime on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, he will not be overallocated because he is not assigned to work more than the max of 40 hours
 in the week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a group resource, you might set up a crew of carpenters, bricklayers and electricians, each a 5 man crew. Since there are 5 individuals in each, the max units for each group is 5 (500%). You can have all 5 working on simultaneous tasks without overallocation,
 assuming the overallocation basis is set to day by day for the group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>Not recommended: a resource called "carpenters" with max units = 2000% to represent 20 carpenters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recommended: make one resource per person.</p>

<p>Sure, it seems like more work. But if you want/need the results and the control you are after, then you have to do the necessary work.</p>

            <p>Thanks John&nbsp;</p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>Project is recognizing the percentage &nbsp;as either a person or a group. Each individually being 100% of allocated time.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I would like to track the project that closely; but I am not usually afforded the time to spend writing the schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just had a board Director on the last Mid - Rise tell me that all I need is about 60 entries &nbsp;total for a schedule, vs the over a thousand that I had. I discounted him as someone who probably married into the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, that being said I am in the process developing a template, where it may be possible to work the two in together somehow. I try to find a way to measure everything, and keep a log on everything; Project has been a very good tool for me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are doing construction projects and I am very familiar with them, allow me to say something about the necessary level of detail that is typically required for the tasks and the resources if you are to achieve the degree of control that is needed.</p>
<p>Say you have $1M worth of construction. You do an update of progress every week, say on Thursday afternoon. You want to break it down into tasks that have a duration of no more than 5 days, and the resources will be, say. two people plus a sack of materials.
 Typically, a task will be about 50/50 labour/materials, so each task will have a cost of, say $2000. You need $1M worth of tasks, so that's 500 of them, minimum. If you take into account, and you should, that each task will have an order for materials plus
 a wait time plus a delivery, that's another 1500 tasks or "events" that have to be scheduled and tracked, so 2000 total so far. Add to that the summaries and sub-summaries that go into building the WBS, plus other events etc, then 3000 lines would be about
 right.</p>
<p>Any fewer than enough and you may as well not bother to start.</p>
<p>It is better to overdo it than under do it.</p>
<p>And the work type resources should be a list of individual people, not teams.</p>
<p>Every time you aggregate either tasks or resources you are moving away from the original objective which was to break it down into component parts.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>The number of tasks depends on how large the project and what level of detail you need to track/report. Unless you have very small projects, and with a potential crew of 20 (per your initial post), the director who told you 60 tasks was adequate was obviously
 only referring to a set of reporting tasks, not the full working plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not agree with Trevor with respect to identifying each individual resource. For a large project, that will give you no end of tracking minutia that you really don't need. For example, let's say you have a concrete finishing crew of 10 guys and you need
 4 to do the finishing on a house slab. Do you really care if its Joe, Bob, Tim, and Wally or do you simply care that you have 4 of the 10 available guys?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a plan is always a balance between to little detail and too much. To find that balance, you must determine what information you need in the way of reporting metrics and then set up your plan to provide those.</p>
<p>

            <p>John, we hardly ever disagree, and I take your point about the progress updating presenting the extra difficulty of needing to know, ie have records kept, which guy did which hours on which tasks.</p>
<p>On a tight run project, those necessary records should be kept, but that problem doesn't surface until the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I was looking at his original question about getting rid of the over-allocation.</p>
<p>Unless you can assign joe and bob to this task, and tim and wally to that task, and joe, bob and tim to another task, etc, you can't plan the project for minimum duration, or allow leveling to find a solution "within the available slack". If a decision about
 who should do what isn't made at planning stage, then it has to be made on the job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is just a few carpenters on a few tasks, and the project is building a house, and it doesn't matter if the finish date ends up a bit lter than it could have been, then making those decisions on the job, and allowing the carpenters to make them, may
 not matter much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you have 50 boilermakers to do 300 tasks in two 10 hour shifts per day, during a 45 day, $7M, ship refit, and the ship is definitely coming out of the dry dock at 12:00 on the last day, the individual assignments have to be done in advance. And you
 don't want to be assigning bob to do task A, B, C and find out later that he ignored the plan and decided to do D, E, and F instead. The ship would leave the dry dock and 30 or so tasks would not have been done, even though with good scheduling, and working
 to the plan, meant they could have been done.</p>
<p>This why some shipyards go broke and others do not. Building companies too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you so rightly say, it's always a balance. Too much aggregation diminishes the opportunity or the possibility of more control. Extra control means more work in planning and record keeping and updating, and that has a cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, you are very hard to beat to first answer.</p>

<h2>            Nokia C6-00 turning off on its own</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently bought a new Nokia C6-00 phone (approximately 1 month ago) and ever since it keeps turning off by its own in various situations - no matter if the phone just lies on the table. The battery is full, the phone is not connected to any device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of minutes ago, I looked at some pictures, I locked the keyboard and put the phone on the table. A minute later, it was switched off, without any warning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most annoying thing is that if I want to switch it &nbsp;on again, I have to take out the battery, wait a couple of seconds, then try turning it on again. Otherwise it won't work!</p>
<p>I installed the latest software, hoping that this would solve the problem - unfortunately it didn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think? Is this a problem with my phone, or coult it be, that there are some other mobile phones who react the same way? For eg. I have a friend who owns a Nokia 5230 and has the same problem, only not so frequent. By the way - my phone turns
 off at least 2 times a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? Should I directly go to the nearest Nokia service?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, I think you should go directly to a Nokia care point yes. From what you tell, it really sounds like there is a hardware issue with the phone.<br />
<br />
Sometimes there could be other reasons for this, faulty Simcard, faulty memory card or it can be some bad 3rd party app running in the background.<br />
<br />
If you have installed a memory card, you could try a bit without it to see if that may be the cause, but as it is brand new, and if you haven done anything special to it, I would take it to a Nokia care point to get it checked.

<p>Thank you for your replies. I have an 8 GB memory card in my phone, but it's older, I also used it on an LG phone, so I don't think that this is the problem. But let's exclude everything possible :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with the Nokia Care centers is that...there aren't any!! I live in Germany in a big city and not even in bigger cities Nokia hasn't got any care centers. I looked on the nokia website and on Google, too. So this thing with the care center is
 a big, fat lie. Thanks, Nokia. I expected a little bit more when paying some hundred Euros on this mobile phone...</p>

<p>@phonehacker: well, replacing a sim is not that easy - first of all, I do not have another sim card and second, if I would just take it out to see how the phone reacts, I would have to wait for hours or days, because this odd behaviour of my nokia is very
 unpredictible. the phone sometimes works fine for 2 days, but sometimes it turnes off every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Of course, but before I installed any application, so when the phone was brand new, it did the same. This is why I wouldn't say it happens due to a third-party app. But everything is possible.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually you are NOT the only one. i've bought my Nokia&nbsp;C6-00 from kuwait like 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>The device shuts down automatically when i leave it idle.This has happened like the fourth time, except that i can switch it on directly without the need to replug the battery in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure. i will try some of the suggestions above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you succeeded in solving this issue?</p>

    <title>What are the keyboard shortcuts for superscripts and subscripts in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisjrussell  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are the keyboard shortcuts for superscripts and subscripts in excel&#63;</h2>
                    I was looking up the shortcuts for superscripts and subscripts the other night and found out that control shift + will make something become a superscript, but only if you are highlighting something in a graph. I could not get the subscript key combination
 to work though. Is there a key combination that will make something superscripted or subscripted in all situations, such as when something is in a data box in excel?

<p>Hello Rebecca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the app was closed while the slides were saved on the clipboard, check your temporary files to see if you can still recover them:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> and <strong>R</strong> to open the <strong>
Run</strong> dialogue.</li><li>Type <strong>%TEMP% </strong>on the text box.</li><li>Click <strong>Ok</strong>.</li><li>A window will open with temporary (TMP) files.</li><li>Look for the TMP file that has the same time and date when you last closed the app while your slides where on the clipboard.</li><li>Change the file extension from .TMP to .PPT and open the file to see if you can access the slides back.</li></ol>

<h2>            Cannot receive calls from Girlfriend but can call her just fine</h2>
                    Hi, Me and my girlfriend have been using Skype for a couple months now however she cannot make a Skype to Skype call to me without the call immediately dropping. When she tries calling me on mobile it says it is forwarding her call and to please wait then
 it immediately drops. then when she calls me on her laptop and chooses the Skype to Skype option it tells her she needs Skype credit to make calls to mobile numbers and landlines even though it is a Skype to Skype call. Her phone is an LG Stylo 2 Plus and
 the computer is an HP Zbook 17 with Windows 10 Pro. Both are up to date on their respective software versions as well as the Skype version. we have tried multiple solutions including calling from a different network, calling on a mobile data plan and calling
 while connected to her 5g home network. nothing is working.

<p>Yes, you are happy with build 17677 and all of us are aware of that already.</p>
<p>Why do you keep posting that message to all threads?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After build 17677 has been many builds and your PC has failed to update with everyone of those and it will be doing that for ever if you don't do anything to it and that anything is clean install of 17134, turn that to get previews and update to latest preview

            &nbsp;Have you checked your drivers in Device Manager?&nbsp; Maybe you need to get an updated one from Toshiba.&nbsp; Also I see that this laptop has an AMD A8 1.9 GHz CPU.&nbsp; Have you checked to be sure that's not one of the CPUs Microsoft has dropped support for with
 RS5?

<p>
I'm having the same issue with zoom. &nbsp;Mine is RingCentral which is based on Zoom software. &nbsp;But it happens when I am recording the session. &nbsp;It doesn't crash unless I'm recording my shared session. &nbsp;Any solutions yet?</p>
