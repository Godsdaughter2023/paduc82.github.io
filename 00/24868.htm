    <title>Navigation Pane - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hnim2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Navigation Pane</h2>
                    Initially I moved the vertical divide between the navigation pane and the content of a form, to the left just that only the icons will show. Now I want to widen the pane so that not only the icon but the name of the object also will be visible. The icons
 are visible but there is no vertical divide that I could move to widen the pane! The following measures did not help as well:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. I compacted and repaired the DB<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. I switched off&nbsp; the navigation pane visible option, Closed the data base and reopened and switched on again<br />
<br />
Please help<br />

            <p>Try a simple click on the bar of the pane. Also try hitting f11 (see if either of those work). You might also want to hold down the shift key during startup to prevent any forms loading, since a "model" form will prevent the nav pane from being displayed
 (so, make sure no forms or startup code runs here).</p>
<p>So, if a form is "open" as model, then the nav pane will remain hidden and you not be able to click on it, or expand the nav pane until the form is closed.</p>

    <title>Spam&#47;junk mail not being blocked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robbmitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spam&#47;junk mail not being blocked</h2>
                    <p>For about a month or two I have been receiving junk/spam in my Outlook email account that is not being caught by the junk filter. The sending addresses all have symbols as part of address. Here is an example: &nbsp;ADTAuthorizedDealer &lt;"&lt;!!&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;!!&gt;"&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Outlook 2016 as my desktop email app and cannot figure out how to create a rule using the symbols as they are what is the common denominator in all the junk mails. I have two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Why isn't Outlook email catching these emails with this format</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How do I create a rule in Outlook 2016 to handle these emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Arabic support in IE 10 - Win 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Arabic support in IE 10 - Win 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello Guys, have a very weird problem with IE 10 (Win 8 system), that when&nbsp;I change language to Arabic for example I can use it in the IE address bar and it appears right, but when I try to write Arabic in any web page (google, facebook, yahoo,..etc.) it
 writes in English but with the wrong keys (I press G for example so it puts D) I tried changing language many times with no use, noting that when I copy Arabic and paste it in any web page it works just fine, and by the way I can use Arabic normally every
 where other than IE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that I can&nbsp; get a solution for this :(, thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Dear Joe, I have the same numbers as you. <br />
I didn't see any uefi "flash" screen upon firmware update...though. </p>
<p>my dubt remain if the uefi firmware has been actually&nbsp;updated...because I received the update twice till now even if the installation log&nbsp;states completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the microsoft support could answer directly (and clearly)&nbsp;to the&nbsp;question (better than link to other articles).</p>

    <title>Huge fonts, other Outlook 2013 e-mail problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard central jersey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Huge fonts, other Outlook 2013 e-mail problems</h2>
                    <p>I set up my new Dell Inspiron 3847 (PC desktop) on April 5. My Outlook 2013 e-mails look fine when I send them, and in my sent box. But sometimes the recipient sees part or all of my message 10 times normal size (for example, 100pt Arial, not 100pt). Sometimes
 it looks OK to the recipient, but in the Reply to me, my original message has something huge. Sometimes the problem doesn't show up at all until there's another round of replies--and always in an earlier message, not the latest reply. Sometimes it's only&nbsp;a
 line space below the greeting; sometimes it's one word (my hand-typed, not formatted, signature, or "From:" in the From/To/Subject lines); sometimes it's one paragraph (the 4th, in my message below a friend's reply, today; other times, it could be the 7th);
 sometimes it's an entire message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in an MS VIP website that it could be the e-mail antivirus scan in my security software, because an MS update sometime ago (which caused a change in&nbsp;mso.dll) causes some companies' e-mail scans to drop the decimal point, so that 9.0pt reads as 90pt.
 That website said it affects the sender's e-mails (true in my case), so recipients can't change this, but the sender can disable that add-on--not the whole security software, just the e-mail scanning part, which she said isn't essential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm having additional problems--again, very inconsistently, with no apparent pattern: 1. At least one recipient reported that my 12pt Times New Roman arrived at his in box as 14.5pt TNR--not the same, but not 10 times the size. 2. I send my e-mails single
 space, with one space between paragraphs; sometimes they come back, below the Reply, with extra spacing. I checked, and it seems that the paragraph formatting changes so that there's extra spacing added Below each paragraph. But the original message might
 otherwise look normal--no huge type--at least until a second exchange of replies. 3. At least a couple of times, when I highlighted the bigger spacing between paragraphs noted in no. 2 here, I saw that in a 10pt Arial 3-paragraph message, the 2nd line space
 was still 10pt Arial--but the 1st, below the 1st paragraph, was suddenly 12pt TNR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be other problems, but these are what I noticed. My security software company is Total Defense (through my cable company), and a technician there insisted it's a settings problem that only Microsoft can fix. A Dell technician last Wednesday remotely
 reinstalled my Outlook software from the MS website (using my product key) and promised that would solve the problem--but, of course, it didn't. Another Dell technician on Thursday remotely changed various settings in my Outlook (and maybe elsewhere), including
 disabling my security software anti-spam filter (but is that the same as the antivirus e-mail scan?), and promised it would fix the problem. Um, no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Google search turned up many similar complaints, though mostly that's&nbsp;a zoom problem (not mine, it seems--my messages always go out looking fine to me; it's the recipient who sees a problem--sometimes--or I see one in my message only below the reply, or
 the 2nd reply, or the 4th. (Or the error can be in the reply instead--like a huge "From:" in the first reply to my e-mail. But never in anyone's new message to me.) But I haven't found any suggested solutions yet, except for the MS VIP's one about disabling
 the security software e-mail scan. And she mentioned that only in connection to the 10-times-size problem, because the decimal point gets misread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing: I needed to replace my much-missed Windows XP and Office 2003 before MS stopped supporting them, so I had to take what was immediately available (including Windows 8.1, not 7). Dell insisted that I had to have McAfee in the PC for a 30-day
 trial. I immediately uninstalled it and installed Total Defense (and no, I didn't go on the Internet or set up my e-mail accounts again until it was installed). McAfee is gone from Control Panel. But I've been told that these companies put stuff all over a
 computer, so maybe part of it is still there somewhere, causing a conflict with my TD security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a techie. All I know is that I've been told--and assured--a lot of different things, and nothing has solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone out there have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if it's a problem caused by the MS update (apparently KB2289158), any idea why MS hasn't issued a patch yet? Is this just MS's arrogance unless huge numbers of customers are affected by one of its beta testings sold widely as new software?</p>
<p>

            <p>Me again with a quick follow-up: on line 3 of my message, I meant to write that my e-mail sometimes shows up below a reply as, for example, 100-point Arial, not 10-point Arial. (I did write elsewhere&nbsp;that it comes back 10 times the original size, but I wanted
 to fix this typo.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and sometimes it's huge but not exactly 10 times: 133 point type, for example, or 147 point type. And I've seen this whether my original message was the factory-set 11-point Calibri or my preferences, 10pt Arial or 12pt TNR. So it's not just a corrupted
 or defective Calibri or Arial font. But maybe something's defective, not just a settings problem--although then the reinstallation from the MS website should have solved the problem, right?</p>

            <p>Does your antivirus scan email? Disable it. What antivirus does the recipient use? The 10x problem could be triggered on their computer, not yours.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The extra paragraph &nbsp;space is common with HTML email sent to accounts read in web browsers (eg, gmail). This is the result of how Outlook does paragraphs and how they are rendered on the web. More info:

<p>
</p><p>Font changing to TNR: Is the recipient receiving the email as HTML &nbsp;or plain text?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to make you feel bad for getting a new computer, but "I needed to replace my much-missed Windows XP and Office 2003 before MS stopped supporting them" this really wasn't necessary - for most people here, MS hasn't offered real, free support for a long
 time. MS won't be releasing security updates and&nbsp;your hardware is probably getting long in the tooth, but the software won't&nbsp;quit working just because MS stopped "supporting" it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get used to Windows 8.1, its really nice - there will be a learning curve since your coming from Windows XP but once you get the hang of it, its nice.&nbsp; My 'aha moment' was when I realized that Windows key was my friend - windows key and start typing
 to search for anything.&nbsp; Pinning most used programs to the taskbar is nice too.&nbsp; Even the apps (mostly) aren't bad - I like the IE app as i can open two pages in split screen mode.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for writing--I was actually going to write to you directly, as an Outlook MVP, since I saw your slipstick article about virus scans in security software missing the decimal point ever since the MS update KB2289158. An MS techie I spoke with on the
 phone last night claimed that your article, and another one I found online (at MSOutlook.info, from your fellow MVP), were only about Outlook 2010. Of course, he also admitted he never heard of this problem before, so I'm skeptical, to say the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Total Defense (security software, through Cablevision) tech support told me last week not to change any settings, and I'm sure that when I call again, they'll tell me that if I uncheck Email Scan, my PC will be at risk--but if you and Dell tell me to
 do it, I will. Last week an MS technician said he disabled my security software anti-spam filter, when he changed a bunch of settings in my computer (without that fixing the problem). After reading another article at MSOutlook.info on problems with security
 software virus scanner integrated with Outlook, I also disabled OneNote Notes about Outlook and Outlook Social Connector--actually, they're now listed as Inactive Add-ins, along with MS VBA for Outlook. The only Active Add-in is MS Exchange, since I didn't
 know if I might need that (though I don't think so). Nothing is listed under Disabled Application Add-ins, incidentally, and when I clicked on Add-in options, the window said there are no Add-in property pages to display. And when I open Outlook each time
 now, no Add-ins are listed; previously, it said it was opening 5 of 7 add-ins (unspecified).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll read your slipstick link on extra spacing (it's actually spacing added to the "Below" window for paragraphs--I can tell when I click on Reply and then highlight lines--not extra spacing between lines, but that may not matter), and I can also try sending
 e-mails in plain text; most of the time, that's all I need. But I've found my problem in e-mail exchanges with at least 18 different people--individuals and at companies--using all sorts of e-mail systems, and using PCs, Macs, smart phones, even an iPad to
 read and reply to my e-mails. At least one friend uses the same e-mail server I do, Cablevision (optonline.net in her case, optimum.net in mine). They can't all be changing my e-mails at their end, in the same ways, can they? My assumption is that it's a problem
 originating at my end, some incompatibility, settings problem, defect in my Outlook (though a Dell techie reinstalled it from the MS website last week--using my product key), or infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS techie yesterday said that since my product key ends in OEM, only Dell, which installed it into the PC, can help me. He did recommend that I do a free-trial download of malwarebytes (from malwarebytes.org) and run a scan in case there's an infection
 that somehow doesn't seem to have infected any of the 18 others, since no one has told me of trouble with any e-mails to or from others, and wasn't blocked by the security software of any of them. So I have a feeling that my problem is in the settings, or
 some other defect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you recommend that I try malwarebytes--or definitely not? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If necessary, I'll demand that Dell send tech support to my home, which I paid for--or send me a new computer (though I hate setting one up again, changing some settings like Windows 8.1 startup so it looks more like my old desktop, and transferring my two
 months of files and e-mails to a new PC--unless that would screw up a new one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just now I can't keep using Outlook the way it's operating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you very much for contacting me, and I deeply appreciate any further comments you may have (especially whether I should try malwarebytes--or another program online that might provide a more sophisticated scan than I have with Total Defense).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard</p>

            <p>Honestly, I don't think malware is your problem. Unfortunately, some people make the assumption that everything that is wrong is due to malware. If you want to try it, you can - it may offer some peace of mind to you.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with the Antivirus and fonts is/was more prevalent in Outlook 2010 but can occur in any version.&nbsp; While its important to run antivirus software, you don't need&nbsp;to scan email - attachments will be&nbsp;scanned if you open them. Disabling email scanners
 will also prevent problems where Outlook seems to take forever to receive mail or times out when sending mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure the spacing is due to the HTML coding - you can use one of the methods listed on the page to avoid it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, because your product is from the OEM, they are supposed to provide support for it.

            <p>I was going to reply a couple of hours ago to thank you and report that my huge-font problem seems to be solved, though I'm still getting paragraph spacing and sometimes a changed typeface (TNR, not Arial)&nbsp;in e-mail exchanges with two friends on gmail (as
 you mentioned above) and a third friend using a university e-mail server (which might also be on the web), so I wasn't overly concerned about that. Yesterday a Dell "senior tech" spent an hour and a half eliminating all the hidden vestiges of the Dell-installed
 McAfee, which I thought I'd uninstalled; disabling my Total Defense e-mail scan, as you recommended and she agreed (despite a warning, of course, from TD that I'm now not completely protected); made various settings changes; and ran a malwarebytes scan, which
 turned up no infections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past hour and a half, however, I received a second reply from that friend at the university--and this time, in her first reply, the From, To, and Subject lines (except "From:") were 10 times the normal (and previous) size: 110pt Calibri, not 11pt.
 And then I received a business e-mail from a publishing client, and in my reply to him, the line space below my salutation appeared to him as 133pt Arial, not 10pt--but in his reply to me, telling me that, the line space is 100pt Arial, exactly 10 times normal.
 (His e-mails are in 10.5pt Calibri, and we both used HTML, as I did with the university friend.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So nothing has been fixed after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have to contact Dell again, and probably insist on either home support or a replacement computer. It was suggested to me that I might need the whole OS reinstalled, but&nbsp;if it comes to that, it might be better just to demand a new PC, if possible.&nbsp;And
 maybe Windows 7, if 8 and/or 8.1 are so lousy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Dell PCs with Windows 95 and XP for 18 years with no major problems. But I don't want to keep using the old XP, even if it mostly works OK. I don't want to risk any problems in future&nbsp;because there are no more MS security updates, and my IE 8 browser
 could no longer access some legitimate websites (like my cable company's, and the movie channels Starz and Encore), but I don't want to switch to Firefox, Mozilla, or Chrome, or switch back and forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate all your help, but this is infuriating.</p>

            <p>One last observation, if anyone sees this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've taken to clicking on Reply, then Pop Up, to check fonts in earlier messages (since sometimes my 10pt Arial is changing to 12pt Times New Roman when my message is below the recipient's reply). I suddenly noticed that although an extra line space was
 in 100pt Arial, the hard return next to it was in 12pt Times New Roman (though originally sent as 10pt Arial). To double-check, I clicked on Show Invisibles--and suddenly the huge line space in my e-mail reply to someone else's message (but showing up only
 to him that way, and then below his reply to me) had a symbol that I've seen before but can't remember what it is: it looks like a superscript circle or letter O. Then I noticed that in both "corrupted" e-mails described in my previous note, above, every hard
 return with extra paragraph spacing had this symbol to the left of the return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen&nbsp;this symbol&nbsp;inserted into some Word documents by some people (deliberately or not, I don't know) instead of a word space, though it keeps the two adjacent words connected on the same line. I just can't remember if this is a symbol that anyone can
 insert for particular reasons (inserted when kerning, to squeeze two words, or all the words on a line, closer together?), or comes from people with Macs, or from computers set to a language other than U.S. English, or something else entirely. But the fact
 that it suddenly appears when messages have extra spacing in those places--both when&nbsp;it's double spacing (or, say, 12 points of leading added below each paragraph) and when it's gigantic type--might mean something important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a (desperate) thought!</p>

            <p>I think you're right about the nonbreaking spaces. No idea why they suddenly appear, though, at least in some e-mails when spacing suddenly increases. (I sent one example to the sender, with Show Invisibles, but he said he didn't see them.) Or if their sudden
 appearance somehow triggers at least the extra spacing, if not also the huge fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't rule out some trigger at the other end--except that (a) I've counted at least 19 (or 20) different people affected by this problem, some of them individuals and some at several companies or universities; (b) at least two have gmail accounts and one
 has a university account, but there's a wide variety of other accounts--and one person uses the same server I do, though her e-mail domain is optonline and mine is optimum; and&nbsp;(c) some people have seen the problem in the first (new) e-mail I sent to them,
 while in other cases it shows up in the first e-mail or first reply or after at least one more reply above that, sometimes a few.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With I believe one exception, I've sent e-mails to all these people, and received e-mails from them, using my previous computer (Windows XP, Outlook 2003), without any problems whatsoever. And every one of these people whom I've asked have told me that they've
 never noticed or been told about any identical or even similar problem (or any other e-mail problems) communicating back and forth with anyone else. Also, some use PCs, some Macs, but it's also shown up when recipients of my e-mails used smartphones or an
 iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of which proves that the incompatibility definitely isn't at their end--but the problem began only when I set up my new PC with Windows 8.1 and Outlook 2013, and seems to exist only with e-mails&nbsp;to or from&nbsp;me. That certainly&nbsp;suggests to me that the
 bug/defect/whatever originated in my software, and it's my software that has a compatibility problem, or some other problem, with everyone else's computer--which also indicates that my computer is the one in need of fixing, not that at least 19 or 20 other
 people have to correct these problems or whatever triggers them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate the time you've taken to respond to me more than once (even if I wish you or someone else could easily come up with the solution!)--especially considering the large number of other Outlook 2013 problems I can see just from what's posted
 on these community boards. Maybe it's like this for all software, but it sure looks like another case of MS issuing a product commercially that needed more beta testing among its employees and you MVPs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure you don't want to spend a lot (if any) more time on this issue when so many others are out there--aside from everything else you do--but if you want, I could e-mail you (at your posted e-mail address)&nbsp;excerpts of a couple of these e-mail exchanges
 so you can see for yourself the spacing, font, and now unbroken-spacing issues. But I'll understand if you prefer to pass on this. Either way, I do thank you for all the attention you've shown on this--and I hope that you, the Dell "LT3 specialists," or someone
 else can figure this out; I'd rather not simply stop using HTML for all future e-mails with this computer, even if that's the only time there's a problem.</p>

            There are different variants of the "real media" format, and you may have gotten some that aren't compatible with the phone's player. Try converting them to some other format (MPEG4 etc) on PC and then transfer them to the phone.

<h2>            High battery consumption with PowerPoint on MacBook Pro continuously using High performance GPU</h2>
                    <p>On my MacBook Pro with Nvidia Graphics, PowerPoint commands to have the Nvidia Graphics ("High Performance Graphics") continuously available. The higher power consumption associated with this shortens battery life by 50%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint 2011 had the same issue, but there was a workaround&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macoutlook/office-for-mac-mavericks-high-performance-gpu/e1a6aff0-e36e-40ae-ab62-aa7e3e0c6b10?page=2</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the preview, the workaround does not work, as PowerPoint would crash immediately after startup with the workaround applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the fact that going from 8h to 4h battery life greatly impacts the mobile experience, although PowerPoint works well on systems with integrated graphics, I would consider this as bug. Could we please get this fixed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

            If you need to remove first 7 character spaces only, use TRIM. Hence formula structure would be
<br />
<br />=TRIM(A2)
<br />
<br />Trim also reduces in between spaces to one and all spaces after the string also..hence, if you have ab   cd, it will become ab cd. if this is a problem Read ON....
<br />
<br />If you want to remove first 7 characters irrespective whether they are space or not
<br />
<br />=RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-7)
<br />
<br />A more robust construction would be which will take care of the fact that if the cell has less than 7 characters
<br />
<br />=IFERROR(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-7),"")

<p>This is unbelievable!!! Same here I only have emails from dec 2005 and forward but my old from 1999-2005 are gone. What's the matter with you MS? A simple warning mail would have done it, so we all could get a backup, this is outrageous! And you haven't
 even thought about archiving and compressing them first if space is the issue, you just wake up in the morning with a &lt;removed&gt; new design and decide to delete peoples stuff &lt;removed&gt;&nbsp; &lt;removed&gt;</p>

<h2>            Exclusion of specific words in wildcard search</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I am in advance apologizing for my ignorance and for possibly missing the point.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I am using following wildcard function in Find and Replace (Word 2010) in order to find all 2 letter abbreviations in my document : &lt;[A-Z]{2}&gt;.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After execution of the function, I select all the abbreviations and I format them (bold and underline) in a same manner. However I would like to exclude some specific abbreviations
 (3 or 4 of them) from the search as they occur in the document but I don't want to apply the common format to them. Can the wildcard function be used in this way? Many thanks in advance.</span></span></p>

            Depending on what those abbreviations are, it might be possible to craft a single wildcard Find expression that excludes them. That approach would be far faster than looping through all matches; also likely to be faster would be a series of&nbsp;<span>wildcard
 Find expressions to first apply the desired formatting then remove it from the 3 or 4 you specify.</span>

<p><span><span>First of all, thank you all for your swift reactions and help.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Second, as I am not familiar (and comfortable) with macros, I would like to follow Paul's proposal.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So, after I find all the abbreviations and apply the formatting, I would like to find the 3 or 4 abbreviations in question and apply the different formatting to them. So, I would
 like to find these specific abbreviations with a single use of the find function. Initial search on internet suggests that this is not possible and that I have to do it abbreviations by abbreviations, but I would like to double check with you guys. If this
 is not possible, I will use the macro. Many thanks, cheers.</span></span></p>

<p>You need to at least tell us what those 3 or 4 exceptions are...</p>

<p><span><span>I am sorry, I didn't want to burden the exchange with details, but here it is. So, I am reporting on the discussions between European Union Member States and use standard two letter
 ISO code abbreviations for countries (BG for Bulgaria, AT for Austria, FR for France, DE for Germany and so on;
</span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Country_codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Country_codes</span></a><span>).
 These abbreviations should be formatted bold and underline. I therefore, after finishing the report, “capture” all two letter abbreviations and format them bold underline. However, I also use 3 or 4 two letter abbreviations which should not be underlined and
 bold (CA-competent authority, EP-European Parliament, EC-European Commission and MS-Member State). I was therefore looking for a way to either : 1) exclude these abbreviations (CA, EP, EC and MS) from initial Find function &nbsp;or 2) to “capture” them after I
 apply the bold underline format with the aim to undo the formatting. If there is no way to use the "simple" Find and Replace function, I will use the suggested macro.&nbsp; I am not sure if the detailed explanation helps, but many thanks in any case for your effort.&nbsp;
 Best, Goran</span></span></p>

    <title>Excel format for MAC addresses. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gschneyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel format for MAC addresses.</h2>
                    <p>I work in IT, often I have to keep track of MAC addresses. I'm trying to use Office 365 Excel where I want to format the cells as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A1-B2-C3-D4-E5-F6</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ideally when I enter the information as a1b2c3d4e5f6 it would capitalize and add the dashes. If I do ##-##-##-##-##-## and I add only numbers (like 112233445566) it will format with the dashes (11-22-33-44-55-66). However when using text it doesn't make
 the format. Any suggestions? </p>

    <title>Poor Photos app in Windows 10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Poor Photos app in Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please release an earliest update for Photos app in Windows 10 Mobile to resolve issues like photos not zooming properly when using gestures to zoom in a photo (pinch to zoom). Many times the photos didn't zoom, they just freeze. Its very annoying. I hope
 many other people would also be facing the same issue. I request Microsoft to release an early update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: I am using Microsoft Lumia 550 Windows 10 Mobile Build 14393.67.</p>

    <title>Suspicious keyboard update for Win10 build 1511 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> castlebravo54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suspicious keyboard update for Win10 build 1511</h2>
                    <p>An update tab slid out today at system boot from the lower right side of the screen that said the update required additional action. After installation of what claimed to be an October (why installing only now in late December) Microsoft keyboard driver
 update, the update is nowhere to be found in the list of installed updates. Clicking on a "More info" link associated with the update led to a generic Microsoft driver page with no info. Device Manager still shows a 2006 dated keyboard driver.</p>

            Not all "updates" will be shown in the update list one being drivers, I wouldn't worry about it as this is Preview software and odd things can happen.

some</span> info at the "more info" links for driver updates to prove that they are, in fact, genuine so that when an October keyboard update for some reason suddenly installs near the end of December, your more security conscious users don't think your official
 MS update security might have been compromised... again.</p>

            Many issues are being reported in Onenote 16.10 with no known solution.  You are definitely not alone.
<br />
<br />You should roll back to previous stable version which you had. To rollback -
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall the latest version of Office - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Install the previous stable version - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7#bkmk_current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update...</a>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed everything and downloaded the 15.14 version of the 5 apps. It accidentally solved the issue that my outlook doesn't receive emails. But the OneNote still can't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that I could use it online on my Mac, so not completely cut off. But many features are lost online so if this issue could be fixed I would really appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a stable version of OneNote where I could download alone not with the Word, PPT, Outlook, Excel together?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            No pencil icon in &#39;Films and TV&#39; on Windows 10 with all the latest updates</h2>
                    <p>I have imported a section of our home movies into 'Films &amp; TV' as a trial edit exercise guided by step-by-step instructions from&nbsp;<em>Computeractive Magazine.</em></p>
<p>They have a screenshot of this app showing an edit button in the bottom right-hand corner. There is no edit symbol here. The film was originally shot on an analogue video camera in 1992. It was transferred to VHS cassette and - recently - to DVD. I downloaded
 the DVD content into my W10 (very fast) computer, and was able to edit it with no trouble in VSL. When I transferred the extract to the 'Films &amp; TV' app to try some editing there, it demanded I download a codec, which I did and then it played with slight loss
 of quality (first minus point). Then I tried to find the pencil edit symbol shown in the&nbsp;<span>Computeractive Magazine&nbsp;</span>screenshot, and it simply would not appear. How does it play the video extract, but does NOT allow editing? How come I can
 edit it easily in VSL? (More points going.) I am comparing the 2 before I start hours of editing, and need to know how I get that pencil symbol back.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Microsoft lose to&nbsp;<span>videolan.org</span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pencil icon in Films in TV just enables you to view/edit the video in the separate Photos app that comes with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you try opening the video directly using Photos for editing. It may or not work depending on the video file type and codecs. Also, if my memory is correct, video editing was not originally a feature of the Photos app it was added later at
 one of the major Windows 10 updates.</p>

<p>All of the sudden, when I open a new Word Document and try to cut and paste the body of an email message into Word 2003, it won't paste anything. I've tried pasting into Excel 2003 right after attempting it with Word, and it pasted into Excel with no problem.</p>

<p>To toggle off what I suspect you are referring to as punctuation, press Ctrl+Shift+8 (the 8 above the U and I keys on a QWERTY keyboard).</p>
<p>Are you using Ctrl+V to try the paste?</p>

<p>Hi Byran,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why you're getting the said error message when trying to save or open a document on your computer. In most cases, this could be due to the file format or file properties. For us to isolate this concern, kindly provide the following
 information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Are you getting the same concern if you open any Word document?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>

            the issue started after a hard drive was replaced and windows was reimaged. the main admin account will open all docs correctly zero issues. it is the standard account users I created that cannot open any office documents or create new blank document.&nbsp;
 I have checked the group policies to make sure there wasn't any restrictions, the users have full access and control of the documents.&nbsp;

<h2>            Why does OneNote start by itself&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>A few weeks ago I found a bunch of files called&nbsp;<span>"OneNote Table Of Contents.onetoc2" (see&nbsp;</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/addonenote/thread/eabbd969-4f1d-479d-a254-fc78829b1b60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/addonenote/thread/eabbd969-4f1d-479d-a254-fc78829b1b60</a>)</p>
<p>Today I was working with Excel, and all of a sudden a OneNote window popped up. I clicked again on the Excel window, but OneNote wouldn't leave. I closed it and I saw a message on the tray for a second, but I didn't have the time to read it.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>I've never used OneNote, and right now I don't want to use it. Perhaps in the future, but not now.</p>
<p>Is it possible to avoid OneNote to start automatically without uninstalling it?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Stefano</p>

<p>It sounds like you created a side note, and the pop up alert was telling you where it was saved.&nbsp; OneNote itself does not run, but there is a small utility that does run that lets these side notes be easily created, and allows for the WINDOWS+S key to take
 screen clippings.</p>
<p>To prevent that from running, start OneNote, click Tools | Options | Display and uncheck the box that says "Place OneNote icon in the notification area of the taskbar' (the top option).&nbsp; When you restart Windows, the utility will not run any longer.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi GPratt1
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Yes, it is true if you are using iOS9, you can't use latest Skype client. Since, there is no old version available from Microsoft, hence it is a difficult situation.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi GPratt1 
<br />
<br />If you cannot install iOS 10.xx on your iPad, you will not be able to run the Skype App on your iPad, iOS 9.xx is no longer supported
<br />
<br />The only option you may have is to try the web version of Skype, though you may have to install a different browser to access that:

    <title>Inbox rules not working in outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baldeagle46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inbox rules not working in outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have used the web based outlook.com for several years without any problems with my inbox rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the change to Outlook 2016, none of the rules I had set up worked and the rules I set up&nbsp;on the 2016 version DO
<strong>NOT WORK</strong>!&nbsp; I have entered the rules every way possible with no success.&nbsp; I have clicked the request for a diagnostic report numerous times and have
<strong>NEVER</strong> received a report.&nbsp; I have spent numerous hours on researching these frustrating problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there an update or download that will fix these problems or is there someone out there that can tell me how to fix them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The messages are not going to the 'Junk Mail'.&nbsp; The messages stay in the 'Inbox'.&nbsp; Despite all the rules I have set up, all the messages remain in the 'inbox'.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you set up your email as a POP account. If you are not sure, call up your mail provider and ask them.</li><li>In all probability your email service will be POP. Ask them to change it to IMAP and then get the IMAP settings. Use the IMAP settings to setup email on your phone and we are done!</li></ul>
