            WMP doesn't have built-in support for syncing with an iPod, you will have to use iTunes for that. If you really want to keep using WMP, there are two plug-ins available that add iPod support, see&nbsp;<a href="http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/Sync.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/Sync.htm</a>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Cowon S9 MP3 player can be connected to the PC in MTP mode for use via a media center only, or in MSC mode as a USB memory stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the recent windows 10 anniversary update, we can't use it in MSC mode anymore as windows wants to format it (which would delete the system files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Infinitysoldier : if you don't want to use it in MTP mode (I don't like it myself) while waiting for a patch, MSC mode works fine on Linux (last Ubuntu in my case).</p>

<p>i know a lot of people with these kinds of problems for black ops 2 but hear are some things to try...</p>
<p>Delete the update---&gt;go to settings ---&gt;memory or storage and highlight your storage, then press LB RB X LB RB X and if the proccess was completed correctly you will be prompted to select yes or no select YES and it should restart your console when its restarted
 download the update as prompted and that should work if it dosnt tell me im not sure what else i can do but i can try</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>If you have already tried what the Official Support team have recommended above and are still having problems, see if you can install the game to the hard disk of your 360 and play it from there just as a test. From the Dashboard, press X and then select
 Install. This is just to test and narrow down what the problem is.</p>
<p>Also try clearing your system cache by following this step by step guide:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-AU/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>Let us know how you go and good luck!</p>

<p>Ive tried it all. I cannot install the game because the game is not even there, to install. It does not show up. It only says, play game but no picture of the game disc like it usually does.
</p>
<p>This issue should be looked at by support &amp; figure out the cause to possibly be fixed. Support is a bit useless if no one can seem to help or know the exact cause.

            <p>Thanks for the prompt reply, yes they are all wma files originally ripped from cd, possibly copied from another hdd in system, d,e,f, which are all currently unhooked for system troubleshooting, which everything is behaving good now, except these wma files,
 all from the same album also.</p>
<p>Screen shot shows problem file properties, media usage rights tab.</p>
<p>It just occurred to me, the main library is on the unhooked D:\ drive, I assume with media rights files, but wmp is set to automatically get media rights when I play a file, so I thought that shouldn't be an issue, but mentioned it to include anything possibly
 relevant. Win 7 sp1, updated last night.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the screenshot - I did an online search on this earlier (collab play being a new one on me!) and it does seem to be related to use on external devices - so&nbsp;it may well be to do with the D drive... I have generally avoided using wma for this reason
 and thankfully it no longer features in WMP 12 on Windows 10 for newly ripped files. The down side is it is not possible to update the media usage rights in Windows 10 at present, although it should still work in 7. (I had to do this very recently on my old
 W7 laptop for a wma file I had inadvertently copy-protected many years ago. I then burned it to an RW disc and re-ripped it in wav. format!&nbsp;)</p>
<p>Plan B would be to re-rip the CD in an alternative format but that only works&nbsp;if the disc is still in your possession. The re-burning option may work but again that may be prevented, so it's probably best to concentrate on relocating it if possible. - Let
 me know if you make progress on this because as mentioned it's the first time I've seen this particular media usage snag. - Best, Ric.</p>

    <title>Surface Pen no longer working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardsj3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pen no longer working</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with my pen that does not seem to be answered on any of the support sites I have visited so far. Any help appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a Surface Pro 4 and pen for 6 months approx now and both have been working really well until recently when I had to request a replacement device for the surface pro.&nbsp; Upon return, the pen does not work properly with the new device. If I open Onenote,
 Word etc it writes for a few seconds, then stops for a few seconds before writing again. None of the buttons work and the light does not switch on if I hold down the end button. I have replaced the battery but no joy. The pen seems to be connecting via bluetooth
 (if I take out the battery, the pen does not work at all), but it does not appear on my bluetooth device list.&nbsp; I should say that the pen was working perfectly before and has been stored in a safe place.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something stupidly wrong, or is a new pen replacement required? Can the pen be repaired and if so, where? Lastly, if I order a new one, are there any tips on where can I recycle the old (broken) pen,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi Edward,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is an issue with the performance of your pen to your replacement Surface Pro 4. We suggest that you re-calibrate you Surface Pen using the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023433/surface-install-and-use-the-surface-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface app</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated on the status of the issue. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion</p>
<p>I was able to calibrate, but the issue hasn't quite resolved itself as the pen still cuts out when writing every few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Surface still can't detect via bluetooth (which is strange because the pen is still able to write)</p>
<p>The pen is flashing a red light which indicates a low battery?</p>
<p>I wonder if the issue is a power issue with the pen?</p>

</p><p>I've been having this issue for a while and ive tried searching and trying soo much but still haven't found a way of fixing this issue.</p>
<p>8 GB used to work on this pc before.</p>
<p>the computer is 64-bit.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 8 GB ram installed on my pc and only 3.4 GB is available?!! the rest of it 4.6 GB is apparently hardware reserved??</p>
<p>
</p><p>what ive done so far:</p>
<p>-The ms config technique (several times)</p>
<p>-regedit (change value - from a yt video)</p>
<p>-take out the ram sticks and switch them around by swapping between the slots</p>

            Looks correct.  I'd also manually check the specs on the RAM to make sure it matches the motherboard  or PC specs.  
<br />
<br />Then do the memtest to know for sure the condition of the RAM and slots.  
<br />
<br />Run with each stick by itself to see how it performs.

    <title>Power button broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power button broken</h2>
                    <p>I've seen a few other threads on this same issue, but these threads are all locked, and I do not see a solution posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: I bought a Surface Book in August 2017, so my Book is about 14 months old.&nbsp; After work, I placed the Book in my laptop bag, went home, came back to work the next day, pulled it out, and the power button was down.&nbsp; I got some tweezers to pull it
 up, but when I let go, the button fell back down; that is, there was no "spring" in the power button.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempts at solutions: At this point, I called support, and got to the end of the line where I was told I needed to download diagnostic software before I could speak with a human.&nbsp; As I could not power on my Book, this was not a possible solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went online, started reading the forums, could not find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the two nearest Microsoft Stores (about a 3 hour drive), they said I could bring it in and they might be able to fix it, but likely I would need to replace the tablet.&nbsp; Since I am not under warranty, this would be $600.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chatted with 3 different Microsoft Support people, was told they could not fix the power button issue, I could send it in and they would replace for $600.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a butter knife, pried open the top where the power and volume buttons sit, and found the power button does not contact the actual power switch.&nbsp; I used a paper clip, and doing this was able to turn on my laptop.&nbsp; I have been doing this successfully
 for the past 4 days.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, while using my laptop, it randomly began to shut down.&nbsp; Using the paper clip, had to press the switch several times to turn it back on; it seemed it would begin to boot, and then turn off.&nbsp; Also went through "Automatic Repair" screen.&nbsp; This was an
 ongoing issue, after the third time of the laptop shutting down, I gave up and moved onto other work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My primary frustration is that the issue seemed to start with the simple failure of a $0.01 piece of hardware that 3 different people told me would probably cost $600 to fix.&nbsp; If anyone has any suggestions on what to do next, it would be greatly, greatly
 appreciated.</p>
<p>

            Hello jasonden,
<br />
<br />It is very sad story.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately all questions related to the hardware should be solved in service centre, there are not software issue which can be manage by Community.
<br />
<br />If you are run out of warranty, try to find alternative services which could assist you with button fixing.

            <p>Hi Marion, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community Forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know how frustrating it is to be receiving the same emails that you've already erased. Rest assured, I will do my best to enlighten you why could this&nbsp;be happening and assist you in permanently&nbsp;removing the said&nbsp;emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two options in setting up your account in Windows Live Mail, automatically and manually. If you have set up your account manually, Windows Live Mail will copy your emails&nbsp;from the web version and&nbsp;even if you've already deleted an email, it will
 still show up again because you still have a copy of that email in Outlook.com.&nbsp;Maybe that's the reason you're still seeing those&nbsp;messages because everytime you send or receive emails,&nbsp;they will be downloaded again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also like to verify, are&nbsp;you using a Microsoft account? If you are, you can set up your account in Windows Live Mail automatically.<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Whatever you do in Windows Live Mail, will also be reflected on the web and vice-versa.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to inform us and I'm looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi
<span><span><span>L</span></span><span><span>izzy1</span></span>,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p><span>To have a better understanding of the issue, I would require some information from your end:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which version of Windows Vista is installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer recently?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Who is the manufacturer of the modem?</span></p>
<p><span>I have few steps which might help you.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Let's try to&nbsp;<span>reset the modem or the router.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>1. Disconnect the cable that connects the computer to the modem.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Turn off the modem and the router.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note :
<span>&nbsp;</span>If the modem or the router does not have a power switch, disconnect the power to the modem or to the router.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>4. After your computer has restarted, turn on the modem or the router, connect the cable from the computer to the modem or the router, and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Make sure that all network cables are securely connected.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;You may also connect any other modem and check if you are able to connect to internet.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>If it does not help, you may contact the manufacturer of the modem for further help.</span></span>

<h2>            Screen too magnified for any command</h2>
                    <p>Please, anybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to put such an impossible challenge to you, but I'm not familiar with computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a simple step-by-step solution for my Lenovo G 50-80 Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidentally pressed the wrong keys and now, the screen is super zoomed in.&nbsp; All I can see is edge-to-edge blue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see the start button, but I see a very enlarged magnifier icon.</p>
<p>I can also see a very enlarged&nbsp; Ease of Access icon.&nbsp; I go to a huge lens icon. But there's no response when I click.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Task icon is also huge and non-clickable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no response on Cntlr + - .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing opens when I right click on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything's too big for me to see any size/scaling/customise or drop-down menu.&nbsp; And even if I were to see it, I won't be able to click on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see 'screen resolution', I can't see 'decrease icon size', I can't see 'display' when I right click screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the computer must have upgraded to the latest Windows 10. I'm sure I have the latest drivers, and I've even rolled back my computer to a previous state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started and restarted.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think this is a deep problem? Or can I adjust it without getting the laptop opened up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi Percy,
<br />
<br />You need to boot into Safe Mode, your video driver will not load in Safe Mode and you should then be able to see enough on your screen to fix this . . 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />
<br />Once in Safe Mode, right click your Desktop and choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Make sure Resolution is set to the one marked (recommended)
<br />
<br />Make sure Scale is set to 100%
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC . . .       
        </p>

    <title>dual monitor problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dixiegrayson  say:</h3>
<h2>            dual monitor problem</h2>
                    I replaced a smaller monitor with a dell se2417hg monitor to match the first monitor. The computer will not recognize it, it shows up only as generic pnp, and even after going in and updating the driver, it will not give me the resolution option that I
 need to make the monitors match. I am running windows 10, and I have used an old used small monitor with no problem, so I can't figure out what is going on with this one, I purchased it new. Any help would be appreciated as I can't use it as it is.

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What type of connection are you using for the second display: HDMI, Display Port, DVI? 
<br />
<br />Its possible there might be an issue with your adapter or cable connection. You could try nudging the cable to see if it works or change out the cable. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Monitors
<br />
<br />Right click the monitor that keeps freezing
<br />Click uninstall
<br />
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working again properly.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates
<br />Download and install any pending updates
<br />Restart your computer 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + P
<br />Click Extend
<br />
<br />See if it starts working again.

            HDMI. I have switched out the cables, switched monitors after deleting both, so the newer one is the main one- the computer did not recognize the original monitor when it was added as the 2nd one.&nbsp; The monitor isn't freezing it just will not allow a resolution
 above1680x1050 for the 2nd monitor, while the 1st one is set at 1920x1080. It also drags. I have deleted, reinstalled, restarted several times, and installed updates and restarted.&nbsp;

<p>and these are Intel processors.&nbsp; One ?crazy? thought I had was this:&nbsp; WSUS shows the processor on these Windows7 64-bit machines as AMD64, even though they are Intel processors (all from Dell, I believe).&nbsp; Maybe it is the BIOS date/level that is causing

            Also, I had a&nbsp;few of the "non-applicable" workstations check online for updates.&nbsp; In each case, Microsoft updated them with the superceded 2017-12 Security Monthly Quality Rollup KB4054518.&nbsp; And that update was superceded by the 2018-01 Security Rollup
 KB4056894 that mitigates "meltdown/spectre" which Microsoft online did not offer to the workstation.

<p>Solution:</p>
<p>Our company previously used Symantec Endpoint protection.&nbsp; The Symantec uninstaller left all kinds of garbage on around 50% of&nbsp;the workstations.&nbsp; Microsoft detected the presence of some of the unsupported Symantec EP and would not make the Meltdown/Spectre
 security patches visible to the affected machines, even though we had a supported Sophos AV installed and the QualityCompat registry key was present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used the Symantec "CleanWipe" utility to clean up the crud left behind from the Symantec uninstaller.&nbsp; Then the workstations were able to see the Microsoft patches.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Upgrade to windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I bought a lenovo G500 Brand new with a licensed Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>Problem is I can't upgrade to 8.1, not from the store nor manually. And my device got the requirements to be able to run 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
I download the Windows 8.1 Troubleshooter and it gave me this:</p>
<p>"Your PC is running an enterprise or volume licensed &nbsp;version of windows 8 and cannot be update using windows store. Contact your system administrator for information on how to update your PC to windows 8.1."<br />
</p>
<p>After clicking next it detected that: "minimum system requirement not met"</p>
<p>

            <p>You are likely running a non-genuine copy of Windows 8 Pro if you got that message. Volume License client editions of Windows 8 such as Windows 8 Pro cannot be upgraded to Windows 8.1 through the Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume License distributions of Windows 8 such as Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise utilizing KMS and MAK licenses should be updated by downloading the installation files for Windows 8.1 from the volume license servicing center, or TechNet/MSDN if you have a
 subscription or install based on your employers parameters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the bottom of the laptop, is there a Windows 8 sticker there? Does it say Windows 8 or Windows 8 Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no Windows 8 Pro sticker, then its non-genuine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can do is try initiating a Reset and see if it takes you back to the original factory state:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Look at the bottom and confirm which edition sticker is listed at the bottom of the laptop chassis, Windows 8 or Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its Windows 8, download Windows 8.1, if its Windows 8 Pro, download Windows 8.1 Pro:</p>

            No this did not help at all.&nbsp; The issue is not the game freezing and needing to be restarted, the issue is the game will not launch at all to begin with.&nbsp; I also downloaded Lost Odyssey and that game works fine.&nbsp; Blue Dragon fails to launch.

<p>Hello, ejaykong!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the previously posted troubleshooting didn't really help with the issue you might want to reset your console.
</p>
<p>First you would make sure that you have the sign in info for all of the accounts that you guys value on the console and that you guys have a solid, accessible connection to the internet.
</p>
<p>If you have that, try to do a soft reset. </p>
<p>It's a factory reset where you get to <strong>keep your games and apps </strong>
</p>
<p>Follow the instructions here <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults</a> &nbsp;and let us know if that helps resolve your issue</p>

<h2>            Surface 2 Program Issues</h2>
                    <p>So I just bought an Akai MPK Mini, which is a keyboard for music mixing. It comes with programs that need to be downloaded in order for me to use the keyboard. They are&nbsp;supposed to be compatible with a Mac or any PC that runs Windows 10, but my Surface 2
 won't support any of the programs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can get my device to run these programs or do I need to get a new computer? And will any of the new Surface products run these programs?

    <title>Profile keeps on Corrupting. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aromaticmango  say:</h3>
<h2>            Profile keeps on Corrupting.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys and thanks for reading,</p>
<p>Now for my problem. This has been happening for a while now, often but not all of the time, when I'm unlocking achievements they unlock on my profile but not on the website.
</p>
<p>The most recent case was yesterday when I was playing Cloudy with a Chance Of Meatballs (Don't judge me, it's easy G's) I had unlocked the achievement for slashing 25 marshmallows. The achievement popped and I kept on playing. I finished the game as I was
 near the end, and none of the achievements for completing it unlocked and when I went onto the xbox guide, it said that my Gamerscore had been reset to 0.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time this has happened either. It happened when I had spent hours getting the final achievements from Overlord, the online ones and the exact same thing happened!</p>
<p>This also means that my profile thinks that I've unlocked the achievements when I've not, and I can't unlock them again!
</p>
<p>This really is very annoying!! Has anyone else had this happen to them, or know of a fix for this? I know that one fix is to create a new account, but considering I've put four years into this account, I don't want to start another one.</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas?</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Try this. On your console go to the
<i>Memory Tab</i>&gt;<i>Profiles&gt;delete profile </i>(profile only!). Now go back to the main
<i>Memory Tab </i>screen and press 'Y' on your controller, then <i>clear cache</i>. Restart your console and proceed to recover your profile.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Also, it has been known if you recover your profile to a console that has been banned your profile may become corrupt. Have you done that recently?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">If you are using the
<i>recover profile</i> tool for daily use, such as when you go to a friends/family members house to play, then you should be using a USB flash drive instead. Using the recover profile tool daily has also been known to corrupt a profile.

<p>Thanks for that answer Temhotabot. I'll give that a try when I get home from work.
</p>
<p>I've only ever re-downloaded my profile once it has been corrupted and it has always been to my own xbox, which is not banned from xboxlive. When taking my profile to someone elses house, I always use a USB device to transfer my profile.</p>

<p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>It also is making it so I can't open control panel, settings at all, and many other apps that are pretty important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what is going on and I tried looking into it and nothing was helping. Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
