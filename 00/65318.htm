<h2>            Steering Wheels</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking at getting a steering wheel for the Xbox one in a month or so. I've read a load of reviews, spoke to some peeps abut them, however I've not heard any reviews from average gamers. I'm probably going to get the Thrustmaster TX 458, has anyone had
 any hands on experience with these, any quirks, annoyances, do you prefer the Madcatz. &nbsp;It's all well and good seeing reviews online but an honest opinion from a forum member would be cool.</p>
<p>It's going to be mounted on a rather sturdy coffee table in front of my couch, table sits around 16" high, its very heavy so I hope the clamps are sturdy, pedals will be on the deck, hopefully using the carpet gripper it comes with, if not I think I could
 make something up to support them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the Thrustmaster TX 458. &nbsp;I have had it for about a year and have not had the first problem with it. &nbsp;I am eagerly anticipating breaking it out again in a couple of weeks when Project Cars releases. &nbsp;The only flaw to it in my opinion is that it is
 not wireless so depending on how close/far you sit you may need to get a usb port extension cord.</p>

<p>They look like fun, I kinda like the look and fact you can change the tension on the pedals with the Madcatz. But the TX has a bit more going for it I think.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'd avoid the MadCatz. No clutch pedal. no option for shifters other than the paddle and the biggest reason....it only works with the One.</p>
<p>If you're going to spend more money on a wheel than your console cost don't pigeon hole yourself into only being able to use it on only one platform.
</p>
<p>Since there still isn't a release date on the Fanatec, the Thrustmaster TX is currently your best option and it's a good wheel.

<h2>            Opening external hard drive to view files</h2>
                    I have an emachines mini tower that I run Windows 7 64 bit on. Through NTI back up, all the data is saved on a Toshiba external hard drive. When I plug the Toshiba into my Acer mini tower USB, I cannot open any of the files. They show me a download box,
 and when I go to download the file to, say, downloads, Explorer stops working. It will not even let me view the files stored on the external hard drive. Whaaat???&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p>Since you mentioned Acer and Explorer stops working it makes me think you should read through this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e6a2532b-70b2-43f8-94ed-7d30cca20a08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f12de01e-7245-409c-b87f-ee7d870bdc50" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, read this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer Extensions make up the list/menu of things you see when you right click something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An afflicted Explorer Shell extension can cause Explorer to crash - especially when using copy/paste and/or drag/drop and often to/from an external USB attached drive or device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incidents involving Acer and ASUS systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some troublesome Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Note:&nbsp; You may see this issue after the installation of Windows Update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4038777/windows-7-update-kb4038777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB4038777</a> but the Windows update is not the problem - the update patches security holes that bring the real problem to the surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your system is not from Acer or ASUS it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by making a manual System Restore point so you have an easy way to undo any adjustments if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.&nbsp; You can always reinstall it again later if needed,
 right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and figure out which one is afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using The following program suggestion if you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when Windows feels
 threatened by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d24c2e4c-1ede-4fa6-b292-dc4a77378dcc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!&nbsp;</p>

            Why did Microsoft create a "new" version of windows that is not backward compatible with the games that Microsoft created? So you are telling me that the games I bought in good faith from Microsoft I can no longer use? That is some real garbage.

<p>Assuming your copy of CSF3 is <em>disk based</em>, the issue is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
nothing to do with Compatibility.</span><br />
The issue is DRM Blocking. A 'security feature' MS built into Win10 that blocks the driver used by SafeDisk copy protection -
<em>secdrv.sys</em>.</p>
<p>I have more details on DRM Blocking in my post at&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
---this thread---</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Short story.... You need to use a noCD fix/hack to run this and many disk based games on Win10.
</p>
<p>(while the posters at sim-outhouse may not be allowed to post details for noCD's,&nbsp; some other filght sim sites do have noCD fixes in their</p>
<p>mod and patch section) . </p>
<p>The fix below is from Mega Games who I have used for over ten years for my disk based games&nbsp; (<em>Always</em> hated having to use the disk).</p>

<p>
</p><p>- I have CFS2 which uses the same game engine as CFS3. The only Compatibility setting I use is
<em>Override high DPI Scaling Behavior &gt; Application.</em></p>
<p>You may not need this option if you have not setup&nbsp; Windows <em>Display Settings</em> to use
<em>Custom Scaling</em><em>.</em></p>

            Are you having some issues that you think SFC will correct or are you just practicing?<br />
<br />
In order for SFC to run properly, you have to have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed SP or SFC is going to complain - a lot.
<br />
<br />
SFC needs a source of known "good" files to compare against what is on your system and if you are running SP3, that can only be a genuine bootable XP installation CD that already has SP3 on it.<br />
You can also tell SFC to look someplace else for the known good files - I have mine looking in a folder on an external HDD where I have copied the entire XP SP3 installation CD.<br />
<br />
Many people seem to have no genuine bootable XP installation either because their store bought system did not come with one, they lost it, the dog ate it, etc.&nbsp; If you happen to have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is either SP1 or SP2 and your system
 is running SP3, you can make a new installation CD with SP3 integrated into it through a process called '<i>slipstreaming</i>'.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Making a slipstreamed CD is a good idea and we can point you in the right direction to do that if you have an outdated genuine bootable XP installation CD.<br />
<br />
Then you can run SFC /scannow to your hearts content, but it will probably not do what you think it is going to do or what people tell you it is going to do or people they think it is supposed to do.<br />
<br />
It is a misconception that SFC will replace missing or damaged system files and I will include a test scenario to prove that for anyone to try that thinks that is the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would encourage anyone that thinks SFC /scannow replaces missing or corrupt system
 files to run this test scenario.&nbsp; Then you will learn what SFC /scannow does and what it doesn't do.<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow is designed to run <i>one </i>time when XP is installed and it's job is to populate the dllcache folder with backup copies of critical system files.&nbsp; If any one of those 3498 system files (yes there is a list on
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
my SkyDrive</a>) comes up missing on your system, Windows File Protection will attempt to quickly and silently replace the missing or corrupt file using the backup copy in the dllcache folder and put a message like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64002<br />
Description:<br />
File replacement was attempted on the protected system file c:\windows\system32\taskmgr.exe. This file was restored to the original version to maintain system stability. The file version of the system file is 5.1.2600.5512.<br />
<br />
To see that example, just rename your c:\windows\system32\taskmgr.exe file to something you can remember like 'taskmgr.xxx' and when WFP sees the file missing, it will quickly and silently replace it.&nbsp; That is WFP in action then look in the Event Viewer System
 log.<br />
<br />
Note that if you run SFC and if it finds a file in the dllcache folder that needs to be replaced, you will not be able to tell what it did or if it did anything at all.&nbsp; All you will see in the Event Viewer are messages that it started and stopped - there is
 no message or clue about what it did or didn't do which makes running it more of a waste of time.<br />
<br />
For Windows XP (that would be this forum), when sfc /scannow starts and completes, there is no message displayed after the scan, but there are only events in the Event Log that look like this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64016<br />
Description:<br />
Windows File Protection file scan was started.<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64017<br />
Description:<br />
Windows File Protection file scan completed successfully.<br />
<br />
Even if sfc /scannow finds a file to replace in the %Systemroot%\system32\dllcache folder and replaces a file there is&nbsp; no message displayed or not event even logged in the Event Viewer so you will never know if it did anything or not.<br />
<br />
So, what is the point of these suggestions we see almost every day to get folks to try to run sfc /scannow when they have system problems, or try to run it in Safe Mode (when sfc /scannow will not even run in Safe Mode) and most folks don't have a genuine bootable
 XP installation CD that is the same SP as their installed SP in the first place?<br />
<br />
I do not understand it.<br />
<br />
Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" like to suggest SFC /scannow but to me, that is akin to saying "<i>I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it</i>".&nbsp;&nbsp; They also like to suggest running it in Safe Mode, but SFC will not run in Safe Mode
 (this means they don't try their own suggestions to see if they work).<br />
<br />
If you would actually try running SFC /scannow in Safe Mode, you will get the following messages:<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection could not initiate a scan of protected system files. <br />
The specific error code is 0x000006ba [The RPC server is unavailable.].<br />
<br />
You cannot start the RPC Server in Safe Mode either.<br />
<br />
Here is a message I send to the Microsoft engaged Support Engineers when they suggest that people waste more time trying to run SFC /scannow.&nbsp; If you follow this exercise, you will learn what SFC /scannow does and what it doesn't do.<br />
<br />
Here is a popular error message that is easy to resolve, but these "experts" always suggest to run SFC /scannow (which will not help) and further reinforces the idea that the MS engaged "experts" do not know how XP work.&nbsp; THe error is:<br />
<br />
<i>Control Panel<br />
Windows cannot find 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe'.&nbsp; Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search.<br />
</i><br />
Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" and others always suggest sfc /scannow for that error but it will never solve the problem because that is not how sfc /scannow works, that is not what it does and that is not what it is for.&nbsp; You can see for yourself
 if you keep reading and follow the exercise.<br />
<br />
Now for the learning part:<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear:&nbsp; &lt;Insert Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" Name Here&gt;:<br />
<br />
Before you suggest running sfc /scannow, you need to first find out if the user has a genuine bootable XP installation CD that has the same Service Pack as their installed Service Pack (most people don't).&nbsp; If they do not, sfc /scannow is going to complain
 - a lot, so why do you suggest it?&nbsp; Why don't you just say "I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it".<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow will not replace the missing rundll32.exe file.<br />
<br />
Why do you continuously&nbsp; post "Methods" that do not work and will only waste time?<br />
<br />
Have you ever even seen this problem before, tried to recreate it so you can actually see it, or have you ever actually fixed it?<br />
<br />
That is not what sfc /scannow does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for and here is a test so you can see for yourself how sfc /scannow does work.<br />
<br />
Why don't you learn what sfc /scannow does and doesn't do?<br />
<br />
Here is a simple test for you and all your Support Engineer colleagues:<br />
<br />
I implore you to run this simple test and then you might actually learn how sfc /scannow works:<br />
<br />
For this example, let's use the critical system file rundll32.exe.<br />
<br />
Rename or delete your c:\windows\system32\rundll32.exe.exe file so the file is now "missing".<br />
<br />
If Windows File Protection is running, the "missing" file will be quickly and silently replaced and you will see an event like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64002<br />
Description:<br />
File replacement was attempted on the protected system file c:\windows\system32\rundll32.exe. This file was restored to the original version to maintain system stability. The file version of the system file is 5.1.2600.5512.<br />
<br />
That is Windows File Protection in action.<br />
<br />
Now boot your system in Safe Mode or the Recovery Console so Windows File Protection is
<i>not</i> running.<br />
<br />
Rename or delete your c:\windows\system32\rundll32.exe.exe file so the file is now really "missing".&nbsp; Since WFP does non run in Safe Mode or the Recovery Console, the file will not automatically be replaced like it was before.<br />
<br />
That is a critical system file, right?&nbsp; It is on the list of 3498 file that Windows File Protection and SFC knows about but now it is missing.<br />
<br />
Now, with your rundll32.exe file missing, boot into Normal mode and try to use Control Panel to open the Internet Options or the Power Options and you will see the error that the file is missing (now you have reproduced the error):<br />
<br />
<i>Control Panel<br />
Windows cannot find 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe'.&nbsp; Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search.</i><br />
<br />
Now follow you own advice and run sfc /scannow to completion.<br />
<br />
The rundll32.exe is still missing, right?&nbsp; Did running sfc /scannow replace the missing&nbsp; critical system file?&nbsp; No it did not.<br />
<br />
How can that be if sfc /scannow is supposed to replace missing system files?&nbsp; That is because that is not what sfc /scannow does.<br />
<br />
Now you know what sfc /scannow does <i>not </i>do.&nbsp; It did not replace your missing system file like you said it would do (be sure to put your rundll32.exe back so you will have one).<br />
<br />
Now navigate to c:\windows\system32\dllcache and delete or rename the rundll32.exe file from there - and it will stay gone and not be automatically replaced since Windows File Protection does not look after that folder.<br />
<br />
Run sfc /scannow to completion again.<br />
<br />
The missing rundll32.exe file in the dllcache folder will be replaced, since that IS the folder that sfc /scannow looks after for missing files.<br />
<br />
Now you know what sfc /scannow <i>does </i>do.<br />
<br />
Do you need help in learning about corrupt system files too?<br />
<br />
Since most people to not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD, they will not be able to expand a copy of the missing file from the installation CD they do not have.&nbsp; Another bad suggestion.<br />
<br />
Why don't you post some directions on how to replace the file when the user has no genuine bootable XP installation CD and that will be useful to everyone, or at least post some ideas that actually work (that means you have tried them yourself).<br />
<br />
If you do not know how, say "I do not know how" and I will help you learn how.<br />

            Anybody that claims sfc /scannow 'replaces missing or corrupt system files' only needs to run my little test scenario to see that it does not replace missing or corrupt system files in the system32 folder.<br />
<br />
It does replace missing or corrupt files system files in the dllcache folder - that is what it is supposed to do - and the dllcache folder does not come into play while XP is running.&nbsp; You can totally empty it or rename the dllcache folder so it is completely
 'missing' and XP will still work just fine.<br />
<br />
Microsoft says:<br />
<br />
<i>If the %systemroot%\system32\dllcache folder becomes corrupt or unusable, use <b>
sfc /scannow</b>, <b>sfc /scanonce</b>, or <b>sfc /scanboot</b> to repair the contents of the

<br />
</i>Notice it does not say anything about the system32 folder.<i><br />
</i><br />
If you empty the dllcache folder and have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same SP as your installed SP and then run sfc /scannow, the dllcache folder will be repopulated.&nbsp; That is what it is for.<br />
<br />
What people need to say about sfc /scannow is that it 'replaces missing or corrupt system files
<b><i>in the dllcache folder</i></b>'.&nbsp; That part is always missing.<br />
<br />
Try the test scenario I posted involving the rundll32.exe file.&nbsp; You can't hurt anything, if something goes wrong, it is easy to fix and when you get done you will see for yourself what sfc /scannow doesn't do and what it does do.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Folks that say sfc /scannow 'replaces missing or corrupt system files' are only parroting what other people say or what they have read and misinterpreted.&nbsp; They have never actually
<i>tried</i> to make a test case to understand what sfc /scannow really does, so I made the test scenario for them to help them understand so they can see it for themselves.&nbsp; Seeing is believing (sometimes).<br />
<br />
They need only to run that test scenario one time and they will change their tune.&nbsp; It has converted many people so instead of going by what other people say, you have an opportunity now to find out for yourself how it works,<br />

Suggesting is is also likely to be a waste of time unless you are sure that the person has a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as the installed SP.&nbsp; Since most people don't (and the question is never asked before suggesting sfc

<br />
Before I took the time to figure it out (years ago) I used to suggest it sometimes only because I saw what I though were other knowledgeable people suggesting it - but it never did any good or was impossible (especially after SP3 came out) since nobody had
 a SP3 installation CD.<br />
<br />
Then I sat down and figured out what it really does and doesn't do and will never suggest it again.<br />

I believe that it is a desperate suggestion that means 'I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it'.<br />

<br />
The problem is that most people have the wrong impression of what it is supposed to do (including Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts").<br />
<br />
All anybody has to do is run the test scenario posted 08/14 and learn how it really works.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I can only think of one person that has actually taken the time to do that - but it was worth it to him.<br />
<br />
I did not make all that stuff up on 08/14 either.&nbsp; I have already figured this out a long time ago and wrote it down.&nbsp; Long ago, I used to think incorrectly about it too - then I sat down, did some reading and research and figured it out.<br />

<h2>            stuck at &#34;Making sure you&#39;re ready to install&#34;</h2>
                    I was on windows 8.1 and then I upgraded to windows 10 before dec 2017. Everything worked fine till march 2018. My OS got corrupt and I used HP envy laptop USB recovery usb drive to get back to windows 8.1. Now trying to download window 10. I'm stuck at
 "making sure you're ready to install". I have deleted all my personal folders, disabled windows defender, rebooted many times.&nbsp; Every time I'm stuck at this step for more than one hour. Any suggestions that will work on HP envy laptop.

            Hi DASMATHY,<br /><br />We can try to work through this! Are you downloading the latest windows 10 image? The fall creator link can be found here - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a><br /><br />Iâd create a new user account on your current build, log in as them, and try to download and install 10. If youâre unsure on how to add a new user, I can help. Let me know if you want to go this route. <br />- C

            I would recommend doing a clean install.
<br />Your machine already had Windows 10 on it so your license will be fine if that's what your worried about.
<br />Make sure download the ISO again, link below on how to do the clean install.

<p>tried clean install.&nbsp; But now it says that I'm not eligible for upgrade. Since I restored windows 8.1 from usb restore drive, it's assuming that I'm still on windows 8.1 and thus not allowing me.</p>
<p>It's not recognizing that I was on windows 10 before the OS got corrupt.</p>

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

            Hmm, ok, when you launch the installer, are you asked âdo you want to download updates firstâ? If so, and you chose yes, letâs force quit the installer, and launch again, this time choosing no.
<br />
<br />Let me know, and Iâll keep looking for other solutions.

            Hi JohnTsang.
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />If you have problems connecting Spotify to the internet, you can try modifying the Firewall to open the ports of exit to the application with the following steps:
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open the group policy management console in Windows Defender Firewall with advanced security.
<br />
<br />2. In the navigation pane, click on Rules of entry.
<br />
<br />3. Search "Spotify" in the list.
<br />
<br />4. Double click on "Spotify" to see the Properties.
<br />
<br />5. Click on the "Advanced" tab.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />There may be the option to specify whether the network is 'Home / Private' or 'Public'.
<br />
<br />6. Choose 'Private'.
<br />            
<br /> 7. Click Ok.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />Let me know if it was helpful

<p>using windows XP, SP3, IE8....I changed something on one of the services in services.msc from Network to Local User.&nbsp; Cannot remember which one.&nbsp;So now, unable to start any service that has not been started such as RPC due to dependencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I cannot
 even look at the Properties to change anything on any service.&nbsp; As a result, cannot access internet or recieve Outlook mail...I doubleclick on the icon, but it does nothing.&nbsp; I believe I must have done somethign to one of the accounts...possibly a permissions
 issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyway to tell from the registry</p>

            <p>As has been indicated you can use Disk Manager to shrink a partition to free up space to create a separate drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However even if you defrag the drive it is not unusual to find that you can get nothing like the space you would expect on the basis of the used space on the drive. This is because defrag will not move the master file table (MFT) no matter what. the closer
 that is to the end of the disk the smaller the space to shrink by.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use a 3rd party defrag tool (defraggler, Auslogic) as these will move the file or a 3rd party partition tool (PartitionMagic, Easus) to do the shrink</p>

            <p>Hi Donald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issue description, I understand you want to split your present drive into two partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To create a partition or volume (the two terms are often used interchangeably) on a hard disk, you must be logged in as an administrator, and there must be either unallocated disk space or free space within an extended partition on the hard
 disk. To create a partition or volume (the two terms are often used interchangeably) on a hard disk, you must be logged in as an administrator, and there must be either unallocated disk space or free space within an extended partition on the hard disk.</span>To
 create a partition or volume (the two terms are often used interchangeably) on a hard disk, you must be logged in as an administrator, and there must be either unallocated disk space or free within an extended partition on the hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you need to know how many partitions already exist on the hard drive:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on the&nbsp;Start screen and then click on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;<strong>All apps</strong> icon.
</span></li><li><span>Scroll across to Windows System.</span></li><li><span>Click on
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, located under the <em>Windows &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System</em> section.</span></li><li><span>Next, click on
<strong>System and Security &gt;&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Administrative &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools &gt;&nbsp;Computer Management</strong>
<strong>&gt;&nbsp;Di<em>sk Management</em>.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disk Management may take several seconds to load but will eventually &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appear to the right.</span></li></ol>
<p>If the graphic shows four partitions, you can go no further unless you are prepared to delete the tools which the computer manufacturer has provided such that you can recover the computer easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have only three partitions, you will be able to create another partition, but note before you start the process that if ever you use the manufacturer options to recover, your new partition PLUS all contents will disappear without trace unless you
 back up or save the contents to an external hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want the partition for backups, don't do it. Backups should be made to media which can be removed or disconnected while the computer is in general use.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you want the partition to&nbsp;keep programs separate from the operating system, you are wasting your time. Windows programs have to be re-installed from scratch in the event of an operating system failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>You can also check this Microsoft article which will give you more information like how to create partition, below article is also applicable for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1:</p>

<h2>            Games for Windows Live wont launch</h2>
                    I've purchased a game for my PC from Xbox.com and when I went to install it, it downloaded "gfwlsetup_4d530fa70ebf0001.exe" When I launch the installer its installs the marketplace. After the installation I click the launch button to open GFWL. A small&nbsp;
 window appears saying "Games for Windows Marketplace." After the small window closes nothing happens. Please help.

<h3> randyrhea  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Volume Shadow Copy Service error&#58; Unexpected error calling routine CoCreateInstance.  hr &#61; 0x80004002</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Volume Shadow Copy fails</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several days ago my system became unstable and none of the restore points would run. The system had Windows 7 Professional installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a Windows 7 Home Premium CD, so I reinstalled it and many applications. Applications run fine, but I have no Restore points. If I attempt to Start System Restore to create a Restore point, I get the message: "System Restore does not appear to be functioning
 properly. A Volume Shadow Copy component encountered an unexpected error. Check the Application event log for more information. (0x89942302)" The event viewer says "Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected error calling routine CoCreateInstance. &nbsp;hr =
 0x80004002, No such interface supported" and a second message "Volume Shadow Copy Service error: A critical component required by the Volume Shadow Copy service is not registered. This might happened if an error occurred during Windows setup or during installation
 of a Shadow Copy provider. The error returned from CoCreateInstance on class with CLSID {e579ab5f-1cc4-44b4-bed9-de0991ff0623} and Name IVssCoordinatorEx2 is [0x80004002, No such interface supported". These of course are pure gibberish to an non-expert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading about this in KB, I made sure Volume Shawdow Copy is a running service. It is set to automatic and it is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using an Anytime Upgrade key I have, I attempted to install an upgrade to Windows 7 Professional hoping it might repair a corrupted file, but the upgrade fails because it can't create a new Restore point (Now, I'm chasing my tail!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I next tried to run sfc /scannow hoping it might repair something, but it returns "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them" and a message that details are in CBS.log. I can't open the CBS file (it does not have
 a log extention, but that isn't the problem, it denies me access even though I'm logged in as admisistrator) However, the Event Viewer System object returns "The WinHTTP Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Service service entered the stopped state". The Security object
 gives a couple of Information details concerning "Crytographic operation" but these messages &nbsp;don't look onerous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working on this computer off and on now for several days. I'm at a loss as to what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>So the sake of expediency, I went ahead and uninstalled Carbonite and created the logs. There are two sets of logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The set "before" are after rebooting and waiting 30 minutes. I performed no activity on the computer before that. The set "after" are the logs after attempting a Restore.</p>

</p><p>An issue with permissions seems to thread this problem. When I reinstalled Windows 7 Home was there a chance I created a new volume and hid another. &nbsp;If so, is there a way to check this?</p>

            <p>Hello Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the image. Unfortunately, it looks identical to yours. This takes me back to the permissions problem. It seems like VSS doesn't have permission to run. When I reinstalled Windows, I used a retail store Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium upgrade CD
 I had used years ago to upgrade my system from Windows XP. It was an upgrade CD. At a later date I installed a Windows 7 Professional version over my 7 Home Premium. That all worked fine for a long time, including a Restore or two.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, when my system become slow and unstable, I attempted a Restore. The Restore started (unlike the current issue where Restore won't even start) but after running awhile it returned a message that the Restore failed, please try another Restore point.
 I tried all listed Restore points and none worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried a new install of Windows 7 Home Premium using the same years old CD. That seemed to go OK. I then began installing many apps, including an old Windows 2000 office suite that I've used for years. That old suite had worked fine before my system
 went unstable a week ago. All my apps were working fine and I was happy. Then I decided to install the Windows 7 Professional upgrade that I had a Microsoft product key for. It would not install because it could not create a Restore point. At that point, I
 noticed there were no Restore points from my previous application installs, and that I could not open Restore to manually create a Restore point. That was disconcerting because I now have a system with no ability to Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only takes me a few hours to reinstall the most important applications that I use. Should I just try another Windows 7 Home Premium install? Although, I don't know what would be different. If I format C: before I try another install, I presume my Home
 Premium update CD won't install a fresh 7 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a system recovery CD, might it not just replicate the setup with the same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have been extremely patient and helpful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Randy</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, Skype app doesnât have any recording features for Skype calls. However, there are third-party apps recommended by Skype. These
 third-party apps will only work on the classic Skype app. Check this out: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12395/how-can-i-record-my-skype-calls?q=record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may download the classic Skype app on this
<a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a>.

<h2>            How do I know which Intel display driver I have&#63;</h2>
                    Please help! I don't know which display driver I currently have, and I don't know how to find out. This is really, really confusing and I'm freaking out. I'm trying to run a Nintendo 64 emulator but it randomly crashes the computer...my Vista then tells
 me later it's because of the Intel display driver I have. I don't know which one I have so I don't know how to update it.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker's site as the driver there maynot be the latest however it will tell you in its<br />
description which you have.<br />
<br />
Also look in these :<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; System Information&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top - double click on.<br />
<br />
Components - Display&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Also Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - that is your video card - double click
<br />
on it and Driver's tab tells you version.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
<strong>DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.</strong>
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<p><span><span>You may disable the enhanced SATA feature from BIOS</span><span>(Basic Input Output System)
</span><span>temporarily. Thereafter, try&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/install-reinstall-uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">installing Windows XP</a>.</span></span></p>

 website</span></a><span> &amp; re-enable it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Modifying BIOS/ chipset incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
