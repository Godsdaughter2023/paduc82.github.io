            <p>Hi Deborah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue occurs when sending emails to the specific Gmail account, you need to contact the mailbox owner to get more storage to solve the issue. If you're the mailbox owner, deleting some items could help from my experience. However, as it's a Gmail
 account, if deleting items doesn't help, please seek dedicated help from Gmail support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue occurs when sending to different users, please share the requested information above for investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Aaron</p>

    <title>3 Soft Keys NO LONGER LIGHT UP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clive_merritt  say:</h3>
<h2>            3 Soft Keys NO LONGER LIGHT UP</h2>
                    
<p>Why is it after the new update the 3 soft keys at the bottom of the lumia 800 no longer work properly, surely this is not what you intented because it would be absolutely ridiculous, you would have made 3 keys for a phone nobody can see in the dark, and
 as for some reason there is an option to manually adjust brightness and such which can affect the 3 keys performance but the second you change it and go out of that specific menu it resets itself, so please can we have a few answers, enough people have now
 told of their dismay that the soft keys no longer work, answers answers answers please !!!</p>

            This must be a new bug. I cannot believe that Nokia think that the buttons should behave like this. Even if I leave the brightness on automatic, you can only see the lights on the buttons in very bright surroundings - with the lights off, you cannot see
 the buttons at all. Come on Nokia, sort this one out quick.

<p>Exactly. Using my Lumia 800 in the day is fine on any brightness is fine as the soft keys reflect well in daylight, however at night if I want to use medium or high brightness I'm out of luck now if the keys turn off completly. The screen light isn't going
 to light them up as there's no natural light for them to reflect off! Granted I mostly do use automatic brightness, but on occasion I do use manual brightness settings.<br />
<br />
The only reason I can see for this change (if it was planned) is power saving. Which OK fine, but this should be make as additional settings options, not forced (If it was planned that is). Nokia have definitely changed something though. If you go to the Lights
 test on the Diagnostics and set the backlight intensity to anything greater than 4, the soft keys will go off completly. I would say that's a firmware change plain and simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke to a Nokia Suport representative and he seemed surpsied when I told him the Lights test with a backlight greater than 4 turns the soft keys off completly. Nokia need to sort this out!</p>

<p>no they will not, the lumia is set to automatic brightness as default, the soft keys do not light up after the update, it is a clear bug and it needs fixing, before the update the work, after the update they do not light up, auto brightness is on and always
 has been</p>

<p>Emm, tragic. Right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, yes it is an inconvenience however if you set your phone to Automatic brightness, you'll find that it's not as bad as it looks unless you're using a screen protector on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I don't mean to presume, do most of you use your phone primarily at night?</p>

<p>I don't think were all sitting in dark rooms, and yes while automatic brightness works fine, its just a bit of hassle now we can't use medium or high brightness levels in certain scenario's. When you buy a phone you expect the fundamental features to work
 right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case Nokia just broke one that was working fine prior to this infamous 8106 firmware update. And just to confirm every angle, I restored my phone to the previous firmware revision, checked soft keys worked (They do), upgraded again, hello broken
 brightness settings. Makes you wonder how extensively this was tested. I mean the first thing I did after I saw the soft keys going screwy was to use the BUILT IN diagnostics tool and run the lights test. Doesn't take much effort really...</p>

            OMG... after a terrible 1st handset, endless phone calls to t-mobile and Nokia... I got a replacement last week... Battery still average, sound horrendous... And now... This! Awful 'automatic' light sensing.. In low light the screen is ridiculously low
 and if you don't use auto... NO soft keys at all. What a disaster. Sorry Nokia, it's over, game over...this is NOT the amazing every day... Other than amazingly bad.

<h2>            Outlook meeting reminders and Communicator IM&#39;s do not appear on top of other programs. </h2>
                    Meeting reminders appear on the desktop, but not on the very top of other screens. Instant messages never appear on the desktop, only on the task bar. I selected the option "Always on top", but it had no effect.

            Outlook's reminders cannot be configured to appear on top of other windows.&nbsp; That would cause your focus to be yanked away from what you're doing and you could find yourself dismissing reminders inadvertently.

            Interesting, the reminder might distract you from what you're doing and cause you to actually go to the meeting you need to attend.&nbsp; I hate meetings, but I hate missing them even more.&nbsp; I've missed 5 since I upgraded to Win 7.&nbsp; Maybe my boss will fire
 me, and I won't have to worry about meetings.

            I miss the flashing task bar handle because I have 2 monitors and I may not be working on that monitor.&nbsp; I too have been late to meetings because of this change of behavior.&nbsp; Also, the transparency of the task bar leads you to not focus on colors.

<p>I have been forced onto Windows 7 at my new company and have not been having a good experience with the calendar and notification functioning.&nbsp; While the popups do blink in the task bar, that is not where my focus is while working.&nbsp; I have been late and
 / or have missed meetings because of this ridiculous 'enhancement'.&nbsp; Seriously?...&nbsp; Microsoft, come on. There needs to be an option to over ride the default 'no focus' functionality and allow the user to choose to have the window pop up and take focus over
 other desktop apps.</p>
<p>My backup plan has been to use my personal google calendar to double the meetings up in and then have my Android phone notify me when the meeting is coming up.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to do this Microsoft!</p>
<p>Oh how I wish I could dual boot my work computer into my native linux environment.</p>

<p>I only have one monitor and I still miss the reminders, especially when the sound is muted. I use photo backgrounds and I just don't notice the task bar flashing (It's pretty small on 1920*1200 and is mixed in with 11 or 12 other icons down there. I also
 don't notice the icon flashing when an app is requesting admin&nbsp;privileges. This really is a usability howler.</p>
<p>As for the native linux environment, download Sun Virtual Box and run virtual linux under windows 7. It works a treat.</p>

            I disagree with this.&nbsp; Having meeting reminders "popup" is very helpful.&nbsp; A blinking icon in the task bar is not enough.

    <title>Dates changing on sync&#39;d notes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dates changing on sync&#39;d notes</h2>
                    Scenario - I create a note on my iPhone or iPad; note doesn't sync into my OneNote notebooks on my PC for a VERY long time (in one case two months before this one particular note appeared) when the note does appear in my Unfiled Notes on my PC it is bold
 to alert that it's a new note (this is good) however when I open the note I find the date &amp; time of the note is the current date &amp; time that it finally "popped" into my PC's version of OneNote, not the original date &amp; time the note was created on the mobile
 device.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One of the notes I was able to open it on the mobile device quickly enough to see the original date &amp; time and "correct" the copy on the PC version. &nbsp;The other note synced back to the mobile device with the new date &amp; time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really, really, really need my notes to maintain their original date &amp; times. &nbsp;I frequently use my iPad when meeting with clients and to have the note change when it syncs into the PC version is NOT good. &nbsp;Now suddenly their order has a whole new date
 and doesn't reflect when they really placed the order with me.</div>

<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, appears to.&nbsp; Have not seen a note pop into iPad or iPhone with a date different than the created on the PC date.</p>
<p><br />
Are you experiencing this issue for all the OneNote notebooks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't know for sure&nbsp;- have only actually seen it with "unfiled notes"; will check and start watching&nbsp;all other notebooks closely.&nbsp; Of the two most recents notes to exhibit this behavior; one was created on 8Mar12 and synced into PC on &amp; with a 22Mar12
 date; the other was created on 12Jan12, again it sync'd in with a 22Mar12 date; I do see a couple of other notes that have recently synced into other sections of the "Personal (Web)" folder - they both have the correct date stamp.</p>
<p><br />
Back up and delete all the OneNote notebooks from the device as well from the PC/SkyDrive.
<span>&nbsp;</span>And then add a test file and try syncing and verify the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Eeyore voice&gt;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; When I get back to my home connection I can.&nbsp; Too much data to&nbsp;want to download/re-upload over the mifi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any kind of a sync log file I should keep an eye on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would expect some of the large delay in a note getting sync'd from the&nbsp;mobile device to the PC would be the (mentioned elsewhere in the forums) that the last note (and therefore usually,&nbsp;the "open" note) doesn't sync until you either create another note
 or move to display a different note or if I closed the app on the mobile device before it had had sufficient time to complete.&nbsp; I have 13 notebooks in addition to the Personal Web notebook.&nbsp; I'm not overly worried about the delay for the item to sync in, I'm
 concerned about the mutable timestamp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Did you check with Apple support on this issue? If not, I suggest you to do that as well. Haven't really come&nbsp; across this issue. Something could be with OneNote app/slow 3G connection or the SkyDrive server through which it syncs. Have you installed all
 the updates on the IPhone? <br />
How about removing and re-installing the OneNote app and checking.<br />
<br />
OneNote will only sync if you have told it to do so or enabled automatic syncing. Set your sync preferences in the original notebook: click the green "Sync" icon next to your notebook title in the notebook list, and then choose "Sync automatically whenever
 there are changes" in the dialog box that appears. If you have not previously set up synching on the notebook, choose "Share" under the "File" menu and follow the on-screen instructions to set syncing and your preferences and check the result.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps<br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; in fact iOS 5.1 update just ran earlier this week.&nbsp; I have also updated all apps regularly whenever updates are available so whenever the last updates for the OneNote app was released then it would have updated then as well (within a few
 days).</p>
<p><br />
How about removing and re-installing the OneNote app and checking.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will try that.&nbsp; I have been watching the other notebooks on the phone&nbsp;carefully since my original post in order to answer Daniel's question.&nbsp; None of the other notebooks seem to have the wrong date stamp issue on sync, just the&nbsp;personal web unfiled
 notes when a note was created on the iOS device side.&nbsp; I have, however, noticed that the notes created on the full client do not sync into the app on the iOS device until I open that particular notebook, and then that section.&nbsp; (For example I have a notebook
 that has 6 sections; each section has a varying&nbsp;number of notes.&nbsp; When I open a section on the phone it has however many notes were in that section the last time I looked at that section from the phone.&nbsp; New note titles will pop in very quickly; the actual
 content of the new notes takes a while to populate.&nbsp; Not sure if&nbsp;this is the expected behavior or not?&nbsp; I could see for space-saving on the mobile device not populating content until&nbsp;it was "requested" by the user&nbsp;trying to view that note.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I leave the note and go back all the way back to the Home screen and click on the gears the sync status is "sync now" so it doesn't appear to think it's currently syncing.&nbsp; I'll post back after removing the app &amp; re-installing, re-syncing and
 monitoring and let you know what happens.</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All my notebooks are setup to sync.&nbsp; Checking the sync status on the full client, all the notesbooks have "Up to date.&nbsp; Last sync &lt;time&gt;" and the time stamp is within the last few miutes.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps<br />

<h2>            Retention Policy and In place Hold</h2>
                    Previously when I created a rentention policy for Skype for Business content for a user from security and compliance, then in-place-hold would get activated for that user. But it is not more the case: Thought I activated retention policy for Skype for
 Business content for a user, this user In-Place-Hold is empty. Can you please tell when this behavior changed?&nbsp;

<p>Hi sameerkattel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. For further help, may I know the detailed steps or information about “I created a retention policy for Skype for Business content for a user from security and compliance”?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, In place hold and retention policy do not effect each other and they have no direct relationship. Retention policy works for “delete”, “move”, “archive” for the messages you want. An In-Place Hold preserves all mailbox content, including deleted
 items and original versions of modified items. All such mailbox items are returned in an In-Place eDiscovery search. When you place an In-Place Hold on a user's mailbox on, the contents in the corresponding archive mailbox (if it's enabled) are also placed
 on hold, and returned in a eDiscovery search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<h2>            Full address plotting in Excel w&#47;Bing Maps</h2>
                    <p>OK, I've learned how to plot data on a Bing map in Excel 2013 for a city, but I need it down to the street level. Is this possible?</p>
<p><br />
Here is the project. We are tracking donations to an organization by church and want to see what part of the county donations are coming from. Ideally, larger circles would represent larger donations, but that is secondary. The primary goal is to generate a
 map of the county with dots showing where the donating churches are located.</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Can I use Windows Phone 10 Technical Preview on my Nokia Lumia 630 Dual sim</h2>
                    Hello everyone, Don't mind but I request you to read my this problem carefully and answer after you read it. I have a Nokia Lumia 630 Dual Sim phone that runs on the latest stable version i.e., windows phone 8.1 update. This is my only windows phone. But
 I backup it regularly. Just saw that the stable version of windows phone 10 is still late to release. So, just wondering if I could install the Windows Phone10 Technical Preview on my this phone. So, I installed the windows insider app from the store and registered
 on the insider program. I was searching for risks of it from December 2015. Finally I came to know that my phone will be slow down, some apps may not work. But still I agreed to proceed. But stuck when I saw that my phone may stop working permanently Which
 I saw on the instruction on the windows insider app. So, I am asking is it safe to do. Can I get back to my windows phone 8.1 if problem occurs. Can you tell me that I won't have to say goodbye to my this phone. I have used

            <p>Well, you know there are no guarantees, but millions are running previews on formerly WP8 devices and many on Win 10 ones. I good many of them have used the Recovery Tool to successfully revert to what their devices came with, or what is current. I have
 run previews on 520s, 635s, 1020s, 920s and reverted most at least once. I am running the latest preview on my 950XL. I think you will be fine. I might suggest staying on the slow ring, or even the new preview ring, as those builds are more stable, though
 some fixes may not have made it there yet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do kick off a backup before updating so you&nbsp; have a WP8 one to restore from if you need to revert to it.

            <p>Thank you for your reply, I want to tell you that I know all the good and bad effects of the Windows phone 10 Technical Preview I know that I can also fix it and revert back to windows phone 8.1 but I am just asking about the part where it is written that
 your phone may stop working permanently. Can't I recover that portion too with the recovery tool?</p>
<p>Another thing I want to ask is I found many things about the slow and the fast ring. But in my phone I found another ring named insider release preview. Can you tell me something about that?.</p>
<p>And which among the three is the most stable for windows phone 10 Technical Preview.</p>

                    Skype puts through a monthly charge on 2 of my credit cards and I have tried in vain to stop one. I have not succeeded and have been paying on each card&nbsp; for many months now. I cancelled one of the cards to try to end one payment but the&nbsp; charge is still
 going through. I was told I had to get skype to stop putting a charge through. Any suggestions would be very welcome.

            You can't create drop down list in Excel for ipad. This is a feature which is still not supported. But if you have already created a drop down list on PC/Mac and open in iPad, that would work.

    <title>Windows 10 look and feel thoughts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> world_d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 look and feel thoughts</h2>
                    <p>First off I want to start by saying I've run Windows 8/8.1 from the beginning on all my machines. With Windows 8 I didn't miss the start menu and quickly understood the advantages and the short cuts.&nbsp;Also working&nbsp;for&nbsp;a large software company I personally
 made sure that we created a Windows 8 app and a Windows 8 Phone app. Oh yea,&nbsp;early adopter of the&nbsp;Windows 8&nbsp;phone too which I still absolutely love. I'm not&nbsp;saying everything was rosy. I still have&nbsp;Win App API complaints which I voiced on another thread years
 ago and still have the same complaint all thought I do understand why they do what they do. There are so many great features in Windows 8/8.1/10. Being able to log in once from any device and access the same information, desktop and One Drive. Now I can't
 live with out these features. Home, office, phone, surface. I love it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second the Windows 10 preview launched it was loaded on my laptop and surface. Not even VM. Yes it crashes a lot. It's a tech preview. Of course it does.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;demoed some bleeding edge code on a bleeding edge OS to a customer. By bleeding I mean cut your&nbsp;wrist bleeding. It's a tech preview I knew better.&nbsp;After that tragedy,&nbsp;I had to get ready for our yearly conference&nbsp;which I planed on using Windows 10 for but
 instead&nbsp;decided to reload my laptop with Windows 7.... I have barely touched&nbsp;Windows 7 in years. Why Windows 7. The start menu. I didn't realize that missed it and how much better it is to use till Windows 10. In Windows 10, I love the new start menu. Incorporating
 the live tiles with the basic Win 7 start menu ready extend it functionally and make it far easier and efficient&nbsp;to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where I realized the difference and it's really just purely visual, but that is a lot. It isn't just the start menu. I miss the look and feel of Windows 7. The features in Windows 7 don't even compare with the new versions of Windows but why is it
 that&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;still feel like Windows 3.1. Hardware has only gotten better. Even the GPU onboard of the newer&nbsp;CPUs is better than a lot of video cards these days however Win forms, shadowing all of the visuals that made Windows 7, well for lack of a better
 word, pretty. They are all gone.&nbsp;Win 8 to 10 are all about WPF and that's ok,&nbsp;but even WPF looks and feels better on Windows 7. This is where the new OSs fail. I know that the difference in the way WPF and Win forms appear has been highlighted on more than
 a few threads. But I think it's beyond that. The whole presentation in Windows 10 is just lacking.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, would I personally&nbsp;go back to Windows 7 on all machines&nbsp;because of the visual short comings of Windows 10. No, of course not. The new features are far to valuable.&nbsp;But I'll never demo anything with dialogs, forms and even WPF forms on anything other
 than Windows 7 again.&nbsp;A 6 year old feature lacking&nbsp;OS that just looks&nbsp;more refined&nbsp;than the&nbsp;current OSs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just some thoughts. Some people might not agree with me. </p>

            <p>Well... I certainly do not share your love of the Win 7 interface. The rounded corners represented a throw-back to the old CRT screens and the pop-up dialogs that always seemed to represent a competition among developers to get the most information in the
 smallest possible space... I am just glad to see them going away. The ever increasing need for screen real-estate had just gotten out of hand. One task, one screen on a monitor that can be read with out moving your head is a much more usable, understandable
 interface. It is still Windows with all of the inherent multi-tasking power, the window's borders are now the bezel of your monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Win 8 interface made long strides in the usability of the PC and, finally, a&nbsp;move out of the hobbyist phase - realizing that it is now a tool more focused on the work done in the LoB applications than the PC itself. It has reduced week long training
 sessions to a few seconds of instruction - "Press the Windows key and start typing the name of the program or document you want to use..."&nbsp;Since the interface is largely controlled from the keyboard, mouse problems are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add to it that every thing looks the same (though controlled differently)&nbsp;on all&nbsp;the devices&nbsp;we require employees to use and all training becomes a breeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The visible parts of the PC are now just the monitor and the keyboard, however, the power of todays PC hardware is certainly not wasted. It is simply used in the applications that run on the PC not in support of the PC itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The set and forget capabilities of the new OS's are important also. Again, it is reduced to simple instructions "Log in when you&nbsp;sit down,&nbsp;log out when you leave - The PC and the IT department have taken care of everything else for you."&nbsp;The PC is configured,
 installed at the desk and that is it. The user does not even concern themselves with how to turn it on or off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should also be noted that the simple instructions and training steps are now the same, whether the employee is on real-estate provided by us or a thousand miles away in their own home or office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: I do see the current trend back to a start menu a terrible waste of time.</p>

                    I purchased OST2 to convert my .ost to .pst so I could recover my calendar.

<p><strong><span>Hi unevendesire,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><span>I will suggest you to refer to the below mentioned link and check if this helps -</span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/itprovistaie/thread/3248d727-9067-42c7-a3a2-a4e00870f5f0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/itprovistaie/thread/3248d727-9067-42c7-a3a2-a4e00870f5f0/</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists I would suggest you to perform the below mentioned steps and then check -<br />
</span></span><span><strong><span>Method 1:
<br />
Perform a SFC Scan</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>sfc /scannow&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:<br />

<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please review the following:</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

                    I've always used this for years to go straight to explorer ie "My Computer/This PC". &nbsp;So why does this shortcut take me to recently open/used and even deleted items now. I'm sure I can acclimate myself to the extra click required over on the left however
 that defeats the purpose of the shortcut.&nbsp;

            <p>The items listed in the home folder vary based on the settings in Taskbar and Start menu Properties. If you have it set to display recently opened item/programs from the start menu, it will in fact display said items including anything in the recycle bin.&nbsp;<span>Seems
 a bit strange to me, hopefully that changes with other builds.</span></p>

<h2>            Sync calendar&#47;contacts with non-EAS applications &#47; provide CalDAV and CardDAV support</h2>
                    Hi, I have some applications for contacts and calendar which do not support Exchange Active Sync.<br />
I would like to two-way-sync them with my Hotmail/Outlook.com Calendar / Contacts anyway (i.e. Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, FRITZ!Box(IP phone) address book, ...).<br />
<br />
Do you support syncing them with CalDAV/CardDAV? If not, it would be great if you would consider supporting it or a comparable protocol in the future. It would be really helpful and make me switch from Google to Hotmail.<br />
<br />
Exchange Active Sync is great for syncing outlook.com with mobile devices, but sadly, I did not find a good desktop application (with more features than Windows Live Mail) for syncing my calendar/contacts with outlook.com using this proctocol.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 No Longer Activated - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 No Longer Activated</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new laptop that had Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 installed on it. Having had used Word and Excel numerous times, I had no issues until I changed my computer's login settings from Administrator (Local) to my Microsoft account.
 I attempted to use Word while logged in to my Microsoft account (on the computer, not in the software) and was met with a "Enter your product key" popup. I figured this might be an issue because I changed my computer's account settings. However, after switching
 back to Administrator, I am met with the same issue. Because I purchased this laptop with the software already installed, I do not have a physical copy with a product key. What can be done and what might be the issue?</p>

            I've never heard of any PC maker providing Office 2016 Pro Plus pre-installed, was this a new PC or a second user one?&nbsp;<br />

<p>My apologies, Palcouk. It wasn't from a manufacturer and may have just been refurbished (though there was no mention of this) but looks and feels brand new. I got it on eBay. It's an HP Elitebook Folio 9480M i7 vPro. Like I said though, the software was
 working just fine, activated and all. It stopped working almost immediately after I changed the account I log in to the laptop with. The other thing is this was preloaded with Windows 8 Pro with a link to update to Windows 10 Pro. Yet still, even after THAT
 update, the software worked fine. I'm at a loss for an explanation. I hope this can be reversed before December 21st because now there is a deadline for its use. -_-</p>

            I could try contacting the seller. I imagine he has the activation keys logged somewhere.<br />
