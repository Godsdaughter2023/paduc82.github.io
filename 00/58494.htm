<h2>            My Win 7 desktop won&#39;t load properly.</h2>
                    I turned my desktop PC on today and it wouldn't load the desktop properly. For the last few days it had been extremely slow to boot, to login, and to load the desktop, but now the taskbar and icons won't load properly at all. They keep popping up and disappearing.
 I can get to the security screen (Ctrl+Alt+Delete) just fine and there are no problems with it, but windows explorer crashed at least three times and WerFault keeps opening up 10+ of itself, but I can only see it doing that because I have the Task Manager
 open. There's no problems with response time at the moment beyond the fact that I can only interact with the Task Manager.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It's also been having some difficulties identifying my OS on boot-up for the last month or so. It will intermittently not recognize my OS and I'll have to re-start the computer to fix that.<br />
<br />
I had used Malware Bites to scan and clear out viruses two days ago, thinking that it may have been slow due to a virus. By the time it was done checking everything it was 6pm yesterday. This includes the time it took to check the disk after the first restart.
 (One of the disks needed to be checked for consistency.) After that was done and I restarted again, the computer ran mostly fine. It was slow to boot up again, but at least still worked. I'm going re-start it once I post this to see if that helps, but I still
 need to make sure this doesn't happen again.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what I can do? <br />
<br />
I'm using my laptop to ask about all of this. <br />
(Sorry for the rambling manner in which this is written.)

            When I tried to boot it back up some hours after I posted this it went to the boot-repair thing. Having it do that (revert my PC to a previous version) fixed the problems.<br />
(Though, I had to figure out that the default USB ports for the keyboard and mouse are disabled in it for whatever reason.)<br />
I have no clue as to what could have caused this still, though. However, it definitely started after installing a Windows update that was marked as important. It's saying I have yet more updates to install, so if it does this again after installing them then
 I'm gong to blame them.

    <title>Unable to Proceed from Lock Screen without Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to Proceed from Lock Screen without Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Device: Surface Pro 4</p>
<p>Usually just a mouse click or a swipe will undo the Windows Lock Screen and move on to the Windows Log-in. I had tried password (Microsoft Account), PIN and Hello for signing in and all are working fine.<br />
</p>
<p>BUT for the first time on this device today, I used the Win + L shortcut keys to lock my workstation. Thereafter, whenever I power on or restart my PC, I get this message on my Lock Screen "Press and hold the Windows button, and then press the power button
 to unlock. (Or you can unlock by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete.)". I can no longer just click or swipe the Lock Screen away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The first suggested method of unlocking could not work at all.</p>
<p>2. Only Ctrl+Alt+Delete can unlock this screen, </p>
<p>3. but even so, either method means I MUST have a keyboard. </p>
<p>3. There are no on-screen keyboard or ease of access icons for me to touch or click to work around not having a physical keyboard attached. I had tried this (restart my PC) without my surface type cover and there is absolutely NO WAY to get out of the lock
 screen without re-attaching my type cover. For a device that is designed to also function fully as a tablet, this is a serious show-stopper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I undo this and get back to the good old single click or swipe way of getting out of the Lock Screen? I do not wish to disable Lock Screen entirely, I am fine with the Lock Screen as long as the simple way of unlocking (using mouse click or swipe)
 is possible again.</p>

            <p>Hi Petrus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggested creating a new account in order to identify if there are any corruption with the user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any third party security software installed in the computer, I would suggest you to temporarily disable it and check if the option is still greyed out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><em>Disclaimer: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software.
 If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.&nbsp;
</em></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
<br />
</span>Meanwhile, try the steps below to disable Security logon through Local Security Policy and check if it works:</p>
<p>1. Type <strong>Local Security Policy </strong>in the search bar and open it.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expand <strong>Local Policies</strong>&nbsp;in the left pane and click <strong>
Security Options</strong> </p>
<p>3. On the right pane of Security Options, locate <strong>Interactive Logon: Do not required CTRL+ALT+DEL</strong> and double click on it.</p>
<p>4. Check "<strong>disabled</strong>" and click "<strong>ok</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now check if the issue persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted and I apologize for the misinformation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to know that the issue is resolved. We appreciate your effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your query, it looks like the secure logon somehow got enabled during the upgrade to Windows 10. Hereafter, since you have already disabled it, you can definitely go ahead and make use of the shortcut key. The secure logon will not be enabled
 unless you manually change it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any Windows related queries in the future, do let us know. We will be glad to help.</p>

    <title>Update to the Witcher 3&#58; not installing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psych3delicbull  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update to the Witcher 3&#58; not installing</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to install the most recent update for The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt for the past two days. I have done many troubleshooting techniques and cannot seem to be able to download the update. Troubleshooting techniques I have done:</p>
<p>1. Restarting the console.</p>
<p>2. Hard shutdown of the console (hold power button for 10 seconds or until the console turns off) and start again.</p>
<p>3. Taking the disc out and putting it back in.</p>
<p>4. Switching between a wireless and wired internet connection. Both of these for me are moderate strength, so I would expect not the fastest of downloads. But I would still expect it to begin to download.</p>
<p>5. Uninstalling, then reinstalling the game while offline. Then try to download the update again.</p>
<p>Nothing has worked. I keep getting the same response with the update. It says "Updating 0%" like it's going to update, then after a few minutes, or in some cases a couple of hours, it says "Installation Stopped". Then I will try a troubleshooting technique
 and begin to download the update again and will still get the same result. I have 58 GB free space available for it, and the update is size 18 GB so I know that storage is not the issue. Any suggestions would be wonderful. The Support Chat has not been overly
 beneficial.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help or suggestions.</p>

            Hi Jippe-Jim
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with the error you are getting.
<br />
<br />I would recommend reset Windows 10 keeping your files and apps . . . 
<br />
<br />To do this
<br />1.	 Start your PC as Windows attempts to load and the spinning dots appear, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds.  This is known as a Hard Shut Down
<br />(Do this twice )
<br />2.	Turn on your computer for the 3rd time and it should come up in the Recovery Environment
<br />3.	You will be prompted for System Repair/Safe Mode/Command Prompt
<br />4.	Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows 
<br />5.	If this is unsuccessful, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps,
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            Hi  Jippe-Jim
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately that error is not a very good one.
<br />Normally means you will have to rebuild your PC.
<br />Hopefully you can do a custom install.
<br />This will take your existing windows folder and convert it to windows.old.
<br />Then when you get it built and login you can check your c drive for that folder and look for your old user folder and retrieve your files.
<br />See link by Andre on how to do this.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There is a chance that powering off your PC, then unplugging it to install the power supply is what caused your problem...<br />
<br />
Due to a Feature called Fast Startup, doing this is almost equivalent to pulling the plug with the machine running...<br />
<br />
Before trying a System Restore, or anything drastic, try doing a "Startup Repair" on the same screen Andre mentions... Might try a couple of times...<br />
<br />
You might also try the Command Prompt with these commands...<br />
<br />
<br />
BOOTREC /FIXMBR, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
BTW... Is your new GPU plugged in ?&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot that a couple of times...

<h2>            Rescue Options for Windows XP Service Pack 3</h2>
                    Hi everyone!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an older computer I use every day for "grunt work" so to speak...Operating system is Windows XP, and I was wondering if I could make a complete system &amp; all files restore disk, using a 32 GB flash drive. &nbsp;I'm having trouble with my DVD drive and
 if something happens, I wouldn't be able to do a system restore with the disk I now have made with Symantec Ghost. &nbsp;Plus, it would be a restore from over 10 years ago!...it would take me forever to get back to this point with all the programs I have on it,
 and some aren't even available anymore. &nbsp;It's a 80 GB hard drive, with 49 GB of free space...can anyone help with this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div><br />

            A popular third party program folks seem to like is from Acronis and they have a free try/buy version that you can purchase later if you like it.<br />
<br />
With the Acronis (free 30 day trial) you backup, you can make a bootable CD or bootable USB and use that in the event of a disaster.&nbsp; If/when you like it, at the time of this writing the cost for the full version was a mere $49.99.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/trueimage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/trueimage/</a><br />
<br />
There are many other options if you do a little Googling.&nbsp; Thank goodness Al Gore invented the Internet.<br />
<br />
Here are some products that other forum users suggest might be appealing.&nbsp; Use Google to find them and read about their features, and capabilities.&nbsp; Some have free versions or you can purchase them to get more features:<br />
<br />
If you have or purchase a Western Digital drive, you can get a version of Acronis True Image free from WD:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.wdc.com/product/downloaddetail.asp?swid=119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.wdc.com/product/downloaddetail.asp?swid=119</a><br />
<br />
Or you can obtain backup and cloning software separately (this is not a comprehensive list and is no particular order; some are free, others not):<br />
<br />
Marcium Reflect (free version)<br />
Acronis True Image Home&nbsp; (free trial version)<br />
EaseUS ToDo Backup (free version)<br />
Paragon Drive Copy&nbsp; or Partition Manager Personal<br />
Paragon Backup and Recovery (free version)<br />
Casper<br />
Norton Ghost&nbsp; (discontinued)<br />
<br />
Some disk cloning software ideas for you to Google:<br />
<br />
XXClone<br />
Marcium Reflect (Free Version)<br />
DriveImageXML<br />
Acronis True Image Home 11<br />
EaseUS ToDo Backup (free version)<br />
Paragon Drive Copy&nbsp; or Partition Manager Personal<br />
Paragon Backup and Recovery (free version)<br />
Casper<br />
Norton Ghost&nbsp; (discontinued)<br />
Clonezilla<br />
<br />
Whatever method you choose, it is prudent to test your method from end to end to be sure it works.<br />
<br />
You can do something like create a temporary folder somewhere on your system and copy a bunch of files into it, perform your backup, then delete the temporary folder and be sure that you can recover it from your backup.<br />
<br />
The day you need your backup/restore process to work is not the day to find out it doesn't work.

<div><br />
<div>Thank-you for your quick reply! &nbsp;It was very informative and I appreciate all the related material too!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll check out all of them, and decide where to go from there, but will probably use the one you covered first...Acronis.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was looking through my Windows XP operating system last night, and can't even seem to find where you go to create a rescue disk!...It's easy on my new laptop with Windows 8, although there's not much else I like about W 8 !! &nbsp;It's still quite a transition
 from W XP, without ever using Vista or W 7 either...so far I don't much care for it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again!</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I don't think there is a good way built in to XP so some manufacturers have programs you can use to make some sort of recovery CDs.&nbsp; Many manufacturers don't even ship you an XP installation CD or your system make not even have a CD/DVD drive.&nbsp; So what
 are you going to do?<br />
<br />
If you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is not the same Service Pack as your installed SP (most people don't), you will not be doing a Repair install of your XP either.&nbsp; if you have an older XP CD, you can make a SP3 installation CD through a
 process called slipstreaming&nbsp; and that's a good thing to have (but won't help you all of the time).<br />
<br />
I used to like making bootable XP Recovery Console CDs (no XP media required) but sometimes you just can't do what you want or need to do and I started liking Hiren's Boot CD better since it seems to work all the time and not just some of the time.<br />
<br />
One day I wrote down some of the reasons why I switched:<br />
<br />
The bootable XP Recovery Console CD made from xp_rec_con.iso is okay for some things but it may not work well on some systems - especially those with SATA hard drives.&nbsp; That is because it will not contain any SATA drivers and you might be able to boot on it,
 but you may not be able to maneuver and run even simple commands.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
A good sign is that when you boot on the CD instead of being in the C:\WINDOWS folder where you need to be, you will see that you are in the C:\ folder (wrong) and when you enter commands you may see things like:<br />
<br />
enumeration error<br />
Access denied (or something similar) <br />
<br />
If you try to run bootcfg /rebuild you might see:<br />
<br />
Error:&nbsp; Failed to successfully scan disks for Windows installations.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This error may be caused by a corrupt file system, which would prevent Bootcfg from&nbsp;&nbsp; successfully scanning.&nbsp; Use chkdsk to detect any disk errors.<br />
Note: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This operation must complete successfully in order for the /add or /rebuild commands to be utilized.<br />
<br />
These are all signs of a system with a SATA drive and the Recovery Console won't help you much since there are no native SATA drivers built in so it can't understand the HDD interface.<br />
<br />
You might be able to get it to behave by fidgeting with the system BIOS to temporarily change the HDD interface to something other than SATA, do what you have to do and then remember to change it back when you are done.&nbsp; Even if you use a genuine bootable XP
 installation CD to get into the Recovery Console, you still might run into these problems (no natively built in SATA drivers) so it just can't understand the HDD.<br />
<br />
Another problem is that unless you have previously tweaked your system registry to automatically log you in to the Recovery Console, sometimes folks can't get past the prompt for Administrator password when using Recovery Console no matter how hard they try.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 That can be a problem with or without SATA drives.<br />
<br />
Unless you have previously tweaked your registry, you will not be able to access a floppy, CD, USB thumb drive or any of your personal folders from the RC either and you will not be able to get into your personal folders like My Documents, etc.&nbsp; You can only
 get into the Windows folders that are allowed and that ain't many - mostly just the stuff under the C:\WINDOWS folder and C:\<br />
<br />
With those variables in the equation, I started to like the Hiren's Boot CD better since is handles SATA drives just fine and doesn't prompt for a password.&nbsp; It also brings up a Windowsy looking desktop that people feel more comfortable using instead of the
 RC command line interface.&nbsp; They are already used to "exploring" folders and files and copying and pasting things.<br />
<br />
Hiren's has many good built in tools too - like a Registry Restore Wizard that lets you roll back your registry (just the registry) to a previous date based on the System Restore points already on your system.&nbsp; Just a few clicks and you're done.&nbsp; It is much
 simpler than trying to do that from the Recovery Console command line interface where you can easily make mistakes.<br />
<br />
If you need to edit your boot.ini file, there is a text editor built in, etc.&nbsp; Supposedly, you can even get on the Internet if you need to but so far when fixing things, I never need to so I haven't tried that part out.<br />
<br />
For most problems, people just need to run a chkdsk with error correction, maybe replace a file they have accidentally deleted or perhaps they want to copy all their personal files off to some external USB drive and all that is easy using Hiren's.&nbsp; There are
 lots of other tools on that CD too and I have not used them all but they are fun to look at.<br />
<br />
So if somebody has a problem using the Recovery Console or it doesn't like their commands, or they can't get past the Admin password prompt or they just need to replace a file or two, I like Hiren's better since it always seems to work no matter what the environment.&nbsp;
 Fewer questions to ask, fewer 'I'm not sure' replies to wonder about, not so many suggestions that "might work" or suggestions that begin with the word 'try' and less back and forth messaging.<br />
<br />
For systems that have no CD/DVD drive, a Recovery Console CD is not going to do you much good either.&nbsp; Some folks will say to go out and buy an external CD/DVD drive, but you can take the Hiren's and make a bootable USB thumb drive too.&nbsp; I could never get that
 to work well with xp_rec_con.iso so I&nbsp; gave up trying to figure it out - too many steps.<br />
<br />
I say:&nbsp; You <i>might </i>be able to do what you need to do with the Recovery Console, but you will
<i>always </i>be able to do what you need to do with Hiren's.&nbsp; I do like to have both though (old fashioned I guess).<br />
<br />
Go ahead and make one and check it out - you don't have to "do" anything...&nbsp; just boot on it and poke around.&nbsp; If you build the Hiren's CD and check it out you will probably find it very useful.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So if somebody just needs to run a chkdsk with error correction, here is what I tell them...&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are not sure what you have for bootable media, from a working system, make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD, boot on that into the Mini XP mode and run the chkdsk from there.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install anything from UniBlue or the Ask toolbar (never install the ASK toolbar for anything).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Plug-and-play is only possible if the device manufacturer supplied Microsoft with a driver for their device. If they didn't do that, you have to get the driver directly from the manufacturer.

            <p>Hello Alejandro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I suspect that the problem lies with the User Profile or with&nbsp;system files. Suggest you&nbsp;to try with the below mentioned troubleshooting steps and see if they sort out the&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These steps will repair any missing or corrupted system files,, if they causing any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Use System File Checker to repair damaged Windows files</strong></p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool to repair damaged Windows files. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key.</li><li>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly</li></ol>
<p>For more information about the System File Checker tool, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Run the DISM tool </strong></p>
<p>If the problem continues, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix corruption errors. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key</li><li>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly.</li></ol>
<p><span><strong>Important:</strong> </span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair
 source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong></span>Replace the C:\RepairSource\Windows placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Error &#34;This app can&#39;t open&#34; followed by Blank Store Page.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I recently upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, from Windows 7 Professional, and I would very much like to try the new Edge browser.
<br />
However, whenever I run the Edge browser, this comes up.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2287080-2b0c-4a98-9f81-a5e4d3c83ea7" /><br />
<br />
Which doesn't make sense- because Microsoft Edge isn't even on the Windows Store, and when I click the link to go "purchase the full app" it takes me to this.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/128dfea0-52fb-4dd7-ae0a-ba46f52d68ae" /><br />
<br />
Does anyone have and Idea what I can do to fix this?<br />
<br />
A couple more details: My Windows 10 Pro in indeed activated, and all other applications seem to be working just fine.
<br />
I did notice that whenever Windows 10 asks me for feedback- and I click the button to give it, it does the same thing with the Feedback app.<br />
<br />
Edit: I also noticed that I can't used the Contact Support App. Same issue.<br />

<h2>            Start Menu</h2>
                    I've pinned several websites on my start menu previously, but now either I forgot how to or what I think I remember, is not working (right click on site, select pin to start) or showing up when I right click. Is this the wrong way of attempting this? If
 so, what are the correct steps?

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on <strong>
Start</strong> button.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on <strong>
Command Prompt</strong> (Admin) option which will let you run <strong>'Run as administrator</strong>’.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Command Prompt Window pops up.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type:&nbsp; SFC&nbsp;/SCANNOW and hit Enter.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:
</strong>Try the following steps to run <strong>DISM</strong> scan to check and restore system file corruption:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

In command prompt, type the following commands and press Enter after each command:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>

<h2>            Start screen apps turn grey, and go back to start</h2>
                    when i try to play some of my win8 games like jet pack joyride or riptide GP, they just go to their loading screen for a few seconds, then the turn grey and the it just goes back to Start. I enabled all .net framework features in programs and features
 in the control panel but it doesn't work. but the games work when i put them in the short mode, like in the picture in this link&nbsp;

<div>if they work perfectly in that mode with a messed up aspect ratio, i don't see why it shouldn't work full screen</div>

            It could also be a keyboard problem so if the remap doesn't work run the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Then uninstall the keyboard driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Keyboard, then Driver tab, then Uninstall, then restart PC using mouse.

<h2>            XBOX ONE DEALS WITH GOLD AND ACHIEVEMENTS OFFLINE&#33;&#33;&#33; PLEASE READ FULL POST BEFORE COMMENTING</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all, so i recently tried to play content that i downloaded on XBOX ONE GOLD SERVICE.... OFFLINE!!! Well, i found out that when trying to play this content is completely inaccessible OFFLINE. The content wasn't GAMES WITH GOLD FREE downloads, i am completely
 fine that i can't access them OFFLINE as it is FREE CONTENT!!! Now DEALS WITH GOLD is DISCOUNTED CONTENT, which still involves a TRANSACTION COST ££££ Which means that i have PURCHASED THE CONTENT so i own said CONTENT. So, say we have a storm and the internet
 goes down and us gamer's want to play a particular game we have DOWNLOADED from DEALS WITH GOLD OFFLINE, WELL, BASICALLY WE CAN'T as this, PURCHASED CONTENT can not be played UNLESS YOU ARE SIGNED IN TO YOUR GOLD ACCOUNT. SOUNDS LIKE DRM TO ME!!!! IF YOU DON'T
 FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVE WROTE IN THIS POST, DO NOT REPLY WITH ANY STUPID REMARKS, THANK YOU!!! Oh the caps text is not me shouting i am just making things of importance stand out.</p>
<p>Oh, also, why are there no ACHIEVEMENTS OFFLINE??? What about people who have xbox one and no internet access but enjoy the achievement side to gaming. I don't want to hear, oh well most people have internet these days so why bother having access to them
 offline..... Well, you'll find out that a fair amount of states in America don't have the net as communities are to far into deserts like Texas one state that is very net thirsty let's say. Also the UK in the countryside there are lots of places with out internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's been known ever since they announced Games with Gold on the Xbox One that you would need an online connection and Gold subscription in order to play any free games you got as part of the promotion. As for achievements, I'm not sure why you can't unlock
 them offline, but my guess is it's because the only real point of having them really, is to show them off to other people; if you're not online, then there's not really much point.</p>

<p>Galactic Geek, READ THE POST PROPERLY! I said, i know that the FREE GAMES with games with gold are only rental, I KNOW, i said it in my main post if you read it!!! But, with DEALS WITH GOLD, now READ what i say "DEALS WITH GOLD, &nbsp;not, GAMES WITH GOLD", (BIG
 DIFFERENCE), Games with gold is 2 free games a month. Deals with gold is DISCOUNTED GAMES. Again i am completely fine with games for gold being rental based only as they are FREE. When it come to deals with gold, right, this is the DISCOUNTED GAMES, i believe
 that this should be content that you can play OFFLINE with no internet access due to the fact you have PURCHASED said content. So if you have a storm as i mentioned in the main post and you want to play one of those said games you downloaded at a price from
 DEALS WITH GOLD you can't access them unless you are signed in and logged online to your account. YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE DISCOUNTED GAMES OFFLINE!!!! READ IT PROPERLY PLASE, THANK YOU

<p>Well your only flaw is that you stated "recently tried to play content that i downloaded". &nbsp;How did you download them without an internet connect? &nbsp;Seems a little suspect. &nbsp;I think the same (GWG rules) might apply to DWG too. &nbsp;Since they are both benefits
 of having a Gold account maybe the XOne needs to be connected to the internet to verify you are Gold so as to continue receiving the benefits of being Gold. &nbsp;If it were not the case then I could buy 1 month of Gold (when a game I want in on DWG) receive the
 discount and then disconnect the internet and still have the benefit without being Gold. &nbsp;MIGHT I SUGGEST BOLD OR ITALICS NEXT TIME INSTEAD OF CAPS.... IT IS VERY ANNOYING.</p>

<p>You guys are really blind. If i purchase an game from deals with gold, i should be able to access it OFFLINE. The content that i download to my HDD should be accessible from the HDD without connecting to the internet, as i now own the content for purchasing
 it ONLINE, they're stopping you from having full rights and usage to the content you're purchasing as a customer. Oh CAMHAWK who even mentioned anything about downloading something without the internet!!! I said "if i download something i should be able to
 access it OFFLINE like you can on XBOX &nbsp;360 after purchasing it ONLINE" not in that exact layout but i meant it that way. Camhawk you seem to misunderstand the point i am making here as well. How in this world is anyone getting a deal with deals with gold
 discount??? MS talking here "Oh hey MS XB1 customers, here pay us a gold sub fee, then you get a discount for a game that we (MS) can still dictate the contents usage" What is wrong with someone paying a one month fee to get a game with DWG it's not like MS
 are losing out, they are gaining MONEY, 1. the customer buys a month that he/she had no intention of getting 2. MS gained sales from games that the customer's had no intention of buying at full price. Now when there gold sub runs out they can't access the
 game said customer purchased for a discount, the purchased game is locked behind a PAY WALL!!! So here is a little scenario for people that struggle to understand DWG scam, well it's equal to it. Person goes to store to buy a physical copy of a game discounted
 price, gets home, has access to it online and offline THIS IS BRILLIANT. Now, another person is online, purchases digital copy and it's discounted, internet goes down wants to play the game offline. MS, "Oh sorry what's that, you wanna play your game without
 internet access, tough, you may have bought the game from us but you sure as hell aren't playing it unless your online with our consent." Long story short this is DRM. BongKaos, why shouldn't i be able to play something i purchased online, offline???</p>

<p>I think I got an idea with what is wrong.. Example: say the OP buys a discounted game from the Deals with Gold promotion. Lets just say he downloaded Tomb Raider. He disconnects his Xbox One from the internet and goes to play his newly acquired game Tomb
 Raider offline but it wont let him play it. Why cant he play the game he bought? Am I close OP?

<h2>            Removing pre-installed Wild Tangent games</h2>
                    My laptop came with some links to Wild Tangent games on the web. When I tried to remove these by right clicking on them in the Windows 8 start menu and selecting uninstall, it took me to the Programs &amp; Features menu where they are not listed. I eventually
 found the program files &amp; deleted them but the links/shortcuts in the "All Programs" section of the new start menu are still there. When I click "Open File Location," it shows me a games folder with links to the games that now don't have graphics. I know these
 games aren't really on my system but it just bothers me that I can't remove the links from the start menu. Please Advise!

            <blockquote>Well lucky to you. I had my update to 8.1 before I uninstall the Apps. After that I did the clean up. And guess what, those exacly those Apps are still on the list. Is there any way I can remove them? They are just annoying.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately the problem doesn't resolve by the time. :-(</div>
</blockquote>
Same problem here with 8.1.
<div><br />
<div>Having uninstalled WildTamgent, I though that was that, but I was still left with five generic links as Apps (All Casual Games, All Enthusiast Games etc), which I couldn't delete, and uninstall was patently useless since I'd already done that (Duh!).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyways, I finally tracked them down - the shortcuts are in the old Start Menu - programdata\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\games. I removed the 5 shortcuts from there, and the apps disappeared, Result!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note programdata is a hidden folder, so check "hidden items" in your file explorer window.</div>

            I don't know of any other way to get rid of them. I had given up on the issue and just lucked out that they were removed with the 8.1 update. I didn't even notice for a few days afterwards. Good luck on getting this issue resolved-hopefully you don't have
 to wait until 8.2!<br />

            Hi, AshleyWatson
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode with network function.
<br />To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />After you enter Safe Mode try to update your network drivers and then try to enter Normal Mode
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.
        </p>

            Hi AshleyWatson 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Reset your password (on another device) and if you login using Safe mode, make sure to use Safe mode with networking.
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE USING MICROSOFT ACCOUNT
<br />You will have to reset your Microsoft account password. To reset your password, click on the below link and follow online directions
<br /><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />
<br />If you have security info on your account, Microsoft will send a one-time code to the alternate phone number or email address you gave to Microsoft. After you enter the code on the next screen, you'll be able to make a new password.
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE USING LOCAL ACCOUNT
<br />Reset your Windows 10 local account password - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4028457/windows-10-reset-your-local-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402845...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Make sure caps lock &amp;/or number lock isn’t on.
<br />Try another keyboard or try using the onscreen keyboard from the sign in screen (three-quarter circle for assisted mode) to rule out the keyboard.

    <title>Windows 10 Calculator Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyle ragh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Calculator Problem</h2>
                    Hello, I have a Windows Pc with Windows 10 Enterprise with all latest updates and i5 8gb ram so it normally handles everything. However, I don't know where to report problems so I asked here. So on the Calculator App, on normal mode I type 21/2 it will
 give a answer of 10.5 which is correct. However if I type 21/2 on programmer mode then it will say 21/2=10. If you cant check the screenshot.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e195aab-35ca-4699-a825-2da66e6ff8a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e195aab-35ca-4699-a825-2da66e6ff8a4" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90c12647-443f-4a6b-a1f1-af2b120d23ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90c12647-443f-4a6b-a1f1-af2b120d23ce" /></a>

<p>Did your computer come with Windows 7 or is this an upgrade from Vista or XP?</p>
<p>If it is an upgrade then go to HP's support web site and check for Windows 7 drivers for your specific model number. Also check for recent updates even if your PC came with Windows 7 preinstalled.<br />
<a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/support.html</a></p>
<p>If there are Windows 7 drivers then download to a folder on your hard drive and install all of them, starting with the Motherboard/chipset drivers, SATA, LAN, Audio, Etc., and so on.</p>
<p>For graphics card issues check the Graphics card manufacture's download site for the most recent Windows 7 drivers for your card.<br />

<h2>            How can I view my webcam in VISTA&#63;</h2>
                    Hi dear sir,<br />
Before I used WIN XP Professional and on my computer windows i could view my webcam with XP's software next to local partition. But now i'm using WIN VISTA Ultimate and cannot find any way for viewing my webcam like in WIN XP. So what is the reason for this
 . Is here any way for viewing my webcam without any new software. My webcam is included in my laptop and isn't separate. Dell Vostro 1500"<br />
Totaly I'm sure i installed my webcam driver correctly but still it doesnt work for me. However i can view it with yahoo messenger or it's software "Creative Live". But i like to work it like Win XP in /my computer.
<br />
<br />
Best Regards.<br />
Farshad Foroughi<br />

            The problem is not with NOD32 proper, it is with the email scanner portion of any and ALL Anti Virus products. &nbsp;They help nothing, they add nothing, and all they ever really do is create problems where none otherwise exist. &nbsp;Regardless of whose A/V product
 you use, do NOT install the email scanner part of it, &nbsp;you'll save yourself a ton of grief.
