<h3> marilynhartley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel HD 5500 causing screen flashing and blacking out. Any recent solutions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have followed the posts from about a year ago on this and no-one has posted a once and for all solution. Has anyone more recently found a remedy? I have been on the Intel website to see if they've got a new driver and downloaded what they had there but
 it didn't work.</p>
<p>I know it's the Intel HD 5500 display driver as every few minutes the flashing starts and I go to Device Manager - Display Adapter - Intel HD 5500 - uninstall driver and item. Problem stops and the computer goes to the basic display adapter which lacks features
 but at least the computer is usable. However, after a few minutes the computer picks up the Intel HD 5500 and reinstalls it. Feel like throwing this 5 month old computer into the river!</p>

    <title>Contemplating Clean Reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joel fischoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contemplating Clean Reinstall</h2>
                    <p>I suffered a crash and, somehow, my computer seems to have been rolled-back several months in terms of programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Essentials isn't working anymore. &nbsp;(Initially, it would no longer send/reply/forward, then I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, and the installer insists the program is there when it isn't.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Security Essentials isn't working anymore. &nbsp;(In the process of trying to fix the above, I uninstalled it, and cannot reinstall due to an error.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been almost four years since I got this computer with Windows 7 pre-installed, and it was already running significantly slower than it should, so it's probably around the right time for this anyway, but I wanted to get opinions: Should I do a re-install?
 &nbsp;I can get the ISO from&nbsp;http://www.mydigitallife.info/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-from-digital-river/ (I think this is legal, right?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me why either way? &nbsp;And any hints -- things I should do beforehand -- would be helpful. &nbsp;Is there a way to get a listing of the programs installed in Programs and Features/Installed Programs? &nbsp;What drivers should I have on-hand?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything else I might be missing?</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>1) Open a command Prompt by right clicking and select 'Run as Administrator'
</strong><br />
<strong>and then at the command prompt type:</strong>&nbsp; chkdsk&nbsp; /f&nbsp; /r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then press the enter key.</p>
<p><br />
If prompted to schedule the volume to be checked the next time the system restarts,<br />
enter: y </p>

<p><br />
<br />
<strong>2) Run the&nbsp; SFC&nbsp;&nbsp; /SCANNOW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command. This will check and repair if necessary any critical Windows system files.</strong></p>
<p><br />
Click on Start/All programs/Accessories&nbsp; then <br />
Right click on Command Prompt option and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />

</p><p>Since Windows came pre-installed do you still have the product key located on the sticker (On the side of a Desktop case. Bottom of a laptop or inside the battery case, note that you may need to remove the battery).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have recovery media from the PC manufacture then a key is not required. You may also have a recovery partition.</p>

====================== Keyless Install ================================</p>
<p><br />
How to perform a 'Keyless Install' of Windows:</p>
<p><br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD disc you created and start the installation process.</p>
<p><br />
After you enter user name and password you will be asked to:<br />
'Type your Windows product key',&nbsp; do not enter a key.<br />
Also located just below the box where you would enter the key is a box with a check mark<br />
to 'Automatically activate Windows when I am online', remove the check mark and click 'Next'.</p>
<p><br />
You will now have a 30 day grace period in which to activate Windows. </p>
<p><br />
During the grace period you can install your device drivers, <br />
run Windows Updates and resolve any other problems or issues.<br />
Once you are satisfied everything is functioning properly, then activate Windows.&nbsp;

            <p>I strongly recommend you use the built in recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, since this reduce the head ache of hunting for drivers and will restore the system to its original factory state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<br />
<span>
<p>For Dell, press F8 on the keyboard until the Advanced Boot Options menu appears on the screen.</p>
<br />
</span><span>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are using an old computer, there are some things you should take into account if you are upgrading to Windows 7 – System Requirements. Doing a house cleaning in the operating system might not necessarily be enough to speed up that old computer. Instead
 a hardware upgrade of components might just be what you need to achieve better performance. The first three things that come to mind are Memory, Processor and Storage. These three components can add a dramatic improvement to your computers performance. One
 of the great things about running Windows 7 is the memory foot print is about the same as Windows Vista and its more efficient because of a lot of complex low level changes the Windows Team made to the operating system with how it loads programs, services
 and devices. Anyway, if you do upgrade to Windows 7, here are few things you can do to speed things up even more.</p>

<p><em>Preparing Disk cleanup </em></p>
<p><strong>Disk Cleanup – </strong>This is always a favorite place to start, because it list many of the common locations where old unused files that are often not needed any more are stored. To find Disk Cleanup, click Start, type: Disk Cleanup. Alternatively,
 you can find it under Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools. When Disk Cleanup is started, you are prompted to select the drive on which you would like to do the cleanup. In this case, its the operating system drive where Windows 7 is installed,
 usually C:\. If you are running Windows 7 in a dual boot configuration with another operating system, click in the list box and select the drive on which it is installed. Click OK.</p>

<p><em>Disk Cleanup dialog</em></p>
<p>An initialization wizard will scan you hard disk to check for areas of the system you will be able to run the clean up on. After the scanning is complete, the Disk Cleanup dialog appears. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up
 safely. The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures
 Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.

<p>In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from Windows Vista
 or clean install, Windows 7 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.

<p>A folder you might be familiar with is the Windows.old, in a future article I will be taking a closer look at this directory. Its basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reinstall Windows</a> if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings.
 The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space and reduce the systems performance. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 7 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories
 and ensure that everything migrated successfully to Windows 7. </p>
<p><strong>System Restore</strong> – The Windows Team has added some nice enhancements to Windows 7′s System Restore feature, allowing you to keep a larger collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your

System Images of Windows 7</a>. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 7 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that
 System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of&nbsp; disk space to keep System Restore Points.</p>

<p><em>Configuring System Protection settings</em></p>
<p>To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the
<strong>Configure </strong>button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the
 amount allocated. Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System
 Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance,
 if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file.&nbsp;

<p><strong>Visual Effects – </strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/11/10/making-windows-7-your-own-personalize-and-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back in November</a> I discussed some of the theming capabilities built into Windows 7. Some of these themes
 are designed for PC’s with limited capabilities. Microsoft calls these Basic and High Contrast themes. To access them, right click your desktop, click Personalize.</p>
<p><em>Windows Aero Basic</em> – For computers that cannot support the minimum graphics requirements of Windows Aero Glass. Aero Basic features the standard elements of the Windows 7 interface except for the translucent effects and animations. Instead, areas
 such as the Taskbar, window borders display a blue/grayish color scheme. Other unavailable features include the inability to choose a Window Color, see and interact with thumbnail previews, Alt-Tab Preview, Flip 3D and Aero Peek.
</p>
<p><em>Windows Classic</em><strong> </strong>- First introduced with Windows 95, this experience was the flagship theme for Windows for many years and was replaced by Windows XP’s Luna in 2001 but is still included in Windows for persons who are not quite ready
 for the changes in Windows 7. Microsoft has made some changes to Windows Classic in Windows 7 where menus are concerned. The standard look and feel still exist, but Microsoft has decided to remove the Standard Classic Menu that was available as an option in
 both Windows XP and Vista. Personally, I agree with this, since the new Start menu offers so many benefits such as Instant Search, easier access to programs, better control (no cascading/off screen sub menus), ability to search HomeGroups, Public directories
 and detailed results when presented. The new Start menu also introduces support for features unique to Windows 7 such as Jump List providing access to task and recently accessed files associated with a program.
</p>
<p><em>High Contrast themes</em><strong> </strong>- If you have difficulty reading or viewing your screen, Windows has for years included high-contrast color schemes that heightens the color contrast of some text and images on your computer, making those items
 more distinct and easier to identify. </p>

<p><em>Indexing Options</em> </p>
<p><strong>Indexing Options – </strong>Instant Search makes it quick and easy to find personal files and folders you commonly use. To improve the performance of your search experience, make sure the Index is not set to search the entire computer, searching
 areas such as System and Program Files directory can greatly slow down the performance of your searches and provide less reliable results. You can instead add folders you often search or store files.
</p>
<p><strong>Power Settings – </strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/12/02/environmentally-friendly-decisions-for-todays-pc-user/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">In December</a>, we talked about some of the energy efficiency improvements built into Windows 7 that allow
 you be more productive on the go and also provide better performance in certain scenarios.
</p>
<p><em>Windows 7 extends battery life for your mobile PC, helping you be productive longer while still getting great performance. Power-saving enhancements include increasing the idle time for the processor, automatically dimming the display, and more power-efficient
 playback for DVDs. With Windows 7, you’re also kept better-informed about battery status.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Get Idle and Stay Idle Longer.</em></strong> An idle processor reduces battery life. Windows 7 reduces background activities and supports the trigger-starting of system services, so your computer’s processor can be in an idle state more often.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Adaptive Display Brightness.</em></strong> The display on a typical mobile PC consumes more battery power than any other part of the computer. Windows 7 automatically reduces display brightness after a period of inactivity, much like cell phones
 do today. And Windows 7 intelligently adapts to your activity. For example, if the screen dims after 30 seconds and you immediately move the mouse to brighten<br />
the display, Windows 7 will wait 60 seconds before dimming the display again. <strong>

<p><strong>Startup Performance</strong></p>
<p>We install a lot of applications on our computers. Sometimes, those applications will place special files in areas of the operating system such as the Startup Folder to make launching the application faster. Sometimes a program might even create a special
 Service that prepares itself when Windows is starting up. If you have a lot of these types of programs installed, some of them can have a adverse effect on your systems performance. To resolve this, you can simply launch the Microsoft Configuration Utility
 (msconfig). MSCONFIG provides a host of options for managing how your computer starts up and also for diagnostic purposes when your system might not start properly. To launch MSCONFIG, click
<strong>Start</strong>, type: <strong>msconfig.exe</strong>, hit <strong>Enter </strong>
on your keyboard, or click <strong>msconfig.exe </strong>result in the Start menu.

<p>There is my list, of course yours will vary because of the hundreds of millions of configurations that exist and the millions of applications available for Windows. If you are unsure about a program, do a search on the Internet about it before unchecking.
 Keep a small inventory of the programs you are using, look in the notification area of the Windows Taskbar to see what is displayed. Hover the mouse pointer over the icon, which will display a balloon about that program. Also,
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
do a backup</a> before unchecking anything. If you do get confused, the Startup tab displays a button near the bottom of the window called

</p><p>Reinstalling Windows 7 should be used as opportunity to re-evaluate my current setup. Do I need all the applications I now have installed? For you, it could be a great way to setup Windows 7 the best way, configure it the way you want to and create a nice
 backup of the installation for future purposes. Well, lets jump into it!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Find all those applications disks, serials and hardware drivers</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0197.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fIMG_0197_thumb.jpg" height="429" width="571" /></a></p>
<p><em>When planning a reinstallation of Windows, gather all important software first</em></p>
<p>This is a common mistake people make when they decide to reinstall Windows. They often just pop the Windows upgrade disk in and blow out the current installation, call it a day then complain the next day that Windows lost all their programs and they can’t
 get their current programs and hardware to work.</p>
<p>The first thing you should do before&nbsp;starting&nbsp;a reinstallation is to make a small inventory of all the current applications you have installed, the ones you use the most and the ones you think you can discard. You can use Programs and Features in Windows
 7 to see a list of all the applications you have installed, then you can categorize by Last Used On, see below.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image47.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb47.png" height="239" width="396" /></a></p>
<p>Right click the Column bar, then click <strong>More…</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image48.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb48.png" height="517" width="404" /></a></p>
<p>Then click the check box for <strong>Last Used On </strong>then click <strong>
OK</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to click the Last Used On header column to show a list of all your most recently used applications. You can make an exception for driver related software such as Modem or Video driver utility programs. Select the programs you no longer need
 and click <strong>Uninstall/Change </strong>on the command bar.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image49.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb49.png" height="433" width="543" /></a></p>
<p>A list of all my most recently used programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image50.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb50.png" height="420" width="590" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Common locations on the system unit where you can find your Windows product key</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1A: </strong>In regards to Windows, if you purchased an Upgrade license and not the full version license, you might need to reinstall the qualifying license first. For example, if you upgraded from Windows Vista, you will need to reinstall Windows
 Vista then upgrade to Windows 7. It’s a chore because Windows needs to do a validation check to see if you qualify for the upgrade rights. I will be looking at a workaround in a future article. If Windows 7 came with your computer or you need to find the qualifying
 product serial, look on the chassis of the machine, either side, the top or the bottom (for laptops).</p>
<p>The same principle applies to software such as Microsoft Office. If you purchased a Microsoft Office upgrade license, when you decide to reinstall it, you will need to present the qualifying product as proof of purchase to qualify for the upgrade. So if
 you were previously running Office 2003 and purchased an upgrade license for Office 2007, you will need to have that Office 2003 disk nearby to do the validation check. Another common mistake users make is thinking that you can use a Windows product key to
 install and activate Microsoft Office and vice versa. You cannot do this, Microsoft
<strong>Windows</strong> and Microsoft <strong>Office</strong> are two distinct products developed by Microsoft Corporation. Both products use their own unique product keys for activation.</p>
<p>If you use programs such as Adobe Creative Suite or Apple iTunes, you should consider deactivating and deauthorizing each respective program first. Also, make sure your iTunes Library is backed up.</p>
<p>To deactivate an Adobe program, open the application, click <strong>Help &gt; Deactivate…
</strong>follow the on screen instructions</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image51.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb51.png" height="151" width="556" /></a></p>
<p>To deauthorize Apple iTunes, open the application, click <strong>Store &gt; Deauthorize This Computer…
</strong>follow the on screen instructions to complete the deauthorization. The reason why you should do this, iTunes might think you have installed iTunes on another computer. The software provides up to 5 authorizations, not deauthorizing can cause problems
 when you decide to authorize additional computers in the future since there will be no way authenticate that previous systems are no longer being used.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image52.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb52.png" height="194" width="558" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Additional resources for iTunes users</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">iTunes: Back up your iTunes library by copying to an external hard</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Where to locate product keys?</em></strong></p>
<p>Product keys can often be found inside or on the back of the product packaging. If you purchased Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office digitally, check your email since it would have been emailed to you. If you have somehow lost the email, you will need
 to <a href="http://store.microsoft.com/help/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact the Microsoft Store</a> to find out if they have a record of your purchase. If the programs are installed and you had entered your Windows product key during activation, you can use one of the
 following programs to retrieve the product keys before you attempt the reinstallation:</p>
<p>Here are four utilities, all of which will may display your product keys if they are still there:</p>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Belarc Advisor</a>

Includes many additional features.
<p>If none of these options are available to you, then the unfortunate truth is, you will need to purchase a new full version license.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to locate Hardware Drivers?</em></strong></p>
<p>A very important part of setting up Windows successfully is having the right drivers. Windows 7 installs the most common out of box drivers, but if you have unique hardware devices such as a multi-function printer or other&nbsp;devices, make sure you have drivers
 on hand to reinstall when needed.</p>
<p>Some common drivers I recommend you obtain prior to reinstalling are Network Interface Card
<strong>(NIC)</strong> drivers such as Ethernet, Wireless Adapter, Wireless/Wired Router, Video Drivers and Audio Drivers.</p>
<p>After you setup Windows, you will most likely need to connect to the Internet to download updates for Windows and your programs. Ethernet and Wireless Adapter drivers may be needed in this case which is why I recommend putting those on &nbsp;a thumbdrive for
 easy access.</p>
<p>To make sure you have the right version, check the manufacturer’s website. If you are using a name brand laptop such as a Dell, just go to the manufacturer’s website, look for the Drivers and Downloads section of the website, enter the computers model number
 or service tag and click search. This will present all the drivers for your system model. Download all necessary drivers and store them safely until needed.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0198.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fIMG_0198_thumb.jpg" height="380" width="568" /></a></p>
<p><em>Examples of popular driver disks you will need</em></p>
<p>Other drivers such as your chipset driver might be handy too, especially if you are using integrated graphics, network and onboard audio, the chipset driver provides the communication between all the components in your system with processor and memory such
 as your audio device, video card and network interface card. You can often found this on the motherboard or recovery disc that came with your computer. If you are not able to find updated or Windows 7 native drivers for some of your hardware components, you
 can also try Windows Vista native drivers which will work most often.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Do some house cleaning.</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, we tend to store a digital copy of&nbsp; almost everything we own. While we enjoy archiving and having instant access to the information from years ago, sometimes its best to re-evaluate the need to have it all stored on our hard disk. Instead,
 storing some of those old documents you rarely access or those old digital photographs you only look at once in a while on an external hard disk might be best.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to look for redundant files. Do you need to have 4 different versions of your resume? My recommendation is to just delete the older ones and keep the latest version. Another area to look at is email, do I need to have 10 years worth
 of email on my hard disk? Do I need to have all those contact files? What this also does is reduce the complexity and time it takes to backup your most important files which we will discuss next and guarantees that you will restore just what you need after
 setting up Windows.</p>
<p>Duplicate files are also an issue, I use this handy program called <strong><a href="http://www.bigbangenterprises.de/en/doublekiller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DoubleKiller</a></strong> to weed them out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Backup, Backup, Backup!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Image125.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fImage125_thumb.jpg" height="412" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>An External Hard disk is an important investment when planning a backup</p>
<p>I can’t stress enough how important a step this is. Losing access to programs or drivers can be an inconvenience, even a temporary one, but to lose years of work such as documents, photos, videos, emails is not a good thing. Make sure you have all that information
 backed up safely.</p>
<p>The best way to do this by using an external hard disk. Just leave CD’s and DVD’s out of the options for backup, they are inconvenient, unreliable and can be easily damaged. External hard disks are affordable, robust and offer lots of storage to backup GB’s
 or even TB’s of data you might have accumulated over the years.</p>
<p>There are multiple methods of doing a backup in Windows 7. The first one I recommend is the standard
<a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Backup</a> which backs up all your personal files and settings. The next one is <a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System Image</a>, another reason why External hard disks are recommended because what it does is creates an exact replica of your installation. So, if something goes wrong with the reinstallation, you can always restore your backup and you are back in business.
 The other option is Windows Easy Transfer, this is quite similar to Backup, but is narrow in its capabilities. I have also discovered it has issues backing up Microsoft Outlook .PST folders and you cannot specify specific locations in the system you want to
 backup, it only does common directories such as the User folder and shared folder. I recommend you use both Backup and Windows Easy Transfer to compliment each other. For instance, you can use WET to do the backup of common user folders and Backup unique directories
 where you might have data stored.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Decide which architecture of Windows 7 you want to install (32 or 64 bit)</strong></p>
<p>Like I have been saying, the opportunity to reinstall Windows 7 gives you some choices. If you initially installed the 32 bit version of Windows 7, you might have upgraded your installed memory since then or plan to. If you are running 4 GB or more RAM,
 you can effectively take advantage of it by using 64 bit Windows 7. First you must ensure that all your drivers and applications are compatible.</p>
<p>To determine this, use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor</a> provided by Microsoft. Also check the manufacturers/developers website for all your applications and hardware devices. If your computer came with 64 bit Windows 7 installed or you installed that initially, you might not be
 seeing the immediate benefits and would prefer to downgrade to the 32 bit architecture. This is especially true if you only have 1 to 3.2 GBs of RAM installed. It’s also likely that system performance can greatly improve running the 32 bit version.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you do decide to downgrade to Windows 7 32 bit, you will need to backup your files manually to an external hard disk,
<strong>not </strong>by using Windows Easy Transfer. This is because Windows Easy Transfer backups from within Windows 7 64 bit are not backward compatible with Windows 7 32 bit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Starting the installation.</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you should do is disconnect any non-essential devices. This might interfere with setup. So things such as printers, external hard disks, scanners or any other device that is not needed (apart from your mouse and keyboard) should be disconnected.
 If you plan on moving from one architecture, 32 to 64 bit or vice-versa, insert the Windows 7 disk, restart the computer, make sure your DVD drive is set to boot from the disk.</p>
<p>In this case, I will be reinstalling the same edition and architecture.</p>

<p>Click the option ‘<strong>’Reinstall Windows (requires Windows installation disc)’</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This process will do a standard clean installation, I won’t go over the entire process since Notebooks.com has already documented the process
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/06/how-to-install-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Our intention though is to do a clean install, which means, nothing will be left on the drive. To be clear Programs, Drivers will need to be reinstalled and your
 personal files and settings will need to be restored. If you have not backed up your files and downloaded your drivers, please go and do it first and remember, back up to an external hard disk.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Reinstall-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fReinstall-1_thumb.jpg" height="255" width="432" /></a></p>
<p>Make sure you have your Windows 7 installation disk, insert it when prompted, then click Yes.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Reinstall-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fReinstall-2_thumb.jpg" height="425" width="565" /></a></p>
<p>You will be asked if you want to backup your files first. Windows 7 will intelligently detect if there were any backups done as you can see in the above screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Reinstall-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fReinstall-3_thumb.jpg" height="422" width="561" /></a></p>

<p>If there is more than one drive listed, it likely means, one is a Recovery partition and the other is the System Partition. Avoid formatting or deleting the Recovery partition, select the system partition where Windows 7 is installed and click

<p>You will be warned that all data on the drive will be destroyed. Again, make sure all your files, settings are backed up. Make sure you have downloaded all necessary drivers, have all application disks near by. If you are unsure, click cancel, and then click
<strong>Next. T</strong>his will do is create a Windows.old folder with the previous installation still intact so you can recover any missing files.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Clean-Install-8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fClean-Install-8_thumb.jpg" height="424" width="564" /></a></p>
<p>The installation is now in progress. Once complete, you will go through the Out of Box Experience which involves joining a wireless network, a homegroup if available, entering your user name, password, name of computer, date and time and configuration of
 common settings. Please see previous Notebooks.com article for instructions <strong>
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/06/how-to-install-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>After installation is complete</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>The first thing you should do is&nbsp;install an Antivirus Utility. I personally use the free
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a>, but there are others out there such as AVAST! Home or AVG. Make sure it is the most up to date version.</div>
</li><li>
<div>If you are unable to connect to the Internet, make sure your Network Interface Card, Wireless Adapter, Router drivers are installed. Again, these drivers should have already either been downloaded or you have the driver disc ready for reinstallation.</div>
</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image57.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb57.png" height="404" width="579" /></a></p>
<p>Run <strong>Windows Update, </strong>a fair amount of updates have been released for Windows 7 since it came out. I recommend, just for convenience purposes, if you must reinstall Windows 7, wait until Service Pack 1 is released which should be very soon.
 This can reduce a significant amount of downtime, since all you will need to do is reinstall Windows 7 form your disk, then install the Service Pack.</p>
<p>Avoid installing driver updates for hardware, just install security updates first. If you encounter problems installing updates, you can learn more about resolving it
<strong><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/10/25/how-to-manage-configure-and-troubleshoot-windows-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Finish installing any addition drivers needed to have a functioning system. I would recommend you do next after this is to create a System Image of the installation. What this will do is create a backup of the installation, so you could use it in the future
 as a way to reinstall Windows 7 quickly without starting from scratch. You can learn more about doing this
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a></div>
</li><li>
<div>After you have backed up the installation, you can start restoring your personal files and settings, either from a Backup or from a Windows Easy Transfer file, whichever method you used. Windows Easy Transfer should give you a report of which applications
 you will need to reinstall. Learn more <strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>Reinstall your applications. I suggest you try creating system restore points in between each configuration. So, after you had installed the drivers successfully, restored personal files and settings, create a new system restore point each time, it can
 be a life saver, trust me.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Reconnect any external devices you were using, try doing it one at a time then restart, just in case one causes a system instability. If it does, it likely means you need to update the driver.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Reactivate Windows, this can be done by Internet, especially if you are reinstalling Windows on the same machine, the same applies for Microsoft Office. If you encounter any problems reactivating Windows, please review the following Notebooks.com article
<strong><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/28/how-to-resolve-common-windows-activation-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
</strong>for tips and solutions to common activation problems in Windows.</div>
</li></ul>
<p>Now, this is a lot to digest when considering a reinstallation, so its best you don’t do this when you are in the middle of a project or working on something important. Do it when you have some off time, focus on certain things over a period of time such
 as gathering reinstallation disks, drivers, backing up files and settings. It is also best if you can have a backup system on hand you can use during the down time. With careful planning, this should be a fun and easy to do project itself and it will save
 you some money compared to carrying your computer to a repair company and it will enhance your computing skills.</p>

<h2>            &#39;Remove Everything and Reinstall Windows&#39; Does not Work</h2>
                    When I navigate to 'Change PC Settings' and hit 'General' and click 'Get Started' under the 'Remove Everything and reinstall windows' header I get a gray opaque shadow that just shows up. It doesn't do anything it just locks up. If I hit the spacebar twice
 it exits.&nbsp;<br />
This also happens when I hit 'Personalize' and 'Browse' under Lock Screen. I am unable to browse. It just grays out the screen with an opaque box.<br />
<br />
I also am unable to do 'Refresh PC without affecting files' it has the same result..<br />
<br />
A little back story: I purchased the update via digital download. When It was done it would not activate. I had to call in and activate it over the phone.<br />
After that It displayed the times incorrectly for the Eastern Time Zone: Example It was 9:03 AM and it was displaying 12:03 PM, which would be Pacific Time.<br />
<br />
I really just want to do a fresh reinstall, but I can't seem to be able to. Someone please help..<br />

            I am having a similar problem. When I go to my settings and I click change pc settings then go to recovery, I click on "get started" under "Remove Everything and reinstall Windows". Once I click on the box, a green strip 3/4 wide in the middle of the screen
 covering from the left side to right pops up. It says "Please wait" and under it says "preparing(with a loading symbol)". But then it does nothing. It will sit like that for hours and not actually do anything. My screen will turn off if i am not keeping it
 awake, and once i have to awake the screen, it has already closed out of the box preparing to reinstall. Im not sure why Windows cant make reset settings much easier like a phone, but this makes me not want a Windows computer at all.<br />

                    <p>Dear colleagues!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had read a lot on this BSOD-error, but found nothing about my case :(.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Acer Aspire 8950G with Intel Core i7-2630QM, 16GB of RAM, two SSD disks (Plextor M5Pro 512GB and Plextor M6Pro 1TB). Most recent hardware was installed in December'14.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notebook worked perfectly till 06-Apr-15. Since that date I can't neither turn it into sleep or hybernate, nor power it off without BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did I do on&nbsp;06-Apr-15?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Installed one update from MS site concerning Realtek High Definition Audio.</p>
<p>2. Installed Hyper-V (I used VirtualBox before)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 07-Apr-15 (after first BSOD) I rolled back all the changes above, but it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I understand from minidumps, VirtulBox network adapter drivers came into conflict with Hyper-V (it is just my assumpltion). I deinstalled VirtualBox too, but BSODs didn't leave me (and analysis pointed to NDisVirtualBus driver). So, I installed
 VirtualBox back because need to work with virtual machines. With BSODs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not experienced user to read dumps, so need help! Because it is quite diffucult to live having no ability even to power off computer correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attach two minidumps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. With VirtualBox deinstalled (http://1drv.ms/1EMt0k6)</p>
<p>2. With VirtualBox installed again (http://1drv.ms/1bP1tTD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>

            <p>Dear XP Rocks!, thank you for your answer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I already wrote, uninstallation of VirtualBox didn't help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did it again after your answer, upgrade BIOS to the lasest one, tried to hybernate - and result remained the same, BSOD with the same error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is dump:&nbsp;http://1drv.ms/1ORMASL</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help is still needed........</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I upgraded sptd.sys, because use Daemon Tools Lite. But did it after last BSOD. Hope, this driver is not the root of problem, because DTL I had since the beginning (about 3 years).</p>

<h2>            Printer driver causing print margin errors.</h2>
                    Original Title:HP Deskjet 6840dt Color Inkjet Printer Driver Problem<br />
<br />
The Windows in-OS HP 6840 printer driver I installed on two Windows 7 systems (a clean install) is not functioning properly. The driver appears to not be determining the left and right margins properly so that text prints slightly out of register. If I switch
 to a HP 550C driver the printer functions properly, but of course now images don't print properly. I've been advised on some forums to contact HP, but they essentially say it is a Windows driver and therefore not their problem (and of course the printer is
 out of warranty). Has anyone else had this issue and found a solution? Our campus is upgrading to Windows 7 campus wide and this model printer is fairly ubiquitous so...<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions you might have<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I am afraid there isn't much Microsoft can do about the issue since it is a HP printer. I'd recommend you contact
<span><a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/summary/ww-contact-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>HP
</span>Support</span></a></span> once again and hopefully they should be able to assist you this time around.<br />
<br />
Also, check if you can make any changes in the Printer properties.<br />

            Maybe I'm confused...the printer is not the problem...the driver for the printer is. If the printer was broken I'd just replace it. If this is a "in-OS' driver for Windows 7, did Microsoft supply it, or does HP write the driver and have it certified by
 Microsoft? HP is not supplying any support for Windows 7 "in-OS" drivers as far as I can tell, so why would they help me? Altering the communication properties with the printer (I'm assuming that you mean bidirectional control or the file type sent to the
 printer&nbsp; [I may have the wrong word there]) did not fix the problem.<br />

<p>The hardware manufacturers write the drivers for their individual devices.</p>

<p>As this is the case, HP is the best point of contact for this specific issue.</p>

                    I am trying to move music files onto a microsd card. The computer recognizes the card, I can transfer files from the card onto my laptop but not from my laptop to the card. I get the error in the title. I'm using Windows 10 with the Fall Creators update.
 I have updated/uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers for the sd card port.

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the micro-SD drive or the files that you are transferring has been corrupted. For us to isolate the issue about transferring files to your card drive, kindly respond to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aside from updating to the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, can you tell us what changes have you made to the files or to your system or to the drive prior to the issue?</li><li>Are you able to transfer files to another external drive? This is for us to see if the issue is caused by the system or by the drive.</li><li>Besides from updating and reinstalling the drivers for your USB port, what other troubleshooting steps have you done so far? This is for us to know and avoid any duplication of efforts on your end.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>It's a new laptop so it's the first time I went to use it and no other changes were made. The micro-SD card was not recognized at first due to a missing driver which I installed from the manufacturers website and the cards was detectable afterwards. I am
 also not able to reformat the micro SD card in the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to transfer files to other external drives, but not other micro-SD or SD cards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than the updating and reinstalling of the drivers I haven't done any other trouble shooting steps as I was unable to find similar enough issues online.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the laptop is new, there might be built-in apps that were installed by the manufacturer on your device. These apps may sometimes cause software conflicts within your device. We suggest that you perform a clean boot in Windows to determine if a service
 is disrupting the system in transferring files to your SD card. You may follow the steps on this

            <p>That I know of there's no reason to uninstall the on board graphic's driver it's part of the chipset driver = leave it alone and installed</p>
<p>Just install the new card and connect your monitor to it</p>
<p>On board graphic's are usually disabled when a real graphic's card is installed.</p>

<h2>            Can&#8217;t unenroll in Xbox betas now because I&#8217;m too young&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>a weird thing happened to me out of nowhere. So basically my xbox one account was considered an “adult account” and because of that i could change my profile picture and use the xbox insider hub. One day my age on xbox just randomly changed to a teen account
 and now im on a little bit more restricted settings. I had my insider app set up to be enrolled in the minecraft beta but now my brother (who i share an account with) and his friends want to play the new minecraft now instead of the xbox one edition minecraft
 but he cant play with them because im enrolled in the beta and theyre not enrolled in the beta and i cant unenroll from the beta because it says my account is “too young” now but i was able to use the insider hub no problem before hand and i was able to use
 the insider app just fine with no issues but now all of sudden this happens. Is there a way ican unenroll from the beta or do something?&nbsp;<br />
Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Received 2 different codes unsuccessfully downloading today&#38;&#35;39&#59;s update.</h2>
                    
<p>I received the prompt to update this afternoon, but i have received a couple different failure codes.</p>
<p>First one I received after my 360 failed its 3rd and final initial attempt to download update:</p>
<p>397F-3CD4-A080-0F00-8007-2EE2</p>
<p>After turning off my 360 and restarting it I got though the initial download, my 360 automatically restarted itself, and continued to download to where it failed again with a new code:</p>
<p>3CD4-0000-3080-0506-8007-2EE2</p>
<p>I have tried ALL the trouble-shooting possible.<br />
(restarted modem and router, plenty of storage space, cleared cache and removed HD a couple times, tried wirelessly and via ethernet, no firewall issues)</p>
<p>Haven't tried to update via USB because I'm a mac user and ****. files don't transfer well, sorry ;)</p>
<p>I can connect to XBL and be prompted to update via ethernet, but this is my "Error Status Report" after failing to connect wirelessly. (After the trouble-shooting)</p>

<p>Hi PIZZA DANZA - Please try to connect your XBOX 360 wired via an Ethernet cable (without your router in the equation) then restart your XBOX 360 and the cable/dsl modem. Try to download the update again. This issue with the ending status code 8007-2EE2
 suggests that your network is having a hard time communicating with the XBOX Live servers to fully download the update. Now if you are getting prompted to download a system update (June 12th 2012 being the latest) it's unfortunately not available on the website
 as of right now to download manually. This should be available next week as the full update rolls out to all users of XBOX Live.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you can also try to take off your routers security and move the console or router closer to each other for a stronger signal if you're unable to directly connect via an Ethernet Cable.<br />
<br />
Try that out and let us know how that goes.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

    <title>Is it possible to migrate windows media player database from windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mustangjeff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to migrate windows media player database from windows 7 32bit to windows 8 64bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm in a bit of a pickle and looking for help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a HTPC running windows 7 32bit, and&nbsp;I use this system as my main music source in a fairly high end audio system.&nbsp; I wanted the best sound possible so I ripped all my music CD's (approx 600) to WAV format using EAC.&nbsp; Because WAV files can't store metadata,
 I painstakingly added each album folder&nbsp;individually to the media player database and updated each folder as an album.&nbsp; This probably took 80-100 hours of work when all was said and done.</p>
<p>Recently I've puchased Windows 8 64bit, and want to run it on this system.&nbsp; I purchased a new drive for the WIndows 8 install&nbsp;as not to mess with the original windows 7 drive, and attempted to copy the database files&nbsp;to the windows 8 drive.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly
 it didn't seem to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried copying the entire folder C:\Users\accountname\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Media Player\&nbsp;&nbsp; that contained the file CurrentDatabase_X.wmdb</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Unfortunately it doesn't, but thank you for the reply,&nbsp; It gives me the option to move the actual music files which are located on a separate drive, but it doesn't give me the option to backup the actual wmdb files which containes the actual important information
 (file locations, track names, album names, etc).</p>
<p>I have a feeling that I'll need to start all over again.</p>

    <title>Camera Roll folder. Pictures folder, OneDrive folder and Photo app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera Roll folder. Pictures folder, OneDrive folder and Photo app</h2>
                    <p>At the moment I am rather confused. Can someone please explain what each of the items in the title are, and how they are interconnected. This is my current understanding - is any or all&nbsp;accurate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PICTURES FOLDER is where I store any images I have taken with a camera, or scanned for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ONEDRIVE FOLDER is the folder that I can put files or folders so they can be automatically uploaded to the cloud storage called OneDrive. I can turn synching of a folder on or off
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PHOTOS is an app that can be used to edit photo images. It will also search your computer for images and automatically make "albums" of the photos it finds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what is Camera Roll folder. What is it used for? \how is it different to my Pictures folder? Why is their pictures in the Camera Roll folder when I have only just upgraded from windows 8 to windows 10. I don't recall ever seeing CameraRoll folder on
 windows 8.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p>
<span>The server name will be the Fax Server name. “A FAX Server’ is a system installed in a local area network (LAN) server that allows users who have the Fax Server client installed on their workstations
 to send and receive fax messages right from their computer. “ </span></p>
<p>
<span>Fax Server can only be utilized if the user is within the Capitol Complex. This is usually defined by the prefix of 242 or 353 phone numbers.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You will have to contact your Network Administrator to get the server name if you are trying to install this on a Domain.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Here is an article that will give you steps on ‘How to Set Up a Fax Server or Fax Client with Microsoft Fax’:
