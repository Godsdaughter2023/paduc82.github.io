<h2>            Cannot send or receive messages on one of my accounts anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to send and receive messages on my Skype account but the messages are stuck in "Sending..." when I try to send it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting my Wifi, changing my DNS server, using a different account (which worked!), reinstalling Skype, using classic Skype, but none of the above seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something going on with my account? I checked the heartbeat website as well but it says everything is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

<h2>            stop skype from ringing on all devices</h2>
                    <p>I have installed the Skype plug-in for Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have&nbsp;three devices that I use Outlook on. One of&nbsp;these devices has Skype capabilities - when someone calls me, Skype rings on all three of my devices and when I answer with my Skype enabled computer, Skype still rings on my other 2 computers until
 I physically answer the calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talk about frustrating and sort of impractical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...how do I make Skype stop ringing on devices that don't support Skype calling?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!!!</p>

            <p>I haven't received a reply and there are other folks with the same issue - is there a solution for this OR is the answer simply to use Skype's desktop version and not install Skype on non-Skype devices? And to not install Skype on Outlook.</p>

    <title>Data validation Can I set an error alert stop and warning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fje1001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Data validation Can I set an error alert stop and warning</h2>
                    <p>I have a cell in a spreadsheet that I would like to warn someone if they attempt to enter a negative value, as that is generally not appropriate, but it is possible to have.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also would like to prevent them from entering anything except a number (blank, space, character, etc).&nbsp; I can use a Custom formula&nbsp;and use IsNumber to make sure it is a number on the Settings tab, but the real trick becomes how to warn them, but allow,
 a negative and how to stop anything other than a number being entered.&nbsp; I think it is either stop them or warn them, but wanted to check if anyone does this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>It's difficult, if not impossible, to do all you want with worksheet functions, formatting and data validation.&nbsp; But I think this bit of VBA code might do the trick for you.&nbsp; It is Worksheet event handling code, so it has to go into the worksheet's code
 module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get to the worksheet's code module, open the workbook, select the particular sheet you need this to work on and RIGHT-click on its name tab.&nbsp; Choose [View Code] from the list that comes up.&nbsp; That will open the VB Editor and present that worksheet's code
 module to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy the code below and paste it into the code module.&nbsp; Change the value of <strong>
Const tgtAddress</strong> to become the address of the cell you need to deal with, be sure you use the $ symbols.&nbsp; Close the VB Editor and toss some test entries into that cell and see if you like it or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to keep it, be sure and save your workbook as "Macro Enabled ..." type .xlsm, not as .xlsx.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp; 'address of cell you want to watch over<br />
&nbsp; <strong>Const tgtAddress = "$E$2"</strong><br />
&nbsp; 'ignore it if they deleted the entry<br />
&nbsp; 'or if not the proper cell at all!<br />
&nbsp; If IsEmpty(Target) Or Target.Address &lt;&gt; tgtAddress Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; 'next we deal with entries like 123a or b221 or HI!<br />
&nbsp; If Not Application.WorksheetFunction.IsNumber(Target) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "You did not enter a number into the cell.", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbOKOnly + vbCritical, "Invalid Entry"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'force back into the cell but leave their mistake visible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; 'test if negative and just warn them<br />
&nbsp; If Target &lt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox("You have entered a negative value.&nbsp; Do you wish to KEEP the entry?", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbYesNo + vbQuestion, "Negative Entry") &lt;&gt; vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.ClearContents ' clears their entry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />

<p>Our organization's Outlook desktop client is an outside telecommunication company hosted platform, which is a hosted shared platform with multiple clients. We also have Office 365 with Outlook OWA at Exchange online. Both
 have the same email address while they don’t have any connections. We would like to sync between Outlook desktop client and Office 365, so we discussed with the telecommunication company engineering team on this, but they are not sure if there are any available
 tools do to this request. I was wondering whether it have to be done from the telecommunication company hosted platform side by its support team Or we would be able to do sycn from our Office 365 admin center? any prerequisites required?&nbsp;<span>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have not sync on-premises with Office 365 for active users yet.</p>

<br />And you create the profile with the tool that I gave you, so that you have a single profile connected to Office 365.

<h2>            Outlook 365 for mac slow receiving emails from IMAP</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've had this issue for a very long time, and managed to put up with it, however its now become worse, so feel the need to push this out there and see if this is something that i'm only experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 365 for mac installed. The main app I use daily is, as you can imagine, Outlook. I've looked at using Apple Mail and other apps, but when it comes down to it, Outlook has everything I need and allows me to 'integrate' with other people using
 windows much easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However...... I have a big issue when trying to receive emails. It takes ages!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 mail accounts set up, all IMAP. Plus I also have these set up on my iPhone. When I get sent an email, from any of these accounts, I first get it on my iPhone. Then it takes up to a staggering 40 minutes, before I receive it on my laptop version
 of Outlook! As you can imagine if it wasn't for my iPhone, i'd be missing some very important email deadlines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, i've contacted Microsoft support via the Outlook app, and they have come back with a few things to try, so this is what i've already tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Removed and recreated my profile - This didn't change anything</li><li>Checked my IMAP settings and changed the sync time to 2 minutes - this didn't change anything</li><li>Uninstalled (yes I uninstalled) - re-installed and recreated profile - this, apart from giving me some scary moments when I thought i'd lost all my saved emails - isn't help</li><li>Created the profiles on Apple Mail and confirmed that this issue doesn't happen with this app</li></ol>
<p>So thats where I am. I have told Microsoft support that I still have the issue, and looking online it does look like there are other people out there that have exactly the same issue - so its not just me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to push this out to anyone and everyone and see if this has been either fixed, or confirmed as an issue. At least then I know something is going to hopefully be done to sort it. If not then I may have to resort to using Apple Mail!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, also forgot to say. If I quit out of Outlook and close it down, then re-open it again - 9 times out of 10 I get the emails all come through!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help!</p>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the detailed info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All emails are downloaded from the IMAP server. To identify if the issue is related to network connection, I'm wondering if the Outlook for Mac and Outlook for iOS(may be the default Mail app) are under the same network connection. If so, please do a test
 below and let me know the result:</p>
<p>Disconnect one of your IMAP accounts in your iPhone, just keep the same IMAP account online in Outlook for Mac. Then sending emails to this account and check what will happen. We can check if there is something wrong with the Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please keep working with the Outlook in-app support engineer. We'll appreciate it if you can share some update with us.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lance</p>

<p>Hi Lance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the message. I think I understand where you are going here, however I have tried this also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this initially started to happen, I removed all but one IMAP account on my phone. This was mainly because I needed these emails to be delivered fast. I then removed this account from my laptop Outlook accounts and just kept the other two (which are
 my own private email accounts). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also played around with only having one email account set up just on my Outlook for mac client and even a totally brand new email account, which I set up on my ISP's website, using my own domain. I set this up only on my laptop Outlook, and tested
 it using emails going to it from different accounts (in case there was an issue with the companies the emails were coming from). Alas the same thing happens, and I even get the emails on my ISP's webmail about 15 minutes before they appear in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Matt</p>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, I understand that the email delivery is fine in the webmail mode but there is a huge delay when it arrives Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We may need to collect some information to identify the root cause.</p>
<p>1. Are all the imap accounts on your ISP? </p>
<p>2. Does the ISP support Exchange configuration?</p>
<p>3. Which app do you use to set up IMAP account on your phone, Outlook for iOS or the default Mail app?</p>
<p>4. When you did test, do Outlook and your phone use the same network connection? Like connecting to the same WiFi?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please capture a screenshot of the account setting page like the image in the article below, you can mask some private info:</p>

<p>Hi Lance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>heres some answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are all the imap accounts on your ISP?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one that works via Yahoo and another one that works via a domain I have with Freeola</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Does the ISP support Exchange configuration?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Yahoo and Freeola do support Exchange configuration</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Which app do you use to set up IMAP account on your phone, Outlook for iOS or the default Mail app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the default, Apple email app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. When you did test, do Outlook and your phone use the same network connection? Like connecting to the same WiFi?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, both my phone and my laptop connect to the same wi-fi connection. I have also connected my laptop direct to my router via ethernet, but this doesn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also have 2 images below of my settings for yahoo and freeola</p>

To start up in safe mode:</p>

<li>
Start or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. The&nbsp;Apple logo appears on your display. If you don't&nbsp;see the Apple logo,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">learn what to do</a>.</li><li>
Release the Shift key when you see the login window. If your startup disk is encrypted with&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FileVault</a>, you might be asked to log in twice: once to unlock the startup disk, and again to

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What feature within Excel are you using when you receive this error?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Are you using Office 2007 on both computers? Does the non-working machine have service pack 3 for Office 2007 installed?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it doesn’t, I would recommend installing it to see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest that you optimize your browser to make sure that it isn’t contributing to this issue. This will also serve as an initial troubleshooting step to clean up unnecessary clutter in your hard disk and improve browser performance.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>For&nbsp;Internet Explorer </span></b><span>- kindly close all the programs you are running on your computer.&nbsp; Then you can simply press (<b>Ctrl&nbsp;</b>+
<b>Shift</b> + <b>Del)</b> key, check all the boxes when <b>Delete Browsing History
</b>windows pop up. Click <b>Delete</b> and then <b>OK</b>.<br />
<br />
For other browser, please refer to this </span><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>link</span></b></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, we’d like you to provide us the answers to the following questions that I have enumerated below. These will help us to investigate and eliminate the possible causes of this issue&nbsp;your concern:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>•Is your browser updated on its latest version? if you’re not using an updated browser, some parts of Outlook might not work and it might not display properly.</span></p>
<p><span>•Does the issue happen when using a different computer? </span></p>
<p><span>•Do other Outlook.com accounts encounter the same issue when using your computer?
</span></p>
<p><span>•Does the same thing happen when you access your account from the same computer with a different browser?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>To switch back to Hotmail, perform the following steps with Outlook.com displayed in your browser:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner of the page next to your name.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the last item in the menu, <b>Switch back to Hotmail</b>.</span></p>

            <p>I am having the exact same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My issues started in Hotmail, where&nbsp;addresses would not "auto fill' when I replied to emails.</p>
<p><br />
After reading many posts, I went to Outlook.com to just read up on it.&nbsp; Low and behold, I was automatically logged in and my hotmail account appears to have been migrated to Outlook.com.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now, whenever I try to go to Hotmail, it automatically takes me into Outlook.com.&nbsp; That wouldn't be an issue, except for the fact that Outlook.com is completely non-resposive for me.&nbsp; I can't take any action within that interface.&nbsp; None of the hyperlinks
 respond when clicked.&nbsp; I can see the messages...select them by checking the box...and a couple of links in the footer work.</p>
<p>Anything that refers to this address "bay002.mail.live.com" works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!&nbsp; I have been a happy Hotmail customer for as long as I can remember...dating back to the 90s.&nbsp; Like the original poster, I can only interact with my mail via my mobile client.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not looking to switch services, but will have no choice if this isn't resolved soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>We recommend that you update your&nbsp;browser on its latest version for us to rule out the possible causes of this issue. S</span><span>ome parts

<span>Also, please be informed&nbsp;that
</span><span>users who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were sent notification messages concerning the upcoming upgrade. Accounts that were automatically upgraded do not have the option to switch
 back to Hotmail. </span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You can check the option to switch back by

<p><span>I would like to assist you on this issue and I need more information for us to pinpoint what might have causing this and how we could resolve this case.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When you say “I cannot enter anything on Outlook it is blocked” does this mean:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>You can’t sign-in to your account.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you can’t sign-n to your account I suggest you reset your password or verify your account via SMS</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here’s how: </span></p>

<p><span>Your Outlook and SkyDrive should have the same username and password, so I think it’s odd that you can’t login to your Outlook while you can in SkyDrive.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would like to assist you on this one and it would help if you tell us short details of this issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I also like to know how you access your account and what site you pull up when logging in to your Outlook account.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It would also help if you could provide us the affected email address so we can check what might have causing this problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In the mean time please check my response to barbara and&nbsp;see what solution will possibly work for you.</span></p>

    <title>Some E73 044.088 firmware bugs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thetao---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some E73 044.088 firmware bugs</h2>
                    
<p>Recently I updated the firmware on my T-Mobile USA E73 to version 044.008.&nbsp; The browser was updated from 7.2.6 to 7.2.6.9, Adobe Reader from 2.5.202 to 2.5.208, T-Mobile's Visual Voicemail program from 1.0.8, 1.0.11, and RealPlayer from a 06 Apr 2010 edition
 to one dated 16 Aug 2010.&nbsp; There is also a new "WLAN Wizard" program and a "Clear Data" program.&nbsp; I'm sure many other programs were updated, too, but most don't include version numbers.<br />
<br />
I was hoping for a bunch of bug fixes, but so far the only obvious improvement has been the Google/Internet connectivity in the Search plugin (the "Home screen application" plugin on the Standby screen) coming back to life.&nbsp; But I feel this was fixed more by
 the installer flushing some corrupted file rather than replacing bad code.&nbsp; A user on the t-mobile.com forums suggested that WiFi now works normally with non T-Mobile SIM cards, but I haven't confirmed that.&nbsp; Here is a list of smaller bugs I've found, that
 I wanted to post publicly somewhere.&nbsp; Bugs related to Messaging, Email, WiFi, Maps, Voice functions, UMA, VPN, VOIP, etc. are not here, either because they're too time consuming to test or because I haven't used those features yet. :smileywink:<br />
<br />
I am hoping other E73 owners will either post some of their own bugs here or post feedback on my list.&nbsp; And I am curious how many of these bugs also plague the E72?<br />
<br />
<u>Browser bugs</u><br />
<br />
1) Go "Back" a page in the History (pressing the "3" key works well) but press Stop before the new page can load.&nbsp; Immediately try going "Back" again, and this page is now gone from the History.&nbsp; The page before it loads instead.&nbsp; Use the right soft key to
 choose a page farther back, but again immediately press Stop.&nbsp; It appears nothing has changed, but now press the right soft key to flip through the History, and you will see two copies of the current page.&nbsp; One is the last page in History (what you would expect),
 but there is now a copy which has replaced the original page you wanted to load.&nbsp; Press "3" and you will load the History page previous to it.<br />
<br />
2) Ctrl-A and Ctrl-V don't work in HTML text input or textarea fields.&nbsp; (Ctrl-X and Ctrl-C do work.)<br />
<br />
3) The layout of this very web site (http://discussions.europe.nokia.com) is slightly worse when viewed in "Full" (not "Mobile") mode.&nbsp; View an individual post and the "Options"
 DHTML drop-down menu now spills into the page.&nbsp; Followups to that post (and much of the rest of that page) now appear centered.<br />
<br />
4) When replying to a post on this web site in "Full" (not "Mobile") mode with the "Reply" (not "Quick Reply") editor, several strange things happen.&nbsp; Typing in the HTML textarea field with predictive text off, the "capitalize first letter" feature (i.e. "Abc"
 in the header field) can get stuck on, resulting in all caps.&nbsp; Typing with predictive text and "Word auto-completion" on results in the auto-completed word being taken as the correct word.&nbsp; That is, continuing to type does not change the auto-completed word,
 but simply appends to it.&nbsp; For example, trying to type the word "something" types this instead<br />
<br />
s<br />
so<br />
sometimes<br />
sometimese<br />
sometimese2<br />
sometimese26<br />
sometimese26i<br />
sometimese26i9<br />
sometimese26i95<br />
<br />
This happens with "abc" still appearing in the header field.&nbsp; Since the firmware upgrade, there has been a slight change.&nbsp; Instead of forcing numbers, it now activates browser keypad shortcuts.&nbsp; So instead of a "2" appearing, the "Find keyword" search field
 appears instead.<br />
<br />
Additionally, since the firmware upgrade I sometimes find myself unable to type at all.&nbsp; The cursor remains flashing in the textarea field, but no variation of "abc", "123", etc. appears in the header field, so no characters appear.<br />
<br />
All problems described in 4) appear to be exclusive to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices">
http://discussions.europe.nokia.com.</a>&nbsp; They do not appear when typing on other sites!&nbsp; My initial feeling is that I would prefer having browser 7.2.6 back. :smileysad:<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Other bugs</u><br />
<br />
5) USB Tethering doesn't seem to be any more stable.&nbsp; Randomly (but often after a phone crash), the USB modem stops talking to the host computer, and rebooting the phone has no effect.&nbsp; More technically, it won't respond to AT commands, in the same way an external
 dialup modem acts when it's switched off.&nbsp; The only solution seems to be connecting it to Ovi Suite or PC Suite, removing the phone from the program, and then running the "Connect a device" wizard as if you're adding the phone for the first time.&nbsp; Finally,
 reboot the phone and then use Ovi Suite or PC Suite to make the first connection.&nbsp; (I typically use Linux, so this last step is important to me.&nbsp; Dialing first from Linux does not seem to revive the USB modem.)&nbsp; I recently contacted Nokia support about this
 problem and may have gotten as far as 3rd Level support...but I still have a feeling they didn't believe me. :smileysad:<br />
<br />
6) The optical scroll key still doesn't work during voice calls.<br />
<br />
7) The "Send Touch Tones" function on the voice call menu does not work!&nbsp; During a call, I believe it's supposed to translate alphabetic key presses like "N-O-K-I-A" into numbers. i.e. "6-6-5-4-2".&nbsp; Instead, the only keys allowed for input are 0-9, *, and #,
 which defeats the purpose of "Send Touch Tones". :smileysad:<br />
<br />
8) There appears to be a strange bug in the Ctrl Panel -&gt; Phone -&gt; Licenses application.&nbsp; I have three SD cards, the original 4 GB card and two 8 GB cards for music and other data (not for programs).&nbsp; One of the 8 GB cards was behaving strangely.&nbsp; Any operation
 on the card would take a very long time, during which the application would appear to lock up, and with no visible status bar.&nbsp; In addition, running "Licenses" with this card inserted would 1) crash "Licenses", and several seconds later 2) reboot the phone.&nbsp;
 "Licenses" works normally with the other two SD Cards and with no SD Card.&nbsp; I manually copied all data from the card, reformatted it, and then copied all the data back.&nbsp; Multiple runs of chkdsk (and also the GUI-based error-checker) in Windows XP now show
 no disk errors, and SD Card operations are fast again!&nbsp; But Licenses continues to crash.&nbsp; The only difference I see between this and the other 8 GB card is that it has only about 340 MB free, vs. over 2 GB free.&nbsp; Note that I copied all my .mp3 files to the
 card <em>before</em> running Licenses.&nbsp; Without doing a lot more troubleshooting (as I don't actually use Licenses and stay far away from DRM!), it seems that it's trying to write data to the card, but has a limitation that prevents it from operating above
 a certain memory boundary.&nbsp; Very strange!<br />
<br />
9) In the Music Player, display a list of artists, albums, etc. and when pressing a key to narrow the list, the initial press of the "J" key does nothing.&nbsp; All other keys respond normally.<br />
<br />
10) The Multiscanner program includes a "Check for updates" option that points to a nonexistent Nokia web page.&nbsp; Mostly irrelevant.</p>

            1), 3), 4) Life is too short to keep waiting for that almost useless browser to get any better. Use a good one that's known to work better, like Opera Mobile or Mini.<br />
<br />
5) Does it work as expected while in Windows? If so, the problem might be that of lack of compatibility or support with/for Linux since there are simply too many distros each with unique settings to make something perfectly compatible for all. If possible,
 use a virtual Windows installation from within Linux, or try a Windows emulator, or use Wine.<br />
<br />
8) I cannot say for sure for the specific situation of yours, but the phones generally handle the cards inefficiently. The data is written to them in such a way that it becomes fragmented very soon. Since the cluster size is pretty big, each of the files which
 is not an exact multiple of a power of 2 (the cluster size) uses much more memory than its actual size due to multiple fragments. Since the reported free space is total space minus the total file size, it only shows the free space that should be present as
 if the files were packed most efficiently without any gaps. But since this is not the case, the memory equal to the reported free space is often not available.<br />
<br />
In your case, the card's size is 8 GB and it shows only 340 MB free space. That means most of the space is occupied. Assuming a great many number of fragments, it's not surprising to say that it might actually have only a 100 MB or so worth of usable free space
 left, maybe even less. To determine more exactly, try copying a 330 MB file over to the card. If the copying fails, try a 320 MB one. If it fails too, try a 310 MB one, and so on.<br />
<br />
When you backup the card on a computer, format it, and then copy the files back over to it, the computer writes the files one after the other. The data is not fragmented here immediately. As a result, the reported free space is very close the actual free space
 available for writing the files (you can check this like above). Probably that's why the problem goes away for the moment when you just backup, format, and restore the data on the card.<br />
<br />
I too do not know much about the licenses to be of help here.

<p>Thanks for the replies!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1), 3), 4) Point taken.&nbsp;:smileyhappy:&nbsp; I do have Opera Mini installed, but usually forget to use it.&nbsp; But with the exception of the listed bugs, I have no problems with the Nokia browser.&nbsp; I would like to see new features like better Flash support, a "view/save
 source" option, a "copy link" option, a way to manually open a second browser "tab", and finally "hosts file" support for users, for advertisement filtering, but I wonder how many of these are supported by Opera?&nbsp; I will figure this out eventually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) When the USB modem fails, it fails <em>everywhere</em>.&nbsp; I would prefer to not use Windows at all, so it is critical that this bug gets fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8) You misunderstand...or perhaps I didn't explain properly?&nbsp; The Licenses program crashed before I backed up the files and reformatted the 8 GB SD card, and it crashed just as readily after I restored all the files!&nbsp; The 7.5GB+ of mp3 files on the card
 is currently 0% fragmented. Even if there was a high degree of fragmentation, I can't imagine that Licenses needs to write more than 100K (probably much less) of data, which would still easily fix in the available space.</p>

            About the new features in the browser. When you want to view the page source, the general assumption would be that you want to do some marking up, programming, scripting, or designing stuff, regardless of whether you merely wanna look at the URL of an
 embedded object. Given the limited resources available in a phone, only those functions are generally included that are in a great demand by most users. Therefore, sometimes you have to resort to multiple steps to achieve what you can do with a single click
 on a computer. I mean, since most people do not perform the development tasks on a phone, the view source command might not come in the near future. If you can somehow save the page in a folder, you can then open it in a text file viewer to set the source.
 To open a file with a program that's not the default for it, you might want to use an external file manager like X-plore.<br />
<br />
A copy-link option is so obviously required in a browser it's absurd to even think such a feature is not present. It's not present in the officially available Opera browsers but there's a modded version 3.12 of Opera Mini that allows you to highlight a link
 and copy its target by going to Tools &gt; Page &gt; Link &gt; Copy (you can define a keyboard shortcut if you'd use the function frequently). But then, this version of Opera Mini lacks the other features; so it's only useful when you want to copy a link without opening
 it. It also features a File Manager, an FTP Manager, a hex viewer, and a great many other functions. So, while it won't replace your day to day web browser, it can be used as a tool.<br />
<br />
Opera Mobile allows you to manually open a new tab.<br />
<br />
Yes, something like a hosts file support would be welcome in the phone OS. Actually, while it's used for filtering out certain sites, the purpose of the hosts file is to cache the IP's, which most people won't do manually and leave it up to the browsers. Therefore,
 like the view-source feature, this one is also something the devs would love to have but it's probably not in the wishlist of the majority of the users.<br />
<br />
5) Hmmm... In my case, the USB modem fails when I try to access the internet on the phone while I'm already using the phone as a modem to access the internet on the computer. Disconnecting and reconnecting the cable has no effect, and the USB connection option
 in the phone (which lets you choose whether to connect in PC Suit mode or Mass Storage mode or etc.) hangs. A restart of the phone fixes it. Frustrating, but tells me to not fiddle with the internet in both the devices at the same time.<br />
<br />
As you wrote in the original post, the modem hangs normally after a phone crash. Are you using the phone while it's connected to the computer and is being used as a modem? Or does it crash automatically while connected to the computer? In the former case, is
 there a specific function you perform that makes the phone crash, like trying to access the internet on the phone?<br />
<br />
8) Sorry about the misunderstanding. You wrote:<br />
<br />
"The only difference I see between this and the other 8 GB card is that it has only about 340 MB free, vs. over 2 GB free."<br />
<br />
Thinking that the lack of space might be of concern in case of the first card, I elaborated a possible reason. I ignored the specific program (the license one). If 100 KB is all the program needs to write, the lack of free space doesn't seem to make a difference
 in the behavior of the two cards, does it? Well, can't say for sure what exactly is happening there.

<p>I don't have trouble using Internet access on the phone concurrently with USB tethering.&nbsp; (For example, I can be tethering and still get new email notifications.)&nbsp; Hmm, I suppose Nokia updated the modem driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modem never hangs while in use.&nbsp; I will be using the phone for something else, notice it acting strangely, opt to reboot, and then ponder whether the modem will be dead the next time I need tethering.&nbsp; I have been in probably a dozen different scenarios
 where I was sure I'd finally found a reproducible case for Nokia, but every time I retried those steps, tethering would keep working.&nbsp; The best I could figure out is that installing a new program (of a certain complexity, and
<strong>the first time only!</strong>) would kill tethering.&nbsp; But as this happens just once, that's not easily reproducible.&nbsp; Recently, the Licenses program crash seems to do the trick.&nbsp; As does deleting the E:\private\101ffc31\glxmdstn file as detailed in
 one of my other threads, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/5C1727F9-D74C-43A0-BA0B-5CC711E76140">

<p>A few more bugs, compiled from other threads:<br />
<br />
1) Four junk Contacts appear in the Home screen Search plugin.&nbsp; Select Search, then Contacts.&nbsp; One example is "317c913a4aefba37" which is saved in the Contact's Last Name field. The date "12/22/-292" also appears in both the Birthday and Anniversary fields,
 and all other fields are blank.&nbsp; These four entries do not appear in the normal Contacts app and cannot be deleted within Search.<br />
<br />
2) Making the optical Navi key vibrate requires enabling vibration in Settings AND enabling "Vibrating alert" in the active Profile.&nbsp; The phone will then ALWAYS vibrate on incoming calls/messages/etc., too.&nbsp; You cannot enable Navi key vibration separately.<br />
<br />
3) When starting a new SMS/MMS message, email, Note, etc., the first character defaults to a capital letter through Nokia's "Abc" input mode (capitalize first letter).&nbsp; But at the start of the next word, line, etc. pressing Shift toggles only between the "abc",
 "Abc", and "capitalize next letter only" (the up arrow) modes.&nbsp; There is NO OPTION for caps lock.&nbsp; Caps lock can be enabled only on the SECOND letter of a word, i.e. you have to type one letter first.&nbsp; Either the initial "Abc" mode is mistakenly being carried
 into the rest of the document, or someone accidentally swapped "ABC" for "Abc" later on.<br />
<br />
4) Calendar reminders initially start with an alarm and a flashing screen, and activate up to 6 times.&nbsp; If at any point you fail to respond to a reminder by pressing Silent or Snooze, all subsequent reminders will flash the screen ONLY (without more user intervention).&nbsp;
 So unless you have visual sight of the phone, the reminder becomes worthless.&nbsp; In this state, the right soft key lists "Snooze" instead of Silent, so the phone knows the reminder is silent, but this makes no sense.&nbsp; Pressing Snooze reactivates the alarm +
 flashing screen for the NEXT reminder.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few problems I've noticed but can't easily duplicate:<br />
<br />
5) You view some images in the Gallery and later manually delete one or more of them through File Manager or a similar program.&nbsp; Placeholder icons for these images remain in the Gallery, and attempting to delete them results in a "General: System Error" message.&nbsp;
 The images were attached to a freshly-downloaded email message, and appeared in both the Gallery's Images -&gt; All and Images -&gt; Downloads sections, but attempts to repeat the bug make the images appear only in the All section.&nbsp; If the images were saved to the
 memory card, deleting the Gallery cache file in E:\Private can solve this problem, but saving the files to the phone memory has no such solution.&nbsp; In the end, viewing Photos in Ovi Suite managed to repair the corruption in C:\Private.<br />
<br />
6) I have noticed cases where Calendar reminders go silent (i.e. subsequent reminders flash the screen ONLY) no matter how I respond to a Calendar reminder, but only on the FIRST reminder.&nbsp; Put another way, the very first time a Calendar reminder occurs, whether
 I press Silent, Silent+Snooze, or do nothing, the followup reminder MAY flash the screen only.<br />
<br />
7) I have managed to crash the Calendar on a number of occasions, just by navigating around through the month view and viewing (not editing) a number of entries.&nbsp; Eventually the Calendar display disappears, although the Open Apps (task manager) list still shows
 it running.&nbsp; It tends to crash on moving up, down, left, or right within the month view.<br />
<br />
8) There is a longstanding bug (dating back to at least 2008) that still exists, where a Calendar reminder fails to repeat up to 6 times, with the message "1 or more alarms missed due to time change".&nbsp; Of course, there was no time (zone) change.&nbsp; The Calendar
 event was created and eventually deleted within a span of about 20 minutes, and the phone remained on my desk the entire time.<br />
<br />
9) Some people have complained about the clock disappearing from the home screen, and I have now seen this, too.&nbsp; It typically happens after launching a new program, which appears but then fails to respond to any keyboard input.&nbsp; I press the Home key to make
 sure something works, and then notice the missing clock.&nbsp; I thought at first this could be caused by the processor running at 100%, but that's not the case.&nbsp; Perhaps a certain program(s) are grabbing system resources and not releasing them later, and this
 resource eventually runs out?&nbsp; (The problem stared around the time I began using the Nokia Podcast program.)&nbsp; Not being a Symbian programmer, my best guess is that's it's some kind of timer resource.&nbsp; Exiting one or more programs restores the clock.<br />
<br />
10) Enabling vibration of any kind ("Vibrating alert" or Navi key vibration) doesn't necessarily work even as smoothly as described in 2) above.&nbsp; I have sometimes needed to reboot the phone first or maybe toggle some other Profile setting, too, to make the
 phone vibrate.<br />
<br />
It's possible that 5-10 all occur due to memory corruption or other scrambled system resources, but without proper debug tools, I can't do much more than continue testing and hope it eventually makes sense.</p>

<p>Two more bugs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Use the Modes program (Control Panel -&gt; Modes) to change modes (instead of the "Switch Mode" icon that can be added to the standby screen as an Application Shortcut) and the current Wallpaper setting is applied to the other mode.&nbsp; Put another way, if
 you use the Modes program to change modes, you can never retain separate wallpaper settings between the Personal and Work modes.&nbsp; Instead, change modes with the "Switch Modes" icon to keep your wallpaper settings intact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Phone vibration of any kind (either the Profile "Vibrating alert" setting or the Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Optical Nav Key -&gt; Vibration option) is disabled when the phone is charging (AC or USB).&nbsp; This applies to everything: new emails,
 SMS/MMS messages, incoming or missed calls, calendar reminders, and clock alarms.&nbsp; If the phone is in the vibrate-only Pager mode, clock alarms do still sound an audible alert. &nbsp; This bug may be the last word on 10) above.&nbsp; Or it may not?</p>

<p>I also have found the tethering to be unreliable, and I do not add applications to the phone because it is in a constant low memory state that I have never found a way to resolve (even after all of the supposed things subgested by T-Mobile and various forums).
 I have had the phone replaced multiple times, as that sems to be some obscure concept that replacing it resolves problems rather than using actual problem determination and resolution techniques. You seem to have better luck with tethering than myself, since
 even though it may vary some in stabiltiy from one replacement phone to another, it works far less often than it fails and as such it is a feature that I now ignore since it almost never works and I have seen nothing that indicates it wil be resolved in the
 future.</p>

<p>See my comments on this thread for how I fix tethering when it dies: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/D661D6FE-D564-478A-98B8-0A1D990E0ABA">
http://forums.t-mobile.com/t5/Nokia/5230-and-OVI-Suite-won-t-connect-to-Internet/td-p/753675</a> .&nbsp; I am sorry to hear it's been much less reliable for you, and would also be surprised if it dies from hardware issues.&nbsp; I've assumed that after a software install
 or crash of a certain magnitude, the state of the phone (i.e. some settings files in C:\Private) changes, and takes down tethering in the process.&nbsp; I suspect T-Mobile keeps trying to swap out your phone because that's all that's within their power to do.&nbsp;
 :smileysad:&nbsp; But both Nokia and T-Mobile are aware of the issues posted here, and hopefully the next firmware update will contain real fixes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your memory issue, what is installed to your phone memory and how much memory is typically free?&nbsp; Have you used a program like Y-Browser or X-Plore to really scour what's there?&nbsp; Per a complaint from an E72 user, I have been irregularly monitoring
 the free space on my E73.&nbsp; It's been nearly 2 weeks since I last checked, and I somehow managed to lose nearly 9 GB, but free space is still over 164 MB, and I install
<em>everything</em> to the phone.&nbsp; (The memory card gets used for Nokia Maps data, downloads, and mp3's only.)&nbsp; Worse case scenario: have you considered a hard reset?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Here is an update on my known issues with the E73 044.008 firmware.<br />
<br />
Tethering update:<br />
<br />
I continue having trouble finding a reliable way to kill tethering, but it still dies regularly enough.&nbsp; I have learned something new.&nbsp; The link I posted above, suggesting that to restore tethering it's necessary to to remove and re-add the phone in Ovi Suite,
 isn't true at least for me.&nbsp; All I must do is reboot the phone and try connecting with Ovi Suite.&nbsp; (I typically use Ubuntu Linux, so rebooting into Windows is still a hassle.)&nbsp; If I don't reboot the phone first, the modem is still dead within Windows, just
 like in Linux.&nbsp; It may be that the first modem "touch" after a reboot is important.&nbsp; If I reboot the phone and try connecting with Linux, the modem nearly always remains dead, and then requires another reboot (once I'm in Windows) to fix the problem.&nbsp; This
 also suggests that Linux could be doing more (simply a better AT initialization string?) to manage the modem, but I still don't see why rebooting isn't enough.&nbsp; If I knew which file(s) in C:\Private (the likely culprit?) controlled the USB modem and tethering,
 I could watch for changes.<br />
<br />
Licenses app update:<br />
<br />
My speculation above, that Licenses can only write to certain lower parts of the memory card, is incorrect.&nbsp; I temporarily deleted several mp3 files for bands with names at the start of the alphabet, but Licenses still crashed.&nbsp; (My music files are stored in
 folders named after the bands, and then in folders named after the albums.)&nbsp; Maybe it wants to write a lot more data than I think, or maybe the 1321 mp3's on the card are too much for it?<br />
<br />
Browser bugs:<br />
<br />
1) Visit <a href="http://www.dvdcompare.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dvdcompare.net</a> and the Nokia browser crashes after about 100K if it's using the default settings.&nbsp; The program closes and is no longer on the task list.&nbsp; Disabling Javascript
 has no effect, but disabling images loads the page normally.&nbsp; The previous 7.2.6 browser also had trouble with this page and took roughly 5 minutes to load/render, but never crashed.<br />
<br />
2) There are a number of other web pages that render poorly or crash the browser, but I'll also cite
<a href="http://www.justin.tv." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.justin.tv.</a>&nbsp; The home page appears to ignore all supplied CSS, it's impossible to bypass the "Please verify you are 18 or older" popup (not hard to encounter)...possibly a cookie problem
 (?), and logging into the site is also impossible...cookies again (?).&nbsp; Note that I'm not complaining about the missing Flash videos. :)<br />
<br />
3) about: links like about: blank and about: plugins make the Nokia browser go a little crazy.&nbsp; The right soft key changes to Stop (pressing it has no effect), the window blanks, and a progress bar appears...then nothing happens.&nbsp; It's still possible to use
 the Options menu to load Bookmarks, exit the browser, etc.<br />
<br />
4) On the Bookmarks list, you can usually launch a "Go to" URL field by pressing any alphanumeric key, except that the U and J keys have no effect.&nbsp; U and J correspond to * and #, so on an actual web page would control zooming the page in and out.&nbsp; This has
 no relevance to the Bookmarks page, but the keys are blocked from performing their expected function.<br />
<br />
Other issues:<br />
<br />
5) Sending an email from a web mailto: link or from within Contacts (Options -&gt; Create Message -&gt; Email) shows a poor GUI effect after you've sent the email.&nbsp; The right soft key changes to "Close" which results in two further options, "Save to drafts" and "Delete".&nbsp;
 Choosing "Delete" does nothing (the email window remains displayed).&nbsp; Choosing "Save to drafts" is the only way to close the email window, but the email never goes to Drafts.&nbsp; (It does go to Sent messages automatically.)&nbsp; This problem doesn't happen with SMS/MMS
 messages (Options -&gt; Create Message -&gt; Message), as the window closes on its own.&nbsp; I think this should also be happening for emails.<br />
<br />
6) Voice tags for sending email and SMS/MMS messages can fail if more than one email address is configured.&nbsp; I have two POP3 accounts running through the Nokia Email program, i.e. without a Nokia Messaging account.&nbsp; If these voice tags work better in a different
 configuration, I wouldn't know.&nbsp; What seems to happen is that "message" voice tags work normally until I try an "email" voice tag.&nbsp; At that point, all email and SMS/MMS voice tags fail completely until a reboot.&nbsp; The phone recognizes the command, finds the
 proper email address or phone number...but no GUI interface appears.&nbsp; The only permanent solution is to have just one email account.&nbsp; I have never tried this with any version of Email besides 3.09.0, but have a suspicion earlier releases will behave the same.<br />
<br />
7) With the above email configuration, switching email storage from the phone to the memory card using Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Other -&gt; Memory In Use within the Messaging program, causes my email mailboxes (normally on the list of folders in Messaging) to temporarily
 disappear.&nbsp; I can still access them either through the Email program or through any email plugins on the standby screen.&nbsp; The mailboxes in Messaging eventually reappear on their own.&nbsp; I used to think I could jog them into view by rebooting, sending myself
 an email, temporarily changing another Email or Messaging setting, etc. but this doesn't appear so.&nbsp; The problem doesn't appear affected by whether the "Copy all messages to the new message memory?" prompt appears.&nbsp; I also don't keep the message storage on
 the memory card long enough to receive new messages, in case that is relevant.&nbsp; As the message and email storage is simply being
<em>moved</em>, I wonder why the mailboxes would disappear from the list <em>at all</em>?<br />
<br />
8) The OS uses a fade-out effect for title bar text that is too long to fully fit.&nbsp; Some easy examples of this are in Settings: General -&gt; Personalization, General -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Standby Mode -&gt; Mode Settings -&gt; Application Shortcuts, and General -&gt;
 Security -&gt; Security Module.&nbsp; The problem is that the text is cut off unnecessarily short, i.e. there is still a lot of usable space in the title bar.&nbsp; In the first two examples, scrolling up and down through the various options eventually causes the hidden
 text to "spring up" on the right.&nbsp; Purely a cosmetic error, but one that's led to some confusion.<br />
<br />
One more "can't easily duplicate" issue:<br />
<br />
9) An E72 user once complained that setting the phone lock feature made his phone unstable.&nbsp; I tried this on my E73, and during the first day had to remove the battery to recover from 2 or 3 total lockups.&nbsp; I don't recall the nature of each problem, but one
 happened near the start of playing a video through the YouTube app.&nbsp; In my previous 6 months of ownership, removing the battery was only necessary when testing software not fully compatible with my phone.&nbsp; Removing the phone lock fixed the problem, and after
 re-enabling it the following day, I have had no similar lockups.&nbsp; Weird.</p>

<p>A short addendum:&nbsp; on February 20th, I mentioned a problem with the standby screen clock&nbsp; disappearing, and keyboard input sometimes simultaneously failing for a newly-started program.&nbsp; I don't know if this is the case for everyone, but I just narrowed it
 down to a bad interaction between F-Secure Anti-Theft (the free download) and Java programs like Opera Mini.&nbsp; Remove Anti-Theft and the problem appears to go away.&nbsp; I don't know if Anti-Theft is partly written in Java and the OS can't handle running too many
 Java programs, or if it's something else.&nbsp; But Anti-Theft is no longer on my phone and the clock problem is gone.&nbsp; I have contacted F-Secure for advice.</p>

<h2>            ActiveX Combo Box - Password Protected Options</h2>
                    I was just wondering if there is a way to password protect some of the options in a drop down list in the ActiveX combo box. I want it so that if theres a list of A B C then I would like a different password to have to be entered everytime someone changes
 that in the drop down list. Thanks in advance for your help!!

<p>How is the ComboBox list populated. Is it a worksheet range, AddItem from VBA code or setting the List property from an array?</p>

<p>If from a worksheet range then the best way would be to have the list on a worksheet that can be protected.</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 picture-style bullets not available in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously used Microsoft Word 2010 but have since upgraded to Microsoft 2013(Office 365). In Word 2010, when I wanted to define a new bullet( so I would click on Bullet--&gt;Define new bullet there would be three options: symbol, picture and font. For the
 picture bullets there were several options to choose from to use a bullet. I have noticed, however that in Word 2013, when I click on Picture( Bullet) I do not get a a list of picture-style bullets instead I am prompted to use an image from my computer or
 search online. I really liked the Picture bullets from Word 2010 and was hoping I could use them in Word 2013. I must mention that I no longer have Word 2010( no saved copy at all--it was a trial version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>This change is part of Microsoft's decision to stop packaging any kind of clip art with Office. You have a few alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a friend who is still using Office 2010 or earlier, who can copy the Bullets folder from their computer to a disk or USB drive. For Office 2010, that folder is at&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\MEDIA\OFFICE14\BULLETS (for earlier versions,
 change the "14" to the appropriate version number. Then copy that to any convenient folder on your computer, from which you can select bullets using the "From a file" method. [Caveat: this is a copyright violation.]</li><li>Download a collection of bullets from the Internet. A useful search term is "free clipart bullets". An example of what you may find is
<a href="http://www.wilsoninfo.com/bullets.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.wilsoninfo.com/bullets.htm</a>.</li><li>Buy a clipart collection. These often have a large selection of high-quality bullet images.</li></ul>

    <title>What is the keyboard shortcut for scrolling down to the end of a Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arianavincent  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the keyboard shortcut for scrolling down to the end of a Word document on a Mac&#63;</h2>
                    What is the keyboard shortcut for scrolling to the end of a document using Microsoft Word on a 2018 MacBookPro?
<br />
<br />
I tried command/down arrow and command/up arrow and neither worked. <br />
<br />
I also tried control/down and control/up and that did not work. <br />
<br />
I called Microsoft support and was on the phone and on hold with them for over 25 minutes and no one knew the answer.
<br />
<br />
Eventually, the tech said that my Mac computer did not have the right buttons. Go figure. How frustrating.
<br />
<br />
Basically, he said that I needed an extended keyboard. <br />
<br />
He said that I need to manually scroll or use the scroll bar. <br />
<br />
He gave me the impression that Microsoft Word does not have the ability to allow the user to scroll down to the bottom of a document.
<br />
<br />
Then he disconnected my call without saying goodbye.<br />

<p>As Charles indicated, the keyboard shortcut for going to the <em>end</em> of a document is
<strong>Command+End</strong> if you're using a full keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you're using a laptop or condensed keyboard there typically is no dedicated
<strong>End</strong> key... It's incorporated into the ▶︎ as a secondary function. Unfortunately, it often is not printed on the key cap. You'll need to use the
<em><strong>fn</strong></em> key along with <strong>Command+▶︎</strong> so the actual key combination is
<strong>fn+Command+▶︎</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com not receiving emails from some senders</h2>
                    <p>My outlook.com email account is not showing emails sent to me from some senders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an account with another provider that is forwarding the emails as well as putting them in it's own mailbox.&nbsp; For several senders the emails are arriving OK in the other provider mailbox, but not in the outlook.com mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The senders whose messages I've found to be missing so far are organisations sending regular information or newsletters.&nbsp; I've checked the Junk mail folders and deleted items and don't find them there.&nbsp; I don't have clutter turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to trace what's happening to these messages?&nbsp; Is there anyway to find which senders are effected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bit strange that legitimate email is disappearing without a trace.&nbsp; Anyone any ideas what might be happening?</p>

<h2>            continuous vibrate email alert </h2>
                    I have two issues with WM 6.1 standard:<br />
<br />
1. My smartphone is configured to vibrate as well make a noise when it receives an email. When I received one today, it vibrated for hours until I pressed a button. This drained my battery;
<br />
2. When I switch my phone off and on, and browse through my contacts, my keys are jumbled up. I have to go to 'All Settings' -&gt; 'Adaptxt options' -&gt; 'mode' and then press done to correct this.
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how to correct these faults?<br />

I'm not quite sure what happened there.&nbsp; What device do you have?&nbsp; <br />
I would probably do a soft reset and try it then I might set a different tone if that did not work.&nbsp; Make sure that it is not set to repeat if that option is available.<br />
<br />

Can you explain that a little more?&nbsp; I'm not quite sure what you are explaining.

<h2>            Birthdays and Anniversaries in Calendar</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Nokia 5800. I&nbsp;PC Sync to synchronize contacts and calendars from MS Outlook. As and when I insert a Birthday or Anniversary in the contact, it gets sync on the phone but doesnt show as a calendar reminder or alarm unlike other calendar entries.
 My earlier SONY Phone used to support this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the ways out for the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            IIRC symbian just do not support this feature, this is specific to sony handsets. at least I can confirm for 3rd edition phone with and without FPS. They do not have this functionality.

    <title>Syntax error in FROM clause - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galla_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syntax error in FROM clause</h2>
                    The following SQL works just fine as the rowsource for a list box in an adp. It also works in SQL Server (with the "dbo_" part removed from the table names). However, it doesn't work in the accdb I'm converting to and gives me a "Syntax error in FROM clause"
 error.<br />
<br />
select EID as [ID], s.Definition as [Site], fname + ' ' + lname as [Name] <br />
from dbo_lk_ID as m join dbo_lk_site as s on m.site = s.site join dbo_RAND as r on m.EID = r.ID
<br />
where len(ID) &gt;= 8 <br />
order by Len(EID) desc, EID desc<br />
<br />
I would appreciate your help.<br />

<h2>            Free trial of Office 365 is not working on Mac OS</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I've downloaded and installed Office 365 directly from the Microsoft website, but no matter what application I open, it's saying that my "account (null) has an expired Office subscription" - I literally started my free trial today. When I try to renew my
 subscription to activate my free trial, it doesn't work either. I don't have the option to view my account directly through the applications either.</p>
