<h2>            LCD Monitor shuts off after windows loading screen</h2>
                    hiyas, just got a new pc running windows vista home basic, everythings updated drivers n all, but im having a problem with my monitor. Im running a radeon hd4870 v-card also with newest drivers. The monitor that wont fuly load is a viewsonic vx2035wm.
 This monitor works fine on my other windowsxp machine with a radeonx1300 with same type of card. I have tested other monitors on my new system such as a samsung 2233 and all works fine. I have visited both companies websites and am getting frustrated by the
 run around. One post mentioned a driver that was missing from vista that was present in windowsxp which makes sense. Unfortunetly for me, i can no longer find this post. Would you guys have any ideas about this issue? Thank You in advance for any help you
 can give.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            Chris, what Jeremy was eluding to is absolutely correct. If your monitor is stopping after the windows loading screen then this is a driver issue (whether it is settings or compatibility), because it is at that stage that the drivers and their settings
 get applied.<br />
<br />
You did not however state whether you tried this situation in Safe Mode or Safe Mode + VGA. Here are the steps:<br />
<p><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/f9c50a72-04ec-4088-9fd4-a4f979eef5a71033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</a></p>
<br />
Another piece of advice I will send your way is to check Viewsonic's website. I found some drivers that were labeled as generic Vista drivers. Although windows will automatically apply default drivers when necessary, some monitors do require driver installation.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to Viewsonic's website:<br />

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these methods:  
<br />
<br />Method 1.
<br />Run the Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />  
<br />1.Download the ﻿Windows Update Troubleshooter, and then select Open or Save in the pop-up window:
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/wudiag</a>
<br />
<br />Notes
<br />	• If the pop-up doesn’t come up, you might have a pop-up blocker on. If you’re using Microsoft Edge, instructions for disabling the pop-up blocker are here. For Internet Explorer, instructions are here. If you are using a different browser or separate pop-up blocker, check the website of the browser or blocker’s manufacturer.
<br />	• If you select Save, you need to go to the folder where the troubleshooter is downloaded to after the download is complete, and then double-click the latest wu.diagcab file to run the troubleshooter.
<br />	
<br />2.Select Next and follow the steps in the wizard to find and fix problems with Windows Update .
<br /> 
<br />Method 2.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent Servicing Stack Update (SSU)
<br />
<br />Determine whether you are using 32-bit or 64-bit Windows:
<br />	1. From Start, choose Settings.
<br />	2. Select System.
<br />	3. Click About.
<br />	4. Scroll down to System type.
<br />Download the version of the latest SSU (KB4456655) that matches your version of Windows from the Microsoft Update Catalog. 
<br />Restart your device and check for updates.
<br />Did this resolve the issue?
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 3.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent KB
<br />
<br />	1. Go to the Update history page. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/windows-10-update-history?ocid=update_setting_client" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/window...</a>
<br />	2. Find the most recent update KB for the version of Windows 10 you have – it’s usually at the top of the list – and either write the KB number down or copy it.
<br />	3. Go to the Microsoft Update site and search for the KB number. <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Hom...</a>
<br />	4. Select the link for the download, and then choose Download. Select Save if you are prompted. 
<br />	5. When the download completes, select Open to start the update.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 4.
<br />
<br />Fix Windows file corruption
<br />
<br />Important
<br />You need to run both the DISM and SFC commands shown below, not just one of them.
<br />	1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, right click the Windows button, and then select Command Prompt (Admin). If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow or Yes.
<br />	2. Type the following command, and then press Enter.
<br />	DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	3. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />	sfc /scannow
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	4. Close the command prompt, and then run Windows Update again.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Method 5.
<br />Perform an in-place upgrade
<br />
<br />Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool (MCT) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/win...</a> and use it to perform an “in-place upgrade” of Windows 10. We have a video that can show you how if you aren’t sure. <a href="https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall</a>

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />If you are an older release,
<br />Try updating to 1809 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

    <title>OneDrive small cloud icon on taskbar disappears windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneDrive small cloud icon on taskbar disappears  windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Every morning when I start my computer the OneDrive small cloud icon from the taskbar is missing.</p>
<p>After I get it back on, it is good all day even when I shut down my computer and start it again later in the day. &nbsp;Let me say that I have very little knowledge about windows 10, however, it makes me think that something runs during the night that removes
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is possible, does anyone have an idea what might be causing it to disappear or why this is happens?</p>

            <p>Hi Maxine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that the OneDrive cloud icon is not set to appear in your taskbar and is only shown when you're signed in with your Microsoft account. You can control which icons you want to always appear in taskbar by going to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Personalization </strong>&gt; <strong>Taskbar</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. To open Windows settings, press the <strong>Windows key + I</strong>. You can also right click on an empty space in the taskbar and select
<strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/812dccdb-6acd-4756-b777-747469c1c662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/812dccdb-6acd-4756-b777-747469c1c662" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Under <strong>Personalization</strong>, click <strong>Taskbar</strong>. Scroll down just a little bit and click
<strong>Select which icons appear on the taskbar</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dada0c15-bb73-4ee5-8b19-f160cc6f4e97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dada0c15-bb73-4ee5-8b19-f160cc6f4e97" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Make sure the slider beside <strong>Microsoft OneDrive</strong> is set to <strong>
On</strong>. The OneDrive cloud icon should now appear at all times once that's configured.</p>
<p>

            <p>Cedeeh Bal, I have already posted above and believed my problem was corrected, however, I just restarted my computer for something I was doing and when I signed in again; my OneDrive icon on the taskbar was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible their is another reason that you know of that could cause this to continue to happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is quite easy to just put the command in the run bar and get it back each time but it certainly is a nuisance. &nbsp;More than that, sometimes when I get the icon back on the taskbar, the sync settings are no longer the way I had them set. &nbsp;Should I forget
 to check it, I find myself doing hours of work that did not sync and I really hate when that happens.</p>

<p>Hi everyone.... <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I have a solution for this problem</strong></span>.<span><em>driver update fails hp LaserJet 1320 series - Error 0x80240061</em>

<p>I wasted my whole week to search for fix and tried every solution but failed.</p>
<p>lastly I thought to roll back to previous version of windows, simultaneously a thought came into my mind, "I should try the driver for windows 8.1 in current windows''.
</p>
<p>so I opened HP printer drivers and changed the windows to 8.1, and downloaded UPD( Universal Print Driver for PLC 5.. Size about 18 mb.&nbsp;<br />

device manager&gt;update driver&gt;search my com for driver&gt; browse the driver and install.<br />
I hope it will solve your problem as well.</p>

<p>HP abandoned that printer after Windows XP. The last driver was issued on April 30, 2004.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without support from the manufacturer, it's just a matter of time before a printer stops working properly, or stops working altogether. Be glad that your printer has worked up till now - that's quite a run!</p>

<h2>            Not Fully Shuting Down &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>With Every Version of Windows 10 i tried it been the Same i tried Enterprise, Education, Home, Pro, Technical (Basically Every Version)</p>
<p>It been the same and i might turn back to Windows 7&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue with it was it wont shutdown when i shut it down the thing goes blank and stops working but it still making heat and no lights on my Dell Inspiron 15 5547 (Laptop) it makes heat and the only way to shut it down or power back on is when its at that
 stage to hold down the power button for 10 seconds then click it again it got very annoying and i wonder is this a bug in windows 10</p>
<p>

 a working laptop and i dont want it to stay this and heating up and when it isnt plugged in it will be dead the next morning for school and this is also why i am scared to upgrade to windows 10 on my desktop and i am wondering if it will affect my Desktop
 as Well because even though really windows 10 wasnt that polished like windows 7 was at released i always want to stay with</p>
<p>microsoft and hope my teacher wont force me into getting a Mac because she keep telling me this wont happen if you have a Mac and if i can get this fixed it will be nice and also my desktop specs will be put bellow&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am Still Having issues and it wont work&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it says only screen saver is enabled which then i disable it and it still happendeds also when i am using it more and more and more windows 10 is super buggy i am wondering why wasnt windows 10 keeped in Technical Preview and then i will under stand&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When i Power Off my Laptop it will stay on it is silent and it will still produce heat and i am getting worried since windows 10 is going to damage my laptop since all the fans will turn off and will be just hanging there and i can feel the heat build
 up and then the laptop lights will be off</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When i close my lid i told my laptop to stay on but when i do that it make the disconnecting device sound and it will disconnect my trackpad and it is very annoying since i am a student and if i close my laptop and my trackpad will turn off i am going
 to need to carry those Microsoft Wireless Mouses with me and i want to use the thing that comes with my laptop since i already spended alot on the laptop already and i dont want to carry my laptop around with a mouse because its just taking too much space
 in my Laptop Bag</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When i plug in my earpuds it make static like hisssss..... and when i am playing audio it start crackling i update my drivers to the latest one but still</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. everytime i unplug my ethernet cord from my laptop because my room i am at barley have internet signal so i use a powerline and when i unplug it windows will crash and will say diffrent errors everytime and i update the drivers still the same issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. If you have a slow hard drive the "Search the web and Windows" cortana will make like a few minutes to open and its getting annoying since it was snappy on my new 480GB SandDisk Ultra II SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. My Fan will Ramp up to max RPM Randomly even though the CPU isnt hot and it is damaging my fans&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. it will glitch the touch screen and will do random touches and i am forced to turn it off in device manager because its glitching too much</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>More i use windows 10 makes me want to get back to my older version of windows but its too late since microsoft already changed the key I am getting more aware that windows 10 is not a complete build but i am think why did Microsoft take it out of developing
 stage and why didnt they keep it in were all the issues will be fixed because if its damaging my laptop and crashing all the time this shouldnt be happening because Dell said it was a Windows 10 issue and they cant do anything for me and i am there thinking
 1 of my friends got one of those Laptops from the Microsoft show thingy and i asked him if he is having any issues and he is not really having any issues and i think why did microsoft take time on 1 device to make it smooth and call it a day because when i
 updated 7 of my computer in the whole household it is giving some of the same issues&nbsp;</p>

 the BIOS from DELL Support page. The New BIOS for the Inspiron i3542 is: A08. Also UPDATE the Intel Management Interface Driver from: Device Manager &gt; System Devices &gt; Right click on INTEL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE DRIVER &gt; right click on Properties &gt; finally click
 on Update Driver. Let the System Download and Install the New Driver: Version 11.0,0.1157. Finally Reboot your laptop and Test: Sllep&gt; Shutdown time, etc. This corrected all my problems ok?. Good luck and report back your results please... &nbsp; Aaron...</span>

            <p>Still having the problem i updated the bios the day i was going to update and the drivers but right now still the issue right now i am downloading my Copy of Windows 7 laying around and downgrade because i need my laptop in 2days and if my laptop fails due

<h2>            RECYCLER &#47; &#36;RECYCLE.BIN Virus- how to remove</h2>
                    I have picked up the Recycler virus when I lent my external hard drive to a friend. I have tried all the online solutions I can find but nothing works. It seems whenever I get near to deleting anything important to the virus it blue screens my computer
 and shuts me down. I've tried as many things as my small amount of technical know-how goes and cant erase it.&nbsp;<br />
I've been on the CMD sending suggested commands through but none seem to work or be able to track down the virus. It hides itself and other files so I've unhidden all my&nbsp;documents&nbsp;but I can't seem to shake it. I've read formatting the computer&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;work
 as it just recreates itself like when you&nbsp;delete&nbsp;it. The only option I haven't yet tried is using a mac to at least delete it off the external drive.&nbsp;
<div>I'm not the most computer savy person in the world so any help as to exactly what it is and what to do would be much appreciated.</div>

<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can refer to the following article and try downloading the Microsoft Safety Scanner and perform a
 full scan from Safe mode on you r external hard drive.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Microsoft
 Safety Scanner </span></span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Start
 your computer in safe mode</span></span></a><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: When you perform the scan, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup of important
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you don’t have any data in the external hard drive, then you can try formatting the external harddrive from safe mode and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.

<h2>            No sound, no XP install disc and no sndvol32.exe file in system32&#47;dllcache folder.. So how can I get my sound back&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been through as many of the fixes suggested on the forum as possible so feel I have to post this as a new question. I have no sound on my computer anymore. I reckon it was an accidental deletion of key files during an uninstall of some programs. Anyway,
 the double wammy problem is that I:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Do not have my XP install disc anymore because it got lost long ago, and</li><li>I do not have the sndvol32.exe file in system32/dllcache folder so can't paste it back into the system 32 folder</li></ol>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So how can I get my sound back!?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My laptop's really old and this is just the tip of the iceberg in &nbsp;the problems its got, but I can't afford a new computer at the moment so any help is greatly appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>The above article will show you how to install sndvol32.exe from the CD.</p>
<p>Since you do not have one you can borrow one from someone.</p>
<p>You can also copy the file from another computer.</p>
<p>Since you have a iceberg under this issue why not try to install the clone from the link below.</p>
<p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/Minimixer/3000-2169_4-10074198.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Minimixer/3000-2169_4-10074198.html</a></p>
<p>XP OS CDs are very inexpensive now so maybe you should purchase one and do a clean install instead of chipping away at the iceberg and save yourself headaches.</p>

<h2>            Auto KMS Problem</h2>
                    I have Brand New Lenovo Z510 with win 8.1. The problem is that my antivirus (vipre) detected AutoKMS as a threat, when i search for the threat i discovered that my windows was activated by Auto KMS. So my question is activating windows with AutoKMS is
 legal? AutoKMS let me to an original copy of Windows? If the answer is no, what can i do? Because this is a laptop bought from Lenovo Store.

            <p>KMS refers to Key Management Server. This is normally used by volume license client Windows 8.1 licenses which are used in managed IT environments on thousands of computers. Its used for the volume activation of these computers without having to manually
 do so. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Its possible the AutoKMS is a variant of this which is used by OEMs to automatically activate thousands of Lenovo systems with the same Windows 8.1 image from the factory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could configure your Vipre antivirus to ignore it if you are not getting any activation error messages from Windows itself.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 problem with &#34;Save As&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothybooth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 problem with &#34;Save As&#34;</h2>
                    I have just moved to Windows 7 from XP and I like it.<br />
<br />
I often need to save files with a name similar to already existing files.<br />
<br />
In XP I selected "Save as" then went to the existing file location, clicked that file once and the name appeared in the "File name" bar.&nbsp; I would then just edit the file name to the new name and save.<br />
<br />
When I try this approah in Windows 7 I get the dialog box asking if I want to replace the existing file even though the new file now has a different name.<br />
<br />
Anyone come across this?<br />
<br />
<br />

            The link worked fine. &nbsp;It just doesn't address the glitch. &nbsp;It is just basic instructions on using "Save" and "Save As". &nbsp;The post was not about normal Save functions. &nbsp;It was about the glitch. &nbsp;I kept searching and found another more recent thread about
 this problem. &nbsp; The person offered a work around that I am going to try.

<h2>            Sometimes getting 0x8009002d error when signing in using PIN on Windows 10 1703</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this problem for a reasonably long time with my Dell Precision 5520 (in fact since I bought it). Sometimes (maybe every 3 times the screen locks), when I enter my PIN I get an error message with the code 0x8009002d, and I have to enter my password.
 I can restart, and that does fix the issue, but the issue comes back eventually. It did go away for a while when I installed Windows 10 1703 (as an update), but it has not come back. I have tried changing my PIN, but I get the error "An internal consistency
 check has failed". Is there any way I can resolve this as it is really frustrating</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>Alternatively, where can I get a copy of Windows Live Mail, so that I can at least restore my e-mail and then transfer it to another e-mail client.</p>

<h2>            Go back to Windows 10 Home from Windows 10 Home Insider Preview</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an issue with windows update on my windows 10 home, so I chatted with Microsoft help desk and the tech remotely controlled my laptop in order to fix the issue. He then did some upgrades that changed the edition of my windows from windows 10 home x64
 to windows 10 home insider preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, I lost contact with that tech, so I tried chatting with other techs but they said that it was that tech's fault and that they can't help me. They asked for the product key, but since I bought this HP laptop with a preinstalled windows 8.1 back
 in December, I didn't have the product key. The only way for me to go back to windows 10 home is to downgrade to windows 8.1, i.e. restore to factory settings and then upgrade back to windows 10 home, but I don't want to do that as it will erase everything
 from my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How am I supposed to go back to windows 10 home without doing a full restore on my laptop ? and how on earth did the tech downgrade my windows edition WITHOUT my permission ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>yes it says "Windows 10 Home Insider Preview Evaluation copy. Build 10565" in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the laptop with windows 8.1 preinstalled back in December. I upgraded to windows 10 Home on July 29th.&nbsp;I had some issues lately with windows update, so I chatted with the help desk and the tech downgraded it to Windows 10 Home Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on the activation panel, I see the following:</p>
<p>Edition: Windows 10 Home Insider Preview</p>
<p>Activation: Windows is activated</p>
<p>Product Key: Windows 10 on this device is activated with a digital entitlement</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's an option that says "Change product key"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the command button and it says that I'm permanently activated. and No, before yesterday, I never had the insider built.</p>

<p>There's an option to stop the insider preview builds. I don't know if that would take it back to windows 10 home or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can do a clean installation of windows 10 using the windows 10 upgrade media tool. However, when I get to "where to keep" windows, three options are provided. 1) Keep personal files and apps. 2) Keep personal files only. 3) Keep nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only option that I can choose is the 3rd option. I can't select either 1 or 2.</p>
<p>I have many licensed apps on my laptop, and I really don't want to restore it to factory settings. This will be costly and time consuming, and all of this happened because a Microsoft support tech changed the edition without permission.</p>

Clean Install Windows 10</a> .&nbsp; However if you feel you can't do this now then we can look for another solution.&nbsp; I only wanted you to be aware that this is your hands-down best option to go from chronic problems to perfect performance.&nbsp; I would help you see
 to that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The change to Insider Build when you'd never had one to begin with is so unusual that I have elevated it to the Windows 10 developers for their attention and possible resolution.&nbsp; I'll let you know what I hear as soon as they reply, probably Monday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be no reason why you could not opt-out of Insider builds since you're permanently activated, so it should revert to RTM.&nbsp;&nbsp; But since there's such an anomaly here possibly affected by deep corruption of the install which brought you to Support
 in the first place, and you're not amenable to getting the best install of all at this time, then we should probably wait to hear from those who built the OS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>That sounds good, as I really don't want to delete everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to permanently opt out of Insider Build, but it didn't let me. Afterwards, it referred me to Windows 10 installation media tool http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this will help, but the tech did go on the cmd prompt window and did a couple of things before the upgrade to the insider version took place. However, I don't recall the commands that he inserted. There was this percent completion bar and
 it was stuck at 20% for quite some while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, we'll wait and see what the OS builders would say</p>

<p>Hi Sam -</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to install Works first.&nbsp; It's a discontinued program, but it still installs to Windows 10 and works fine as I use it myself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not compatible with Word but apparently the trial version of Word on the new Dell picked them up in error and is trying to open them.&nbsp; If you ever need to open Office Files and don't want to buy Office you can install free<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
</span><a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LibreOffice - Free Office Suite&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So install <a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/55-microsoft-works-9-0-direct-download-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Works 9.0 Direct Download Links</a> and it should open the Works files, but if not, right click to Open With and browse to Works to associate them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition the factory install is an inferior install of Windows that most tech enthusiasts won't run in the first place.&nbsp; You can have&nbsp; the best install following
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">

<p>Thanks Greg. &nbsp; I had already installed it works 8.0. &nbsp;When I tried to open all hell broke loose and when I wouldn't pay their blood money for Word I was locked out of my files. &nbsp;There was not way to open automatically with work and all were changed to word.
 &nbsp;I know I screwed some things up in the directions but I eventually signed. &nbsp;Somewhere in your note was Libre office which I followed an loaded. &nbsp;I then was able to get through them an app that has all my .wps files opening with works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I get to try and make pictures easier than the photo viewer garbage.</p>

<p>Update:<br />
It appears that my 2 mentioned failed updates don't apply to Vista with SP2 (service pack 2)... as with my system.</p>
<p>There were 2 other updates amoug the 9 that addressed the same security issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I'm gussing that the problem is that "Windows Update" screening&nbsp;wasn't/isn't proberly detecting the correct system aspects?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you still haven’t got any support on this then .NET Framework setup team can help investigate further by looking into the logs
 from your machine. You can get detailed logs from your machine for complete analysis by running the log collection utility, from elevated command prompt, from here:

    <title>Oblivion GOTY Edition freezes at random times - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Oblivion GOTY Edition freezes at random times</h2>
                    
<p>I know this is pretty dumb, but I'm having a weird problem.</p>

<p>Alright, so in January I got Oblivion Game of the Year Edition. (in mint condition at GameStop, pure luck) I bought it.. and just now got to get into it. As I walked out of a building and used magic, the game froze. This happened a time before, when I walked
 into a house and there was an invisible person.. apparently the character model didn't load. I tried attacking it, and the game froze. Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>


<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>There is no way to fix this. Bethesda games freeze on occasion, especially if you are playing for a long time in one sitting. The best thing you can do is save often in different slots so you aren't losing much time when the game freezes. It's annoying when
 it happens, but it shouldn't be happening very often.</p>

<p>No it is fixable have you ever tried clearing the system cache it makes games go faster and makes them not freeze as much go to system settings memory and what you have it saved on where it shows the memory unit and the hardrive press y and say yes to cache
 it will say performing maintenance this could make it freeze less but older games intent to freeze more.</p>

<p>@Ninja Goboree: I tried clearing the cache.. but I did it a different way. I was told to hold the A button when the game was booting up until I see the Bethesda Softworks logo. Is that basically the same thing?</p>

    <title>Turning off vibration for Arc Touch Mouse on Macbook Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tobyzaida  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turning off vibration for Arc Touch Mouse on Macbook Pro</h2>
                    I just got the Arc Touch Mouse for my Macbook Pro, running on Yosemite 10.10.1. I would like to turn of the scroll vibration/clicking noise that occurs when I use the scroll wheel on the mouse. I have checked my system preferences, under the "Microsoft
 Mouse" preferences, where the help guide says that there should be an option to directly turn off the vibration. However, there is no such option apparent, despite the fact that everything else appears to be working just fine. Is there any other approach I
 can take to turning off the vibration, or should I just learn to live with it?

            If you can turn it off on a windows computer, then it will remain off on your mac too!<br />

    <title>Streaming videos &#40;like youtube&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zandbj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Streaming videos &#40;like youtube&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have this nasty issue and would like a solution or suggestions</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 desktop 3 laptops on the same network. Network speed download 6Mb (not much but stable :-))<br />
desktop and 2 laptops on windows 10 and 1 Laptop on windows 7. All pcs are fully updated including drivers etc and&nbsp;all PCs are&nbsp;Playing youtube with HTML5&nbsp; ( I checked the below data with the html5 option "stats voor nerts"</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the windows 7 PC&nbsp;I have no issue at all&nbsp;(buffer fills up to 100 seconds and higher, connection speed shows 6Mb) .
</p>
<p>On all windows 10 machines with youtube html5 buffers load maybe 5 to 10 secs then empties waits and then loads again a few seconds. The Connection speeds showing varies between 800k and 1.2MB (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>so way under
 the network speed</strong></span>).</p>
<p>In the task manager I can see that the net&nbsp;bandwidth doesn't change and has plenty of bandwidth to support the stream.</p>
<p>I removed all but one PC from the net and have the same issue (Plenty of bandwidth but still the same issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took one of the windows 10 laptops to another location&nbsp;that has&nbsp;a 100Mb network and this same laptop (without any changes) now streams YouTube without any issues. But also with a reduced connection speed for the HTML5.<br />
<br />
How do I solve this at home. How can I let&nbsp; windows give the full network speed to the application as it does in windows 7???<br />
I looked every where but can't find an answer......? All suggestion thoughts, pointers welcome.<br />
<br />
Ps. I did contact Microsoft on this&nbsp;3 times&nbsp;and all they can come up with is update your drivers, clear your cache and their standard list of cleanups and fixes.&nbsp;All done up to a full repair but&nbsp; no success!<br />
<br />
ps2. Netflix plays fine If I use the app. Some other applications stream fine as well through the browser&nbsp;others show the same issue like YouTube (like MSN etc)<br />
<br />
ps3. I Used different browsers edge, chrome all give&nbsp;exactly the same issues </p>
<p>
</p><p>ps4.&nbsp;My windows phone streams&nbsp;youtube etc fine and without a problem on the same network</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm almost at the level of setting all my PCs&nbsp; back to windows 7!! </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
