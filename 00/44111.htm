<h2>            Remote Desktop Access for Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    I want to buy a netbook from Verizon that runs on Windows 7 home premium.&nbsp; If I left that netbook at my office and it was plugged in and turned on, can I go home and use the Remote Desktop Connection function to connect to the Netbook computer at my office
 that's running the Windows 7 Home Premium?

            I'm sorry, but Home Premium can't accept connections via Remote Desktop.&nbsp; That requires Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried them on Windows 7 Home Premium, but remote control programs that might work include

    <title>Can&#39;t add Shared Printer Without Credentials - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmartz65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add Shared Printer Without Credentials</h2>
                    <p>I have been printing from one computer to a printer connected to another computer on my small office network for Years.&nbsp; A few weeks a go I started having issues with not being able to open the the printer properties to change paper size and so forth.&nbsp; When
 I try to open the Properties of that printer&nbsp; in Settings&nbsp; I get an access denied error.&nbsp; &nbsp;I removed the printer and tried to install it again but it always asks me for Username and Password, however I have all the sharing settings set to allow File and Print
 sharing turned on, Network discovery is on and password protected sharing is turned off.&nbsp; Everything should work, but it doesn't.&nbsp; Even when I enter the username and password for the computer it's connected to It tells me they are incorrect.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is crazy!&nbsp;
 I'm very familiar with a small network and file and print sharing, and everything is set so that it should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am i Missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can share files just fine between the two computers and the shared printer shows up just fine when I open that computer in the Network locations in File explorer, so it able to see it just fine.&nbsp; Just won't connect.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur due to hardware components missing/corrupted, if the UB drivers are incompatible/non-updated or if the system files and folders are missing/corrupted on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>When you say “Fileexplorer are not showing are come up in the task manager list”, do you have
<strong>File Explorer</strong> window open on the computer?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if the USB drive is detected on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Run the
<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check if any of the hardware components is missing or corrupted on the computer.</span></p>

Hardware and Devices, </strong>click on <strong>Advanced </strong>option and check
<strong>Apply repairs automatically </strong>option.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on screen instructions and wait for the troubleshooting to complete.</span></li><li><span>After troubleshooting is completed, check the status of the troubleshooter shown on the window.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, update the USB drivers installed on the computer manually from
<strong>Device manager</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Connect the USB drive to the computer, press
<strong>Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select <strong>Device manager</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Expand <strong>
Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong> and check if the USB driver is visible. If visible, right click on the driver and select
<strong>Update this software</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Follow the onscreen instructions and wait for the update to complete.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li><li><span>If the issue persists, download and install the latest and most compatible USB drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if the issue is resolved.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            I get stuck on &#34;restarting&#34; screen of my new windows 8 laptop twice allready,  waited about 4 hours each time and gave up. is the long wait normal&#63;</h2>
                    hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just bought a new laptop carrying windows 8 and every time i get the message requesting i restart my system to install the latest changes, i get stuck on the "restarting screen" for hours. &nbsp; On 2 occasions i waited 4 hours until i finally decided to
 simply power down and restart , i even got a message the first time telling me the system would be done with updating/installing in 2 days....&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i dont think its caused by a slow system as i run a hp Pavillion ( ENVY m6 ) with a 1.9 Ghz processor and 8 Gigabytes of RAM, it seems like plenty to me...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>is there anyway i can have at lease a "status bar" on the restarting screen, that way at lease it would tell me if the system froze or is actually doing something?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Or better yet is there a way to FIX this issue at all? i remember long updates on vista but the worst i had was about 2 hours...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thank you&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Thank you for coming back.<br />
</p>
<p>I suggest you to try the following trouble shooting steps and check if the issue perists.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Check the update history</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a first step of troubleshooting, I would suggest you to check the updates history to see if there are any updates that have a failed status and let me know the description of those updates.<br />
a.Press Windows key + W and type Update in search bar.<br />
b. In the list of results, click Windows Update.<br />
c.In the left pane, click View update history.<br />
Let me know if the description of the updates that have failed status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Manually try installing the updates from Microsoft Download Center</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Go to the Microsoft download website, type the "KB" number of the update into the download search
</p>
<p>box, and then click Go.<br />
b. In the list of search results, click the Knowledge Base (KB) article link to go to the download page. If there's more than one listing, look for a link that goes to the Microsoft Download Center.<br />
c. If there are multiple versions on the download page, find the appropriate one for your computer. Click the Download button, and save the update to your desktop.<br />
d. When prompted, click Open to install the update.<br />
</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggestions above don't work as I can't get off the restart screen and I cannot figure out a way to get to boot in safe mode screen. I have used the laptop less than a dozen times and have had nothing but problems with Windows 8.</p>

<p>this only works if you can get into your computer. I am stuck restarting while updating. It is my understanding that you can't turn off your computer while updating. I did it once on windows xp several years ago and lost my whole system and everything in
 it. So I am afraid to turn the computer off.</p>

<h2>            No repair possible - stuck with no icons&#47;thumbnails</h2>
                    Well, upgraded from 7 to 10.&nbsp; After a black screen issue all seemed okay for a week.&nbsp; Turned computer on for second time in the day yesterday after running fine in the morning and all my taskbar icons are the same generic one and all my shortcuts and icons
 on the desktop have disappeared.&nbsp; Missing in every folder in every drive.&nbsp; No photo thumbnails either.&nbsp; I'm not in tablet mode, restore didn't work and now it says it's had a catastrophic failure.&nbsp; Rebuilding icon caches etc doesn't work and tried a repair
 install and that failed and reverted to older version again and now yet another black screen.&nbsp; Got it up and running again but still no icons, shortcuts or thumbnails anywhere.&nbsp; Help please, I need a positive fix for this not a 'try this' type of thing which
 I have done every way possible.&nbsp; I'm into photography and Win 10 has ruined my life.&nbsp; Not very happy with it at the moment.&nbsp; Microsoft really need to give a definitive fix f

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a repair install with Media Creation Tool as shown here:</p>
<p>- http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently running Version 10.0 (Build 10240)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried creating a new account and it is exactly the same unfortunately.&nbsp; if you can see the image, all my shortcut icons gone from top left of screen, This PC, Control Panel and Recycle Bin missing from top right etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only things that are intact
 are the Start button, Calculator and Shazaam(the only downloaded app).&nbsp; As mentioned, all thumbs in folders of photos are gone. As are all folders - All that's left is the writing...</p>
<p>The Windows.Old folder is there and contains - Perflogs, Program Files, Program Files (x86), ProgramData, Recovery, Users and Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I should also mention that a right click and click on 'properties' bring nothing up at all any more either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interstingly I just opened a photo editing program and if i go to save a photo, I can see all the folders, thumbnails etc and can also right click and see properties.&nbsp; Just can't&nbsp; to it on desktop or without running some software like the photo editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi again, </p>
<p>as an update, if I use a program such as "multi commander", I can go into a folder and see the thumbnails of each picture - so it's a 100% Windows 10 error it seems.&nbsp; I wish Microsoft would test things before releasing them &amp; ruining&nbsp; peoples PC's then not
 be able to fix them :-(</p>
<p>I really have tried every single fix in the book and nothing works&nbsp; at all.</p>

            <p>Solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had just downloaded a ISO of build 10240 and was within 2 YES 2 seconds of hitting the button &amp; reinstalling the OS when I thought I'd do screenshots of my Program Files folders so I could recall what software i was running.&nbsp; There was a folder simply
 called x64 which i opened.&nbsp; It contained the 'WindowsShortcutArrowEditor' app.&nbsp; I clicked on it and it was set to 'custom'.&nbsp; I clicked on the 'no arrows' option and amazingly all was restored!&nbsp; How it jumped from it's normal setting to 'custom', I'll never
 know but all my context menu's work now and everything is 100% back to normal.&nbsp; Thank goodness!</p>

Hi</p>
<p>Are&nbsp;there any&nbsp;files in the folder? Based on the file names, someone might be able to determine which program placed the folder there.</p>
<p>You cannot 'move' a folder to a Library. Libraries are virtual folders that only mirror the contents of physical folders.</p>
<p>Stationery is usually associated with Email client programs. Have you installed any Email programs lately?</p>
<p>Let us know.</p>

            No, for my e-mail, I only access my Yahoo account.&nbsp; At the time My Stationery first appeared, I only had this laptop a few days and I didn't even know there was such a thing in my programs.&nbsp; The file was originally very large, with many choices for different
 styles of stationery.&nbsp; After I sent it to the Recycle Bin, the title continues to pop up among Documents or Music, but with the message that this folder is no longer available. I haven't clicked on it to find out, however.

            I have an update to my question.&nbsp; My Stationery is empty, though the title is there.&nbsp; But a new folder has appeared in Documents called "Notes".&nbsp; It was last modified on 6/10/2009, which is long before I bought this computer. It contains files such as:
 Genko 1 and Genko 2, Seyes, ShortHand, and To Do List, all of which are typed as Journal Template.&nbsp; How did it get in Documents?&nbsp; Can you tell anything from the files in it?

<h2>            Windows 7 Recovery Disks  &#34;Not Enough Space&#34;</h2>
                    I had to reformat my WD 500Gb drive on my PC and when I used my Windows 7 Recovery Disks it kept telling me not enough space on hard drive and wouldn't continue. How do I get these discs to work ?&nbsp;

<p>OK, this would now be a question for the Lenovo helpdesk because they made the DVDs, not Microsoft. I would start with the Lenovo FAQs.<br />

<h2>            Princess Guard useless&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This Playthrough i decided to be a supportive player and focus on Co-op so&nbsp; i thought "well, what might be better to join the Princess Guard and be able to use 2 healing spells".</p>
<p>You get bountiful Sunlight which heals over Time and requires 36 Faith</p>
<p>and soothing Sunlight which is a Great Heal and you need to have 48 Faith</p>
<p>Both Spells do not only apply to you, but also nur Phantoms.</p>
<p>But is there really any need of these Miracles? In ordner to join the Princess Guard you must have cleared Anor Londo anyways and most likely you already killed Pinwheel too and have 15 Estus Flasks.</p>
<p>And when being summoned, why should the Host stand still near me and wait until i have casted the miracles? He could use a Flasks which will be a lot faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, do you think that there is any need in that Covenant and these 2 Miracles or not?</p>
<p>Did you make some good experiences?</p>

<p>Well, the Catacombs are pretty easy and you need 48 Faith for the Miracle which actually heals, the other one is a Heal over Time.</p>
<p>AND you have to find these Miracles.</p>
<p>So let's assume you didn't put all of your Points into Faith from the start of the game, you are already at a fairly high level and i never met people at a higher level who always needed healing and if so, you still don't have time for these miracles to
 cast in a boss fight or PvP</p>

Catacombs and Pinwheel himself are hardly the most difficult places in the world to make your way through enemy wise. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to expand partition that has free space to the left with diskpart&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a SSD and made a second partition on my HDD to move my data on. I planned to clone and move the slimmed partition to my SSD, but read that I was better off doing a fresh install. I did a fresh install on the SSD, deleted the old Windows 7 partition,
 and went to add the unallocated space to the data partition (unallocated space is to the left of the partition). I know you cannot do this with Disk Management, but I did it before on my Windows 7 laptop using diskpart. I found an article a while back on how
 to use diskpart to do what Disk Management cannot, but I don't remember how to do it or where I found it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know that I can do it with 3rd party apps like GParted, but knowing it can be done but not remembering how to do it with diskpart is driving me crazy. Can anyone help me?</div>
                </div>

            Hi Schwaka,<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, it's very easy to extend the partition when the free space is rightly behind, but what can you do with the space in the left? Most people will feel it's really a big trouble.
<br />
<br />
Don't worry! Here, I recommend you an easy-to-use software, AOMEI Partition Assistant Server Edition. It's so prevalent among computer users and most people speak highly of it.
<br />
<br />
Based on your problem, there are two choice for you. One is to move the unallocated space behind, and the other is to merge the free space to the data partition. Both of the functions cannnot be permitted in&nbsp; Windows 7 Disk Management. Apart from the two features,
 more functions are supported to manage your disk. <br />
&lt;Removed&gt;<br />
<br />
Have fun with it! <br />
<br />
Best wishes!<br />

            <p>Thanks for the quick clarification!<br /><br />To check, are you taking part in the Xbox One update preview? Also, if the the console reset that keeps games isn't working, try the full factory reset to see if there's any change.</p>

<h2>            Download a legitimate copy of Windows 7 Pro 64</h2>
                    I am buying a new PC tomorrow and I would like to install&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;windows. My old machine will be scrapped for parts so I will we legally using my one licence of Win 7 Pro on one machine. I lost my&nbsp;original&nbsp;disk, but saved the key (specifically for
 this case). Is there an official link I can use to download a copy? The version that would apply to me would be this one:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Windows 7 Professional with Service Pack 1 (x64) - DVD (English)</div>

</div>
<div>Since Microsoft does offer a 30 day trial with any Win7 disk, I think it is is&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;to make the disks accessible. It is kind of silly to make me hunt for someone who has a disk in an age of internet connections faster than DVD drives. But considering
 if you google the SHA1 provided above, the pirate bay is the first result, I&nbsp;sincerely&nbsp;hope a legitimate solution exists.</div>
</div>

    <title>Micro-stuttering every few seconds in Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kurapika92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Micro-stuttering every few seconds in Windows 10.</h2>
                    I have Toshiba Satellite C650D laptop and I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 a few days ago. Ever since then, I've been experiencing this micro-stuttering (referred to as either a&nbsp;<strong>generic freeze</strong>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<strong>single-app freeze.&nbsp;</strong>I'm
 leaning towards generic freeze because my whole computer seems to stutter every few seconds which is indicated by the stutter in my mouse cursor's movement). It's especially evident when listening/watching something because the stutter causes the audio to
 distort momentarily and it sounds robotic. I've looked online everywhere about people experiencing this issue and nothing has helped me. These are all the troubleshooting steps I have done:<br />
<br />
Thread 1:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/system-micro-stutterfreeze-on-loadup-slow-loading/e4a205a5-7e18-414f-ba74-3251a2e4e4bf<br />
<br />
1. System file checker&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> in Command Prompt (Admin) - No problems detected.<br />
2.&nbsp;<strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth&nbsp;</strong>- No problems detected.<br />
3.&nbsp;<strong>CHKDSK /f /r&nbsp;</strong>- This might be the reason for my issue because it got to 11% and hung there for about 2 hours. According the the thread it was posted in, it indicates a possible problem with my hard drive. I need more opinions on this because
 I checked my hard drive for errors (This PC -&gt; Right click on the drive -&gt; Properties -&gt; Tools tab -&gt; Check) and it said it's working fine and that nothing is wrong. Also, I did not have this stuttering issue in Windows 7 just a few days ago. I'm sceptical
 to believe that my hard drive now started failing after installing Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Thread 2:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-desktop/micro-stutter-every-20-seconds/309fe779-4316-4253-b163-43c06e0de013<br />
<br />
1. System Maintenance troubleshooter - No problems.<br />
2. Defragment hard disk - it was only 7% fragmented so it was not necessary.<br />
3. Cleaned up hard disk - Still stutters.<br />
<br />
I honestly have no idea what else to do at this point. This stuttering began after installing Windows 10 and I never experienced this at when I was running Windows 7. I think my last option is to revert back to Windows 7 and do a fresh install to Windows 10,
 but I've been hesitant because I don't know what I need to backup and what files I will lose.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            I've reverted back to Windows 7 for the time being and I don't have this micro-stuttering issue anymore. I've heard from people, like I mentioned in the OP, that a fresh re-installation for Windows 10 could resolve the problem, but I don't really see any
 point in doing so at the moment since everything is working fine in Windows 7. It seems like the problem was with Windows 10 and not my hard drive. If I end up upgrading again and still have micro-stuttering, I'll be sure to update this thread.

            I decided to re-upgrade to Windows 10 a few hours ago and I'm started experiencing this micro-stuttering issue on my Toshiba Satellite C650D laptop again. I'm pretty much out of any troubleshooting options at this point. This never happened in Windows
 7 and has only started happening both times I decided to upgrade to Windows 10. <br />
<br />
Could this issue possibly be because of Toshiba's audio drivers not being compatible with Windows 10? I've been thinking that that might be the reason why I'm experiencing this issue. When I upgraded to Windows 10, both times, my audio initially did not work
 at all. I had to go to the Device Manager, uninstall the audio driver (Conexant Audio Driver), and then restart the laptop to allow Windows to automatically download the High Definition Audio Device. That is the only change that I can think of that has happened
 when I upgraded from Windows 10 so maybe that is the issue? The problem though is that I've tried uninstalling the High Definition Audio Device and tried to re-download the Conexant Audio Driver from the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.toshiba.ca/support/isg/center/en/index.asp?p=PSC0YC-02V026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">manufacturer's
 website</a>&nbsp;but it hasn't been able to re-download. It seems like it is completely incompatible with Windows 10 and there aren't any other audio drivers available. It's a driver that was released in 2011 and was meant for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/414fcd75-ed58-4ab5-ad24-a03b4645f8b4" /><br />
<br />
Also, referring back to your first trouble shooting tip of updating the chipset drivers, I'm not sure what that means and how to do it. Could tell me how to do that? If this refers to updating the drivers from the manufacturer's website, I've already done so
 and it did not help.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated because I have no idea what to do at this point.<br />

            <p>I also have this problem after upgrading to Window 10 from Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to happen every second, it is noticeable while moving the mouse or typing
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only happens when some windows are focused, such as Microsoft edge or desktop. When I bring up task manager for example, it stops. I need to refocus on Microsoft edge or the desktop for it to reoccur</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated chipset drivers, but there are no windows 10 only drivers for intel chipsets on the website</p>
<p>I did chkdsk - no errors</p>
<p>disk defrag - 0%</p>
<p>sfc scan --- all done no problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit:</p>
<p>I uninstalled a program something like "Atheros Wireless..." and the stuttering seems to have reduced, because the Acer support site for my laptop has these drivers for windows 10 only&nbsp;but my laptop model has Broadcom, not Atheros wireless&nbsp;+ Bluetooth. So
 uninstalling them seemed to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: still got the stuttering. While writing this sometimes selecting text will cause me to move the text as windows may think i'm double clicking. IT gets really annoying and games that require mouse/keyboard input while stutter because of this</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also on a laptop Acer Aspire R7 571G and it's not a mouse/keyabord problem, because it also happens with the touchpad and touchscreen input - it's an input problem</p>

            I've reverted back to Windows 7, again, and guess what? No problems whatsoever. It's obvious that no one knows how to help given the lack of any actual replies from people offering troubleshooting tips. I'm done with Windows 10 until it's fixed.

            <p>I've been having this issue on my self-built desktop. Whenever I'm on Windows 8.1 there aren't any issues at all, but the moment I switch over to 10, there is a microstutter that runs through literally every program I'm using. It's incredibly noticeable
 in sound, but I can even see my mouse lag across the screen. I'd have to say that the problem is consistent, it happens about ever 1-3 seconds. I can't play games, typing is slowed at times, and I can't listen to anything via my speakers/headset or speak over
 my mic as it distorts myself and anyone speaking on the other end.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Troubleshooting Tried:</strong></p>
<p>1. I've tried upgrading and downgrade Realtek drivers repeatedly.</p>
<p>2. I booted into safe mode and the problem ceased, booted back into regular mode and it started again.</p>
<p>3. I've tried multiple Nvidia drivers.</p>
<p>4. I've reformatted multiple times, issue persists through Windows 10 each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at pretty much a loss at this point. I work via this computer and thus it cannot be inoperable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted Microsoft directly on multiple occasions. They keep telling me that Tier 2 will call, then I get an email the next day saying that I didn't answer - no call ever comes through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking about waiting until December to try again, but I am so hopeful that someone will find an answer to this before then...</p>

            Good to hear that your issue has been resolved. However, like I mentioned above, for my Toshiba Satellite laptop, the previous audio driver for Windows 7 (Conexant SmartAudio HD) is simply incompatible with Windows 10 and I can't download it. I have to
 use the generic High Definition Audio Device driver Windows provides to even have any sound on anything. This is simply something I can't do to resolve my issue, but also like I mentioned above, I've reverted back to Windows 7 and everything has been working
 perfectly.

<p>Hi Luis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A corruption within your user profile can be a possible cause why your system is asking for a password even if you did not set up your user account to have one. For us to provide an accurate solution, we would need you to answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build, version and edition of Windows is installed on your computer?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer settings before you encountered this issue?</li><li>Are you trying to install the applications or programs form the Windows Store?</li><li>Are you using your Microsoft account when you are signing into your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest trying to use another user profile and then check if the same issue persists. If you don't have other user profiles on your computer, you can create a test user account. To create a test user profile, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Using Cortana search, type Settings and then hit the Enter key. </li><li>In the Settings window, select Accounts. <br />
</li><li>Select Family &amp; other people. </li><li>Choose Add someone else to this PC. </li><li>Click I don't have this person's sign-in information. </li><li>Click Add a user without a Microsoft account. </li><li>Name the user as TEST and then provide a password.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Installing Windows 7 Service Pack 1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing  Windows 7 Service Pack 1</h2>
                    I am trying to install Windows Service Pack 1 and am getting nowhere!<br />
<br />
I have carried out all the instructions given when it fails to install and still it does not work. I cannot get free advice, or so it says (for whatever reason) when I try, and I am not prepared to pay –why should I when it is Microsoft's product I am trying
 to upgrade - so this plea is an attempt to get help from you. <br />
<br />
I keep getting a message saying there are Windows updates to install (even though everything is set for automatic downloads) and, when I look, these are Service Pack 1 and Internet Explorer 9. So I tried downloading the Service Pack and installing it – failure.
 (The information on the screen says it will restart the machine during installation but this never happened!) This happened twice and so I followed the advice for this problem and – failure!
<br />
<br />
So, thinking it might be my download, I purchased the DVD with the download on it. I put this in the computer – and it failed. So I trioes the sugested solutions again, including uninstalling my AVG Security system, and tried again – it failed. (All this was
 taking at least 30 minutes per go!). <br />
<br />
During these trials I have been asked several times if I would like to download 'Hotfix for Windows KB947821'. If I say no, the program stops! If I say yes it downloads the program (I now have 4 successful downloads of it) but nothing else happens!!<br />
<br />
So, the questions are:<br />
<ul>
<li>Is there anything you can suggest that will end in success for me?</li><li>Do I even need to install the Service Pack if all the other updates have, apparently, been installed? If no, how can I stop the message appearing?</li><li>My Windows 7 was 'created' from an update of Windows XP by means of a clean update. I bought an update from XP to 7 disk and used that. Could this affect things?
<br />
</li></ul>
<br />
I have a friend whose computer has automatically downloaded the Service Pack without him having to do a thing. Why won't mine??<br />
<br />
Ever hopeful<br />
Cheers<br />
