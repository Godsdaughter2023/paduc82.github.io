            I have tried clearing the cache, cookies, relaunching the browser, using other browsers, other computers and still the paragraph spacing doubles. I dont understand why you dont have the option of altering spacing when composing emails. Do you realise that
 some people are applying for jobs via email and how completely unprofessional it looks to receive an application with huge spaces between the paragraphs? Numerous people are reporting this and ye have done nothing to resolve the issue apart from repeating
 the same useless instructions. Ye are ******* useless! I have used hotmail/outlook for years and what was a perfectly good system has been messed up, I'm not wasting anymore time on this, its easier to change to gmail. Well done.&nbsp;

<p><span>It just happens to be where I posted.</span></p>
<p><span>Me too, I have for a very long time used MS word 2003 under XP and Hotmail, with no problems.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that I was all but forced to upgrade programs that worked perfectly fine.</span></p>
<p><span>I have WIN 10, MS office 365, the latest outlook.
</span></p>
<p><span>I to, get double spaces when I compose in word then cut and paste to outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>I have been doing this for years, with no problems. I am sure there is a real simple fix to it.</span></p>
<p><span>Just as the most complicated maze, is real simple, with a real good map!</span></p>
<p><span>I have asked, read other solutions, most of the places they say go to, I cannot find.</span></p>
<p><span>This applies to outlook, office XXX, and windows XX.</span></p>
<p><span>It feels like 80% of what I have learned the past 20 years is about useless now.</span></p>
<p><span>I have an old MS word 6.0 user’s guide from 2003 that is WORD ONLY and is 1.5 inches thick,
</span></p>
<p><span>an old MS EXCEL ONLY users guide is almost 1.75 inches thick.</span></p>
<p><span>Is there a PDF that can be down loaded for all this great new stuff??
</span></p>
<p><span>Change to improve a broke system is great!</span></p>
<p><span>Change for the sake of change is not!</span></p>
<p><span>It seems MS has hired/promoted a lot of people that feel they need to make big changes to justify their jobs.</span></p>

                    Hi everyone, I am thinking about installing the Windows 10 technical preview, but I want to install it on another hard disk/local disk. Can I do that, and if yes how to, and how can I wipe it later?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<p>
</p><p>The following describes the standard way to start the installation, especially if you are dual booting a 64 bit version of Windows 10 alongside a 32 bit version of Windows. Another way is&nbsp;to start the installation from within a runing version&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and
 select the partition where you would like to install Windows 10. See below for further instructions how to do so.

<h2>            Microsoft Teams Auto Attendant - Can&#39;t Assign Service Number to Resource Account</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently Auto Attendant configuration has moved from the Skype area of O365 Admin Center to the Teams area. Once trying to configure a Teams Auto Attendant, I am unable to assign a service number to the Auto Attendant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a German Auto Attendant and I am trying to assign a German service number, which we have available, but whenever I try to assign it and hit Save, I get an error message saying "We can't save changes to &lt;auto attendant&gt;.". The resource account was made
 about 5 hours ago, and I have been checking a couple times every hour since then to see if it is assignable but it still isn't. The resource account is assigned an E5 license and International/Domestic Calling. When looking in the Skype for Business Admin
 Center, the phone number we are trying to assign is showing as unassigned, so it should be usable. For the email address of the resource account, instead of the using &lt;auto attendant&gt;@&lt;company&gt;.onmicrosoft.com, we are using &lt;auto attendant&gt;@&lt;company name&gt;.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an older Call Queue that has been automatically converted from Skype for Business to Teams, which seems to be operational and with a service number even though there aren't any licenses attached to it, but for some reason the newly created Teams
 Auto Attendant with licenses assigned will not work.</p>

<p>After checking earlier today, I was able to assign the service number to the Auto Attendant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this made a difference but I had put in an order for another German service number at some point during the work week and it was approved today, making it available. Once I saw that it became available, I was able to assign either one of the
 two German service numbers to the Auto Attendant, both of them being accepted whenever I switched between the two.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Illegal&#34; character in folder path is preventing me from being able to open a word document in Mac Office 2011</h2>
                    I have the newest Mac in our office and just installed Mac Office 2011. I am unable to open a word document if the parent folder name contains a ";" semicolon. I know this is the problem because when I remove the semicolon from the parent folder name I
 am able to open the word document.

</div>
<div>I have tested three other Macs in our office to see if the same error occurred, it did not. For some reason this error only happens on my Mac. Any ideas how to fix this problem?</div>

            check this:<br />
<br />
2011 has a bit of accidental PC code in that does not allow certain forbidden Characters. However; it so deep in code if they can't take it out without the whole application suite blowing up.
<br />
<br />
Some of the forbidden Characters are:<br />
Numbers before names, Superscript/Subscripts, "&nbsp; '&nbsp; \ | / &lt; &gt; { } [ ] &lt;&lt;&nbsp; &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Numbers after Names are okay.&nbsp; None of these characters can be used in name of Hard Drive, Directory Names, and any File Names.<br />
<br />
And on servers no names can have the name File or Fileserver&nbsp; in any path names. <br />
<br />
You can use _ (underscores).<br />

 how were you able to resolve?&nbsp; Sorry, but my desktop knowledge isn't great.

<p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, a deleted email will show up in the Deleted Items folder. Regarding your concern, can you check if the deleted email show up on your Deleted folder online on its email server? If so, we can confirm that Outlook is not syncing properly with your
 account. Also, have you installed the latest Office updates on your computer? There's a possibility that you need to install the latest Office update to get it fixed. You may refer to this

<h2>            IF&#47;Then Help for a range of cells</h2>
                    I am trying to use and if/then statement for a range of cells.&nbsp; If any of these cells contain data, I want to put a "1" in an adjacent cell, so that I can use a count function for another chart.&nbsp; I have put the arguments in, but for some reason, when I
 try to use a range, it keeps giving me an error.

<p>The&nbsp;IF function does not work with ranges unless you enter it as an array&nbsp; (you press Shift+Ctrl+Enter, instead of Enter to enter it)</p>
<p>So if that is really what you want the formula would look something like</p>
<p>=IF(OR(A1:A10&lt;&gt;""),1,0)</p>
<p>when you have entered it as an array it will look like this on the formula bar</p>
<p>{=IF(OR(A1:A10&lt;&gt;""),1,0)}</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com Family calendar appointment duplicated loop bug</h2>
                    <p>Outlook.com Family calendar appointment&nbsp;duplicated loop bug</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two events in our shared Family calendar have suffered some sort of duplication loop bug and cannot be deleted, through desktop Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The events were created in Outlook for iOS&nbsp;on a iPhone that also had the email account set up in native iOS Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screen shot of the appointment&nbsp;in Desktop Outlook...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2835b49d-465d-4453-870f-f6afb2e70d64?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2835b49d-465d-4453-870f-f6afb2e70d64?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screen shot of the appointment&nbsp;in the single day of the month view in a browser on Outlook.com...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70f1be3f-91c8-4b41-b2e6-58831dc7186b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70f1be3f-91c8-4b41-b2e6-58831dc7186b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screen shot of the duplicated appointments in the day view in a browser on Outlook.com...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce31b273-4d0e-44dc-86ae-24eab8ff2e34?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce31b273-4d0e-44dc-86ae-24eab8ff2e34?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this last screen shot there are so many copies of the appointment that it can't display them, there's a new appointment&nbsp;every few pixels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we resolve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are now two members of my family who cannot open their calendars in Outlook for iOS if the select a date past the date of this duplicated appointment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Dianne, </p>
<p>
</p><p>BN3806, was the original appointment owner, and we were using that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The appointment deletes work in eM Client once you have let the entire mailbox synchronise first.&nbsp; Then we deleted the offending appointments a screen at a time, waited for the synchronise to complete each time, then repeated again.&nbsp; That still took an hour,
 but hours less that if I had to do it in OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>AjN3806</p>

<p>
</p><p>I updated my Lumia 525 yesterday on Windows 10 technical preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first cut observation is everything seems bit slow and takes a bit of time (read loading) on this platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project sparton looks promising but again the same issue of bit slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will keep posting the further observations.</p>

 this:</p>

<p>Your title suggest that you want the row color to change?&nbsp; If the ICM Code is Yes?&nbsp; I also don't follow the logic you are trying to use.</p>
<p><br />
In 2007:<br />
1. Highlight all the cells on the rows you want formatted, say&nbsp;A2:C13<br />
2. Choose Home, Conditional Formatting, New Rule<br />
3. Choose Use a formula to determine which cell to format<br />
4. In the Format values where this formula is true enter the following formula:</p>
<p>=COUNTIFS($A$2:$A$13,$A2,$B$2:$B$13,"ICM")</p>
<p>5. Click the Format button and choose a format.<br />
6. Click OK twice</p>

<p>The title of the original post was "changing row color when value changes".&nbsp; So like I said I used your formula as a guide, it ought to look familiar.&nbsp; From a speadsheet formula to changing the row color is always obvious?&nbsp;&nbsp;And is the OP versed in conditional
 formatting, are they new to 2007?&nbsp; I gave a modified version of your formula, because those modifications are necessary to make it color a row and I gave the steps for condition formatting because the OP might not know them.</p>
<p>Actually your formula looks a little familiar to me also, seems I've seen it posted many times by others.&nbsp; Hummm...</p>
<p>Lets face it, are we trying to help the user?&nbsp; I see many posts which take my ideas and extend them or correct them or make a very similar proposal, in fact sometime they are identical, not a single character different, I never respond or take offense, and
 to do so is just a waste of time and energy.</p>

Or, are "we" trying to help ourselves? Are "we" here just to gain some level of status? I think that's why you're here. You're desperate for points/medals/post count. Full stop.</p>

<p>I am using a Lumia 620, and my service provider is Speakout Wireless. I have data included with my service plan. My data connection is set to on. I contacted my service provider and they said to contact Nokia for the right APN settings. What are the right
 APN settings? How do I activate my data connection? Please help. I searched the support section and didn't find an answer.</p>

            If you look at the number of views, you can see this a common problem.&nbsp; Here are some possible fixes that have worked for others.&nbsp; If you can't get it to work, demand your money back!<br />
<br />
<div>
“…Office is Busy…”<span>&nbsp; </span>The Office cannot carry out this operation, because the product is carrying out another task. Please wait until it finishes and try once again.” /
<br />
Every Time I open an Office 365 program it tells me I cannot proceed without repairing the program.
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
&lt;snip&gt; Apparently, there is no fix at this time.&nbsp; I spent 4 days with technical support (L1,&nbsp;L2 and L3).&nbsp; They claim that it is not a Microsoft issue.&nbsp; It is an issue with Windows 7.&nbsp; Funny, it is a relatively new laptop, with no other issues with any other
 application. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Looking at the replies reporting “fixes”, it appears that this message may be a symptom of more than one issue, making suggesting a specific fix impossible.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here is a collection of fixes that have been reported in the forum:</p>
<p>Fix for “Office is Busy” and Office repair doesn’t work.&nbsp; I had this issue on several computers and then found this fix.&nbsp; It made Office run quicker and&nbsp;the annoying “Office is Busy” messages stopped.</p>
<p>Open any of the Office programs (Word, Excel, etc.).&nbsp; Go to the File Tab, then find&nbsp;“Account” and click on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right side of the screen, your should see “Office Updates” shown with a box to the left of the title.&nbsp; If
 you click on “Update Options”&nbsp;select “Turn off Updates”.</p>
<p>No more “Office is Busy” messages and no more slow responding Office windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; I have been having this problem, as well.&nbsp; While performing an installation repair operation has worked for me, it has taken a lot of time, and requires closing and re-opening all of my Office applications.&nbsp; A post on another thread
 mentioned a better solution that has worked for me: Simply stop or restart the “<b>Microsoft Office Service</b>”.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You can do this by using the Control Panel &gt;<span>&nbsp;
</span>Services applet.&nbsp; Find the service name in the list</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right click on the service name</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Select Properties</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on the stop button, wait to see a message that the service has been stopped</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on the start button</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>It seems to have resolved the problem within seconds, and it is much less disruptive (though not nearly as nice as a real fix for the problem).&nbsp; I hope this helps. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Note: another person reported they had to turn the service on and off a few times before it worked.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>*****</p>
<p>Another way to get to the Service dialog, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>open “File Explorer”, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right Click on “Computer”, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on “Manage”. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Computer Management panel opens double click on “Services and Applications”
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>then click “Services”. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>scroll down until you find “Microsoft Office Service”.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right&nbsp;click on it then click “Restart”.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>***********</p>
<p>One person reported that they have to restart the service every time after booting the computer.
</p>
<p>In that situation, it may be easiest to create a batch file to issue the commands.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then you can put it on your desktop or task bar to have quick access to run it as required.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The brain dead simplest form of this .BAT file would be:</p>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
net stop “Microsoft Office Service”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
net start “Microsoft Office Service”</p>
<p>but it is better if you do some error checking to make sure you know what is going on if there are any problems. This page has a detailed batch file you can use as a template:</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt; As it turned out, I used system restore to an earlier time (two days before the “we’re sorry” message) and MS. Word came back just fine. Soon after, I was advised an update was available, so I clicked to allow. MS Word has been

<br />
Way too many people are having this problem and wasting days and weeks trying to get it fixed! The only way MS is going to fix it is if they start losing money because of it.<br />
<br />
If MS does not cooperate and give you your money back, contact your credit card company. Ask for a the charge to be reversed because they gave you a defective product. Refer them to this forum to see that lots of people are having this problem.<br />

<p><b>2013 03 13- Two free, full-blown alternatives to MS Office - Open Office / Libre Office</b>
</p>
<p><a href="https://windowssecrets.com/newsletter/two-free-full-blown-alternatives-to-ms-office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://windowssecrets.com/newsletter/two-free-full-blown-alternatives-to-ms-office/</b></a><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>As Microsoft’s Office has grown in size and complexity, more than a few users have wondered whether there’s a viable alternative — especially when it comes time to pay for an upgrade or new copy.</b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; After using both for a couple weeks, I didn’t notice any major features missing in either. Writer is a capable word processor that does pretty much everything Word can do and more. In fact, we picked Writer as the best word processor for
 Windows. If a word processor is all you really need, then Writer will do everything Word can do and more.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you’re new to spreadsheets or just a light user, Calc gets the job done. However, if you’re working in an environment where you’re sharing a lot of macros then you’re best off sticking with Excel. Both of them are easy to get started with, support
 the same file formats, and offer a pretty close selection of features.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>LibreOffice’s Impress is a perfectly capable program, but if you’re working with people who usually use PowerPoint you might run into some compatibility issues still. If you’re just making presentations for your own purposes, then Impress should
 work for you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of the software in the suite, database software is really more about what you and your company use. Base has fantastic integration with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Thunderbird, whereas Access integrates better with Outlook and Paradox.
 Both manage to do what they need to do well, so which you use really depends on the context you use it in.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>For the most part, LibreOffice and Microsoft Office have the same suite of software with the exception of one thing: Outlook. LibreOffice doesn’t come packed with an email client, so if you need Outlook or an equivalent, you won’t find it here.
 The rest of the suite is pretty similar.</p>
<p>It’s pretty obvious that if money is tight, LibreOffice is the office suite for you. Even still, if Microsoft Office isn’t actually required at your work (especially with Outlook), LibreOffice has a lot to offer these days. LibreOffice also supports
<a href="http://extensions.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">extensions</a>, which means you can customize the look, features, and feel of the suite to suit your needs. Fortunately, the two office suites usually play nice together, so if you want to give LibreOffice
 a try for a few days you should be able to continue working with documents you’ve already created in Microsoft Office (though as stated above, you may run into a few small issues).</p>

<p><span>Hi Taryn,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may try removing Windows credentials, see if this fixes the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Sign out from Office applications and quit all the Office applications opened on your system. To sign out, open any Office application, let’s say Word or Excel, click
</span><strong><span>File&gt;Account&gt;Sign out</span></strong><span> and close all open Office documents.
</span></li><li><span>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>&gt;<strong>User Account</strong>&gt;<strong>Credentials Manager</strong>&gt;<strong>Windows Credentials</strong>&gt;Delete all
<strong>MicrosoftOffice16</strong> <strong>and MicrosoftOffice15</strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
</span>credentials.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, p</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">lease try to delete cached files in Upload center. To do this, right click on Start menu &gt; Search &gt; search and Open
<strong>Office Upload center</strong> &gt; click <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>
Delete cached files</strong>, click <strong>Ok</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After deleting the cached password, open Word or Excel and click <strong>
File</strong>&gt;<strong>Account</strong>&gt;<strong>Sign</strong> <strong>in</strong> and enter your Office 365 log in credentials, check if you can see connected services and open the document from OneDrive for business or SharePoint Online and check if you still
 get the same issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 23.25pt"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you getting the issue only with the shared Excel workbook?

<p>I deleted all the Office credentials and cleared the cache.&nbsp; From what I can tell it seems to start out okay uploading changes the first time, and then the next time there is confusion about sign-in and the troubles begin.&nbsp; It happens whether the file is
 password protected or not.&nbsp; I signed out of everything and then signed back in.&nbsp; the error below is after doing all that.</p>

<p>Taryn/Neha</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue of "UPLOAD FAILED...." error message is now occurring on a second password protected excel file. Opened both files this morning, made a change in one file, clicked 'save' and immediately got error message. Shut the file down by clicking on the 'X'
 in the top r/h corner; I did not click on 'Save a copy' or 'Discard changes'. Reopened the file and despite error message having appeared, my changes were saved...weird. Repeated above and same thing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following above advice, signed out account through Excel and then deleted MicrosoftOffice15 credentials through Control Panel. Also deleted cached files in upload centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately reopened Excel and signed back in to my 365 account. opened the offending file, made a change, saved and it returned the 'UPLOAD FAILED...' error message. Closed without saving again and reopened the file. Again the change was actually saved.
 Repeated twice more and same thing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I called a colleague over and said watch this......I made a change and then clicked on 'save' ........nothing, it saved the change as it should without any error message. Incredible its like when I have an intermittent fault with my car and
 I take it to the garage, I can never get the intermittent fault to happen in the garage!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might be wrong here, but I wonder if signing out of 365, deleting MSOffice15 credentials and then signing back in took a few minutes to register on a MS database somewhere, hence when I immediately signed back in I still had the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is, at the moment, it is working as it should, but lets see what the next 24 hours brings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>

                    <p>I have both IMAP and POP accounts. My contacts were associated with one [or both] of the POP accounts. But my primary account was IMAP. This was a mistake. I don't run Outlook on anything except my big desktop. I am suffering for that IMAP mistake; read
 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, something caused all my contacts to not appear in Address Book and People. The contact information was still in my computer somewhere, because when I clicked on "To" or "Cc" or "Bcc", the suggestion box dropped down and I could see part of the
 contact data. By typing a letter in those boxes, I could see a different part of my contacts. I don't believe this data was in a cache, because I could see contacts that I have basically never sent an email to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called MS Tech Support and got to a Level 1 Technician in the Philippines. He was polite and easy to understand his English. He worked for almost 3 hours! A for effort. Sadly, he made the problem worse. I can no longer see any of my contacts when I address
 an outgoing email. He knew he screwed my Outlook, although he never mentioned it or apologized. He gave me a 1-month free extension to my Office 365 subscription. That was the only sign that he had made things worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got some advice from Karl T, an MVP here, but he confused me. He is VERY good, but seemingly can't talk down. My questions frustrated him!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife also uses Outlook on her computer and last year, she lost her contacts. I gave her my contacts and she used that as a start to reconstruct hers. I did the same thing after the above event. We share a lot of common contacts. I removed the ones that
 I never would use and have started adding a few of my contacts. This will be a long process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now found that all my rules are gone; I had hundreds. Don't know exactly when they were deleted? Like did they go away when the initial problem occurred or did they go away due to the Level 1 Tech?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I have a call-back appointment with a Level 2 Tech next Tuesday. I don't have high hopes that:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The call will happen</li><li>The call will be at the requested time [when I'm home and at my computer]</li><li>I will be able to understand his/her accent</li><li>It will result in getting my contacts and rules back</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>As I read various online sites w/ instructions to fix various parts of my problem, I get confused. First, none of their instructions are the same. Second, none of their instructions work on my computer and my version of Outlook. I start going down a list
 of steps and find that what they describe [or show in pictures] is different than what I see. Some of these online sites are official MS sites and this community forum w/ comments from MVPs. Part of the problem is the myriad of versions, but I try to only
 look at Outlook 365 instructions and the above still happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, I have the latest "stable" version of Windows 10 and MS has kept Office 365 up-to-date...I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One issue I found this morning: I have a fast 64-bit computer and Windows 10 is a 64-bit OS, but Office 365 is a 32-bit version. It's been a while since I downloaded it and don't remember an option for me to select a 32-bit version. If that option had been
 present, I'm sure I would have selected 64-bit. I may be strange but I'm not loony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, I looked for instructions to install the 64-bit version of Office 365 this morning. Again, I found multiple ways to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lost all faith in MS, their Tech Support system, and their user community. I am afraid that trying to uninstall the 32-bit version of Office and then installing the 64-bit version will make my underlying problem worse!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The proper analogy may be "When you are in a deep hole, stop digging"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could use some GOOD, ACCURATE advice or stronger anti-depression pills.</p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Unfortunate that the question didn't get resolved. Do vaguely remember the thread but would be really helpful to provide a reference to the actual thread. In any case,
<br />
<br />Re: #1 - the cause of the issue as best as I recall is that the contacts involved an a contact folder with the additional words of "This Computer Only" in the folder description. Am fairly confident that I would have written something along the lines of
<br />
<br />"If Outlook could not find the underlying .ost file associated with the IMAP account, it would recreate the file, re-sync the email data with the server but all folders with the words "This Computer Folder" in the folder name would be empty. More specifically, the "Contacts (This Computer Folder)" would be empty or in other words, all the contact data would be lost".
<br />
<br />Am also confident that I would have included a variety of other information but will leave things to the above for the moment.
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - The same reason would apply regarding &lt;Rules&gt; as described for item #1. In the current version, "rules" are stored in the data file associated with the email account. If the .ost file for the account got recreated - the "rules" will be lost.
<br />
<br />Re: #3 - Can't speak to what instructions you're following for installing 64bit Office since no references are provided so to that end - will start with the following article
<br />
<br />Download and install or reinstall Office 365 or Office 2016 on a PC or Mac
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2016-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />The critical item in the above article is that you need to log into your MS Account used to purchase Office in order to get to the 64bit option as described in the article
<br />
<br />Also suggest you take a serious look at the following since 32bit Office is still the recommended version to install for the general public
<br />
<br />Choose between the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Office
<br /><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/excel-help/choose-the-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-office-HA010369476.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/excel-help/ch...</a>

<p>I believe the previous thread was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10-mso_365hp/lost-all-contacts-in-outlook-365/1d1a4a72-4d8d-4e7e-8ded-c9e8a70b806d</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the 2nd link to an article about choosing between 32-bit and 64-bit Office installs interesting. The only possible rationale for 64-bit in my case seems to be in this sentence:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">You’re
 working with extremely large pictures, videos, or animations in PowerPoint</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">."</span></p>
<p>I have only occasionally created PowerPoint
 presentations, but I often deal with "extremely large pictures" although that is a rather ambiguous statement, as what I think is extremely large may not be what the author of that article thinks is extremely large. I have many gigabit images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have a good friend who regularly creates big PP presentations and he solicits images from me and others. He requested that we resize the submitted images. I tested PP and found that it resized large images, thus we didn't have to. This was several
 years ago and I don't remember with certainty what version of Office I used in the test, but I believe it was 2007. So the above statement confuses me. Perhaps PP no longer resizes images?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did the author restrict to PP? Would not a large Word document filled with huge images benefit from 64-bit? I do those all the time. Yes, Word frequently scrambles images as the documents grow large. Not sure if 64-bit Word would work better?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karl, I'm delighted to have your help, but don't get frustrated if I can't understand your answers.</p>

<p>I suspected that might be the case and commented on why I concluded the contacts shown were not JUST in a cache. I can go on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had several hundred contacts [I'm down to 151 after the crash of 2018]. Some of these contacts I had not used in years. Yet, when I typed in the first few characters of one of these seldom/never used contacts, autocomplete showed the proper email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have observed that when I add a new contact, it does not appear in autocomplete. I have to manually type in the new address or go to the Address Book and ask to send an email to this new contact. Even after I send the first email to a new contact, autocomplete
 still does not show it. I have to go away and come back another day and perhaps the new contact will be in the autocomplete box. I always thought this was a terrible way for a modern program to operate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the cache unlimited? MS says it is limited to 1000 entries. Many times a cache will have a max size and after it fills, early data is dropped out. It functions as a "stack" in these instances. But MS does not indicate that it's a "stack". Instead, they
 shuffle the data per a secret algorithm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two distinct and different boxes that appear. If I type "A" in the "To" field, Outlook will show me up to 5 contacts with "A" [if there
<strong>are</strong> 5 "A" contacts]. It uses both first and last names! So it will find Alan Wrench and also Wench Allen. On the other hand, if I right click in the "To" field, it apparently shows me the most recently used contacts. I have noticed that Outlook
 changes the priority of these displayed contacts daily even when I do not send any emails! Both type boxes are titled "Recent People".&nbsp;I always thought this was a terrible way for a modern program to operate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the strange behavior of autocomplete, I concluded that the data didn't come from a simple cache. Must be a demented cache? BTW, I read the MS article, "Information about the Outlook AutoComplete list". The first thing I noticed is they call it a&nbsp; "list"
 in most instances. There must have been several authors, as near the bottom of the page, someone starts using "cache".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this instance, "cache" is the wrong word. According to Wikipedia, </p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">A memory&nbsp;</span><strong>cache</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">,
 sometimes called a&nbsp;</span><strong>cache</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;store or RAM&nbsp;</span><strong>cache</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">,
 is a portion of memory made of high-speed static RAM (SRAM) instead of the slower and cheaper dynamic RAM (DRAM) used for main memory.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">In this instance, there is no separate hardware memory used for the AutoComplete list. It's just a LIST of data stored in DRAM! I think calling it
 a cache is techno babble.</span></p>

<br />Not sure if 64-bit Word would work better?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />In this case, would suggest to installing 64bit and see if there's a difference. The only caveat to that is if you have any 32bit applications that integrate with Outlook (or any other app addins) in which case you'll have to make a choice.
<br />
<br />As for the previous thread - not sure why you think I got frustrated. Merely stated that a series of questions asked in the last post were already specifically answered in my original response (as in items #1 &amp; 2) and there was never a response from you to items #3 regarding the information provided. 
<br />
<br />Lest I misunderstood things - issue was left at that you decided to simply rely on a backup copy of your contact items should you ever encounter another problem.

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />To reiterate - can't refuse something that wasn't asked. In the case of items #1 &amp; 2 from the original thread - there wasn't a comment about what wasn't understood and as was also mentioned in my last reply, there wasn't a response to item #3 (32 vs 64bit).
<br />
<br />In any case, since I really don't know what is or isn't understood or even what exactly it is you are trying to get done at this point especially given that you left things with recovering from your backup contact csv file. Waiting for the level 2 tech who will be able to and most likely will take control of your system is probably the best route at this juncture. Anything else would be trying to re-write/re-state the info in the responses provided along with the reference articles included.

<p>I may be remembering incorrectly. I may have been the only one who was frustrated, unrelated to your attempts to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back and read my <strong>original</strong> post and the 4 questions that I didn't respond to. They are in a short post that started with, "<span><em>Karl, you are WAY beyond me here</em>..."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example, I asked, "</span><span><em>Where do I add the PST file? My first guess is via File Explorer. But what do I name the PST file? How do I create this PST file?</em>" Your answer
 was, "</span><span><em>Answered in my first reply in this thread so rather then repeating all of that again, please review that reply</em>...". That was what I incorrectly tagged as frustration. Sorry.</span></p>
<p>Your answer in the first reply was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span><em>create a PST file in the profile (from the ribbon --&gt; New Items --&gt; More Items --&gt; Outlook Data File)</em>"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So you DID answer #1, but I didn't understand your answer. Read the 1st line of the post with my questions; I think I clearly was asking for an expanded answer. If I didn't understand your answer the first time, rereading
 it won't help. I choked on "Ribbon". A more complete name would have been "<em>Home ribbon</em>" since the other 4 ribbons don't have "<em>New Items</em>". I know that is a nit, but when a novice is confused, nits are important. Adding
<p>
</p><p><span>When I followed your instructions, it offered to create "<em>My Outlook Data File(1).pst</em>". I have no clue what data will be in that file! What account will it be associated with?</span></p>
<p>[new subject]</p>
<p>I alluded to this, but I failed to describe it well, thus you didn't understand. My fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For several years, when I clicked on "<em>People</em>", the navigation pane on the left had two entries. I truly don't know if these are files or folders. Whatever. The top, default entry was "<em>Contacts (This computer only)</em>". To the right was a large
 area with a list of contacts. These contacts had headings, describing them. I wish I had a picture! There were only 6-7 total contacts listed. The second entry in the navigation pane was "<em>Contacts</em>". When I selected it, all my contacts were shown on
 the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the 6-7 contacts associated with&nbsp;"<em>Contacts (This computer only)</em>" are saved in the OST file associated with my primary IMAP account, then when that file is deleted, Outlook will create a new one w/o any contacts. But losing those 6-7 contacts
 is not a major blow. I would assume selecting "<em>Contacts</em>", which you say is associated with my 2 POP accounts would show all my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original problem was that the&nbsp;"<em>Contacts</em>" entry went away, thus I could not see, edit, or create any contacts. At the same juncture, selecting the&nbsp;"<em>Contacts (This computer only)</em>" failed to show the 6-7 contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm suspecting that Outlook had been working incorrectly for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something happened about 9-6-2018. That was when the above happened. Also, at that time my Rules went away. The only 6 items in my Spam folder are communications from MS tech support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have 3 columns when I view&nbsp;"<em>People</em>". The middle one is a search box. I don't remember it before 9-6-2018.</p>

<br />I think I clearly was asking for an expanded answer.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />I guess at one level we're even since while you may not have understood my answer, I in turn have no idea as to what it is that you don't understand so impossible to provided a more targeted answer :-) . With that out of the way
<br />
<br />Some basics in terminology - for the sake of this so as to not needing to write a novel about the myriad of variations - please open Outlook and press CTRL+6 which will show the full folder list for each data file configured in Outlook. Will deal with the other condensed Nav Pane views at the end.
<br />
<br />With the full folder list open - please review the following
<br />
<br />Understanding Outlook Navigation Pane
<br /><a href="https://www.contactgenie.info/understanding-outlook-nav-pane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.contactgenie.info/understanding-out...</a>
<br />
<br />In terms of terminlogy
<br />
<br />The "Root" of each folder list that appears in the Nav Pane would be also referred to as the "top" of the data "file".
<br />
<br />Each entry underneath the "Root" name are "folders". When you click on each folder, items contained in that folder appear in the middle block of the Outlook UI assuming that you have the &lt;Reading Pane&gt; configured to show on the right-hand side.
<br />
<br />Beyond that, am only repeating what has already been stated 
<br />1) There is only one "default" contact folder for a profile
<br />2) The default data file contains the "default contact folder" (also applicable for the Calendar folder)
<br />3) When a change is made to the default data file, the default contact/calendar folders are also changed. Can't do one without the other.
<br />4) In short, whatever data file is the "default" - that's where the default contact folder is located and if that happens to be the .ost file for an IMAP account where the contact folder has the added words "This Computer Only" - then you risk losing all that data for the reasons already stated in previous replies. However, the following may also be of interest/use (probably far more then what you want but there is no way to put all of this into the equivalent of a "sound byte" without the risk of a criticism that it doesn't explain anything)

<br />
<br />To finish this off, when you click on one of the icons at the bottom of the Outlook Nav Pane - let's pick the &lt;People&gt; icon for the sake of this discussion, what you see is simply a filtered "view" of all contact folders in your profile without it not be very clear as to where those folders reside in terms of data files in the profile.

<p>I did not know about CTRL+6. It did what you said. But I have no clue how to undo what CTRL+6 did. I really don't need to see every folder, except in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not make the "new" folders exposed by CTRL+6 go away [I tried relaunching Outlook], so I read your article about the Nav Pane. I moved the Calendar, Contacts, Journal, Notes, Sync Issues, &amp; Tasks to the bottom of the list [right above Search Folders].
 When I relaunched Outlook, the order of these folders I moved was changed. Calendar and Contacts were where they started [below Deleted Items]. Journal and Notes were in the middle. Only Sync Issues and Tasks were down where I moved them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I could find many answers to these mysterious happenings, but I don't intend to become an Outlook guru. Outlook is simply an email client; a tool that I use. I have many complex programs on my computer. Most are more intuitive than Outlook. I have
 limited mental capacity and must use my remaining neurons to operate various photography apps; like Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, PTGui, Zerene Stacker, ExifToolGUI, Photomatix Pro, JPEGsnoop, RawDigger, etc. I want Office apps to be tools that I pick up and
 use w/o complex issues. When I want to drive a nail, I don't want to have to read hundreds of online sites telling me how to configure my hammer or find the head when it fly's off!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found no "Roots" in my Nav Pain [misspelling intentional].</p>
<p>
</p><p>You didn't respond to my description of the way Outlook worked in the distant past [before 9-6-2018]. Specifically, your description of where contacts are saved [what they are associated with] doesn't explain why I had a tiny subset of contacts associated
 with my default "<em>Contacts [This computer only]</em>" but ALL the contacts were associated with the "<em>Contacts</em>" folder, which you describe as being associated with one or both of my POP accounts! I don't know what I did years ago to cause this behavior.
 I don't know how Outlook would support this, given your description of how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the day when a Level 2 Tech is supposed to call me after 4 PM Central time. I truly don't expect to get that call. If I do get it, I expect to get it before I get home from my weekly infusion, which is 50 miles from home. I explained all this to
 the Level 1 Tech...</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>&gt;&gt; <br />
I think I clearly was asking for an expanded answer. <br />
&lt;&lt; <br />
<br />
I guess at one level we're even since while you may not have understood my answer, I in turn have no idea as to what it is that you don't understand so impossible to provided a more targeted answer :-) . With that out of the way
<br />
<br />
Some basics in terminology - for the sake of this so as to not needing to write a novel about the myriad of variations - please open Outlook and press CTRL+6 which will show the full folder list for each data file configured in Outlook. Will deal with the other
 condensed Nav Pane views at the end. </p>
<p><br />
With the full folder list open - please review the following <br />
<br />
Understanding Outlook Navigation Pane <br />
<a href="https://www.contactgenie.info/understanding-outlook-nav-pane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.contactgenie.info/understanding-out...</a><br />
<br />
In terms of terminlogy <br />
<br />
The "Root" of each folder list that appears in the Nav Pane would be also referred to as the "top" of the data "file".
<br />
<br />
Each entry underneath the "Root" name are "folders". When you click on each folder, items contained in that folder appear in the middle block of the Outlook UI assuming that you have the &lt;Reading Pane&gt; configured to show on the right-hand side.
<br />
<br />
Beyond that, am only repeating what has already been stated <br />
1) There is only one "default" contact folder for a profile <br />
2) The default data file contains the "default contact folder" (also applicable for the Calendar folder)
<br />
3) When a change is made to the default data file, the default contact/calendar folders are also changed. Can't do one without the other.
<br />
4) In short, whatever data file is the "default" - that's where the default contact folder is located and if that happens to be the .ost file for an IMAP account where the contact folder has the added words "This Computer Only" - then you risk losing all that

<h2>            How to share Word documents based on same template &#40;.dotm&#41; between Word 2010 and Word 2011 users on a network&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a huge problem in sharing a Word template (more precisely; the rendered document from the template) between Windows (Word 2010) and Mac (Word 2010) users on a network.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In my test environment I have a&nbsp;<br />
*Win x64 7 computer with Word 2010<br />
*Mac computer with Word 2011<br />
*a shared network drive with my template file<br />
<br />
<br />
My Word 2010 configuration: File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; General | File Locations... &gt; Workgroup templates &gt; Modify &gt; "\\AF-02004\Users\PublicWordTemplate" (a network shared folder):<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63bb985c-18d0-41d0-a239-655123147ce8" /></p>
<p><br />
My Word 2011 configuration: Word &gt; Preferences &gt; File Locations &gt; Workgroup templates &gt; Modify &gt; "Users:Public:WordTemplate":<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35071824-506c-4040-9328-4c75c61261dd" /><br />
<br />
<br />
**Problem:**<br />
When i create a document in Word 2011 based on my common work group template (from the shared network drive) and take a copy of that document (.docx) to my Windows computer and open it in Word 2010, i have full access to all my macros.<br />
<br />
When I edit the document in Word 2010 (Windows), save it, and take the document (.docx) back to Word 2011, there are no macro functionality any more! I can also see that the Document template folder has been changed!<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0122da8a-834a-4fa3-8cc2-c8fc978b98eb" /><br />
<br />
That's not the folder I initially adressed... (\\AF-02004\... is not a Mac style relative path!)</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>How should configure the system so I can keep macro functionality in the template based documents when I share them between PC (Word 2010) &nbsp;and Mac (Word 2011)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have read this thread:</p>
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macword/making-documents-based-on-custom-template/f140f0c0-5a45-43cd-b892-86f94b3c4d30)">Making documents based on custom template shareable (Word 2011)</a>&nbsp;
<p>I have the same problem: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- It doesn't seem to matter if the document was authored in Word 2010 or Word 2011. Both work as expected on the PC, fail on the Mac.")</span></p>

            <p>Hi Hauns:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The short answer is <strong>"DON'T"</strong> attempt to share templates between different versions of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, Word 2011 is kind of "Word Lite", it does not have all the powerful tools and features that Word 2010 has. &nbsp;While documents are almost completely interchangeable, templates are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have discovered, the template path is stored in the document. &nbsp;While the PC can resolve the Mac path, the Mac can't resolve the PC path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One issue you will run into is the concept of "Trusted Locations". On the PC, you can "Trust" locations so Word will load templates from them, ignoring the presence of macros. &nbsp;On the Mac, the trusted locations are fixed, you can't customise them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your purpose, you need a Global Add-in (more convenient than an Attached Template, since the Global Add-in is available to all documents).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you place an alias to your template in the Startup folder on the Mac, Word will load the template as a global add-in whenever it launches. &nbsp;On the Mac, the Startup location is<br />
&nbsp;/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/Startup/Word</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you can change that location: I haven't tried recently, but I seem to remember that if you try to change the Startup folder location, it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, on the PC, you can load this as a Global Add-in and it will stay loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now: &nbsp;I would set the file Read-Only and edit it only on the PC. &nbsp;PC Word adds extra sauce to templates; Mac Word will interpret that as "damage" and may strip it if you attempt to save changes to the template from the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to share templates between Word 2008, 2007, 2010 and 2011 on my computer, but eventually I found it was just too much trouble. &nbsp;I now copy the macros to the Normal Template in each version of Word. &nbsp;Anoying, having to remember to update the macros
 in four different templates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wasn't so lazy, I could write a macro to load a Global Add-In on Execute, and put that in each template. That macro would never change, and each time it would load the single maste copy of the macros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One reason I don't is because of the mayhem that would result if I ever introduced a 64-bit version of Word. &nbsp;The VBA in the 64-bit versions is very definitely NOT compatible, you end up with some serious code-arounds on some statements to cover the different
 functions available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            outlook deletes my meeting without send a cancellation</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user with a problem in Outlook 2010.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>She sent out meeting request from a public calendar&nbsp; or a person calendar with attendees.&nbsp; She wants to cancel the meetings and the future meetings.&nbsp; When she cancels the meeting it deletes from the calendar public or person without sending a cancellation
 message.&nbsp; We want the cancellation messages so that the appointments&nbsp;are taken off of the attendees' calendars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I did a test from my calendar and I can right cancel or open the appointment and cancel I will get a cancellation message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If she opens the appointment she will get a send update box but if she hits cancel meeting the meet is deleted without a message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials Definition updates</h2>
                    When I look at Windows Updates, which are automatic, virtually all of the MSE definition updates show failed, while virtually all other updates are successful. Why? And is MSE worth anything as a scan tool given this situation. When I open MSE it indicates
 definitions are up to date.

            I ran a full scan on my Windows 7 system which took over 22 hours with no other activity going on with my computer. Under settings I had CPU usage at 90%. After seeing that scan had been running for 22 hours, and seemed to be only half done,&nbsp;I changed
 setting to 50% and scan was completed almost immediately. Scan results showed no issues. Does anyone have any idea why this occurred?

<h2>            Why is my phone no longer supports whatsapp</h2>
                    Hi. I bought my Nokia Asha 203 three months ago and i downloaded whatsapp and it was working properly until yesterday. It all started by writing " invalid application" when i try to open it. I've deleted it so that i can re-dowload it but when i try to
 dowload it again says invalid application but when i dowload other applications like games and facebook it does download.<br />
<br />
What must be the problem?<br />
<br />
Please help because i rely on this whatsapp application since my family is abroad and i have got not enough money to call them since international calls are expensive.

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
sorry to hear the problems you are having. have you checked with Whatsapp as to what the issue is? this is their product, and has nothing to do with Nokia as support for a platform is dictated by the app developer.

    <title>Need help with auto sorting in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russellrobinette  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help with auto sorting in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I need Excel to auto sort smallest to largest descending and pull other cells to the new location as a new time is entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In detail:</p>
<p>Column C is time of day for a specific event (in military time) beginning on Row 5.&nbsp; When a user enters a new event and assigns a time to it, I need that corresponding information to sort into the correct event row.&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is a capture of the worksheet.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e808013-577e-4324-ac9b-6f46c92c6ed1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So for instance; The data entered for Event #10 beginning with Cell C14 and ending with Cell I14 would need to move to the row for Event #1 (Cells C5 to I5).&nbsp; So basically&nbsp;I just need Columns "C" through "I" beginning on row 5 to auto sort based off of the
 time entered in column C so that the proper Event&nbsp;# is met based off of the time of day that it occurs.&nbsp; I believe this requires a Macro but I am unfamiliar with those.</p>

            <p>One caveat before you go too far. . . . .automatic sorting by VBA is risky because if you make an error in data entry it is difficult to track down after the sort occurs and you don't get a "do over"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you feel an autosort is needed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting columns C to I and Data&gt;Sort takes but a few moments and leaves you with a chance to undo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VBA code is available if you choose to go that route.</p>

</p><p>Let us know what you think.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Gord.</p>
<p>This document will be on a shared drive for multiple people to use and I'd prefer not having them all try to do anything other than what the file is intended for (not all of them are well versed with Excel).&nbsp; Other wise, I would just show them all how to
 sort after each update or do it myself.&nbsp; Unfortunately this is not a viable option.&nbsp; The plan is to have them fill out all of the other pertinent cells first and then enter the time of the event in column C last (since I don't want to sort by anything other
 than Column C)so that they don't have to track down where the data moved to after it auto sorts.&nbsp; That being said, there are individual tabs for each day of the week with very short lists to be sorted on each tab so I am not too concerned with entry errors.&nbsp;
 It should be fairly simple to recover any lost data due to the small size of the list.</p>
<p>I'd like to at least give the auto sort option a try before resigning myself to manually sorting each time there is an update.</p>

            <p>"Shared drive" means one workbook is shared?<br />

You cannot see or edit code in a shared workbook so must unshare before adding the code.<br />
<br />
You can re-share it later after you have done your testing and are satisfied with results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good idea to make an unshared copy of the workbook for practice workbook.</p>

            <p>Gord,</p>
<p>I tested it on a new(blank) workbook and it yielded the same error.&nbsp; Again, I am using Excel 2k10.&nbsp; Do you think the issue may involve the file type that the file is saved as?&nbsp; It is currently a .xlsm document and the Trust Center settings for Macros are
 set to, "Enable all Macros" and "Trust access to the VBA project object model".&nbsp; Not sure what I am missing here.</p>

            And yes, I would be glad to upload the file to a sharing website to see if we can resolve the issue.
