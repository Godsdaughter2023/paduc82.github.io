    <title>a pop up box that wants to run a word search in messages in windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suepernv  say:</h3>
<h2>            a pop up box that wants to run a word search in messages in windows mail</h2>
                    
<p>When I am reading messages or typing message in Windows Mail &amp; also in my Facebook account, I get a pop up window that wants to search for words . It has a box that says "Find" where you would type a word or letters &amp; has boxes to check to Match whole word
 only, highlight all matches &amp; match case. This box will not go away until I type something in the box.&nbsp;Then it will highlight in yellow every occurence of the word or letters. It is very frustrating &amp; I don't know which program it came from or which update.
 Has anyone had the same problem?</p>

    <title>Genuine product key is now not genuine&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinwebber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Genuine product key is now not genuine&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For the past few years, I have had windows 7 ultimate with a genuine product key that I purchased. However, very recently I have begun to get a windows is not genuine prompt. And my desktop background has gone black with the text in the bottom right saying
 "Windows 7 Build 7601 This copy of Windows is not genuine."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is why is it doing this now? When I never had this problem before, and how do I re-validate windows with this key as I have tried re-validating and it tells me to try another key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span><span>A few days ago my computer was working somewhat o.k. but then started typing acting up real bad.<span>&nbsp;</span>When I click the Start button the All

 it.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was something like aTi2v0.exe or something like that.<span>&nbsp;</span>If I click on internet explorer, as soon as it loads it does the same thing.<span>&nbsp;</span>I cannot type which site I would like to go, or do
 a search because the fields are typing the x’s.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also, the cursor acts like it wants to disappear when I hover near a program on the task bar. My virus program (Avast) did not detect anything and I did a full system scan .<span>&nbsp;</span>Is

<h2>            Bluetooth keeps turning off.</h2>
                    <p>How can I turn Bluetooth on? It will randomly shut off, then my bluetooth mouse just stops working. I have tried the following fixes.</p>
<p>1. Restart the computer - works most often but is a complete time-wasting pain.</p>
<p>2. Go to Device Manager. Checked the driver, and it's the latest. Go to HP website (mouse is XB4000) and download possible update anyway.</p>
<p>On of the preceding would usually help. Now, it won't work. I also recently put new batteries in the mouse just to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bluetooth icon used to be shown with all others in the system tray but now it doesn't. It doesn't show in Device Manager and there is no "Other" device as some Microsoft help articles have shown.</p>

<h3> jillkangas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 login password</h2>
                    My husband died in 2012. &nbsp;I took his laptop in to a computer person (in 2013) to have his password hacked and changed. &nbsp;The computer guy said he couldn't hack the password, but created an administrator account and put my husband's account in a folder on
 the desktop. &nbsp;Fast forward to yesterday when I downloaded Windows 10. &nbsp;Once again my husband's account is the only one on the start up screen--no administrator option. &nbsp;I tried going into F2 and changing passwords, but that didn't affect anything. &nbsp;I don't
 know what to do. &nbsp;It seems that once again I have a computer that I can't use.

<p>you will be able to Play Xbox Live, but you can`t purchase Content on the Xbox Store (Games,DLC,Video, Apps).
</p>
<p>Also some other Content is not available (Apps,Xbox Video,Netflix etc.)</p>
<p>Please do enough Research about what you want to do, if it is possible before getting one..</p>
<p>It could be embarassing, at the Moment it can be difficult to get Games with Gold for XB1.</p>
<p>But yes you are able to Play Online via Xbox Live on a "unsupported" Xbox One.</p>
<p>As I do I`m from Switzerland, but I can`t get the DLC for Titanfall or Battlefield for Example.</p>
<p>And "free" games for Gold i needed to purchase via xbox.com and enter a CreditCard (For that no garantuee that it works), of course it was for free but tricky.</p>

    <title>Power Option kicks in when Spybot is running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Option kicks in when Spybot is running</h2>
                    Vista Home Premium SP2, IE8, WLM 14.0.0726<br />
Dell laptop<br />
<br />
Where is the proper section to post this ?<br />
First time Spybot asked to have system restarted in order to finish scanning and reparing. It found quite a lot of problems.<br />
Power Option is set to turn off display after 20 minutes.<br />
Spybot ran for over 80 minutes. Power Option turned off the display every 20 min. I had to hit the power button 4 times to turn the display back on.<br />
I thought Power Option only kicks in if computer is idle. <br />
SpyBot was running, why power option turned off the display ?<br />

<p><span>Hi t-4-2,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft answers!</span></p>
<p><span>You have done a good job in posting the question in the right category!</span></p>
<p><span>Sounds like you have set the computer to sleep and also to turn off the display.</span></p>
<p><span>Sleep is a power-saving state. Sleep saves all open documents and programs, and allows the computer to quickly resume full-power
 operation (typically within several seconds) when you want to start working again. Putting your computer to sleep is like pausing a DVD player: the
<strong>computer immediately stops what its doing </strong>and is ready to start again when you want to resume working.</span></p>
<p><span>Basically, when the computer goes to sleep, programs (<strong>SpyBot)</strong> will ideally not run the computer.</span></p>

<br />
I'm afraid not. If the computer went to sleep and I had to turn it back on by pressing the power button ( which I did ), I would have to sign in my password. That's how I set it.<br />
<br />
My power plan is :( plug in )&nbsp; turn off the display&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20 min.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put computer to sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 hr.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That comes back to my original understanding of Power Plan.<br />
Power plan will kick in only after 20 min of idle. But, if my Spy Bot is still scanning, computer is NOT idle.
<br />
Am I right or wrong ?<br />

            Hello t-4-2,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To my understanding idle means user activity (such as mouse movement or keystrokes).&nbsp;If you set the computer display to&nbsp;"never" this won't happen in regards to you having to login, but you can&nbsp;change this also by not requiring a password upon waking up. Happy
 Holidays. Make it a great day!<br />

    <title>Problem with Forza Horizon 3 on Xbox One S - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with Forza Horizon 3 on Xbox One S</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>



<p>I bought the Forza Horizon 3 game for the Xbox One S 500 Gb console. After the installation, the game starts normally. However, while I'm playing the first race, always at the same point on the track, the screen goes black but the sound of the game continues. Unfortunately, I do not have the invoice anymore, so I don't know if I can exchange the game. I ask for your help.</p>

<p>Thanks for attention.</p>

<p>Att,</p>

<p>Evilásio Costa.</p>

<p>Remember that this is only "CONCEPT ART", so basically the map might be totally different in reality.</p>
<p>I mean sure, the island is the same shaped, but the sky might be different, the runway might be different, the destroyed carrier might not be there... This is just a scetch an artist has made to make the map look awesome.</p>

<p>You must not have played any previous BF title. 1943 was made smaller to accompany the player size as well as the arcade file size. Mostly the latter, I think.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums!!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are here to help you and guide you in the right direction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Help me with additional information. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-Were there any hardware or software changes made on the computer prior to this issue?
<div><br />
<div>There are several reasons that could trigger this issue. Here are some possible reasons for this issue:
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Third party application installed on the computer is causing the issue.<br />
b. There could be some devices on the computer that could require updated drivers.<br />
c. Virus Infection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try these methods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Method 1<br />
</strong>Perform virus scan to make sure the computer is virus free.<br />
<strong>Run Microsoft Online Scanner. <br />
</strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
Important: While performing scanning on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.
<br />
Also run full scan using Microsoft Security Essentials, click on the link mentioned below.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials</a><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2<br />
</strong>Boot the computer in safe mode and check whether the issue persists, if the issue does not persist then perform clean boot and check whether the issue resolves.
<div><strong>Step 1<br />
</strong>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed. Please click on the mentioned link below.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2</strong></div>
<div>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
How to troubleshoot problem by performing clean boot in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
Note: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in Step 3 to reset computer as usual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Method 3<br />
</strong>Make sure that you have all the latest drivers installed for all the devices on your computer. Click on start, type ‘device manager’, in the device manager, see if you have any yellow bangs or exclamations for any devices. Expand the driver you want
 to update and right click on the sub item and click update driver.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps.<br />
Keep us posted if you face any issues on windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</div>

    <title>Belkin Powerline and unable to connect to Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Belkin Powerline and unable to connect to Xbox Live</h2>
                    

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time in reading my post. Hopefully you will be able to help me.</p>
<p>Before I upgraded my network, everything connected worked.</p>
<p>I basically have invested in the Belkin Powerline HD pack (F5D4078uk) and a Netgear Switch (but ignore this for the moment)</p>
<p>I have a Belkin Wireless Modem/Router - F6D4630-4.</p>
<p>I have connected it like so; Internet &gt; Router&gt; Powerline&gt; Powerline&gt; PC - this configuration worked. Replace the PC with the Xbox. The xbox receives the Ip address from the router however it cannot connect to the internet - with the famous - cannot connect
 to DNS error. I have also 'pinged' this with the response of time out.</p>
<p>I then went on to Belkin's website to update the firmware, I have done this and have had no luck.</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas - any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>

<p>Belkin N routers can be troublesome, try setting up exactly like this guide:- <a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/faqs/62-my-nat-is-strict-or-moderate#BelkinN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Sadly this didnt help. I have tried to do the suggestion, the xbox cannot gain a static ip from the router, it fails the very first test. So I had to put it back to the 'auto' settings. There is a massive red cross between Network and Internet.</p>

<p>Hmmm, what did you upgrade in your network then? And the PC works fine on the adapters? I have seen Belkin power line adapters have issues before with the Xbox</p>

<p>I just bought the powerline adaptors, nothing else has changed on the network.
</p>
<p>I can confirm that the PC can use the adaptors - as I am currently connected to it now, but it doesnt work for the XBOX - its really annoying me. What is so different to the xbox and the PC that is so different that it allows the PC on the internet and not
 the xbox.</p>

<p>Its not the Xbox that is different really its the Belkin powerlines, some don't work well with the Xbox. I've seen ones that do work before but even affect your NAT status which is even more strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've found the best Homeplug/Powerlines to be Solwise, VeseNet and Devlo, any chance you can return and exchange them? Apart from seeing if there's a firmware update for the powerlines (unless your saying you've done this already) I'm not sure what else
 you can do really, I find Belkin kit pretty shocking for anything relating to Xbox to be honest, its a shame as it used to be good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't work with a manual ip address or on auto but works when connected direct to the modem there's nothing you can change on the Xbox or router to make this work, its down to the powerlines</p>

            <p>It means that you can, if you wish, open the CBS.log file in Notepad. This file shows the results of running the System File Checker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find the CBS.log file, go to&nbsp;C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two things you should know about reading scanner log files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First: You need to be an uber-geek to understand what these log files mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second: Scanning tools like SFC or Event Viewer or Reliability Monitor or similar third-party tools will almost always find all kinds of errors, warnings, corruptions, etc., that almost always have no real meaning. They are typically just Windows internal
 plumbing.<br />
</p>
<p>If you have a specific problem with Windows, the best thing to do is to concentrate on solving that problem. Running scanners just to see what they output is like investigating your wife's old boyfriends: You're not really accomplishing anything and just
 making yourself upset.<br />

            <p>Thank you for that. I indeed didn't understand what was in that log file haha. I tried putting this.</p>
<pre><code>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</code></pre>
<p>The following showed.</p>

<p>I don't know what to do so I just scanned drives C &amp; D. Errors were found in C then the PC restarted but I don't know if everything has been fixed. The real issue I was trying to solve was the BSOD specifically, Memory Management. I did that SFC scan as
 suggested <a href="http://windowsreport.com/memory_management-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. I also ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool and yet no result was shown after the restart. Any other things I should do for BSOD not to come back?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I can only offer limited advice here because, not meaning to boast, my last BSOD was when I had Windows 7 and it was just once. (More on the BSOD later.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A blue screen almost always has an error message (which LOOKS_LIKE_THIS) and an error code (which starts with 0xC000...) The first step is to search for that message and/or code on the internet to find out what it means. That tells you what type of error
 you're dealing with. Frequently, that's all the information you'll need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the explanation is too generic or doesn't sufficiently explain what went wrong, you can usually find more details in Event Viewer. Look for an error that occurred around the time you saw the blue screen. That will provide additional details. Understand
 that you're wading into geek waters here. If you're a computer person you'll run another search with the additional details and usually find your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An important part of interpreting a BSOD is being aware of what's going on with your computer. The experts also get blue screen errors but they can usually identify the source because they are attuned to changes that are being made to their computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think that researching blue screen errors is complicated, figuring out what the **** a DISM log means is much worse. On top of everything else, they contain red herrings that don't really amount to anything but just take up your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what you've tried already, so here's my advice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Post the error message and/or code here and describe exactly what you were doing when you saw the error. Someone here might be able to interpret it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- If you can find the error is Event Viewer, post the details here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- If no help emerges, there are some people here who occasionally volunteer to read through your DISM log (must be insomnia) and pinpoint the cause of the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About BSODs: They really should be called the Blue Screen of <em>Life</em>, because they stop your computer from committing suicide by executing incompatible or incorrect instructions
<em>and</em> they provide an error code for diagnosis. Before BSOLs, computers kept on executing bad instructions until they couldn't go on any longer, and all you got was a cryptic message pointing to an address in memory.</p>

            <p>From your advice:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;All I was able to remember in the blue screen message was the word "Memory Management". It happened when I turned on my pc when I woke up. The day before, a weird message showed but it was not a blue screen. The weird message I think contained the word
 "Shell" and "Boot" though I'm not really sure and it happened when I was having a system scan using BitDefender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Since it happened immediately when I turned on my computer, I based the code below on the first error event in the event viewer on that day.</p>
<p><em>Windows failed fast startup with error status 0xC0000001.</em></p>
<p>Even though it just happened once after upgrading to Windows 10, I really am worried because I just recently reformatted this pc to Windows 8.1 just because of the frequent BSODs before, until it coudn't boot. Then I was shocked it just upgraded
 to Windows 10. Although I still have a chance to go back to Windows 8.1, I'm still considering staying since I pretty much like Windows 10 and I don't want to be outdated in the future. But if my hardware components really can't handle Windows 10 then I think
 I really need to go back. I don't know how to know though if my pc can handle this os.</p>

<p>1) Disable the touchpad and get a real mouse.&nbsp; Could be USB, USB wireless or Bluetooth (if you have the latter option.)</p>
<p>2) Disable the scroll feature of your touchpad.&nbsp; This will depend, somewhat, on the particular touchpad... BUT...</p>
<p>Control Panel &gt; Mouse &gt; Device Settings Tab &gt; Settings &gt; Virtual Scroll</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>

    <title>White pixel in front of my screen&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            White pixel in front of my screen&#63;</h2>
                    I was playing a&nbsp;game one day, and when I clicked a button, it kicked me out of the game. I went in and out of the game trying to figure it out, and it turns out a white dot or pixel is on my screen. And when I click it in game, it takes me out of the game.
 And because in the game the&nbsp;"pointer" (what&nbsp;you use&nbsp;to click&nbsp;things)&nbsp;is fixed on&nbsp;where the pixel is, I can't move or&nbsp;click without being kicked out of the game. Is&nbsp;there anyway to fix this?

            It's actually not Windows, it's iTunes.&nbsp; The latest version is very white (and very hard on the eyes).&nbsp; It looks just as bad on XP, you probably just had the previous version of iTunes before you upgraded.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Apple is the only one that can
 change it -- they programmed iTunes, and they didn't follow the standard rules of "respect the users' choices!"<br />

We have tried every way to sync it over and over. We don’t have a usb and honestly don’t want to. I want to fix the real problem.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>My&nbsp;mic stopped working with&nbsp;my original controller...the headset and mic work on other devices so we got a new controller and now it won’t sync.</p><p><br /></p><p>Ideas? Thanks!</p>
