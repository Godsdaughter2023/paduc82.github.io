<h2>            sent messages from windows live mail 2011 no longer appearing in &#39;Sent Mail&#39; folder</h2>
                    <p>I've been using windows live mail 2011 successfully for a long time for my gmail account ( set up by wizard so uses IMAP folders).&nbsp; I have no other email accounts. Suddenly , during a session , my sent mail was no longer appearing in my 'Sent Mail' folder.
 I suspect some local file corruption. If&nbsp;I send messages using the gmail webmail the messages DO appear in the local 'Sent Mail'&nbsp; folder so IMAP synchronisation is working OK. The sent messages were still appearing in the local All Mail folder and I can move
 them OK&nbsp;to 'Sent Mail'. and get them synchronised)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reading all relevant 'answers' to similar problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved all sent messages from 'Sent Mail' to a subfolder in 'All Mail' in order to empty the 'Sent Mail' and used 'properties' to click DELETE all messages and headers. This did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the gmail account from live mail , and set it up again ( using the wizard).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used from control panel the 'repair windows live essentials'. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've unset and reset the box for 'save copy of sent messages in the 'sent items'. And rebooted lots of times. I've reviewed all likely settings and they are unchanged. I've reset the IMAP folder list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping there is a simple remedy as I've now spent many hours 'experimenting' with no success.</p>

            <p>Are you still on Vista? Windows Live Mail 2011 isn't supported on any other platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the <em>Sent items </em>folder under Storage folders. Are your sent messages there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select Properties. On the
<em>IMAP</em> tab, is the Gmail <em>Sent Mail </em>label mapped to <em>Sent Items</em>?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gmail saves sent messages on the server automatically, so the <em>Save copy of sent messages in the 'Sent Items' folder
</em>option is redundant and doesn't need to be selected if you only have the one account.</p>

            <p>thks for fast reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on windows 7 home premium. Windows live mail 2011 came preinstalled I'm sure, and has worked fine for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no sent items&nbsp; under storage folders in any folder including sent items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And under the IMAP tab the Gmail sent items path is set correctly to Sent Mail ( as set by wizard).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have about 15K sent mail entries&nbsp; though I have now moved them out of the Sent Mail folder hoping that would 'uncorrupt' the file somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly something happened when I was emailing&nbsp;during a period of about 2 hours that stopped live mail being able to write the sent messages to the Sent Mail folder. I thought perhaps I'd exceeded some size limit. The mail gets sent ok and the messages appear
 in the 'all Mail' folder as expected.. And of course webmail is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess one option is to uninstall live mail 2011 and install a later version and again remove the gmail account and set it up again. thks</p>

    <title>The benefits of Xbox One X on 1080p TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> v3ntilator  say:</h3>
<h2>            The benefits of Xbox One X on 1080p TV</h2>
                    <div>99% probably bought Xbox One X for 4K, but i bought it for improved framerate, loading, texture quality, faster system etc.<br />
There is not that much info on the net for 1080p mode as the main focus is 4K.<br />
<br />
I bought the console yesterday for 1080p, and here is my discoveries so far.<br />
<br />
Xbox One X benefits on 1080p TV vs Xbox One 2013.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Pros:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>- Forza Horizon 4 runs at 60fps instead of 30 fps.<br />
- Shadow of Tomb Raider runs at 60fps instead of 30 fps.<br />
- Forza 7 Menus and everything else runs on stereoids. Loads a track at the blink of an eye. (As fast as Mario Kart 8 on Wii U and Switch)<br />
- Game streaming to Windows 10 is now perfect and lag free on max quality.<br />
</p>
<p>- Loading times is shortened alot on lots of games, and even non enhanced games like Just Cause 3.<br />
- Games with framerate issue usually runs at locked framerate on Xbox One X.<br />
- There is some new super sampling etc. for games which also works on 1080p.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>- Assassins Creed Odyssey. Loading time. I don't think it's that much faster. The first thing i noticed right away ingame is that the textures is crisper and have more details.<br />
- Red Dead Redemption 2 gfx have crisper textures among other things.<br />
- Red Dead Redemption 1 is custom enhanced for XBX ands looks better.<br />
</p>
<p>- Xbox system menus doesen't lag anymore. Full speed, and everything is quicker.<br />
- Xbox Game Recording can record up to 1 hour even in 4K.<br />
- Quitting games is alot faster</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>- Running any Games natively on TV at the same time game streams to Win 10 does not affect performance in any game i tried like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Aassassins Creed Odyssey and Forza Horizon 4. (Pointless, but i forgot to stop streaming before i started
 a bunch of games. ;)<br />
<br />
- Just Cause 3 on first run loads ~3 times as fast as XB1. If you go back to menu, and load again it loads whole game in only around 8-10&nbsp; seconds, and ingame is full speed no matter what happens. JC 3 is not enhanced for XBX, but still have big improvements.<br />
I haven't started JC 4 yet which is enhanced for XBX.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>- X amount of the games have XBX Enhanced patches which is not downloaded on old Xbox One to save space.<br />
- 15 of 40 XBX Games installed drained around 150.GB more of space with XBX patches.<br />
- I have 40 XBX Enhanced games on ready to install list too, so i don't know how they are yet.</div>
<div>
<p>-<br />
Everything is better on XBX vs old Xbox, so there is no drawbacks except for selected games that drains more space.</p>
<p>Space is not a issue on Xbox One as you can connect 3 x USB HDD's at the same time, and up 24.TB (3 x 8.TB) i think in total unless they increased the limit even more.<br />
</p>

            Yes the Xbox one X has a lot of great features. That's why it's called &nbsp;"The worlds most powerful console" You have to experience it first hand to really grasp how awesome it is.&nbsp;

            I got an X last year &amp; still haven't upgraded my TV as yet to fully take advantage, even upgrading from the Xbox One Elite console it's a marked increase in startup speed &amp; it runs (for me at least) significantly cooler &amp; quieter as well.&nbsp; What I would
 say though is that the stock HDD is really not a lot, first thing I did before I even got my console was to purchase a 2tb external HD, especially the size some games are getting to be these days!

<p>Been happy with my One X so far. I've got a 4K TV to go with it as well.&nbsp; If you don't have 4K, I suggest you save up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a PC gamer too, built myself a new PC just last December.&nbsp; My only issue with this console - indeed all consoles this gen - is there are too many games locked at 30 fps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the highly optimised 60 fps titles, I've been highly impressed with though. And at the moment, some of my One X titles out perform my PC still. But they won't for much longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you guys/gals like to see more in depth analysis of these consoles, I suggest you check out Eurogamer's Digital Foundry on YouTube. They do in-depth analysis of all current generation hardware.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for nice replies. :)<br />
<br />
I just wanna say a bit about external HDD on Xbox One as someone mentioned it.</p>
<p>It's almost my favourite feature on Xbox One and Xbox 360 too as it can give you unlimited storage if you buy big enough HDD, or use 2-3 smaller ones at the same time. I use 2, as i use third USB for Gamepad charging.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Running games from USB 3.0 HDD is fast on any Xbox One Console including 2013 model. I have used 3.TB in USB on old Xbox One for years with no problem.</p>
<p>You can get 2.5" 2.TB drives cheap nowadays. 2.5" Works with USB power. You can also connect 3.5" External HDD with external power. 3.5" uses too much power for a USB port, but still does not use much power.<br />
The benefits of 3.5" is that they are usually faster than 2.5".<br />
</p>
<div>Xbox One also supports hot swap on USB HDD. If you somehow have to remove it, Xbox One removes the games on menu from that HDD. If you insert it back a bit later, Xbox One scans HDD and auto add games.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I rarely hot swap HDD, but i use 2 x USB drives, and a third USB HDD drive with games i don't plan to play anytime soon to save space on other drives.</div>
<div><br />
When you have external HDD connected, a new option is shown in sorting options.<br />
You can select to show only games internal HDD or games USB HDD. If you have 3 USB Drives, you get 4 choices.<br />
<div><br />
When that's said, i will check out 4K TV's in local stores as i need it for movies too.<br />
<br />
English is not my native language, and is why the "writings" may be a bit weird here and there. ;)</div>

<p>Hello xSICARIOx13!</p>
<p>Usually if a game is kicking you out back to the home screen you should first try a full power cycle or restart on your console first. I recommend you first try the steps listed here:

            I tried every step. Called xbox everyday since it happened. They were great unfortunately they could not resolve my issue. I thought i was done. I could not play on my digital download or hard copy. &nbsp;Only when i figured out that unlinking my social club
 and xbox account did it work.&nbsp;

Also, newer computers come with certain security mechanisms built in, disabling them will be required to facilitate the older version of Windows.

<h2>            Unable to select files or folders in Windows 10 since April Feature Update</h2>
                    <p>Contacting support was a waste of time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to select a single file or a folder within Windows Explorer using my Microsoft Arc Touch mouse OR using the trackpad mouse on the Microsoft keyboard that's attached to my Surface.&nbsp; I can select a folder within the left panel of Explorer (Quick
 Access area).&nbsp; I can select single emails in Outlook and all other applications.</p>
<p>I've done the reset folder options, uninstalled my mouse, nothing.&nbsp; I am literally unable to function without being able to copy files and folders etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Also right-click on the start menu &gt; search doesn't work and the WIndows Search service is missing from Services. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Good News !!!</p>
<p>I uninstalled the MS Virtual Wifi miniport adpator from the Device Manager, rebooted and the Atheros AR5007 based long range wifi adaptor was then listed as Wireless Connection 3 in the Connect to List and could connect to wireless networks as per normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a little bit worried about one part of your description Scott as there is no such Windows application as RegDelete.Exe - the only reference I can find to this application is a piece of software from Pinnacle to remove their video card drivers.</p>
<p>The secret to curing this problem is to get rid of the MiniPort Adaptor by disabling and then uninstalling it using the normal Windows methods.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for your contributions - I will mark this thread as answered.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

<h2>            Laptop display backlight won&#39;t turn off after connecting secondary display</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Dell inspiron with Intel hd 3000 and Nvidia 525m display adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both graphics adapters work great but there is a annoying problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have connected my Sony Bravia trough HDMI with laptop and everything works fine except one problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn on the computer, windows boot on my laptop lcd, then switches to my TV display and everything is fine</p>
<p>and working except backlight on my mobile display won't turn off.</p>
<p>I found half-solution - I project it on my 1 screen (mobile display) then return it to 2nd (Bravia) and backlight on mobile display shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Intel hd 3000 doesn't have support for win 10 but I &nbsp;wondered is there any solution for this weird problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi thanks for response</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full model is Dell Inspiron 17r N7110 with i7-2670qm processor with Intel HD3000 integrated graphics and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nvidia 525M.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated drivers all I can - latest Nvidia but for Intel I had to use Win 8.1 drivers as instructed from&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dell and Microsoft page because Intel stopped support for Sandy bridge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yep, mobile display I mean laptop display and his backlight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Sony TV &nbsp;is always connected trough HDMI as this laptop serves it's purpose for TV entertainment, and it's pretty irritating that when I boot up I must turn off laptop display backlight with procedure I posted in OP (laptop screen is black but backlight
 is turned on).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never happened on Win7 and 8.1.</p>
<p>Now I installed Win10 and everything works great except this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that it's problem with outdated &nbsp;Intel HD3000 drivers 9.17.10.4229 from 5/26/2015 and that I can't do anything about them but if anybody have any idea and maybe solution I would be very very happy</p>

<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name

<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h3> jinxy43  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do you repair media center off windows 7 disc&#63;</h2>
                    Hi a while back I had to replace my hard drive and do it with an tech from alienware. everything went well but the media center didn't install like before I did try to explain but kept saying that was a software third party problem even though I had it
 before with the internet tv etc. now I can open it but no internet tv downloaded playready and that didn't help ether. I don't want to start all over with installing windows 7 , just reinstall for my set up is good except for the media center. is there a way
 to repair or redownload off the disc so that I can have it like before which files should I copy from disc or installer? thanks DD

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform the steps mentioned below to repair Windows Media Center and see if it works.
</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the start search box and hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>b:</strong> Then click <strong>Programs and Features.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>c:</strong> Click on <strong>Windows Media Center</strong> in the window that appears on screen. This listing of all programs installed on your computer is organized alphabetically for easier access.</p>
<p><strong>d:</strong> Click on the <strong>Repair </strong>button. This will completely reinstall a new copy of Windows Media Center over your existing copy. This won't touch any of the changes to settings or personal files you've added to the program. What
 it will do is replace any corrupt or damaged program files with new, functional copies. Once the repair process is complete, you can continue to use Windows Media Center as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a Nice Day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply if you face any concerns. <br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Unable to change folder&#47;file permissions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aschwarz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to change folder&#47;file permissions</h2>
                    <p>I have a two drive system. C:\ is for programs, E:\ is for data. After an unsuccessful win7 - win10 upgrade I was no no longer able to use my OS on my C:\ drive. My E:\ drive had already had a win7 OS installed so I shifted to using my E:\ drive as my OS
 drive (a motherboard setting makes the E:\ drive a C:\ drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have folders and files with an owner:group of Unknown+User&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown+Group. There are several issues I have seen in changing permissions: Explorer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Security and either -&gt; Edit User Name or Advanced.</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing the root folder can be done but does not propagate correctly. Some files give the diagnostic message "The permissions on &lt;filename&gt; are incorrectly ordered which may cause some entries to be ineffective". When this occurs the Edit popup does not
 allow a new user name and the Advanced pupup shows some permissions with "Traverse folder / e...".
<br />
</li><li>In the Security popup the Edit open opens another popup without a diagnostic but the Add button is grayed and inaccessible.</li><li>Changing the owner on some folders yields a diagnostic of "You do not have permission to read the contents of directory &lt;directory name&gt;.&lt;filename&gt;.eml Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions granting you fill control".
</li></ul>
<p>There may be more issues. My problem is that I have 20,000+ folders. If I can't globally propagate ownership/permissions then I have an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I clean my folders/files so that I can propagate ownership/permissions correctly?</p>

 and displays a popup for printing code except Microsoft Edge an Microsoft Photo's. No popup appears but the print job goes to server and jams the print queue. i have&nbsp;replicated this on other&nbsp;windows server 2012 and the same issue occurs.&nbsp;I have tried different
 drivers with no success .I have tried it via windows server 2008 and its works fine. I&nbsp; print directly to printer without going via server it works fine.</p>
<p>Please can I have some advise.</p>

<h2>            I posted about it yesterday, i just want to know what to do right now.</h2>
                    This is what i posted yesterday:<br />
Ok so I knew this guy just today, and we were gonna exchange account for the benefits of the digital rights and the sharing content, i gave him mine first ( dumb ), i thought i had a lot of security systems, i even had the authenticatore app, that code with
 25 digits for the double system, i gave him the data, i kinda felt that it was suspicious but i didn't care, he was saying that i had to approve the log in from my app, but i was like no if you are doing it on the xbox it should say use another option, he
 first said that he was on the xbox, then said "oh no im in the web page" i didn´t care and now i know that i was very naive; ok i told him "no do it on the xbox" i did it and i told him to click on "use another option" button, then select to send a code to
 my alternative e-mail, he did it and i gave him the code that i received, then as soon as i got logged out from my xbox, i told him "now your turn" he said "wait" and that's it, without having passed 1 min i started receiving mails at m alternative account
 that the security info had been changed, the alternative account, a lot of things, i was like fu... , he chaged even the mails with those which i could join or at least try to, so couldn't even recover it with the form to recover the password, when i tried
 it said that the e-mail that wrote didn´t exist, i tried with both i had and same message error, now those mails don´t exist anymore, the account is still there but he deleted those mails. Ok, i tried a lot of things and nothing, oh i even tried with the 25
 digits code but he chaged everything so fast, so i tried a lot of things, i was thinking and i remembered that on the xbox you can see the e-mail from the account, the e-mail related to the gamertag before logging in, so i looked for it and BINGO, there was
 the new e-mail this guy used, then i used it to fill&nbsp; the recover- password form, i did it and everything went well, i changed my password with a link that was sent to the account that i gave, i fortunately logged in with my xbox and chaged the rights to my
 account and everything, i said fortunately because, i sent a request to change the security info, but then i received a mail saying that it had been canceled, he canceled it and THEN chaged the password again, i'm logged in on my xbox with my account but i
 feel like he doesn't log in with his xbox just to pretend that he gave up, he may think i don´t know that he changed the password again so he doesn´t log in not raise suspicion. Im sorry for the long story, so the problem is that he somehow got to change my
 password, the request cancel i can understand it, he received a mail saying that a request had been sent to change the security info, but he somehow changed my password, i fear that he filled a form to change the password and "recover" the account like me,
 because he changed a lot of data when he had it, he changed the name, city, birthday, he knows my gamertag, so he can fill out a request as well with that info because somehow is correct info rigt?,&nbsp; the only thing he doesn't know are the credit card i used
 to buy my stuff, games, memberships, etc; and the security question, or the answer for it well said, wich i put when i created my account like 10 years ago. So the problem is that he may try to "recover" it again and again non stopping, right now he has de
 password, but im logged in on my xbox, just please help, i know i committed a mistake, so badly, but i need help please, i won´t do it again, it has been a whole of a lesson.<br />
<br />
HERE'S MY QUESTION RIGHT NOW:<br />
I chatted with someone of the Microsoft support today, told me they will call me tomorrow and they will star an investigation, BUT the problem or my question is this, i was only logged in with my account with my xbox, i had the fear that login on his xbox because
 he had the password, he changed it again, and he just did it, what should I do? should i just wai until tomorrow for the call or should i send another request to recover the account?<br />

 (so far!) was the touchpad freeze.&nbsp; Thank you so much, whoever posted that one!!!!</span></span></p>

<p>Hey cookiebetter,</p>
<p>Perhaps following up on the thread whose suggestion fixed the issue would have been more helpful. There are lots of discussions going around in this forum regarding jumping cursor and various suggestions such as reducing touchpad sensitivity has helped in
 correcting the issue.&nbsp;Apparently, there are many causes of this issue. But we're happy to note that your issue is resolved.</p>

<h2>            Will a UK Xbox One connect to the UK xbox live store in China&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I live and work in China, and I am going back to the UK and I am contemplating on buying an Xbox one. I have a PS3 and PS4 that connects to the psn store and i can get games and play online there but I've never been able to find out solidly if the Xbox one
 will do the same. I've seen posts on forums from people who imported consoles and using them in different regions and getting issues or being locked out of games they downloaded.</p>
<p>All I want to know is, if I buy an Xbox one, take it to china, will it connect to xbox live and can i buy games and dlc from it, and also if i buy an xbox game from a different country ie the USA will the game's DLC be region locked, and would it be playable?
 Ie I have a UK xbox one in china, i have a copy of call of duty from the USA, would it work online and would i be able to get the DLC for it?</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>The store you see on your Xbox itself is linked to the region you choose from the system settings. Also the Xbox One is region free so if you buy physical copies from games in a different country they still work, however there can be issues with digital
 purchases as you will need a creditcard from the UK with a UK billing address in order to purchase games off the UK marketplace the same goes with the currency cards.</p>
<p>You'll need currency cards purchased from the UK. If you purchase them in China you'll get a different wallet added to your account with which you can only buy games from the Chinese Xbox Marketplace.<br />
<br />
As for the DLC it should just work.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 start up Apps list shows a strange App</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I have observed the following behavior on my Dell Inspiron Laptop, when I boot my laptop and login, I get to the list of startup apps and see a strange app in the list. This app disappears from the list if I go to Apps and Features and come back to
 the startup apps list. Below is the screenshot of the startup apps list. &nbsp;Is my laptop infected with any malware?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;depend on&nbsp;Windows Defender to protect my system from any virus or malware. I see Windows Defender is up to date. I have run a quick scan which did not report any virus. I plan to run a full scan tonight. Full scan on my laptop&nbsp;takes about 15 hours to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Below is the basic information about the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>

<br />Also right click your task bar and go to task manager.
<br />Go to startup tab and make sure you disable any app you don't recognize.
<br />
<br />If none of that works try going back to a restore point before you noticed this behavior.
<br />To do that go to search and type create a restore point and open it.
<br />Click system restore and pick a restore point.

<p>That's either malware or the remnants of malware that Windows Defender removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good anti-malware software will remove only the malicious part of an attack, leaving behind benign portions of the malware that do not affect your computer. You can remove the rest manually, if you wish, but I wouldn't try this unless I had well-researched
 instructions that I feel confident in following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot depend solely on an anti-malware application to keep you safe.</p>

<p>I have run the MSRT full scan and it did not find any infected files. I tried to restore system to a week back restore point and it failed with the below message.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to find out at what point in the registry copy failed? When I ran the system restore again, it did not find any restore points.</p>
