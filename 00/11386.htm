<h2>            Quick Access Toolbar Buttons</h2>
                    Is there an equivalent button in Word for mac to the 'publish as PDF' in the PC version that can be placed on the quick access toolbar or will it need a custom macro?&nbsp;

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>I do not see the ability to customize the ribbon to add the "Save as PDF", just not available. Only way would be with a macro but I can't help with that part. There are a few experts in this community that should be able to help if it is possible.</p>

<p>It should be up to us to make choice between WiFi and non-WiFi connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "avoiding data charges" argument is totally laughable!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case MS does not know there are data charges while using the Internet too. So it should also force us to use WiFi to surf the Net!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has this simple idea not struck the minds of the wise guys in MS? Have they also ever considered the fact that not everyone will have access to WiFi?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forcing us to choose a particular option is totally BIZARRE! What kind of a twisted wisdom is this?</p>

</p><p>I am not asking myself this question because I am fully aware how ridiculous it is - in this specific context. I wish firmware and OS updates are allowed over a mobile connection, just to observe the flood of complaints when masses of people use up their
 "free" (or inclusive, if you prefer) data allowance and get slammed by the mobile operators with hundreds/thousands/millions of (pick your own currency here) on their next bill. What do you think, who will get blamed for not protecting these people from their
 own ignorance ? </p>

<p>
</p><p>I do not understand this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi can be either 2G or 3G or 4G. How can it be "50x the speed of 4G"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sound strange to me. In which world does this technology exist?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&gt;&gt; "...just to observe the flood of complaints when masses of people use up their "free" (or inclusive, if you prefer) data allowance and get slammed..."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Complaint about what? </p>
<p>What's wrong in using up "free" data? </p>
<p>Isn't that supposed to be used up? </p>
<p>And after using up they are supposed to buy the next data pack. Isn't that how it normally works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what exactly is your complain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the context of the main issue I'd raised this does not make sense. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even WiFi will also have lots of traffic and lots of downloads. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again going back to the main point I'd raised, it is we who should be deciding which connection to use for Updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have 2G I know updates will take ages to be completed. Therefore, I will not do that. I may then search for some WiFi spots in town.
</p>
<p>And if I've 3G/4G mobile connection, I should have the option to makes updates through it. Which MS strangely does not want me to do!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?</p>

            If you are on Windows 10, the update should download on mobile data(as long as it is 3G or better) and you have atleast more than 1GB data available. On windows phone 8/8.1, OS updates can't be downloaded via mobile data.

            <p>Hi Stranger, I've Win 10 in my mobile and the data limit is 500 mb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it because of the data limit the OS did not allow Updates through mobile data connection?</p>
<p>Do you mean to say if the data limit is less than the Update quantity there will be no updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, where from did you get this info? Can you please give any link to MS sites?</p>

<h2>            Office 2003 Crashes when trying to Copy, Paste, or Save with Windows 7 Professional</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We seem to be having an issue for the last few weeks with some of our new laptops. We are using Dell E6410 running Windows 7 Professional and Office 2003 Pro.</p>
<p>It seems when our users try to copy, paste, or even save a document they are working on it will crash the Office program they are using.</p>
<p>We did find articles out on the web saying it could be related to a printer driver from HP (since we do have a lot of HP Printers in our office), we did what the article said and changed all the HP drives to a Universal one.</p>
<p>Then the issue went away for a day and then came back, then we found that the Ricoh drives for some of the printers in the office were causing the same issue so we installed the Universal driver for them and the problem went away as well.</p>
<p>Now the issue is back again and we are stumped at what is going on.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated as my user is getting a bit ticked off after being upgraded to something that isn't working.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>-Ira</p>

 the Broadcom Chipset driver from Dell.</p>
<p>GantryG wrote:</p>
<p><strong><span>"I found the problem- it was the "WIDCOMM Bluetooth Software".&nbsp; We found that the problem was specific to&nbsp;some new Dell Latitude E6410 laptops, which use a Broadcom chipset for Bluetooth&nbsp;connectivity,
 known as the Wireless 375 Bluetooth Module.&nbsp; When I uninstalled that, the problem went away on multiple computers.&nbsp; This is listed in Control Panel/Programs and Features as "WIDCOMM Bluetooth Software" by Broadcom, version 6.3.0.3102.&nbsp; This version is known
 by Dell as version A02, and is the latest released by Dell as of now (August 26th, 2010."</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>So after we removed the WIDCOMM Bluetooth software (since there is still no update to this driver) the issue has now vanished.</span></strong></p>

    <title>Server Name on Email Account Setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elibernard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Server Name on Email Account Setup</h2>
                    <p>My ISP has changed their&nbsp;server name since I set up my email account (on my own domain). My email works, but I get a certificate security error every time I open Outlook. I have determined that the best course of action is to change my current server (mail.mydomain.com)
 to their new server (mail.b.hostedemail.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Outlook client with a 365 subscription, therefore current version 1901.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Repair feature allows me to change the server name for incoming and outgoing mail. Outlook accepts the change as "successful", but the changes don't stick. I continue to get the security error - and going back into the settings I see it has reverted
 back to "mail.mydomain.com".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Thank you for your repy, Parmi. However, I found an easier solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added "mydomain.com" with IP address to my host file. Found the IP address by pinging mail.&lt;mydomain&gt;.com</p>

            the only way you can add a language to your phone is by going to nokia care and having them do it, for a small fee. it is not meant for your phone to begin with as the phones are released with respective language packs for their regions. your phone was
 not meant to have japanese. if you decide to update a firmware in the future or have to reset your phone you will lose the added language and will have to go back to nokia care to get it back.&nbsp;

    <title>OneDrive Photo Albums are missing in Camera Roll - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneDrive Photo Albums are missing in Camera Roll</h2>
                    <p>Out of nowhere, the photo albums on OneDrive are gone from the Camera Roll (is it still called that?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Nokia 822 on Verizon, and am running WP8.1 DP w/Black. Just about a week ago, I clicked on the Photos Live Tile, and slid to the left to select Albums. I have the following Albums listed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Camera Roll</p>
<p>Facebook Beta</p>
<p>OneDrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to successfully view pictures in the Camera Roll and Facebook Beta albums. However, when choosing OneDrive, I see the following folders:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Camera Roll</p>
<p>OneDrive Albums</p>
<p>Recent Pictures</p>
<p>Saved Pictures</p>
<p>Shared with Me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Camera Roll on OneDrive.com shows a few dozen pictures in the album (as does the OneDrive app for WP8.1), but it is showing nothing on the phone. Recent Photos brings up a hundred or so pictures and videos (BTW- can this information be cleared?). When I
 click on OneDrive Albums, the only pictures I see are a couple that are in the OneDrive root directory. No other albums are listed not do I see any way to look for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I want to note that the OneDrive app on the phone AND the OneDrive.com website in IE11 on the desktop, EACH work correctly, displaying all photos and albums. I am talking about not being able to view OneDrive albums from the Photos app on the phone.</p>

    <title>Displaced lines in OneNote, all work messed up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Displaced lines in OneNote, all work messed up</h2>
                    <p>I have what seems to be a very serious problem with my OneNote on my SP3. After a few hours of drawing and writing, all lines on my page suddenly lined up vertically, completely destroying all my work (see below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I rely on OneNote for my work, this may be a bug of such magnitude that I may need to consider moving away from the platform altogether, if this cannot be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I could tell, the only thing out of the ordinary that I did was to copy and paste a drawing, but not directly before the disaster occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got similar problems? What can I do?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Bragi Dash Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have a Bragi Dash Pro that seems work well with my Moto G4 Plus android phone. Bluetooth audio connection seems to work fine for music playing, WhatsApp calls, and regular phone calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I use skype the audio/sound switches back to the phone, even though the Bluetooth connection seems to be maintained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to make it so I can use Skype with Brago Dash Pro (note - current version of Bragi software is 3.0.2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Uninstall and reinstall the skype application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. You may try to reconnect the Bluetooth device you’re using.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Clear the connection history of the audio device before reconnecting.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Don’t use other application aside from Skype, after your reconnect the audio device, then try the Skype application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Also, when you’re on a call, try to toggle the speakerphone on / off and check on it.</span></span></p>

                    <p>I had a video call with a foreign interviewer (skype to skype). Both video and sound which he saw and heard me were ok. But both video and sound which I saw and heard him were very poor. For the first five minutes, the connection is good, for the next five
 minutes the connection is bad. His video (I saw him) and the sound are intermittent. But my network signal is normal, even very fast, it is a wired connection, and my firewall is also closed. My skype is also the latest version (MacBook).&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor Specialist on Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />May I suggest that you restart your mac and try again to watch the video, so to confirm this is not related to a lack of free memory issue?
<br />
<br />Does the issue still persists?
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

<p>I created a new note book on the skydrive and this put it on my phone as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now I have 2 on my phone, the one that doesn't show up on the sky drive and the one I created on the skydrive that shows up on the phone too.</p>
<p>These are in the section of office called notebooks and shows a list of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you follow this even?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I delete the other one on my phone that wouldn't sync to the sky drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holding my finger on the notebook only gives me a "pin to start" option.</p>
<p>Selecting it only gives me a "sync" option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I delete it?</p>

<h2>            How to get files to open automatically in Microsoft Word instead of Word Starter</h2>
                    <p>Prior to purchasing Word I temporarily used word starter. &nbsp;Even after getting Word all my files continued to automatically save as word starter documents and anything that I opened up from online automatically opened with word starter instead of word. &nbsp;I
 was unable to figure out how to resolve this issue so I deleted word starter. &nbsp;Now I can not open any files. &nbsp;I can not open files that are saved to my computer, links sent in emails or download word documents from my online school. &nbsp;I have tried to reload
 word started and I can't get that to work either.</p>
<p>Please Help.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>They are saving as Word documents. The thing is that your system thinks that the proper program to open such files is Word Starter.
</p>
<p>Most people who install a full version of Word want&nbsp; to uninstall the Starter edition. You may have to repair your full version after you do this.</p>

<h2>            Filehistory Drive gets randomly unassigned, will not turn on or reassign filehistory drive, &#34;Access Denied error, Start button frozen, PC settings gone..</h2>
                    <p>So after the update to 9926 (which was not smooth) -see comment in (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_desktop/microsoft-visual-studio-2013-with-update-3-will/00d77e13-754c-4232-b8aa-4ce6ccc6429f) I went to restore personal
 files from Filehistory to see that it had not been working for 4 days and was now showing as "off". It was still showing the drive as assigned but when I tried to click on "turn on" it would seem to stick for a long time, then eventually would come back with
 "Access Denied". I have since tried removing the drive, reformatting it, and then trying to add a new drive for filehistory. In any case I get "Access Denied". I have never removed the drive that was assigned to filehistory. I also tried it with other drives.
 Also tried adjusting the Advanced options regarding space for filehistory and time to save them (forever) and still get "Access Denied". See the above link for related issues with new installs of programs and additional permission errors. Since this update
 to 9926 my task bar and start button/menu are freezing so that I am unable to even shutdown the computer. Pressing control _alt _ delete to try and get to task manager now get an error about Windows not responding to Control alt delete and to hit ESC. Freezes
 there and must be manually shutdown via power button. I read about the Windows update that will address this start button freeze but it also affects PC settings and cannot open either. Went to control panel to see that Win Update is now removed. Once this
 is all up will be doing that reg tweak to put Win Update back on control panel. Wish MS would stop messing with that and stop making things less accessible. Now can't get to PC settings to run an update to fix the start button issue in the first place. System
 restore is not an option as noted my comment in the other thread. </p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur due to incorrect system file settings.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With Windows Startup Settings (which used to be called "Advanced boot options") you can start Windows in different advanced troubleshooting modes to help you find and fix problems on your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Safe Mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible
 causes.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may perform a full computer virus scan using Windows Defender to ensure that the computer is free from virus. A fast way to check whether
 your PC has a virus is to use Windows Defender. This malware protection is included with Windows and helps identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>

            I anticipated that that may be a response I'd like to get however running the windows defender in the window setting does not come up with any nothing detected and I just so as a note the windows defender off-line scanner ever since the 9926 build on it
 no longer recognizes windows 10 as an operating system and my case I still have an old install of windows XP 64 which he does recognize but if I try to booty just the windows disc on with just Windows 10 it will say no OS installed I am running a scan off-line
 with another program and I'll see you when I get home but otherwise I've tried those solutions and they don't workapologize for the misspellings this was dictated

            <p>Still not resolved. Also tried with enabling the admin account with same results. Had a couple of remote sessions with techs from Itunes and Acronis as cannot install those programs as well. Both companies were unable to resolve nor provide any information.
 Most recent errors on installs give an error related to "Unable to set file security settings" and also errors to the effect of "unable to create folder on c:\". The specific error codes related to the Itunes installation errors are 2503 and 2502.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The File History drive is always showing as either not on or unable to associate or reassociate with files. Haven't changed or moved it, but do note that multiple drives have "file history" folders. Wondering if I can consolidate those files, wipe the current
 file history drive and attempt to re-assign it. Then manually add the consolidated file history files back to the drive. Would that work? When I do try to turn on file history will usually comeback with an error similar to "Unable to associate drive" or something
 like that. Actually last night the filehistory drive was showing as on, and I tried to hit the restore files button but came back with "no files associated with file history found" and then just as soon as it showed them it went back to file history off. Went
 to services and saw that the service was showing as disabled and reset it to automatic startup. I am not changing the services so again concerning for some type of malware. But that doesn't really explain it all I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A note that I've tried running a couple of commands that were recomended in the past by others in various forums. When I do get errors regarding permissions with Windows 7 and before with XP I would run : icacls c:\* /grant everyone:(oi)(ci)f /t</p>
<p>then followed by : takeown /f c: /r /d y</p>
<p>
</p><p>That usually worked on those OS (I know wasn't Icacls with XP). Am I messing it up worse by running that? I don't run them by default unless I start getting permission errrors frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also used subinacl and scripts related to that to reset-acl permissions and they are specific to username (not MS account) like in Win 7. Not sure exactly how they would be run if signed in with MS account but have run the scripts the same as on Win
 7 and does seem to change some permissions with exception of Access denied on many system files, particularly with security files. I also have tried to see if re-registering all .dll files would help by copying the c:\windows directory .dll files into a txt
 document and then using the replace option to change the c:\ to regsvr32.exe /s c:\ and save as a .bat file. That always worked in Win 7. I do that because was also getting some errors related to missing .dll files, in particular some VC Redist x86, x64 from
 2005, and 2010.&nbsp; Re-registering the .dll files sometimes has some unexpected results like it will turn on autoplay and some times will fix issues with services or programs not running due to "missing" .dll files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, tons of issues. I probably spend 75% of my time lately troubleshooting all these issues. I don't know if I mentioned it but these problems are persistent on multiple OS , including Win 10 9926 and Win 8.1 as well as with Win 7 in the past.
 They are also persistent on multiple different computers running various setups. So makes me think there is some issue with the way things get set up with my MS account. I don't usually configure anything with the firewall or group policy and last time I checked
 everything was either not configured or set on default settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Like I said before, the Windows Defender doesn't update correctly and almost always fails when try to update the definitions. I have the 64 bit Windows Defender offline bootable scanner and used to always work to fix that update issue if I ran it offline
 and updated the definitions that way but like I said, ever since Win 10 9926 the offline Win Defender scanner doesn't show any OS or will only show the other OS and not Win 10 if try to run that. I'm also sure you've heard that SFC no longer works in Win 10
 9926 which only compounds the issue. Also I have never, ever, had Windows defender come back with any positive results. Has never reported any found issues, even when I knew I did have a trojan. So I do not trust Windows Defender at all and really run it just
 to keep the errors at minimum. I usually run Hitman Pro 64 as needed. I also have Malware bytes but now the Malwarebytes won't open and when it does run it gets stopped by Windows with an error. Last time it froze running it's rootkit scan. It's not running
 as it should and as it is scheduled. The last time it did run it came back with issues found regarding some PUP but then it froze and I could never see what it really found or remove what it did identify. Think I'm going to run the TDSS killer and Rkill64.
 May run Combofix also, but I hate to get into that again when I don't have any confirmation that some thing is there and is usually some false positive. I have a giant headache over this stuff. One more thing that there always seems to be some issue reported
 with chkdsk. Used tweaking.com Windowso AIO repair and Glarys Utilities check disks utilities and which both&nbsp; says errors on drive. But again I don't beleive that for sure, as using brand new, out of the box, WD and Seagate Drives and can do a clean install
 on a brand new disk, run chkdsk with /f or /f /v switches and will usually report errors. I don't know what to believe anymore.

            <blockquote>i have a scatter plot showing cross section, (profile), of a beach with distance versus elevation. how do i calculate the area underneath the profile using excel? i know its b*h/2...but how do i do this?</blockquote>
<br />
For a triangle, base*height/2 is the area. For a rectangle, base*height is the area.
<br />
<br />
The simplest approximation of area might be a set of rectangles defined by your data.
<br />
<br />
It's even simpler if one of the variables has equally-spaced values. <br />
<br />
For more info, tell us more about the data (upon which the scatter plot is based).<br />

    <title>Excel Equation - overlapping times and time gaps am&#47;pm issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel Equation - overlapping times and time gaps am&#47;pm issue</h2>
                    <p>=IF(NOT(E2=E3),"",IF(F3&lt;G2,"Overlap",""))</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the current equation I am using to identify overlapping time in my data, which is an error. The data is pulled in AM/PM format and this equation misses or incorrectly identifies overlapping times - especially around
 12pm. Is there a way to easily convert the time to military or a way for excel to recognize the am/pm difference?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also need a formula that takes these times and identifies time gaps of 4 hours or more - sometimes up to 24 hours. Same issue - identifying AM/PM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! :)</p>

</p><p>Your equation has been put in cell 2 of column Next, the same equation in cell 3 of column Prev. Both results are correct. Because Next is compaing with the next row and Prev is comparing with the previous row.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have also the date, a better way is to think with time lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/617dd07a-345c-495e-b906-322a60b8e77c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/617dd07a-345c-495e-b906-322a60b8e77c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>t1 ... t4 must be a date and time stamp. We can now define the overlap as the minimum of t2 &amp; t4 minus the max of t1 &amp; t3. The following picture shows it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90e0fd22-8bf1-4790-a270-91af9a9c24ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90e0fd22-8bf1-4790-a270-91af9a9c24ce" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is now clear that the overlap is from t3 to t2 or iow the minimum of the end times - the max of the start times.</p>

    <title>E61 Battery advice - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oliverm---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E61 Battery advice</h2>
                    I know that a lot of people have commented on the low battery life of the e61, and I have to admit to not being one of them until now.<br />
<br />
I think a phone that does bluetooth, wifi, gprs, 3g and voice, and run any kind of app you throw at it, will use a lot of juice. Its the nature of the beast.<br />
<br />
However, i have seen my battery life drop over the week or two i have had the phone, and now, even without ever making a call, and with jsut Mail For Exchange running over 3g, and only getting about 20 emails a day at the mo, i'm getting less than 14 hours
 from a full 16 hour charge.<br />
<br />
I unplug the phone in the morning, take i to work, where its in my pocket. I come home again and it stays in my pocket until about 9pm when the battery dies. This is if i dont make a call on it, or surf etc. Just a "quiet" day at work with no off-site visits.<br />
<br />
Should I look to replace the battery under warranty? I mean, that cant be right can it? With no wifi, bluetooth etc, i shoudl be getting more than 1 day.<br />
<br />

            Obviously it depends on what features you use, but I have had mine a month and am pretty impressed with the battery life - 4 to 5 days not unusual.

            Four to five days ????? on an e61 ?<br />
<br />
I havent ever had more than two, and i think thats reasonable as wifi eats power. Even so, with wifi never being used and not connected, with bluetooth off, and NOT making a call, i now get less than a day.<br />
<br />
If you really are getting 5 days, then clearly i think i need to return the battery.<br />

            We have seen Mail for Exchange cause high battery consumption if there is a problem with the access point.<br />
<br />
Have you noticed that the GPRS connection indicator is creating and dropping a link every couple of minutes?<br />
<br />
Which carrier are you using? Verify that your AP is not using proxies: While editing the AP, press Options-&gt;Advanced_settings. The settings with "proxy" in the name should be set to 'none' or '0'.<br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting that you delete the information here, but try another AP that does not use proxies. Your carrier may have to provide you with this.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Make sure and update your client to 1.2.14. The latest version will always be found here:<br />

            Easiest way is probably to drag from the corner handle. The handles on the sides will distort. The ones in the corners shouldn't.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi </span><span>Zaher Arraf,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you try the following steps to delete the folder:</span></p>
<p><span>Method1: Move the folder to trash and delete it.</span></p>
<p><span>Then <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>Method2:</span><span>
</span><span>Launch Terminal.</span></p>
<p><span>Type: &lt;sudo rm –R&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span>Press the spacebar one time.</span></p>
<p><span>Open the Trash window in the Finder, and drag all the files you want to delete to the Terminal window.</span></p>
<p><span>Press Return.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted to enter your password, do so and then press Return.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, you can refer to the

            The problem is with&nbsp;Kaspersky Outlook Anti-Virus Addin. Kaspersky's Anto-Spam add in appears to work, but their Anti-Virus hangs Outlook for some users.
