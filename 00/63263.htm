                    <p>hey guys so I have only just tried to move things over to a usb&nbsp;and I looked on the setting and found a storage part and there you could &nbsp;choose&nbsp;&nbsp;different externals devices but could not move things over to them.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be good for everyone to have This added to&nbsp;xbox one so we can put recorded videos&nbsp;on To&nbsp;them and screenshots, so if you can think of this and if it isn't a added it is a big mistake because even PS4 have this available&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows movie maker keeps crashing&#33;</h2>
                    I recently started using the free trial version of movie maker. I was working on a video project for 2 days and it was working perfectly. On the third day of working on the same project, as soon as I imported a video the whole program shut down. when I
 tired to open up the software up again it asked if I wanted to restore the project because it had shut down unexpectedly previously. I clicked 'restore project' and my project was back. A couple minutes later when I added a photo, the same thing had happened
 and the program shut down. When I tried to open the software again, the same thing happened and I got the popup asking if I wanted to restore the project. This time when I clicked 'restore project' the software would shut down within 3 seconds of me clicking
 it. This has happened every time since whenever I try to 'restore' the project. I have also saved the project and when I go to open that, it will only allow me to open it in movie maker and it crashes every time I attempt to open

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by the "free trial" of Movie Maker. There is no "free trial" version of Movie Maker. The program provided by Microsoft is part of the free "Windows Essentials" download and there is no "trial" version, free or otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would do is make sure I'm running the latest official version of Movie Maker. It will be able to read older project files as well as newer project files. But just to be sure, make a back-up copy of your project (.wlmp) files.&nbsp;Some of the
 older versions of Movie Maker were more prone to crashing, so I'd recommend the latest regardless.</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-wlinstall/want-to-download-a-safe-version-of-movie-maker/9531c5d8-0bff-48cc-afa5-9ba19927c6b2">Where
 to get a Safe Download of Movie Maker</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The next thing I would do is immediately try a save of your project as a movie. I'd hate for you to lose your in-progress work and not even have a single save of the movie so far. Remember the *project* is not actually a movie. You always want to try a save
 as a movie as you go along to ensure you don't encounter problems toward the end of the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I would do is to always save your project with a *different* name each time. That way if one of the project files is lost or corrupted in a crash, you can go back to the one before. I usually save the project with numbers like "MyMovie01" "MyMovie02",
 etc. Or perhaps the date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide some details on the number of clips in your project, the length of your movie, the types of video clips you are using, etc.?</p>

                    <p>Hello. For a few weeks now i can't send messages to other players on console (or on xbox.com page). All i get is that for some past behaviour i am suspended from sending messages. I have no idea why i am suspended. I have never send and rude messages to any1 or said anything in the chat. What could be done with it? I can't even start chat with support member because in the graphs where must be my 1st and 2nd name i have "???????" symbols and i'm not able to correct them. :(</p>

 do it using the command prompt. Your answer was simply perfect, you actually answered the question that was asked. Unfortunately some forum members feel compelled to reply whether they know the answer or not. Thanks!</span>

            In Windows 10, right-click the Windows Start icon in the bottom left hand corner of your screen and open the Command prompt (Admin). In the Administrator Command Prompt, you can enter the command "notepad" and the application will open in administrative
 mode. You can then make any edits and save wherever you want without any restrictions. Take care. More freedom, more responsibility!<br />

<h2>            How can I enable compatibility view in Edge&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 and now I can no longer open the web-enabled applications from work in Edge. These applications use older versions of IE. Before, in IE 11, I added my company's web domain to the list for compatibility view and that worked fine.
 However, I cannot find this option in Edge anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search on the Internet and on this forum for compatibility view settings in Edge, I only find instructions for IE. Does anyone know if Edge can be used to properly show older IE web pages (IE 7 and higher)? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Kiran, thanks for your reply. I already discovered in the meantime that I can choose the option to open in IE, but had hoped it would be possible to use Edge. At least you are clear that this is not possible.</p>

            <p>It's not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After long months spent trying to get Edge to work how I need it, I've given up and it's now permanently in the apps list NOT on my taskbar as a shortcut.&nbsp; I use IE 11 as main browser and Firefox (43) as secondary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The long history of Microsoft taking something good and completely ruining it is well documented.&nbsp; There have been a&nbsp;few poor IE's over the years but 11 was as good as can be and Edge in comparison seems like an apprentice piece that should have been discarded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compatibility is a joke, display interactivity is poor and controls are all over the place. The toolbar and menu&nbsp;placements are the work of an 11 year old kid who just wants to mess with the adults.&nbsp; The appearance of Edge is pure Android with clinical edges
 and no character, it's like a Zombie version of IE 11...a body with no brain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do yourself a favour and use another browser until Edge 2 comes out and then we'll see.</p>

            <p><span>It's not just Edge, but many other idiosyncrasies of&nbsp;</span>Windows 10 which had left me wondering if MS actually tries to annoy it’s customer base to a maximum
 extent possible. I have used Windows 10 for a week and ran from one problem / annoyance to the next (e.g. no more placeholder folders/files of online onedrive folders in Windows explorer, sync problems with Onedrive, hardware which failed (on a new Lenovo
 X1 Carbon!), etc. So, I rolled back to 8.1, which worked fine for me.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply. It confirms my own experience and that I made the right decision. I’ll leave W10 for a year in the hope that MS comes to their senses.
 As usual, MS launches a new / half product and then uses their customer base to run into the problems. I'll pass for the privilege.</span></p>

<h3> thdphd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update</h2>
                    I'm curious why you folks thought it was a good idea to drive a bunch of us off Windows 10 with the Creators Update. I've been using Windows 10 since 2015 and now I'm back to 8.1. Installing the Creators Update cost me 10 days of struggle to get my machine
 back to a state in which I could use it at all. I'm done with Windows 10.&nbsp; Moreover, I'm not going to load Windows 11 or 12 or whatever you decide to name the next instantiation of Windows until it is at least 3 years old, if then.&nbsp; I fully realize you past
 practices will force me at some time to choose whether to stay with Microsoft of move to another operating system.&nbsp; I'll just face that situation when it arises. Lastly, I've been using Microsoft products since the mid-80s.&nbsp; This whole experience is disgusting
 and to my mind is the result of arrogance and hubris on the part of both management and programmers.&nbsp; My workplace is still using Windows 7 and they show no motivation to advance to a later platform.&

            My recommendation to users going forward is not to pounce on every new Windows 10 Feature Update that is released. If your system has been working just fine with the current version, wait it out a while or skip it all together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just to keep doing the same thing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />If you look at whats considered the flagship features of Windows 10 1709, they are aimed at newer generation devices like the new Surface Book 2. Otherwise welcome features like Story Remix, which you have to upgrade to 1709 to get, could be supplanted with third party alternatives.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The unfortunate reality is, the newer feature updates are not guaranteed to work really when anything pre-June 2015.

            Window 8.1 will support my personal and work needs just fine until MS decides not trash it at some future date in the interest of their top line and earnings.&nbsp; They should have thought about those things when they were releasing updated versions of 10.&nbsp;
 I had to remove one of those earlier but that was not a hassle.&nbsp; 1709 was a nightmare.&nbsp; Thank you for your response.&nbsp;

            Agree to the fact that 2 major upgrades in an year and a focus on introducing more features is somewhat they should not do-but we as volunteers and MVPs can also give feedback to an extent. It is up to the Product manager to act.

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition &#34;Unlock Full Game&#34;</h2>
                    I have the official minecraft and when I visited the mojang website I noticed that if you have the full minecraft game on pc, you get a free windows 10 edition. I hopped over to the windows 10 edition&nbsp;and I have the code for the full game, but when I click
 on the "Unlock Full Game" button, nothing happens. It just allows me to click as many times as I want but nothing seems to appear. Please help.

<p>OK, there are plenty of apps both free and paid for that we as developers use to create installers (both exe and MSI)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the free apps that are available require some scripting and the end product is not very professional looking . . .</p>
<p>I use a paid for version of Advanced Installer as I find it the best and everything can be done graphically with no coding required</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of them however will create the program files folder, registry entries, uninstaller, desktop and start menu shortcuts . . . etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search the web for 'free application to create msi installer'!</p>

<h2>            Local local area connection adapter is disabled</h2>
                    Hi! I've been having a problem with my Ethernet connection ever since I upgraded to windows 10 (from windows 7). Every now and then while browsing the internet or playing an online game my connection stops and when I run troubleshooting on it I'm told
 that the local area connection adapter was disabled. It restarts its and the internet comes back up, but some times not even 15 mins later it does it again and sometimes the troubleshooting gets stuck while resetting the adapter and I have to restart my computer&nbsp;(which&nbsp;brings
 the internet back online too).&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I am having this problem as well after upgrading to Windows 10. It has to be a problem with the OS. I have shut the computer off and restarted. Re-enabled the local area connection. Tried troubleshooting. Updated the driver. Re-installed the driver. Replaced
 the Ethernet cable itself. And I am still at a loss as to what is causing my local area connection to become disabled every 5 MINUTES. My next option is to just revert back to Windows 7 and hope that fixes the issue.&nbsp;

<p>I have received several notification to activate windows, but each time I click on it I get this feedback :Troubleshoot. And after clicking on the trouble shoot this display: we can't activate your copy of windows. Make sure you're connected to the internet

            Hi Emmanuel.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />How was Windows 10 originally Activated on the PC?  Did it come preinstalled from Factory, was it Upgraded with free or paid Upgrade, or was it a retail copy and license?  
<br />
<br />For Upgrade, when you first upgraded and it activated it assigned a permanent Digital License to the PC in Microsoft Activation Servers so you can reinstall any time and in any way you want as long as you reinstall the licensed version.  It should reactivate soon after going online.  
<br />
<br />You can move the Digital License to new hardware following this procedure:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />Factory installs have the Product Key embedded in BIOS or UEFI firmware and should activate themselves, but you can check for the key by installing ProducKey and look for the OEM-BIOS key:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>
<br />
<br />Retail keys must be reinserted for reinstalls during install or in Settings. 
<br />
<br />What is the Status and Edition shown at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />Run the Activation Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation.  If it says you have a Digital License then no matter what method above only the Generic Version Key can be inserted to reactivate:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />

            Whoever installed it, might have installed a volume license (organization key) on your computer. 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise volume license clients are used by large organizations that deploy Windows 10 in bulk to hundreds or thousands of computers. Sometimes, users will copy these organization keys off the Internet and use them to install Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise, but they are blocked from activating because it can't reach appropriate KMS host (Server computer) which handles the activation request.  
<br />
<br />You would need to purchase a genuine license for Windows 10 Pro from the Microsoft Store. If you can't afford Pro, you can purchase Home, make a bootable copy then perform a custom install. 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/cat/categoryID.70036700?=en_US_Store_UH_software_Win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br />
<br />If you were previously installed for Windows 10 Home, you could try downgrading to that edition.
<br />
<br />There is one way you might be able to downgrqade to Home without having to reinstall everything, but its pretty advanced. 
<br />
<br />Open Registry Editor (WIN + R, type regedit, hit Enter) 
<br />Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion
<br />Change EditionID to Core (double click EditionID, change value, click OK). In your case it should at the moment show Pro
<br />Change ProductName to Windows 10 Core. In your case it should at the moment show Windows 10 Professional
<br />Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Wow6432Node &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion, change the same two values as in steps 3 and 4 above
<br />Close the Registry Editor
<br />Insert the Windows 10 Home installation media, do an in-place upgrade by launching the setup from desktop (not booting with Windows 10 Home install media)
<br />When asked, enter your valid Windows 10 Home product key and select what to keep (settings, personal files and apps, only personal files or nothing)
<br />Windows 10 Home in-place upgrade will be done now.

                    I have tried all the Microsoft web sites I can find I have spent about R200.00 on cellphone calls to them on their (toll free No) waiting for somebody to answer the phone . I was trying to down load&nbsp;windows&nbsp;media player&nbsp;to resolve a blue screen problem
 when I was told that they needed to validate my O.S ,I have been through this&nbsp;process before and was&nbsp;deemed legal the next time I booted up I had all these&nbsp;error&nbsp;messages with the black wall paper .

            Hello John,<br />
<br />
Please specify what version of windows you are running with what updates and also give us information from these blue screens and errors you are experiencing. Windows media player would most likely not be needed to resolve a BSOD.<br />

            Hi alex thanks you for replying. I have windows xp professional with service pack 3 (downloaded last month) from&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;which as you know you cant do if you are counterfeit I also get regular updates from&nbsp;Microsoft.
<div>&nbsp;The blue screen problem. A secondary&nbsp;hassle only happens when when I am online and there is a&nbsp;video&nbsp;clip that I want to watch .first the screen freezes then blue screen with memory dump and a whole lot of instructions and numbers. Please be patient with
 me I am not a computer genius .&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            John,<br />
<br />
On the blue screen about two lines from the top windows will state the faulting module or something else. It will either be a product name or a file name such as sys.dll or system or wininit.exe etc. It's very important to find that out because that is what
 triggers your blue screens. If it is a video clip it might be a problem that happens when the video is sent to the graphics card for processing. Do you have a graphics card or did yours come integrated to the motherboard?<br />
<br />
Difference:<br />
Integrated - Installed onto the main mother board chip.<br />
Non-Integrated - Installed in the specific graphics slot usually at a 90 degree angle with the motherboard. (PC only - laptop: integrated or placed diagonally (45 degree angle)<br />

            This is a problem caused by your graphics hardware most likely. You should try to uninstall your display adapter driver and install an updated version. Another way you might be able to avoid this is if you try to lower hardware acceleration. This lowers
 how much of the graphics card's features and windows uses.<br />
<br />
Right click desktop &gt; Properties &gt; "Settings" Tab&gt; Advanced &gt; "Troubleshoot" tab &gt; move object to decrease hardware acceleration.<br />
<br />
You can try this as a temporary fix or a permanent fix but it would be better to try to fix the drivers so you can fully use your graphics card.<br />

            No. The problem is that&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;sees me as counterfeit so I cant down load from them although I&nbsp;still&nbsp;get updates from them the hassle is my screen background is black and when I fix it , it lasts about 30 min then its black again ,I have to wait every
 time I boot up to get rid of the message from them which I have to click to close before my pc completes the boot up,there is a&nbsp;label on the&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;right corner that says &nbsp;" YOU MAY BE A VICTIM OF SOFTWARE COUNTERFEITING. This copy of windows did not pass

            <p>To expand a bit on Bruce Hagen's reply:</p>
<p>Open Office is an Office <em>productivity suite</em>. It is similar to Microsoft Office, Corel Word Perfect Office and Libre Office. They each contain word processor, spread sheet, data base and other programs. Open Office and Libre Office are free; MS Office
 and WP Office are not.</p>
<p>They,&nbsp;each and all, do good jobs. And indeed, if not used they can all be removed without effecting the operation of Windows or any other aspect of the way the computer works.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may have something to do with the executable file that you're trying to open. To check and verify if this is really the case, and for us to get a better picture with this concern, may we know what file or program are you tying to open? Are you just
 opening an executable file or are you trying to install it to your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the information needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>With that being said, it's common that the file that you want to download needs to be saved first, and in order for you to run and install the downloaded file, you need to open the
<strong>Downloads</strong> folders tab and&nbsp; manually run the file there. If you're using
<strong>Internet Explorer&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> for downloading applications or files from the internet, press the
<strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>J </strong>key on the keyboard to view the Downloads tab. Once you have the Downloads tab opened, right-click on the executable file, then select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how this turns out for you.</p>

<p>Ok ok problem solved for me! I saw that the two files (chrome and Firefox installers) were named ChromeSetup_exe and FirefoxInstaller_exe) note the underscore (_)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just renamed the file and changed the underscore (_) to a dot (.) And that solved the problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for ChromeSetup_exe I changed it to ChromeSetup.exe and Windows now identifies and runs the program!<br />

So with those two folders in mind (although I'm guessing you'll still say they're doing nothing) my question to you why is it this is yet another rant where we don't hear a word against the developers for not patching their game?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hell I download the updates today and can't get into my main profile. It asks for a liveID and password but I could not find anywhere that I could recover these, now I have deleted my profile and kept my save games. So I guess I have to spend another 60+
 hours plating through MassEffect 1&amp;2 befrore I can play 3. I was hoping to at least import my M.E. 1 games in so I would have my commander Shepard since right now all I have is part two.

<p>why would you want xbox live sued?</p>
<p>your asking people to join your group against cheaters, very good, thats cool :), but i dont see why Xbox Live should suffer? People do get banned, if people want to buy a game then cheat, its their own loss.</p>
<p>a great example is mw3. if people buy the game, then cheat, their wasting their own money, because they'll just get tired of being top rank after a week (ignoring the fact they'll get reset anyway) thus the £40 they paid for, isnt what they got from the
 game, but its their own fault.</p>
<p>But your right, we shouldnt have to pay the same price and play with cheats, but cheaters (if caught) have to pay for service but dont get the service.</p>
<p>Just think, how many gamers there actually are on Xbox Live, billions across the globe. Millions do cheat and glitch, and only thousands maybe just hundreds work at Xbox, and only maybe a group of people actually do tha XBL bans (The XBL team). You can easily
 do the maths, its very hard to get EVERY cheater. However, this can be fixed, &nbsp;more people could work for Xbox, and in this time of age, their are plenty of people without jobs.</p>
<p>The only way you should be complaining, is the lack of people that Xbox lets people work for them to make Xbox Live better.</p>
<p>I could say, make a file complaint, (you should anyway) but you could also think "it doesnt do anything, it doesnt get seen", also too, their are millions of complaints an hour, so its a very long process.</p>

<p>Greetings, MickDoc1489. One of the best ways to proactively address cheating is to file a complaint against these users via your console. You can find directions for how to do this here:
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/26/t/19139.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../19139.aspx</a>. If you report someone the case <strong>will</strong> be reviewed by a member of the Enforcement Team.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also encourage you to scroll down to the bottom of that page and review the material related to how Enforcement works. This will provide insight into the process and should help answer any questions or concerns you may have about the process.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can understand that you are frustrated about cheating. However, we are unable to address legal concerns here. You will need to visit this page for any legal questions you may have:

<p>Thank you in advance! Please feel free to reach out to me via PM if you have any further questions.<br />
