<h2>            can we look at the following errors please concerning task bar, netwrk, start menu issues, explorer crashes, app freezes, repeat alerts on restart and more</h2>
                    <p>Hi all I have been testing now since the day the new preview was released, here are some faults I have found so far, and one work around I found by mistake.</p>
<p>1/ start menu issues, non responsive at boot up for a while, and when chnging to all apps some times the start menu must be dropped and re clicked.</p>
<p>2/ after upgrade still has win 7 start sound and sometimes boot menu starts with "continue to windows 7, you click it and it goes to win 10.</p>
<p>3/ New driver required for intel series 4 graphics, some apps freeze and quit</p>
<p>4/ Upon restart alerts such as new app installed repeats all apps installed and all other notices pop up that have already done this. Also repeats levels reached on games</p>
<p>5/ One drive deleted itself today</p>
<p>6/ items pinned to task bar disappear upon restart</p>
<p>7/ wireless network has to be reconnected every restart, even though auto connect check box is checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the work around I discovered concerns the app store, while viewing the app store page for windows 8.1 while using windows 10, when I chose to download an app my store not the beta opened up as the app and let me download to windows 10, nice trick and
 now the store is in my list off apps and performs well, better than the beta store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far windows 10 is ok, the previous preview was less buggy</p>
<p>can we sort the win 7 boot error or is it because of the upgrade</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            hi and thanks for the reply, not sure if you mis read but I did say it was an upgrade from windows 7, not a dual boot, im familiar with that having 7 8.1 and developer 10 all booting fine on another computer, the computer Im reporting the faults has no
 dual boot, whats annoying is the win 7 start up sounds, and the problem with the boot every now and then, the boot screen says continue to win 7 you click it and you boot into windows 10, boot entry only has win 10. others on this forum have had the same issues,
 this issue was not in the first preview, the other faults I have reported are quite common and I would expect that on a beta system such as win 10, I dont need comments returned such as its in its beta stage and to expect errors, Im fully aware of beta errors,
 whats annoying is when we report the faults as asked we are given half baked answers in return, and from what Im seeing not many are being solved. I have been building and repairing for over twenty years, back when computers took tapes so Im more than familiar
 with faults, what I would like to see is a resolution page with solid fixes, not recommendations to pages I have read, please look further into the errors stated and as I said I know beta systems come with a host of flaws, lets hope we dont carry these flaws
 into another win 8.1 flop. If I seem callous I appoligise but some of the answers offer no substance at all.<br />

            to add to this the boot menu actally reads win7(C:\windows): current os default os, so it has not updated the boot menu to reflect win 10 although its booting into win 10, this is an issue that needs to be sorted, as Microsoft are offering an upgarde for
 win 7 when win 10 is released, thats why I tested the upgrade choice<br />

            So what response to the rest of the errors I listed, these are common errors in just about every beta of windows, would be nice if some one has at least acknowledged the other problems and realized it wasn't a dual boot

            <p>I cannot really say that any of the issues you list are 'common', I see none of them in a clean install of the latest build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem that creating a comprehensive list of software installed in Windows 7 and what happened after upgrade may be helpful. After you have formatted the drive &gt; installed the same build via the ISO &gt; installed applications that were in the Windows
 7 installation, one by one, noting issues after each install - The comparison as a whole could be very helpful when combined with specs of the device used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reference to a dual boot would seem just to let you know about issues caused with legacy items remaining on the drive(s) after installation of the new OS. Presumably, these same issues could be present in the current iteration of the upgrade process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues exist, that is a given at this early stage. Now is the time to get these issues and the situations in which they occur, pointed out in a detailed manner. The time for fixing them comes later.</p>

            <p>The forum works well for discussing bugs, but the way to report them is via the
<em>give us </em><em>feedback</em> link in the <em>Insider Hub </em>app on the Start Menu.&nbsp; If you haven't already opened it, please try it.&nbsp; That will also tell you if the Insider Hub is one of the malfunctioning items to add to your list.&nbsp; When you give feedback,
 separate the items into individual feedbacks.&nbsp; The categories will be different and it will make triaging much easier for Microsoft.&nbsp; Of course, if the Insider Hub app fails then the forum is the best you can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend that you perform a <em>Refresh </em>from the Settings app.&nbsp; In Settings, click
<em>Update and Recovery </em>and then choose the refresh option.&nbsp; This will reinstall Windows without disturbing your files, settings, and programs (the old Repair Install option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also be able to do a Rollback by restarting and choosing Rollback on the Boot Options Menu when it appears.</p>

            <p>thanks for the reply and yes I have done all that, I note others are beginning to have the same errors as my self such as the start menu not functioning and a few others I have raised, I merely raise these issues to help make the system better, whether it
 be on the feedback app of this forum, a system refresh would defeat my purpose of why we have the error and how we can circumvent so as not to repeat. Each computer will have its own set of issues and some faults cannot be re produced on another system, overall
 the laptop win 10 is installed on is running fine, the start menu glitch doesn't re produce on my AMD machine, the laptop for its age is coping well, much cooler and quiet, some graphic greedy apps dont run but I expected that, windows 10 is a great OS even
 in the early stages, looking forward to win 10 on my phone</p>

 install as I was testing full upgrade with all programs intact. Now I have it running perfect. For a five year lap top I'm impressed. Thanks Paul

            ok I have to ask why you keep sending me links in emails regarding info I have already seen. I'm very experienced and don't need to boast about experience like I have seen in other posts. I also wont comment unless I feel the need. None of suggestions
 that were provided by you or any one else from Microsoft helped and I will not refresh or clean install on a macine being tested for upgrade. Sorry to be blunt but I calling it as I see it.

            It does sound as if you do not have Outlookk installed on your PC.&nbsp; The "sync" process between Outlook Mobile on your device has to be done with Outlook.&nbsp; So if you doo not have it, you need to get it to sync.

            You have to go to microsoft.com and download the windows mobile device center which is similar to activesync on windows xp and lower. it worked for me because i went from xp to vista and when you are also going to have to upgrade your mobile microsoft
 apps on your phone from wm5 to wm6.1 you can also download that from windows.com

<p>Hi Andrea</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure where you are looking when you said: "<em>when i tried to click office programs to sync, it wouldn't produce a check mark in the box when I clicked</em>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I do is either check the FILES box and then pick the files I want to sync or copy the files I absolutely want into the Documents folder that is created when you setup the partnership.&nbsp; For me, that&nbsp;has been the safest means for me to know I have a file
 and the latest one that has been created.&nbsp; It has become an automatic process for me to save a file then copy it to that folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some folks don't care for the extra step but I can't tell you the number of times I went to check a file and I did not have it so I follow that routine now.&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Hi Stephen,<br />
<br />
The answer is yes. You don’t need to implement on-promise Active Directory. The standalone Exchange Online Plan 2 can achieve your requirement.<br />

<h2>            My Outlook account has been taken over please help</h2>
                    <p>At the moment I can access my emails on my phone and tablet but when I try and log in to the desktop site i get a message asking if I've recently changed my security password.</p>
<p>When I click 'no it wasn't me' I get asked to put in a code which has been sent to my other hotmail account BUT I don't know the password to this account as I haven't used it in ages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried calling and emailing 'support' with no luck. When I did get one reply they sent it to the account I'm having problems with as opposed to the third party outlook address (my partner's) which they had asked me to supply therefore I was unable
 to access the reply as it required logging in to the account in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am so frustrated and don't know where to turn....I am worried my personal security is being violated and whoever has hacked the account now also has access to all my emails and addresses stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also when I did log in by saying it was me who had changed the password (it wasn't) I was obviously unable to make any changes due to logging with the old password and it stated that they new password would go 'live' from the end of this month - so if it
 doesn't get sorted before then my account is going to be compromised permanently .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note in order to even write this I have had to log in to microsoft using my partner's email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

    <title>HTTP 206 Partial Content responses and multiple Content-Length headers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bnaberhuis  say:</h3>
<h2>            HTTP 206 Partial Content responses and multiple Content-Length headers</h2>
                    <p>Apologies if this is not the relevant place to make a bug report, but I have been unable to find a more proper location to do so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When IE 11 makes a request for continued content from some resource that didn't download all the way (or was truncated for some other reason), it makes a request for the rest of the object, which is reasonable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is unreasonable is the method that bing.com's servers respond to such a request: it has 2 Content-Length headers attached to it. &nbsp;The first one holds the length of the entire object, and the second one holds the length of the data that is in the body
 that follows. &nbsp;This tends to play havoc with various proxy servers / ICAP server combinations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>RFC 7230 explicitly states that multiple Content-Length headers should cause a browser / proxy / etc. to outright reject any message that has 2 Content-Length headers (for security reasons; there are a number of exploits that use this specific ambiguity
 in RFC 2616 to deliver malware).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, IIS should never attach 2 such headers to a request; it causes wastes of bandwidth and (admittedly) some small amount of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide a packet capture if requested; however, I will not post it in a public forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the request in question and the response headers (the body is irrelevant to the discussion):</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">

            <p>I Found the reason/cause for this: &nbsp;There's a library on the page called RUM that is used for measuring network speed. This script causes the page to be navigated to this broken url.</p>
<p>You can read more about it here:&nbsp;http://support.datalicious.com/hc/en-us/articles/201251916-How-we-measure-our-tag-delivery-network-performance &nbsp;http://s2.cdnplanet.com/static/rum/rum.js</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can reproduce the error in IE11 on the desktop by using the F12 tools and choosing to simulate as a Windows Phone 8 device with IE10mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the site itself shouldn't use that rum.js script, or the rum.js script owners should fix their detection and not mess up things when detecting IE10mobile etc.</p>
<p>This script even has an explicit check for "if domain is soundcloud".</p>
<p>Workaround: none at the moment, it's not your phone, it's the website's issue. &nbsp; But you can try stop the page loading early on before that script gets a chance to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: 2014-05-28:</p>
<p>Issue is now resolved, soundcloud.com now works on Windows Phone devices,&nbsp; perhaps the provider got my email and fixed their js code.</p>

    <title>Adding a column into Design View - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t3hdaniel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding a column into Design View</h2>
                    In Design View, there are only 3 columns: Field Name, Data Type, and Description.<br />
I want to add a column between Data Type and Description named: Field Size.<br />
<br />
I am doing an assignment and it seems that this is possible.<br />
I know I can change the field size by using properties, but is it possible to have the Field Size in the Design View graph instead? So I can just type it in really fast instead of going through each Field Name and setting it through the "properties"?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>No,&nbsp; The field size is determined by the number type in the properties.&nbsp; E.g&nbsp; Integer is a field size of 2 bytes,&nbsp;Double is 8 bytes, etc.&nbsp; Only the Text (and Decimal) data type allows you to specify the number of bytes the field can use.&nbsp; Other datatypes,
 such as Memo, have no field size and are only&nbsp;limited by the max size of the database file (2 GB).</p>
<p>OTOH, you gain nothing by limiting a Text field to less than 255 bytes because the field only takes up as much space as needed (up to 255) to hold it text string.&nbsp; So you should leave Text fields at size 255, unless you have a specific&nbsp;data requirement&nbsp;from
 a business rule for a smaller limit on the number of characters (e.g. soc sec # must be&nbsp;9 characters)</p>

            Not really possible for your situation.&nbsp; There are ways to dynamically create the fields using SQL and VBA but it would be more work than it is to just enter them like they need to be done.

<p>Neither method fixes the problem.&nbsp; Method one finds no issues; method two does nothing.&nbsp; Edge is still not working.&nbsp; Thankfully, other non-MS browers still work.&nbsp; Trying to open Edge produces no error messages.&nbsp; Updates were installed on 8/29/2015.&nbsp; Should

            <div>Thanks for your email below. The exact problem is this - I’m trying to complete an online security vetting form. The company concerned have advised the following actions (in blue below) must be in place in order to access the form, including the issue
 around 32/64 bit.&nbsp;The preferences have been set as required but when I try to access the form, the message I receive is that the eform is downloading, this may take a few minutes dependent upon internet speed, etc.&nbsp; However, the form fails to download even
 after an hour. My internet speed is not fast but its not slow either. Presumably there is some sort of compatibility issue here.</div>

<p>You could visit the website and open tools-&gt;View compatibility settings and add the website to this list, it will run it in Compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Download failure could be due to several issues such as internet connection problem or connectivity problem in their servers.</p>

 there are some that convert xlsx to xls but I did not see one made my Microsoft.&nbsp; Currently using windows 8.0 and have not yet upgraded to windows 8.10.&nbsp; When I performed a google search I found and downloaded

 format.&nbsp; If you know the file is from another program which is incompatible with Microsoft Office Excel, click Cancel, then open this file in its original application.&nbsp; If you want to open the file later in Microsoft Office Excel, save it in a format that
 is compatible, such as text format.&nbsp; What free software is available from Microsoft that enables those with office 2003 to view documents made with newer versions of office?&nbsp; What non Microsoft software is preferred if there are limitations from the Microsoft

    <title>Error message when closing PowerPoint - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error message when closing PowerPoint</h2>
                    
<p>3 days ago I bought a new Lenovo L412 laptop with WIN7Pro and 2 days ago I bought the MSOffice2010 Home &amp; Business Pack on-line direct from MS.</p>
<p>Curious issue occurs with PowerPoint when I close it, click on the X in top right corner.</p>
<p>I get a message box appear with "Microsoft PowerPoint Has Stopped Working. Windows is checking for a solution to the problem"</p>
<p>Sometimes this box changes to "Restarting MS PowerPoint", where it restarts the program, and sometimes the the error box goes away without telling me anything about any problem it has or has not found.</p>
<p>One way or another I get this 'error' every time.</p>
<p>I'm appalled to have such a problem, albeit minor, on a fresh brand new installation.</p>
<p>Any help please???</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these steps- test after each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Shut down the computer, modem and router for a few minutes then restart all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Internet Options&gt; Browsing History&gt; Delete&gt; (next screen) uncheck "Preserve Favorites website data." then delete the History, Temporary Internet Files and Cookies. Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. From Start&gt; All programs. Accessories, right-click Command Prompt and choose "Run as administrator". At the flashing cursor type in &nbsp;<em>ipconfig /flushdns
</em>&nbsp;(note the space between config and / ) hit [Enter] then Restart.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as passwords and you will have to reinstall or re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings button (Internet Options&gt; Advanced.)</div>
<div>What a reset of IE settings will do:<br />

    <title>Is this Windows 10 Technical Preview issue or nVIDIA driver issue&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amgedismail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is this Windows 10 Technical Preview issue or nVIDIA driver issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Well, back to Windows 10 Technical Preview for Enterprise.<br />
<br />
When I install both the Intel HD Graphics and the nVIDIA GeForce GT 630M either versions "331.65" or "344.11" and now when I run pcsx2 even with the "Default Hardware Device" or "Intel HD Graphics 4000", the FPS drops as if I ran pcsx2 on nVIDIA mode with Windows
 8.1<br />
<br />
In Windows 10, if I uninstalled the nVIDIA driver or disabled it from Device Manager then restart Windows and left the Intel HD Graphics 4000 alone. Now when I run pcsx2 on "Default Hardware Device" I don't get FPS drop and runs very fine.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.pcsx2.net%2fimages%2fDarkTheme%2fsmilies%2fsmile.gif" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed it causes the screen to dim the display when I exit pcsx2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the nVIDIA driver causes the pcsx2 to drop FPS even when on "Intel HD Graphics 4000" mode EVEN if the nVIDIA driver is just installed (not even running pcsx2)<br />
<br />
In Windows 8.1 the FPS drop issue was only when you run pcsx2 with nVIDIA doesn't matter if it's installed.<br />
<br />
So what do you call this issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>So may this be a Windows issue that Windows by default allows all installed programs to run with the nVIDIA processor even if I don't see that program in the nVIDIA Control Panel? Or is this a nVIDIA issue and the driver needs to be updated to support Windows
 10 Technical Preview?</p>

            <p>I think at this stage it is most probably a bit of both Windows &amp; NVidia, NVidia are normally quiet good at upgrading their drivers, in this case I would give them a bit more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS did advise us there may be some initial glitches, in your case this may be one of then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this stage I have not attempted to use NVidia direct updates, rather sticking to upgrade via Windows Update, I normally prefer to use NVidia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded a laptop with HD &amp; NVidia graphics and have not noticed any problems,

<h2>            Excel Automatic Highlight with Manual Override</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I am working on a shared worksheet at work, and am trying to simplify one of our processes. I am manually checking items on our internal programs and updating items on this sheet. When I make these updates, I manually highlight the values for others
 to see the changes I made. However, when someone addresses the changes made, they manually remove the highlight so that they can focus on the other changes. I was looking for a way to have Excel automatically highlight the cells once I enter data into them
 (I tried using conditional formatting and the formula =not(isblank(A1)) as shown below). But, I also want to the sheet to allow another user to manually remove the fill without removing the conditional formatting on that cell. Can someone help me with this?</p>

<h2>            Not a valid license key</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been using Office 2010 Professional Plus x64 for a while on my laptop, basically as soon as the bits became available on Technet Plus downloads.</p>
<p>I've installed it at the time and activated it just fine with a key from Technet Plus. Now a month later I get a message that my copy of Office 2010 is not activated. When I tried to use the key from my Technet Plus subscription it says it's not a valid
 license key. I even requested a new license key but it keeps saying "an invalid license key". The only other error message is see is "0x8007232B"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I copy/paste the key from the technet plus subscription website so I am sure it's typed correctly..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 for Mac incredibly glitchy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kiril b.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 for Mac incredibly glitchy</h2>
                    <p><strong>It's been about a year since Excel 2016 for Mac was officially released and yet some of the problems that were present in it since the days it was still in Beta have not been resolved.</strong> I wonder whether Microsoft is really interested in fixing
 their bugs or they simply do not care for their customers anymore, especially those not using Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the screenshot below you can see a <em>Solver</em> <em>glitch</em>, where the drop-down menu appears displaced. Alongside this, it is also possible to discern
<strong>2 other "classic" issues</strong> which I (and judging by the forums, also other users) have submitted feedback about:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>the floating tooltip</strong>, which stays on screen persistently, even the window is minimized and maximized again (this is also a huge problem in Word, though that is a subject for another discussion);</li><li><strong>the horizontal scroll bar</strong>, which also appears to stay on screen longer than it should, sometimes not disappearing automatically at all, even though no actual scrolling is done.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec70d1a2-17e4-49be-bfc9-cecdd69c03ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec70d1a2-17e4-49be-bfc9-cecdd69c03ff" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice how there is some sort of a field at the bottom of the Solver window, that crosses over the buttons "Close" and "Solve" too. Does it serve any particular purpose or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking of Solver, below you can see a screen shot that illustrates how <strong>
<em>not all</em> parts of the program are optimized for Retina displays</strong>, even though Microsoft's marketing claims suggest otherwise (please take a look at the drop-down menu for signs):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12710f2c-dd9f-4a66-a821-628d420ff10a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12710f2c-dd9f-4a66-a821-628d420ff10a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, <strong>for those who may think this is only about Solver: it isn't. </strong>
There are also other times in Excel (and in Word and PowerPoint, too) when some small items appear pixelated because they have not been optimized (my
<em>guess</em> is they either forgot to do it or they thought they shouldn't waste time on it because people wouldn't use these features as often).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I still think this is <em>pretty indicative of the approach they have to the quality of their products</em>. Attention to small details is important for the overall satisfaction (in my humble opinion) because when a lot of small glitches, bugs
 and minor details are added together, it becomes obvious that they don't really care about the product (and thus, about its users).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another glitch which I have experienced with Excel is when <strong>typing longer formulas in the formula bar</strong>. Then the cursor displayed on screen does not reflect the actual position of the cursor. For example, pressing "backspace" does not delete
 the character directly behind the cursor, but instead it deletes the character before that one. I have produced a small video demonstrating this bug, which is available
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DuVUHyoiw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/95DuVUHyoiw?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/95DuVUHyoiw?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p><br />
In such occasions, there is also a space character at the end of the problematic formula that cannot be deleted (it's also not inserted by the user, it's
<em>just</em> there - I suppose it's a bug).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same goes with typing, as you can probably see there is a disparity between where the cursor suggests the typing would occur and where it actually occurs; in summary, the cursor is imprecise and such a basic thing not working properly is not anywhere near
 acceptable in 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar behavior in the formula bar is exhibited when simply selecting (parts of the) text that has been entered within a certain cell - a part of the text appears duplicated in the formula bar for some reason (see
<a href="https://youtu.be/807un34aHGk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/807un34aHGk?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/807un34aHGk?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I would like to say that<strong> I have used Excel and Microsoft Office products in general for many years</strong> under Windows and in spite of the occasional frustration (which is an innate characteristic of these products), my experience has
 been very good. However, <em>all</em> of their applications for Mac are <em>inferior</em> to the Windows counterparts, not only when the number of missing features is taken into account, but also when it comes to bugs and minor issues such as those disclosed
 by me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like for Microsoft Mac users are an afterthought, despite the fact that they are being charged the same for their subscriptions. It's either that or Microsoft is deliberately making their software for the Mac mediocre.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>P.S. </strong>I know I am going to get a reply asking "Did you send them feedback?". My answer is "Yes". Whenever I have to use anything more advanced in Word/Excel 2016, I always experience technical issues (unfortunately) and in such periods I
 send feedback a couple of times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>P.S. 2.</strong> I have had most of these problems occurring both in Yosemite and El Capitan, so I don't think these are issues that can be traced back to the OS X version. In addition, I keep my software up-to-date and I have the most recent version
 of the Office applications installed. I have also made clean reinstalls of both Office and OS X (albeit for different purposes), however, the issues still persist.</p>

            <p>Hi Kiril,</p>
<p>First, I want to thank you for taking the time to put together this detailed list - we unfortunately don't have time to respond to every thread or issue report, but we do make an effort to read everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the specific issues you've mentioned above...</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Solver floating tooltip </strong>- This persists for me if I reposition Solver when I have the dropdown expanded. &nbsp;Once it's stuck, it does show over any other OS window which is quite annoying. However, I was able to make it disappear by either
 1) clicking the dropdown again or 2) closing the Solver window. &nbsp;We'll look in to the root cause of this, but I had actually not seen this until just now&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Horizontal scroll bar</strong> - Can you tell me what your current OS preference is under
<strong>General &gt; Show scroll bars</strong>? I did a quick test of each of the three settings and Excel seems to be respecting them all correctly. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Solver cosmetic issues</strong> - If you've spent any time with VBA UserForms in Office for Mac, you might recognize the less-than-gorgeous controls in Solver. Solver doesn't look like the rest of the dialogs in Office 2016 for Mac because it is
 actually a custom VBA UserForm, and not a standard OS X dialog. This means that most of the inconsistencies that you're seeing in the Solver UI are a side-effect of the underlying Visual Basic code (which for the most part needs to stay consistent across versions
 of Office). That isn't meant to be an excuse for the design, but hopefully the context makes more sense. I'm also not seeing the white outline from your screenshots in our latest version (15.22). As for any other non-Retina assets you find in the product,
 please report them through the in-app feedback - these fixes are a priority to us and the changes are usually as simple as upconverting the existing icon and swapping them in.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Cursor alignment in long formulas </strong>- This one bothers me, and my only justification for why it hasn't been fixed is simply that we've been working on higher priority issues. Apologies. We also shouldn't be adding trailing spaces to formulas,
 since that would be changing your data and we're committed to the integrity of your documents. &nbsp;It's possible that there
<em>visually </em>seems to be a trailing space, but we've included the TRIM function for almost a decade because we know how painful debugging whitespace can be :)</li><li><strong>Duplicate text in the formula bar</strong> - Another strange bug that I haven't seen until now. &nbsp;My gut instinct says that this is related to issue 4 above, but is also very confusing. &nbsp;Thanks for bringing it up, and we'll make sure it's investigated
 with the other formula bar strangeness.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, with respect to your comments about being both a Mac and a Windows user - we hear you loud and clear. &nbsp;I've said this before in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2016-macexcel/a-list-of-excel-2016-issues-on-a-mac/1dbe0597-7ea1-4125-9abb-ded3bb9eb22e?page=1" title="A list of excel 2016 issues on a mac">
another thread</a>, but I want to assure you that Microsoft is definitely <strong>
not </strong>deprioritizing any of its OS X software. &nbsp;We do face some challenges developing for the Mac, but these are typically cases where we can get some preferential treatment from our friends on the Windows team, and not places where Apple is forcing
 us to compromise. We are the Excel team, full stop. We love this software as much as you do, and want your experience to be world-class, no matter whether you're on a Windows phone, Android tablet, or a 5k iMac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for taking the time - we really do appreciate posts as thorough as yours. And if you're interested in seeing what we're working on, or giving suggestions for what we should work on next, drop us a line at the

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, thank you for taking the time to reply to this discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In relation to your comments:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Horizontal scroll bar issue:</strong> I have had this since the moment I first installed Office 2016 and I have had it both under OS 10.10 and 10.11. I have tried switching the system-wide preference for scroll bars back and forth between "automatic"
 and "show scroll bars only when scrolling", but nothing really helps. Curiously, it is an issue only as far as the horizontal scroll bar is concerned, whereas the vertical one behaves as one would expect. Of course, I can try to disable scroll bars altogether,
 but that is not a good solution as I need to use them in other applications. Furthermore, it is a problem I have
<em>only</em> experienced with Excel 2016 (never had such trouble with Excel 2011 or any other piece of software). As far as I know, the code for Office 2016&nbsp;has been rewritten and that could be causing some of these issues which were previously non-existent,
 but come on, it's practically a newer version of the product so if it cannot be better than the older one (which it is in some aspects), it should at least not be worse than it.</li></ul>
<p>Here's a short video illustrating the&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/FGUQIcexyac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">issue.</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/FGUQIcexyac?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/FGUQIcexyac?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Solver-related issues</strong>: I understand that Solver is a "special case", so to speak, so I'm willing to accept some minor defects such as the non-Retina icon, however, the drop-down menu being displaced really bothers me. The newest version
 of Excel (15.22) which I installed two days ago has somewhat improved on that... by making it extremely hard to move the Solver window in general.</li></ul>
<p>In addition, I have encountered one more <strong>major</strong> <strong>inconvenience</strong> which applies to working with spreadsheets with a zoom level above 100% (on Retina displays it's almost impossible not to increase the zoom level, so in my humble
 opinion this is quite a problem in itself). To be more precise, <strong>when typing formulas in a cell, the cell visually expands and covers its adjacent cells</strong>. Instead of just expanding to the right, it expands in all 4 directions, which makes it
 impossible to reference any of these cells in the formula except for by typing manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c7d19ac0-be90-4539-b3e2-43a2ea6a78ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc7d19ac0-be90-4539-b3e2-43a2ea6a78ec" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see (if you can see it at all, because it's almost impossible to identify), in the screenshot above I was typing a formula in cell B119 and this is what happened (it happens almost always): a large number of the nearby cells were covered so I
 couldn't include them in my formula by clicking. In fact, because it covered too much I couldn't even include them by typing manually because it was no longer possible to discern what kind of information was contained in these cells. This is the
<em>exact opposite</em> of being productive, which I though Excel was designed for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a short video that shows how a cell immediately expands to cover the cell on top right after I double-click to edit it (also, notice how the issue disappears after adjusting the zoom level using the status bar as opposed to the trackpad) (speaking
 of which, why does the window appear at such random positions? This makes no sense - it should always appear in the lower right
<a href="https://youtu.be/bIrNJwSkl5c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">corner).</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/bIrNJwSkl5c?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/bIrNJwSkl5c?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, the font size in certain occasions appears larger than the actual formatting setting (only during typing), which effectively means that even more adjacent cells are covered and cannot be referenced via a click (I will provide a screenshot as soon
 as the issue reoccurs). <strong><em>Update (May 21):</em></strong> here's a short video where I demonstrate how the font size changes (although not with a really long formula). Notice how it's enough to start typing a formula and scroll a bit and suddenly
 the text in the cell gets <a href="https://youtu.be/OeFfRt0n2qk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
bigger</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/OeFfRt0n2qk?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/OeFfRt0n2qk?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>I wonder whether formulas could be truncated in the actual cell so that only the most recently typed characters could be visible...</strong> like it happens in the formula bar when working with longer formulas instead of having the cell expanding?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely hope that these issues are going to be addressed soon (I have almost lost hope). I understand you have your own limitations and you have to prioritize, but I really can't comprehend how something as fundamental as e.g. the cursor being displaced
 in the formula bar has not been resolved in such a long period of time.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure Microsoft will be happy with me suggesting this, but you might consider joining the "Fast" insider program. You'll get beta builds so you can see what will be coming out in updates before they are released, and you will be able to send feedback
 directly to the developers at Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To join the program, launch AutoUpdate (go to the Excel Help menu and choose Check for Updates). Choose these settings:</p>

            <p>Hi Jim, thanks for your suggestion, I have considered this as a possibility despite its associated risks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, seeing how <em>even</em> their release versions are full of random issues and bugs (and have been for months
<em>(mostly)</em> without being fixed), I'm afraid I'll refrain from installing even more unstable software on my computer.</p>

            <p>And here's even more - the random glitches and issues seem to be multiplying with each passing day as I have to use Excel for more and more extensive periods of time (oh, the horror!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new addition shows how <strong>when typing a formula in a completely random cell</strong> (with no formatting settings adjusted by myself)
<strong>results in duplicate entries in the formula bar</strong>. The consequences? Except for being
<em>super&nbsp;</em>annoying, it also <em>prevents</em> me from completing the formula. This is because one key stroke for some reason resulted in two entries of the same character in the
<a href="https://youtu.be/-XqxoHyFj60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">formula bar</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/-XqxoHyFj60?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/-XqxoHyFj60?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is even more interesting in this case is that when marking the text in the bar with the duplicates, it is possible to select just one of two consecutive characters, but when backspace is pressed both of them get deleted. This happens while at the same
 time Excel doesn't want to accept my entry of the formula (not displayed in the video above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I wonder: does Excel treat these as one or two entries? It's confusing and inconsistent in its behaviour. This applies to most of the other issues as well; in general, they appear at random intervals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, this is just ridiculous. Excel 2011 did <em>not</em> have such problems. None of the issues I mentioned here existed in 2011. If it was just better optimised for Retina displays I'd probably still be using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope this is some kind of a bad joke - as I mentioned, it's been about a year now so by now such things should have been ironed out... My patience is growing thin at this point.</p>

            <p>Things are going to be changing all over the place in Office for Mac in the next few rounds of updates. They've already announced a complete break from 32-bit to 64-bit Office. That's a biggie. I know they're working on pivottables and charts because people
 are seeing new functionality in this area and asking about it. I've seen hints of other big changes coming, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Excel is flaky anyway, why not enjoy more flakiness but be rewarded with the chance to get something done about the flakiness?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wait till the official release of updates you're putting yourself a month or two behind the beta builds. When you find a glitch and report it, you have to wait for a cycle or two for the fix to be made and then wait another month or two for the fix
 to show up in the general release. And maybe it won't be fixed right and you need to report something new about that same feature. You're looking at a four to six month turnaround time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you join the Fast program you'll get builds that are just one or two away from the actual code they are working on right at the moment. You can submit feedback right away. The turnaround time could be as little as two to four weeks. Plus, with the fast
 turnaround time you're not expecting the person who did the coding at Microsoft to remember what they did months ago. You'll be in the loop with the coders as they work. The chances of them getting things right goes up a lot when there is a current dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds to me that you really do want Excel to work right. I certainly do. There really isn't a good substitute short of switching to Windows Excel. If you join in you'll be helping not just yourself, but all of us other users who also experience the issues
 you've discovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been doing it for years. You'd be surprised how influential good reports can be and how eager the folks at Microsoft are to make their Mac product really good. And when you get something fixed or a new feature you want implemented, you'll know that
 you helped lots of other people, and that's a good feeling.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The kinds of problems you have shared with us here in the forum are exactly the sort of thing Microsoft addresses in the Fast program. I hope I can convince you to contribute. I am positive your feedback will be valued.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><strong>Thanks for your clarification,</strong> I suppose joining the Insider program has its benefits, however, I am still not willing to do that. And as much as I hate to say it, I disagree with some of the arguments you put forward in their defence. Here's
 why:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You say: <em>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Things are going to be changing all over the place in Office for Mac in the next few rounds of updates.</span>"</em></strong> What if I told you that I couldn't care less about this
 (and even less for the transition from 32 bit to 64 bit)? I want working software
<em>now</em>. I despise the word "updates" (this also applies to Apple) and the way it is now used to justify deficiencies in quality and/or functionality of a release&nbsp;product (I suppose that is one of the "perks" that comes with the Office 365 subscription).
 I don't <em>want</em> and I don't&nbsp;<em>need</em> any new functionality (not in Excel at least), I just want it to be able to do whatever it's supposed to be able to do currently without a plethora of random glitches occurring when doing the most simple and
 fundamental tasks imaginable. I want it to do what it <em>was</em> able to do effortlessly in its 2011 edition. For Christ's sake, you can't even clear unpinned documents in the start-up window now. I don't see how removing functions such as this one is a
 step forwards. It's been on forums and on User Voice for quite a while now and still no development in this relation...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In addition, I have neither the time nor the patience to use beta software and to file bug reports
</strong>(except for bugs that exist in release software that I need to use frequently such as the ones I make posts about here). If I did, I wouldn't be using MS Office, I would be using LibreOffice or something, where at least such state of affairs would
 be tolerable given the way it is developed and distributed (free of charge). Not to mention that your suggestion "it's already bad, so why not try to do something that could make it even worse" is just hilarious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, <strong>I frequently send feedback when I encounter issues</strong> and I only post here when my patience grows really thin and when I get sick of reporting something 100 times without it being fixed in subsequent updates. I have even provided
 them with some sensitive information such as screenshots of the contents of documents containing rather confidential things (not in these forums) just so I can exemplify the issue. Yet I see no value in giving feedback anymore so I'm just left with ranting
 on forums (until I get censored, of course, I'm sure that'll be coming soon).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last but not least, <strong>I find it amusing how you maintain that they actually listen to people's feedback</strong>. My experience from the last 10 months suggests that they very rarely do so. In fact, the same applies to their customer "support". I had
 tremendous issues with Word 2016, for which I <em>wasted</em> 5 hours of my time chatting with their support while they tried to establish a remote desktop connection to solve the issues (which were apparently due to faults in the code and not to my configuration
 and settings as I had done a number of reinstalls). This failed 10 times but they still insisted on trying it again and again every time I was transferred to another support agent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I posted about it <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2016-macword/word-2016-for-mac-giving-me-terrible-headaches/0be97c7c-febe-4b98-84ae-ea17d3820665">
here</a> and I was promised to get some support via a private message. I answered the private message which I got and I never heard back from them. What is more, as I said, I frequently send feedback (mostly negative, but it's hardly my fault that their product
 is so terrible) and <strong>I have as of yet not been contacted </strong>(not <em>
even</em> once)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for additional details or for providing problematic files or anything, even though I almost always provide my email address. And I don't even mean this happens only with Excel. The same applies to ALL of their Mac applications.&nbsp;<strong>So,
 what is the use of sending feedback again?</strong> They DO NOT care!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even James wrote that they were aware of e.g. the issue with the cursor alignment in longer formulas and that it hadn't been fixed because "they had been working on higher priority issues". All of this is a huge letdown and a classic example of Microsoft's
 monopolistic attitude of "it doesn't work well but it doesn't matter since we have no real competition so these peasants will just have to deal with it".</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>And here's one more to add to the list, since updating to the latest version I've been experiencing
<strong>flickering in the list of recently opened documents</strong> (only applies to Excel). The video below demonstrates
<a href="https://youtu.be/BQq7f7BJ1-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the issue.</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/BQq7f7BJ1-I?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/BQq7f7BJ1-I?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The real problem here is that clicking on one document would sometimes result in opening a different one that normally appears at a different position in this list; however, due to the flickering, unless I wait long enough for the reloading process to finish,
 I always end up opening something different than intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I wonder, is this a bug or is this also one of the "exciting" features of Excel?</strong></p>

<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The critical step missing in the MS KB article referenced by &lt;John Fue&gt; is clicking on the &lt;Map Custom Fields&gt; button when the option presents itself during the export process. Doing this ensures that the fields you want to export have been selected otherwise
 it will use whatever field map was selected the last time the export function was run.</p>

                    In Word 2003 when I would type an email address it would automatically format it as a hyperlink.&nbsp; Now, with Word 2007, it doesn't.&nbsp; Can I get it to do that?

<p>Hi Arjun,<br />
<br />
Here are the steps to verify a domain:<br />
1. Sign into Office 365 admin portal with your work or school account.<br />
2. Click <strong>DOMAINS</strong> &gt; <strong>Add a domain</strong>, then type in your domain name and click Next.<br />
3. Then, you will see a TXT record. Add the TXT record to your domain hosting provider and save it. If the domain host provider doesn't support TXT records, click
<strong>Use an MX record instead</strong>, and add the MX record to the domain hosting provider and save it.<br />
4. Click <strong>Okay, I've added the record</strong>, then Office 365 will verify the domain.
<br />
5. When Office 365 finds the correct TXT or MX record, the domain is verified.<br />
<br />
Here is an article for your reference:<br />

<br />
To further investigate the issue, please provide some screenshots about the steps you performed to verify the domain.<br />
<br />
To help you check the DNS records, I need your tenant information and custom domain. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please go to Your details -&gt; Private messages on the right side of the community site and reply
