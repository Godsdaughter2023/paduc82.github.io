<p>Ihave the HTC touch Pro II on Sprint,&nbsp; I was having the problem in which the program took a long time to sync, then it would display the error, what I did was, removed the program by using the built in program removal tool(settings/system/remove programs),
 went to the My phone site downloaded the program and reinstalled it, hit reset icon, and it did work properly.&nbsp; Something that might help is to reset the device BEFORE trying to sync.&nbsp; The first thing I did was to reinstall without removing the program first
 and it did not work.</p>
<p>In short, remove program manually, download program, install, reboot when asked to do so, and use program as intended.&nbsp; Hope it works for everyone, worked for me.</p>

    <title>Excel Password Protection Flawed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> growthmosaic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Password Protection Flawed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am flabbergasted as I realized users were simply taking Excel files with password protection on both worksheets and workbook structure, uploading them to Google Sheets to automatically remove the Excel password protection, and re-downloading to Excel format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't this a fundamental flaw in how Excel has implemented password protection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is so easy to break, a novice user can break it unknowingly. Why have password protection options at all if it is so easy to bypass?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there are nonchalant WikiHow pages on how to bypass the password protection:&nbsp;https://www.wikihow.com/Unprotect-an-Excel-Sheet#Using-Google-Sheets</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft going to implement better security protection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the interim, are there any real options to protect spreadsheet data and structure? Or should I permanently switch to Google Sheets which does allow for more granular and enforceable permissions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

<p>Hi Wayne,<br />
<br />
I've tried replicating your concern here on our end and it seems that you're correct wherein I can easily bypass a password protected file when using Google Sheets. But when we try it on Excel it shows that the sheet is protected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a83c548-d3b1-4edd-a121-501bb4602ed6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a83c548-d3b1-4edd-a121-501bb4602ed6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this, your concern about better security protection in Excel file is now under investigation and we are coordinating with our Internal support team to get this addressed as soon as possible. We’ll let you know once we reach a resolution. Please
 standby.<br />
<br />
To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>

<h2>            Unable to reinstall Office 2013 after &#34;refreshing&#34; PC</h2>
                    I recently "refreshed" my pc. When I tried to reload Office 2013, I was unable to do so this time. I called MS about the problem and was told that some files could not get pass MS firewall. MS would fix it for $149.00. All the so-called updates did not
 help.

 blank partition and then proceed.<br />

<h2>            Geek Base LLC Scareware Scam</h2>
                    <p>Last Friday I received an e-mail message saying that my computer was in danger of being compromised.&nbsp; It stated that it came from a Microsoft authorized business and gave a telephone number where to call.&nbsp; I called the number given and talked to a woman
 who called herself by the name of Veronica.&nbsp; She told me that she could fix my computer and proceeded to do so.&nbsp; In the process, she found over 2300 items that were wrong.&nbsp; Later on, she said that her company&nbsp;could not only fix my computer, but would keep
 it safe of viruses for life for $350.00.&nbsp; That being the case and supposedly being a&nbsp;representative of Microsoft, I agreed to paying that amount.&nbsp; After I gave all my personal data and my MasterCard Credit Card Number to Veronica, a man who said was from Australia&nbsp;joined&nbsp;our
 conversation to say that the transaction had been declined by my credit card company.&nbsp; After I learned that the man was from Australia and that said transaction had been declined, I told him and Veronica to put everything temporarily on hold until I could&nbsp;do
 some checking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I read in my local newspaper that there is a possible COMPUTER SCAM&nbsp;going around&nbsp;that sounds similar to what happened to me as describe above.&nbsp; According to the article,&nbsp;"A look on line found many individuals complaining about being charged hundreds
 of dollars by GEEK BASE LLC".&nbsp; Given these circumstances, I would like to know ASAP if such a SCAM is in fact legitimate and if GEEK BASE LLC is a trustworthy business&nbsp;that Microsoft has authorized to perform the above&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please know that I will be most grateful and appreciative for your prompt reply to this inquiry.&nbsp; Until then, thanks and God bless!!!</p>
<p>

<p>Unfortunately, neither Microsoft nor our security software can protect us from ourselves. All we can do is pick up the pieces and learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good thing that your payment did not get through, but you should contact your bank ASAP and notify them of this fraud attempted against you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is further advised to <strong>never provide remote access</strong><strong>, your credit card, or financial information to anyone who claims to be from any 'un-verified' tech-support.</strong> If you did, call the credit card company to reverse the charge,
 cancel it and get a new one issued to you, and change the passwords on your computer and your online accounts, preferably from a different, known-safe computer.
<br />
<br />
The FTC has prepared very useful information about the tech-support and refund scam at:
<a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0346-tech-support-scams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0346-tech-support-scams</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there is no telling what the scammer has installed on your PC without your knowledge, and how badly it might be compromised, you would now need to notify your bank and anyone who you've had dealings with over the Internet, shut down your PC, and do
 a&nbsp;clean install of your Operating System. This might be the only way you will know that you are free of them.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            It's definitely a scam. Have you told your card issuer about this? Microsoft will never ask for any kind of payment through phone call. There have been so many similar cases filed online, actually. I can even find people reporting about them almost everyday
 at some complaint boards like&nbsp;&lt;link removed&gt;&nbsp;It's better if you report this matter to your card issuer and check if there's any suspicious transaction. Also report to FTC at http://ftc.gov.

            I'm unable to follow your description well enough to tell which of your computers you're saying is slow booting, but if it's the one with norton, that is in line with the experiences I've read about, going from that to worse. If you decide to rid yourself
 of it, they have a special uninstaller tool on their website that will cleanly uninstall it.<br />

<p>I have a little difficulty in identifying your fleet as to what is running on each PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a fleet of W10 notebooks with more basic specs than yours, most have 4GB of RAM and hard drives in the 500GB range.&nbsp; Most of my fleet runs Norton with a couple with Windows Defender.&nbsp; I have 2 PCs at 14342.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is a safe bet to say that the Insider build loads significantly faster than public release.&nbsp; I default to Hibernate all the time.&nbsp; On the Insiders builds, on a Re-start, I often have to check to see if it is not just coming from Hibernate.&nbsp; I
 lay no blame on Norton at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My bet is that Insiders have gone to a better shutdown, perhaps some sort of Hybrid shutdown like Lenovo.&nbsp; I like the Insider shutdown and restart.</p>

            <p>Perhaps I should rephrase my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Sony is indeed an SVS1512Z9EB, fitted with 2 HDD's, with the second drive mounted in the DVD slot. The public release is installed on the main drive, which boots in 15 seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Insider is installed on the second drive, with slow boot time. Both systems were installed from the original Sony system, being Windows 8, the upgraded to 8.1 and then 10. The system on the second drive was then converted to Insiders a while ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until this build, boot times for both were almost identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the PC is another story, which I didn't really elaborate. It is also a dual boot system, with each on its own drive. The Insiders has nothing installed, apart from Steam, with a few games. Boot time for this has also slowed to a crawl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shutdown is also very slow on the current build, much slower than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this explains it a little better</p>

<p>Interesting.&nbsp; I am not seeing the issue on my single boot fleet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, at times, see a PC bog down.&nbsp; I usually go to Task Manager to see what is drawing the resources.&nbsp; Perhaps your PC has a temp load and will settle down.&nbsp; Hopefully some dual booters can give you better advice.</p>

            <p>The next notebook is an old Asus Pro52L, fitted with a 250GB SSD. This is a single boot, where it gets to the log-in screen in a mere 17 seconds, but then takes another 25 seconds to the desktop. Still, pretty fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have noticed that most of the time is after is spent to get to the desktop after log-in - on all Insider builds. It's the other way around with the public builds. Once at the log-in screen, it's only a few seconds to the desktop</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This notification comes when you have been disconnecting internet for a long time or your subscription is not kept current.
</p>
<p>Office tries to check the activation from your client timely. All you have to do is make sure you purchase enough licenses, keep your Office 365 subscription current, and make sure your users can connect to Office Licensing Service via the Internet at least
 once every 30 days. To activate Office, you need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to the internet. Or your data can’t be sent to the server which means the activation will fail to complete.</li><li>Sign in with the correct account and password. To check if you are using the correct one, you can log on Office 365 portal (portal.office.com) to see if you can access with this account successfully.
</li><li>Check if you keep the Office 365 subscription current. You can go to your account subscription page to see if you have “the latest desktop version of Office” license.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview 9926&#58;  Windows update no more possible behind proxy</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 Technical Preview 9926: Windows update is no more possible behind a proxy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Build 9926 there is no more the possiblity to check:&nbsp; "Check for updates fom Microsoft update instead of from your system admin"
</p>
<p>that workes still fine for updates behind the proxy with Windows 10 Technical Preview build 9841.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found no possibility to make it work, but found many people with exactly the same problem.</p>

            <p>I had Windows 8.1 Enterprise Traditional Chinese. Our corporate network requires to go through the proxy without authentication. It can Windows Update normally.</p>
<p>I used Windows Update to upgrade 8.1 to 9926. Then Windows Update stop working. It can shows updates list, but fail to download, with error 80072ee2.</p>
<p>According to Process Explorer's Properties\TCP/IP, wuauserv and bits services never touch proxy while downloading.</p>
<p>I had try every methods I found, including netsh winhttp import proxy source=ie, gpedit's Windows Update and Network Isolation settings, Windows Update Troubleshooter, reset SoftwareDistribution, dsim restoreHealth, sfc scannow... with wuauserv/bits services
 restart, with no luck.</p>
<p>Actually at first it can download only 2 updates, but I had reset SoftwareDistributioni, so can't figure out them. Later it can download another 2 updates, they are Office KB2956151 and Word KB2956163.</p>
<p>While it shows Windows Defender's definition update, it can't download, but Windows Defender's update function can.</p>
<p>I see "Windows 10 Technical Preview Update KB3040021: February 18, 2015" "fixes an issue with installing future builds", but it doesn't provide a download link. Currently 10041 doesn't provide Traditional Chinese, so I can't check whether it can upgrade
 to future builds or not. I am afraid that I will stuck on 9926, never get future builds.</p>

<h2>            Highlighting emails only to me in blue</h2>
                    I've been following an article I saw online about best practice in Outlook 2010. I want to highlight emails where I am the only person in the 'to' line in blue. Quite easy, in fact. However, it appears that I am still not able to see the important stuff
 this way as I am apparently on distribution lists and somehow they are able to put only my name in the 'to' line and not all the other people. It therefore looks as though it is a personal email whereas in fact it has obviously been sent to a group.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it possible to get around this so these sorts of emails aren't highlighted?</div>

            It really depends on the message. I'm assuming it's bulk mail, such as sent out by advertisers, charities, etc, where it is addressed to you and only to you. If it's something else, you need some way of identifying it as not important even though it is
 addresses only to you.

            you may be able to download it using the Download! application in your phone, if you cannot find it in there, then you need to take your phone to your nearest Nokia Care Centre, who are usually the guys who know how to install extra language packs on your
 phone.<br />

<p>It's never been possible to install language packs for the phone using the Download! application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason the phone has lost it's language after an update is because you have been sold a model that was designed for sale in another country.&nbsp; The retailer must have modified it to include the Greek language before selling it to you.&nbsp; They should have
 made you aware of this because when a phone is updated it always reverts back to it's correct language set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact the retailer or visit a nokia care point for assistance.&nbsp; There may be a small charge for this service.</p>

            Well, it seems that your phone shouldn't have had Greek on it in the first place. Nokia can't anticipate unofficial changes to the phone's settings. I do sympathise, though, it's hard to wait for a phone to come out properly localised for your region when
 other countries have had it for months. And honestly it wouldn't be all that hard for Nokia to write the OS in such a way that you can install your own languages, they're world-friendly quad-band devices for crying out loud.

<p>As has already been said, it is most likely that your phone did not have Greek language when it left the factory. Most likely, it was added in the retail chain in order to a non-Greek phone to a Greek market; this often happens when retail groups move stock
 around the world to meet demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not a fault of Nokia, Nokia factory-fits a set of languages relevant to the countries/regions where the phone is built for use, there have never been patches from Nokia to add languages - it can only be done using the software that Nokia service points
 have. We are sorry for the inconvenience that this causes to you, but there is no alternative that this community can offer you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I checked my mail this morning and had no mail in by Google Accounts or Outlook Account. Have checked my phone and online with the Web Sites and all the mail is there. It is just showing up on Windows 10 Mail App under Build 10525. In fact say "Last Update

            I guess they fixed the problems with Mail with the latest Build, 10532. I don't have the problems now that were in Build 10525.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I have 16GB SD card in Lenovo Yoga 2 tablet on Windows 10. The card seems working but actually it doesn't.</p>
<p>- Card is recognized as drive D: and for couple of weeks it worked normally</p>
<p>- Suddenly any application like Camera&nbsp; saved a file&nbsp;(e.g. photo) but in fact&nbsp;there was just a zero-size file. Copying files to the card worked OK.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; CHKDSK /F helped that time</p>
<p>- now the same problem&nbsp;is here&nbsp;again and CHKDSK didn't find anyting suspicious.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Communication troubles</h2>
                    So to be specific my problems are mainly in minecraft(yea its cringy) and it seems like there is no fix for it. The problem I’m facing is that I can’t see other people’s chat and they can’t see mine. This problem first happened to me on the first account
 I made, but that time I just made another since I didn’t do anything on it, but it just happened again. Right now it’s been about two months since it started and I still have it. I do play on pocket edition for now, because my previous console broke. Anyway
 I’ve been looking for a way to fix this, and although I’ve found “solutions” to the problem none of them have worked. I keep looking for the privacy settings to see if anything has changed like people have suggested, but I can’t even find it. I’m hoping I’m
 just dumb and there is a solution to this, but I’m losing hope. I’m getting super tired of this, and I don’t want to make another account because I do more than just minecraft on this one.To be spec

    <title>Can&#39;t disable Network Inspection anymore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t disable Network Inspection anymore</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I used to have more control over the real-time protection options and could disable Network Inspection. When my MSE updated to the latest version the options disappeared. Is this normal? or is there a way to re-enable the options. If I try to manually disable
 the service I get "access is denied".<br />
<br />
This is what it used to look something like...<br />

How it is now...<br />

            <p>These "feature" controls were added in MSE 2.0 and then removed during the beta for MSE 4.0 as I recall, so they've been gone for nearly 2 years now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose originally was to deal with some issues with the early version of MSE where particular modules could&nbsp;sometimes cause issues, either due to conflicts with other drivers or applications on a system.&nbsp; This allowed both some more granular trouble-shooting
 and tuning of MSE under certain specific conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the more common use that many less knowledgeable users made of these was to disable portions of the security in order to deal with performance issues in general, often due to either the presence of malware or simply underpowered hardware.&nbsp; Unfortunately
 this opened the door for even more malware, so the inability of many to use them properly made the controls dangerous for precisely the users who needed MSE most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So during the 4.0 beta as I mentioned these and some other controls were removed and though a small number of vocal users complained, their arguments were generally non-sensical and showed exactly why they had become a problem.&nbsp; So their value in trouble-shooting
 was far less than the risk they created for the very non-technical users who most needed a simple to use anti-malware, which was the original purpose behind MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the question about the meaning of the various controls, the 'Scan all downloads' specifically selected to enable or disable the monitoring of downloads via more recent versions of Internet Explorer, Outlook and some others that many anti-malware
 gain access to via the IOAttachmentExecute interface mentioned in the following KB article.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/914922/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/914922/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that both Windows Defender and MSE are mentioned in the 'Applies To' section.&nbsp; This is also how virtually all current major anti-malware products gain access to these same download and other data streams within Windows, since these API interfaces have
 existed and improved since the release of Windows XP with SP2 and Windows Server 2003.&nbsp; Actually the IOfficeAntiVirus interface existed before this in versions back to Office 97 as I recall, but weren't integrated into Windows itself until later.&nbsp; This is
 where the 'Office' portion of its name comes from and harkens back to the early days of Macro viruses and protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Network Inspection system on the other hand operates via the Windows Filtering Platform which was first&nbsp;added into Windows Vista/Server 2008 and provides the network interface for firewalls and other network monitoring and control applications.&nbsp; This
 is why NIS won't operate on Windows XP, since the WFP didn't exist on that platform.</p>
