    <title>Onenote 2010 notebook sync frozen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Onenote 2010 notebook sync frozen</h2>
                    Hello, Recently after years with no problem with Onenote 2010 on windows 8 (all updated) it froze in syncing a notebook (A): it would spin the green circle for hours. The green bar never moved. It did offer a warning that it had not synced in 11 days.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had this problem once before and recalled making a new notbook helped. So I did (notebook B) and copying some sections from A to new notebook B. Now, my desktop (windows 7) sits for hours with a frozen sync of the new notebook B.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this normal?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1.Will it take 24 hours to sync a new notebook B? (It had run for 6 hours straight)?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. Why did the old notebook A take so long (and still has not synced; although I have not let it run all night yet)?&nbsp;</div>
</div>
                </div>

            Hello, This was useful information but did not fully answer my question.
<div><br />
<div>Now, the laptop (which had the originally slow notebook sync) failed with suspected corrupted info in that same notebook. The info is good in the skydrive webapp.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I suppose I should reinstall onenote or just close and reopen the troubled notebook on the laptop?</div>

            1. The desktop finally completed syncing---after 14 hours for the 2.5 Gb notebook.
<div><br />
<div>2. The laptop still has not finished over Sunday evening through the night until now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I thought it might be the wireless (although full signal), so I connected the LAN connection and will see. This is very inconvenient--and I just upgraded the Skydrive size to 50Gb.&nbsp;</div>

            The answer is "yes, it can take up to 24 hours." And "yes, you may have to resync it partway." Which means babying it. But it is a rare occurrence. &nbsp;It is all synced again on desktop and laptop.

<h2>            Unified Inbox is HORRIBLE</h2>
                    I HATE THE MAC UNIFIED INBOX for multiple accounts! Nobody at Microsoft is listening and 10s of thousands are complaining. Now we are giving up complaining. You don’t have to respond just pass it on again! After every update I hope then I go right back
 to MAC Mail…Please please add Favorites like Windows or allow access to all inboxes separately in the top section as it used to be.

<p>I can see each account inbox but Outlook used to have all inboxes at the top grouped together but each separated.
</p>
<p>&gt;All Accounts</p>
<p>Inbox (A)</p>
<p>Inbox (B)</p>
<p>Inbox (C)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now they are Unified </p>
<p>&gt;All Accounts</p>
<p>Inbox (all accounts show here and you have to scroll down to each account's inbox to view them)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want someone standing behind me and me have the top Inbox selected at work and someone see a personal email or more importantly have someone behind me and see a confidential work email. This is how Outlook worked until about 5 insider fast updates
 came out and this is still the way Mac Mail works and on Windows Outlook it has the options of favorites.</p>

<p>Thanks, I understand now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This new design also means that if you want to see individual Inboxes, all top-level folders for each account willl also then be visible. This pushes the Inbox of subsequent &nbsp;accounts further down the sidebar. For me, some of them are out of view and I have
 to scroll to see them which is annoying. And Smart Folders at the bottom are similarly out of view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the sidebar usable in its current format I have to leave my main work email account expanded and my other accounts collapsed.</p>

<p>Yes, it is annoying to the point where I have switched back to Mac Mail and only open Outlook every few days to check for updates hoping they will change this back or add the favorites option.<br />

<p>
</p><p>This is one of those features that nobody wants, but somebody just keeps inventing these stupid things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do really hope this does not make its way through insider fast build. On insider slow it is not there - yet.</p>

<h3> jayciemiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 521 Update Issue - Phone won&#39;t turn on</h2>
                    I received a notification saying there was a critical update for my phone. I'm guessing it was the Denim update or something. I went through the installation process and everything was fine. Then my phone went to a screen with two gears spinning around
 each other. 7 hours later, the phone as turned off probably 200 times and turns back on by itself to the screen with the gears turning. What is this and how do I get rid of it? I can't turn the phone off on my own, it does it after 10 seconds of being on the
 gear screen. The process bar under the gears isn't loading at all. There is no way for me to access any of my apps or settings because the phone doesn't load enough for me to get to that stuff.

            <p>No, there is not an option to change this list other than by pinning documents to it. For unpinned documents they will appear in reverse chronological order, that is the latest opened will be at the top of the list.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' The document has already been saved at least once.<br />

<h2>            Not sure why it seems the same people seem to have the majority of the problems with windows 10 on this forum</h2>
                    <p>Is it just me or does it seem that most of the biggest problems with the TP seem to be posted by the same people?&nbsp; To me anyway it also seems these same people post the most complaints, mostly very general complaints without much substance.</p>
<p>I am testing on a pretty old tower, now don't get me wrong I have had bugs but most have either been fixed in the next build, I have been able to find a work around or I have found someone on this forum that was able to help. Am posting a screen shot of
 my system.&nbsp; If this old of a system can run Windows 10 with few serious problems would like to know why I keep reading about such serious problems into the latest builds.</p>

            <p>Its probably because they are the usual Microsoft hating Trolls. just ignore them. I'm sure the folks at MS do.</p>
<p>The vast majority of us Insider Preview testers are very happy with Win 10 so far and can appreciate what MS is trying to do by including us in their process of providing us with the opportunity of helping test and develop a new OS.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert by any means, just a grumpy old man who has followed the progression of Windows from its inception and really like what MS is doing.</p>

            <p>Amen to both of you. I have tried to say the very same thing since last October and never caught it like you both did. I am tired of having to weed thru the haters to find real questions and answers. I am hoping when we get to the final build they will all
 move to mac or Linux and complain there and leave this to real MS followers.</p>

            I concur. Started with installing build 10130 from downloaded ISO file, over Windows 8.1, and all subsequent builds including 10162. Setup was a little lengthy, appox. 2 hours, but without a hitch. System log on is quicker than 8.1 and the only bug I encountered
 from my use is not being able to log on with a PIN. Backed up last build to a thumb drive and to restore my complete system with files took only an hour, appox. 92GB. Looking forward to the final release.

            Considering there are now almost 5 million Insiders the small number of those who consistently whine and complain is really testament how well the program must be working. It sure isn't perfect and they may be a tad optimistic at times but I'm thrilled
 that they have gone this route, it's really unprecedented.

            <p>Wow I thought I was the only one that felt this way. I don't get these trolls. If they hate MS or Windows 10 so much then stop using it. Most of the Windows 10 haters are Windows 7 users I've noticed. The only thing the can state is that they want Windows
 10 to basically be a clone of Windows 7. Well why not just keep using Windows 7 then? They can tell you what they hate but I have yet&nbsp;to get one of them to tell me what they WANT out of Windows 10. Other than the already mentioned wanting it to look and act
 like Windows 7. There HAS to be more than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm concerned MS already catered to these Windows 7 guys enough. Windows 8 was getting better and we'd have a Windows 8.3 by now if not for the haters. Basically Windows 10 is Windows 8.3 MS just can't say that. Seriously the Start Screen was not
 that difficult to use. One thing I dislike about Windows 10 is full screen start is a mess and I don't care for partial screen start either. If you could make partial screen start full screen that would solve the issue for me mostly</p>

            <p>I concur with the OP but, unlike the rest of you, I understand the question to be a technical one - "Why are certain people having so many problems?" Is it down to their own skills? Or do they fiddle too much with the registry? Or is their hardware perculiar

<p>It's a question worth asking and I'm surprised that the responses so far seem to just dismiss people who have problems as complaining, whining, MS-hating trolls.</p>
<p>I've had very few serious difficulties, either&nbsp;with VirtualBox or an old HP laptop, but 10130 did break a good run because for some reason it just wouldn't update in one VM and eventually the Start Menu died : I experienced problems that others were whining
 about. Had I suddenly become a troll?</p>
<p>Of course not. Just an unknown glitch of some sort.</p>
<p>There seem to be plenty of people with problems and it doesn't help them <em>or Microsoft

            <p>Boulian - 10/10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marking anyone who makes a complaint or has a problem a "Microsoft hating Troll" is quite frankly rediculous!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had some serious issue when testing, my primary test PC is a HP Laptop with switchable intel/AMD graphics and up till quite recently (two builds ago?) everytime it updated builds I ended up with a blackscreen bootloop. And when you booted into safemode
 explorer.exe crashed immediatly. I ended up having to flash the bios so i could disable the AMD GPU entirely.</p>
<p>I've also had problems with the start menu stopping working a couple of times, with failed build updates and with touchpad drivers giving me a BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem with some people here seems to be more "my opinion is better than yours". And that the people who actually make these "hater" posts that you refer to do so in a fashion (exaggerated language etc) that makes people like you bite and argue
 back. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong - I do think some people here make a lot of unnecessary noise which gets tiresome after a while. But saying "If they hate MS or Windows 10 so much then stop using it" is short sighted. MS have said that win10 will be a constant evolution
 from now on so no more "new versions" of the OS. Eventually everyone will have to move to it if they want/need to keep using windows and the number of applications that just don't work in Linux or OSX will force a lot of people to stay with MS whether they
 want to or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I'd like to see is actually constructive posting on this forum, not a flame war between over-exagerated "MS has ruined their OS" and "shut up your just MS haters" groups.</p>

<p>I'll help people with ELGIT issues. Go look up big bad bombastic bob's posts and tell me he posts anything legit other than hater troll posts and he has hundreds of them. So yes I dismiss people like that. People with REAL issues should just post their issue.
 As soon as I see certain code words in a post I dismiss is as hater/troll post. I also dismiss posts by people that come up with grand conspiracy theories how a company is evil and has evil plans for poor defenseless customers.</p>

<p>You ask why "Windows 10 haters" don't just stick to Windows 7 and stay away from the Insider program. I can only speak for power users, but those of us that use Windows 7 for things other than surfing the web or playing games, will stick with Windows 7 as
 our main OS. Unfortunately, suport for Win 7 will cease in 2020, and if we then have to change to Win 10, we want it to have the same functionality as Win 7. The only way we can have any influence on that is by making our points clear now, not in five years
 time.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I synchronized my Active Directory to a new Office 365 tenant. After the initial sync all my users in office 365 have an error of "Exchange: An unknown error has occurred. Refer to correlation ID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx".</p>
<p>When you check the mail attribute of the users (Mail User) in Exchange online admin console the user displayaname display the alias instead of the correct Display Name.</p>

<p>Hi Regan,<br />
<br />
Please firstly help me confirm some information for a better understanding about the current situation:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Which kind of on-premises environment do you have? An <strong>Exchange on-premises server</strong> or just the
<strong>on-premises Active Directory</strong>?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it a <strong>custom domain</strong> (instead of a local domain) that is used by those synchronized users? If yes, have you
<strong>verified this domain on Office 365</strong> before the synchronization?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you find your synchronized users in the <a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Portal</a> with the correct status “<strong>Synced with AD</strong>”? If yes, can they sign in to the
<a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Portal </a>with their own accounts?<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have you assigned the <strong>Exchange Online licenses</strong> to the synchronized users? If yes, can they sign in to the
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a> with their own accounts?<br />
<br />
Moreover, I noticed that you mentioned the synchronized users became <strong>Mail Users</strong> in your Exchange admin center. Does this mean you have on-premises Exchange mailboxes? Are you trying to perform a mailbox migration?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your updates.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>2. Custom domain is added and verified in the tenant prior sychronization</p>
<p>3. Yes, the user is synced to office 365 portal and have "Synced with AD". But when you click the edit button it will display in the upper portion Exchange: An unknown error has occurred. Refer to correlation ID:</p>

<p>Here's the result</p>
<p>The Value "xxxxxxxxxxxx" of property "ExchangeGuid" is used by another recipient object. Please specify a unique value.</p>
<p>I try to query in MSOnline to doulble check if there's an existing ExchangeGuid the same as what given by error detail but noting is returned. (i wonder where it detects that the ExchangeGuid is already used considering this is the first synchronization
 in a New and Fresh Tenant.</p>

<p>Hi Regan,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the detailed feedback. Now I understand that you’re doing a staged mailbox migration from an Exchange 2007 on-premises server.<br />
<br />
According to your troubleshooting method, actually, we cannot be entirely sure that the "ExchangeGuid" error is indeed the root cause of the issue. As you mentioned, it is a new and fresh tenant, there should not be any Exchange related property changes.<br />
<br />
Since you’re doing a staged migration, I suggest we focus on the migration batch first. Please check if you can find any migration related error message on the
<strong>migration</strong> page of the <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange admin center</a>. Also, you can click <strong>View details</strong> to dig it deeper.<br />
<br />
About any error message you can find, please provide some screenshots by clicking
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> -&gt; <strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong>. And the original error "Exchange: An unknown error has occurred. Refer to correlation ID" is required, too.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Allen</p>

    <title>N70 Hotkeys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnny9j  say:</h3>
<h2>            N70 Hotkeys</h2>
                    I wanted to know if there was a way to change the default hot keys of the phone. I performed the update on my N70 and afterwards my hot keys were changed so instead of having cancel in the bottom right corner of my phone now it says music. I preferred
 it the other way and would like to have it back.<br />
<br />
Anyone, know how to fix this or change the hot keys? Any help would really be appreciated.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Printer driver issues, or issues with the app can be the reasons why this occurs. For us to isolate your concern, we would like to ask for the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the issue occur when printing other files?</li><li>When did the issue occur?</li><li>Were there any changes or updates installed on your computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may try running the Printer troubleshooter: <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_devicec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot problems with devices and printers</a>, and check if the issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back, and we'll assist you further.</p>

    <title>Rolling calander point system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william d parker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rolling calander point system</h2>
                    <p>I want to do a rolling calendar for discipline points for the last 12 months.&nbsp; So what I want it to do is add the values in column C JUST for the last 12 months from the current day and place that total in F5.&nbsp; Let's start the example with today's date of
 10/17/2017 as the base of all the calculations.&nbsp; So if I called out sick for work on 12/2/2016 I will get 1
<strong><em>"incident point value (column&nbsp;C)</em></strong>&nbsp; point for that absence.&nbsp; I want it to calculate back just 1 year from the current day (10/17/2017) day and put the total in F5 which would be a total of 1 so far.&nbsp; Then I call out again on 5/2/2017
 which will cost another 1 point which will make my total 2 points for the rolling year.&nbsp; And in the future I call out again on 12/23/2017 which costs one point.&nbsp; My rolling total now should still be 2 NOT 3 since 12/23/2017 is greater than 1 year from 12/2/2013.&nbsp;
 I hope this is clear?&nbsp; What formula would I put in.&nbsp; The picture below is what I have in currently but need a formula to calculate.</p>

</p><p>So my first thought was a sumif, but the below doesn't work:</p>
<p>=sumif(A1:A9,"&gt;E1",B1:B9) </p>
<p>where the dates were in column A, the numbers were in B, and I put =today()-365 in E1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are ok with a helper column, this will work:</p>
<p>=if(A1&gt;E$1,B1,0)</p>
<p>copy that down and it will only show a number if the date in column A is greater than today-365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure that you could use Sumif, I just have a problem with the logic used by it so I can only make it work for simple things, maybe someone who can fix it will visit?</p>
<p>Hope this help,</p>
<p>Aaron</p>

</p><p>According&nbsp;to your post, you would like to clear app cache. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you delete temporary files and browser history (in&nbsp;Storage Sense&nbsp;&gt; Phone &gt; Temporary files&nbsp;&gt; Delete and in Internet Explorer &gt; More &gt; Settings &gt; Delete history).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If that does not help, please get in touch with the app developer to find out how to&nbsp;clear cache for that particular app.</span></p>

<h2>            Trouble with syncronising contacts on Outlook 2003 SP2 and ActiveSync 4.5</h2>
                    I have just acquired an HTC s710 (windows mobile 6) and am trying to set up the syncronisation with Outlook 2003 on my PC. I have managed to make the connection (via USB) and to syncronise the notes and the email but seem to have problems with contacts.
 Given that there are no "settings" options on the Contacts item within ActiveSync I am asssuming that it is looking for these contacts in a default place and that my contacts within Outlook are not located at this default place, although I have no idea why
 not, or indeed where this default place should be.<br />
<br />
The syncronisation appears to run normally, i.e. no error displayed,, it is just that the contacts on the mobile device remains blank.<br />
<br />
Is anyone able to help?<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Rajesh<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you have solved your issue with the syncronisation, as I cannot help you, but&nbsp;I have another question for you. You state that you have bought an HTC s710 and that you have been able to syncronize
<u>the notes???</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm very interested in knowing how you have made that possible, as I have not been able to find&nbsp;out how it can be done, and have been told that the windows mobile for smartphones does not&nbsp;have the functionality to syncronize outlook notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing if you have found a solution...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stabilo</p>

                    <p>I have a logitech H850e wireless headset which worked correctly all along in windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning after my computer was update the device no longer is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see it listed in the control panel/device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is showing under "Other devices" with a yellow triangle with an exclamation point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following appears<br />
</p>
<p>The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)<br />
<br />
There is no driver selected for the device information set or element.<br />
<br />
<br />
To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it cannot find a driver......I contacted Logitech and they stated that Microsoft actually produces the driver and it is included in the microsoft OS.<br />
<br />
It appears that the driver did not get included in the new version released last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or confrmation?<br />

            <p>Dear Support Engineer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all due resepct............</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was a network admin for 15 years and I build servers including SWIFT servers in the financial sector.</p>
<p><br />
I am well aware of what a Code 28 is, what I need is the driver, obviously it is not there!!!<br />
</p>
<p>"There is no driver selected for the device information set or element."&nbsp; This is pretty self-explanatory.<br />
</p>
<p>The roll back is GREYED OUT and I have also removed the device and restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also trying manually searching, however the driver simply does not EXIST!!!&nbsp; I had windows search the ENTIRE C drive to no avail.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing what the driver is named.&nbsp; If you could provide the actual name of the driver and
 I can locate it I can simply install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted logitech as this is a high-end headset and I was told that the drivers should be included in windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the headset worked right up until the last update I suspect the driver was NOT added to windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked Logitech for a copy of the driver and they stated that they produce the drive in collaboration with Microsoft and that Microsoft would be the ones to provide the actual driver in their OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you would be better served to check your end and determine why this driver was not included in the newest build.&nbsp; Pretty sure it was not just a patch installed but a complete new BUILD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for playing though........</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that my system was upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.........that is when the driver went "missing".</p>
<p>

            <p>The easiest way is to use the Mailings&gt;Create Labels facility and select one of the other of the Microsoft 1/4 Letter labels (one is for portrait orientation and the other for landscape orientation)</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2a424ef-7727-48bb-8ea0-1093b6aa6877" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>and then after clicking on OK, click on the New Document button on the Labels tab of the Envelopes and Labels dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't see anything on the sheet, turn on the display of table gridlines, or if you want to print the lines, apply borders to the table (that's all labels are in Word, tables with fixed cell dimensions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your ultimate purpose is to get four pages to a sheet, you could just create the document in the normal fashion and then use the four pages to a sheet facility when printing.&nbsp; If the content of each of the four parts is to be the same, just create a one
 page document and select the 4 pages to a sheet option and specify the pages to be printed as 1,1,1,1</p>

<h2>            Successfully completed Recovery Form but have not received the Reset Password Email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, my hotmail was locked out of nowhere and MS has told me its because someone was trying to get into my account (which I highly doubt).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the Recovery Form questions and filled them out to the best of my ability, I failed the first time but succeeded the second time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can’t access my old alternative email either, before anyone asks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After getting an email (I’m using my gmail for this) saying I’ve succeeded in proving my ownership, the email then stated that ANOTHER email would be sent with a link to reset my password so I can access my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That second email hasn’t shown up and I can’t fill out the recovery form again since I’ve “exceeded the limit” and now have to wait 24 hours to try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here’s the email I received:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18e302f5-77cf-42b8-913f-46b1b23a46d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18e302f5-77cf-42b8-913f-46b1b23a46d5?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b39cc1a1-2063-4033-a678-304b2d89f12f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b39cc1a1-2063-4033-a678-304b2d89f12f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery request number was 400303785.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need my email back ASAP.</p>

            Dear HollySimpson  ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />It seems that you sucessfully recovered the account, however something went wrong. It is better to contact Microsoft Account Support  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/microsoft-account-get-help-by-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/...</a>  so they can take a look what and why is that happening. Please select option, my problem is not listed and fill the form.

    <title>Why am I getting so much junk mail on a daily basis&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> micameyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why am I getting so much junk mail on a daily basis&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am getting approximately 10-15 spam emails a day, they are mostly insurance or injury claims, something to do with gambling, credit cards, dating or some person pretending they know me (they write 'check this out' with an attachment or link but they never
 mention my name). I am tired of this now. I have already abandoned one hotmail account because I was inundated with junk mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the <strong>exclusive filter</strong> on and I use the <strong>manage rules
</strong>to rule out words like 'ppi' but still I get numerous emails everyday (I have reached my limit now). I get PPI scam emails every week/fortnight. I use
<strong>phishing scams</strong> and <strong>block</strong> to get rid of these emails. I have so many email addresses in my blocked senders list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mostly use my outlook account for things to do with employment and buying from amazon or major stores.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? Has anyone else seen an increase in spam emails?</p>

            <p>Andria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply does not address my specific problem and why am I seeing an increase in spam emails now. I have already done everything to avoid receiving spam as I mentioned above. This is a fairly new email address and I only use it for things to do with employment,
 housing issues (my landlord has my email address) and buying from reputatable major stores. I use another email address for competitions and surveys, I get less junk mail over on that email address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the <strong>manage rules</strong> option and add 'gala bingo' or just 'gala' and suddenly I get 4 or more emails a week in my junk folder about Gala bingo. It's beyond annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate it if someone could explain why the spam emails are increasing and if there is a way to avoid receiving more of these spam emails.&nbsp;

<p><span>The simplest way to obtain that information in a printable format is to create an Event Viewer text log, but you can also obtain a log dedicated exclusively to

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The MMS access point name (APN) is the address your phone uses to send and receive MMS messages. The MMS APN is set automatically when your phone is first set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't send or receive MMS messages, try typing a new MMS APN based on your location and mobile operator. On your phone or computer, try searching online to find the MMS APN settings for your mobile operator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add an MMS APN, do the following steps. You must type an address in the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>MMSC (URL)</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>box. The other settings are optional and depend on your mobile operator.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>In Cellular &amp; SIM settings, select&nbsp;<strong>SIM settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Add an MMS APN</strong>. On a dual SIM phone, select&nbsp;<strong>SIM 1 settings</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>SIM 2 settings</strong>&nbsp;in Cellular &amp; SIM settings.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Do one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Profile name</strong>&nbsp;box, type a name for the MMS APN profile.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>APN</strong>&nbsp;box, type the address for the MMS APN to use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>User name</strong>&nbsp;box, type the user name for your mobile account.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Password</strong>&nbsp;box, type the password for your mobile account.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select&nbsp;<strong>Type of sign-in info</strong>, and then select the authentication method that's used.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select&nbsp;<strong>IP type</strong>, and then select the type of IP address to use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Proxy server</strong>&nbsp;box, type the address for the proxy server to use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Proxy port</strong>&nbsp;box, type the proxy server port number.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>MMSC (URL)</strong>&nbsp;box, type the address of the MMS Center (MMSC) for your mobile operator, beginning with http://</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>MMSC port</strong>&nbsp;box, type the MMSC port number.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Maximum MMS size (KB)</strong>&nbsp;box, type the maximum size (in KB) of an MMS message you can send.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Apply this profile</strong>&nbsp;check box if you want the MMS APN profile to be used right after you save it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>To go back and view the list of MMS APN profiles you have, select the&nbsp;<strong>Back</strong>&nbsp;button, and look under&nbsp;<strong>MMS APN</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Some mobile operators might list the MMSC port number as part of the address. For example,
<strong>http://SiteAddress:portNumber</strong>. If they do, type the <strong>http://SiteAddress</strong> part in the MMSC (URL) box, and then type the
<strong>portNumber</strong> in the <strong>MMSC port</strong> box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
