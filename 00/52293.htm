<h2>            Corrupt World</h2>
                    <p>My Minecraft world has been corrupt for a little over two weeks now, at least I believe it’s corrupt. Instead of an image of the last save next to the world name on my worlds list, or even simply a grass block, my world has nothing. Whenever I press “a” to load my world, nothing happens, no matter the amount of times I press it or restarting my Xbox. It wouldn’t be such a big deal to me, except for the fact that this specific world has hundreds and hundreds of hours of mine on it along with numerous friends that play with me. Please let me know if anyone had the same issue or knows how to fix! Would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            How big a flash drive do I need to make a back-up for a Win 7 Pro 64-bit OS&#63;</h2>
                    I can't seem to find that information in the computer itself, and need to know so that I can buy a flash drive for that specific function that looks totally different than any other flash drive I own, so I don't either use it for something else or accidentally
 erase it.&nbsp; Does someone have the answer for me as to what size I need?&nbsp; 8GB, 16gb, 32GB, or what?&nbsp; Thank you in advance!<br />

            <p>It depends on what exactly you mean by a backup, how large your system is, and what software you intend to use to make the backup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
For starters, assuming that you only have a C: drive, how much space is in use?
</p><p>
</p><p>The backup software that is part of Windows 7 doesn't do estimates --&gt; <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/0cccdac5-d251-48b7-ace3-edbddb9cf766/windows-7-backup-disk-space?forum=windowsbackup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
Furthermore, Windows 7 backup allegedly does not permit a system image to be saved to a flash drive (see -&gt;

            <p>What I need to do is make a system restore back-up, as this is a new computer.&nbsp; It keeps saying I need to do so in the System Action Center, but doesn't tell me how many CD-ROMS or how big a flash drive I will need to make said system back-up, only that
 I need to set it up.&nbsp; That's why I'm asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So maybe go to Windows Explore and see how much of the hard drive is in use and guess accordingly?</p>

            <blockquote>So maybe go to Windows Explore and see how much of the hard drive is in use and guess accordingly?</blockquote>
<p>That's a good start, but do this as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Backup and Restore </li><li>Click "Create a system image"</li><li>The next screen is "Where do you want to save the backup?"&nbsp; If you have an external drive connected, you can select that, otherwise select "On one or more DVDs."&nbsp; Click "Next"</li><li>The next screen is "What drives do you want to include in the backup?"&nbsp; The drive(s) necessary for Windows to run are selected by default; the amount of space used on these disks is displayed; don't change anything.&nbsp; Click "Next"</li><li>The next screen is "Confirm your backup settings."&nbsp; This screen shows what drive(s) will be backed up (imaged) and where the backup will be saved.&nbsp; You'll also get an estimate of the space required.</li><li>At this point, you can click "Start backup" if the location you indicated to save the backup has enough free space.</li></ul>
<p>The estimate appears to equal the amount of space used on the drive(s).&nbsp; More than likely, the actual image will take up less space.&nbsp; Some useful discussion here --&gt;

            <p>The Windows Backup tool will takes much space as is occupied on the on the drives because compression is minimal and in the vast majority of cases the only practical option is an external USB hard drive, DVD/flash disks are not really a workable option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of a new computer the manufacturer should also provide a utility for you to create a recovery disk set which would reinstate the computer to factory default if the drive failed. It would mean re updating the computer afterwards but if this is
 a practical option you would only need to backup your data.</p>

            <p>Thank you, LemP, that gives me the process to use, but I still don't know how much space I'm going to need...by going to Properties on my C:\ drive, I have just under 50GB used and 402GB free.&nbsp; So should I purchase a 64GB flash drive as a
<em>dedicated </em>recovery source to use for the system?&nbsp; The system does provide the utility to create a recovery set...it was the first thing the computer wanted to do when I turned it on.&nbsp; However, the utility
<em>neglected to mention </em>how many discs I would need <em><strong>or</strong></em> how big a flash drive I would need to do so, since those were the two options I was given in that utility.</p>
<p>
I need to know as I neither curently have free flash drives big enough (on which I backup regularly), nor CD-ROM RW discs
<em>period </em>as my last computer's RW disc drive was broken, hence my swap to flash drives and the presenting of all the blank RW discs I had to someone who could use them.&nbsp; Therefore I must purchase the required item(s) on a now-limited budget -- I can't
 just jump up, run out, and purchase the biggest thing available "to make sure" because I haven't got the money now I've actually gotten the new computer -- and I won't for some time.&nbsp; I know in some instances 8GB flash dives are less than ten bucks, but I
 have no idea at the moment what a 64GB would cost....</p>

            <p>The recovery disk set is completely different from a backup. The former will reset back to factory condition completely so does not include your data or any programs you have installed. The ones I have used only offer to write out to DVDs although that may
 not be the choice with other systems. Each one has needed 3 DVDs incidentally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are quite right to look at your current disk size for a backup so 50GB would nominally fit a 64GB flash drive however a new&nbsp;Windows installation grows initially very quickly so future backups would not fit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggested an external drive because the price per GB is much lower. On my local Amazon&nbsp;a 1TB USB&nbsp;HDD is roughly 3 times the price of a 64GB flash drive but can hold 15 times as much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are happy with recovery disks you would only have to back up your data (documents, music etc.) which could be much smaller which them makes a flash drive a more realistic option.</p>

            <p>That's what I'm looking for, as I regularly back up my data (files, pics, music) to an 80GB external and only access it when I need something off of it.&nbsp; Everything else is either on CD or downloaded from the internet.&nbsp; So if I'm only backing up the actual
 operating system for recovery as my data is already backed up or otherwise available, making the recovery set would be a simple fail-safe.&nbsp; Now that I have an idea as to how much space I will need (say 4 discs or one 64GB flash), then I know what I'm looking
 for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have also just discovered how hard it is to type with band-aids on two fingers and be coherent, much less be able to use a trackball mouse

<p>I appreciate the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked all available tools to clean up disk space.&nbsp; With only 29.1GB available, 21.5GB is reserved, leaving a maximum of 7.6GB were I to delete everything.&nbsp; Simply put, deleting every user file, every temp file, every application... which, ironically,
 would have to include the Windows 10 Update Assistant... clearing every cache, I'd still be unable to free up 8GB.&nbsp; I'll need another option.</p>

<p>We recommend that you perform a fresh installation of Windows 10 in order to get the latest version. Make sure to backup your files into an external hard drive or OneDrive. Download the media creation tool into an OTG USB or USB flash drive if you have a
 USB hub for your tablet to create an installation drive. You may download the media creation tool on this

<p>Forgive the delay... i wanted to make sure I could find the time to delve into what, for me, are uncharted waters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your solution seems to be the right direction and I created the USB media and managed to force the tablet to boot from the USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, once the Windows install application started, I hit another snag... prompting me for language, time/currency and keyboard settings in the first dialog, I am unable to tap 'Next' on the tablet's screen. It's as though the install application is configured
 to accept only keyboard input... something that's a bit of a challenge on a dedicated tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I download the correct update for to the USB? Is there another update that works for tablets?</p>

<p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The media creation that you download is correct. When installing Windows 10 on your tablet<span>, you'll need a USB hub, USB keyboard and mouse,&nbsp;</span><span>have your drivers on hand</span><span> because</span><span>
 touch screen will not work, until you install the drivers. Use the device manager to install them. For further assistance with your concern, please contact the manufacturer of your tablet.</span></p>

    <title>No Start Menu and Problems with Task Icons - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No Start Menu and Problems with Task Icons</h2>
                    <p>After the update I have had many issues mentioned in other threads, now mostly solved, but the remaining issues are now critical and I need advice on how to get these corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>the Problems"</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; clicking on the start menu icon (left click) does nothing,&nbsp; Right click brings up a simple function list.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; clicking on the File Explorer icon (task bar) does nothing.&nbsp; Right click does nothing.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Right clicking on any task bar icon, including open apps, does nothing.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Notification s taskbar icon does nothing when left clicked.&nbsp; Right click brings up context menu but clicking on either choice does nothing.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Several apps (Mozilla Thunderbird, Norton 360 specifically, have not been able to have been updated or re-installed.&nbsp; Norton support, using remote desktop app, gave up after 4+ hours of work today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have almost given up.&nbsp; I need a fix, or perhaps the win 10 download can be redone (if this is due to corrupt update), or if nothing it is back to win 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Thunderbird problem was fixed with the last Win 10 update. &nbsp;The Norton 360 version I have, with latest Norton updates, is compatible and working on my other Win 10 updated computer. &nbsp;(The reference you gave is for checking compatiblity, not compatibility
 mode.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Norton software works in safe mode only. &nbsp;Norton has taken appropriate logs to determine the problem. &nbsp;I am not the only one with Norton problems with the win 10 upgrade.</p>

            <p>I started a new discussion [<em>A Solution for Missing Start Menu}</em> but in a nutshell t<strong>he missing start screen was fixed
</strong>by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Removing all traces of my Norton 360 anti-virus app. (or any other antivirus that has a firewall.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Turning on Windows Defender (which can't be done with virus checker installed.)</p>
<p>3. Running the Get-AppXPackage solution again, but ONLY AFTER RUNNING Powershell as ADMIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY way to run Powershell as admin is by finding the program on your hard drive using the file explorer</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>c:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v 1.0\powershell.exe</strong></p>
<p>and right clicking it and then selecting Run as Administrator. &nbsp;If you don't follow this requirement and making sure that Windows Defender is running, then running the Get-AppXPackage instruction will do nothing useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, the AppXPackage instruction for PowerShell (Admin) is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>type: &nbsp;<strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppXPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocatioin) \AppXManifest.xml"}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check spelling and caps and little things like the underline and period as well as spaces. &nbsp;They all have to be exactly as shown. This instruction will proceed, counting 1% of progress at a time, as opposed to a rather short process when not run in Admin
 Mode. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably advisable to go into c<strong>ommand prompt (admin) </strong>and type
<strong>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</strong>to see if there are any corrupt files that have been created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you finish probably best to do a restart. &nbsp;You should now have access to the start menu, and the MS icons on the taskbar should now work. &nbsp;If it doesn't then try again, carefully following the procedure. &nbsp;If there is a need for more detail in the process
 then please search for my other thread by title and it is geared for just about any level of skill. &nbsp;You can also look for the thread that finally gave me the info I needed, titled "<em>FIX - Windows 10 Taskbar Not Functioning (Start/Search/Settings/etc.)"</em></p>
<p>If this helped and worked like it did for me, congratulations!</p>

            <p>Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently Norton interferes with Windows 10. &nbsp;Deleting Norton, turning on Windows Defender and Firewall and doing the above Powershell worked beautifully!! &nbsp;Thank you for pointing that out...you do have a typo in your powershell command though! &nbsp;:D</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few notes: &nbsp;I was only able to access the admin command prompt for powershell by right clicking on the start icon and clicking the command prompt (administrator). &nbsp;Then type Powershell and enter. &nbsp;At the next prompt paste the above powershell info! &nbsp;I
 got a green screen that was processing...progress continued for over an hour so don't be impatient! &nbsp;I did not have to reboot to see the results!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft is following some of these posts...Removing other Antivirus programs is a really easy fix to a very frustrating problem! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question now....are we protected enough with Windows Defender?</p>

    <title>Family Sharing of Paid Apps, music, films - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cazza1000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Sharing of Paid Apps, music, films</h2>
                    <p>Does Microsoft have Family Sharing, Ie a similar method to Apple? Whereas you can buy apps, music, films etc from any family account or device and share it with your immediate family members for no extra cost. Hence I can buy an app appropriate for each
 child but when the younger old enough to use it they can access it for no extra fee. It doesn't seem any different to buying a DVD and allowing each family member to watch it in dependently. I cant seem to see any option to do this on Microsoft. I don't want
 to have to buy three copies of minecraft for PC when I only need one for ipods etc.</p>
<p>I will go back to Macs and apple if this isn't an option. Its the principle. Thanks in advance for any confirmation or guidance.</p>

            Hi Adolf7 ,
<br />
<br />Sad to say there will be no Windows 11, it is an Internet myth . . .
<br />
<br />When support for Windows 8 ends, Windows 10 will be re-branded to just Windows
<br />
<br />Support for Windows 10 does not end in 2023, twice yearly major upgrades to Windows 10 are released which extend the lifespan of Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />So as long as you are up to date your Windows 10 will be supported . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 Start button, task bar menu and swipe does not work</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS laptop and which came with Windows 8 and then I upgraded to Windows 10. Recently the start button is not working. When I click the start button it says Critical error and it will fixed when I log in the next time. It has not happened and I
 have tried all the remedies given in web (safe mode, powershell etc). These has not corrected the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my task bar menu when clicked does not show the pop up menu like wifi and others. I have also tried the swipe from the left side which is supposed to show the pop up menu. This also does not work. Also the windows store and mail shortcut at the task
 bar does not show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is any other remedies and when Microsoft is going give the patch for this error????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Partha</p>

                    <p>Hello I just started getting this error on my PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updated updated my PC to the new Creators update. Everything worked fine to start with. I tested Cortana and it was working great. Everything else was fine. I shut down before going to bed, and then &nbsp;I restarted the next day, and now I tried to start
 my Windows Mail and it came up with "Your Outlook settings are out of date" and my windows account is not logged in.</p>
<p>Now I cant get my email from the windows UWP Mail app. And I can't use Cortana as it says I a not logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually come to think of it, it started doing this after it asked me to delete my last version of windows, &nbsp;as my C drive is small and gets full very quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me that would be great.</p>
<p>

<p>lol no your an <strong>[mod removed]</strong>, just because there clan is on a modder forum dosnt mean they hack games, i have an account on 2 modder sites but i dont hack games, i just like to see whats going on and also know the exploits so i can counter
 them if possible. Like i already said he may have had his GS reset for gamesaving which has nothing to do with him being good at Call Of Duty, you just sound like the typical sore loser on COD just cause someone has done well you claim they must be cheating</p>

<p>Is it midly suspicious? Yes, but it's not proof that the person in question has hacked the game: he may simply be a very good player, or even just having a good night. His clan may be listed under modding sites, but that doesn't equate to them hacking or
 to him/her hacking personally.</p>

            <p>Hi Thofikh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue doesn't seem to be specific to any application.&nbsp; I've tried several, they all report the same error.</p>
<p>I did switch SDXC cards, upgrading from a 128GB card to a 200GB card.&nbsp; I moved all the applications off the old card and back onto the C: drive, swapped cards, and started encountering the error.&nbsp; Get-AppxVolume reported that the D: volume was offline, so
 I guess that it's looking for a specific Volume ID, so I removed the old volume (remove-AppXVolume) and created a new one (Add-AppXVolume).&nbsp; Now I can move packages using the command line (Move-AppxPackage), but the GUI still gives the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC /scannow reports that everything's OK, and the troubleshooter didn't find anything wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Summarize: I CAN move packages using Powershell; Move-AppxPackage works just fine.&nbsp; It's only in the Settings/System/Apps &amp; Features screen that I'm getting the error.</p>

<h3> rch-k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro &#40;1&#41; won&#39;t connect to a specific wireless network when every other device will</h2>
                    <p>UPDATE: &nbsp;As noted below, switching from WPA to WPA2 solved this problem for me. &nbsp;Still seems like a buggy issue with the Surface, but at least it's solved for me now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=============</p>
<p>ORIGINAL POST:</p>
<p>I have an original Surface Pro that I've been happily using for over a year with minimal problems - it connects to wireless networks all the time without problems. &nbsp;Now trying to connect to a new network, and after asking for the network security key, it
 thinks for a moment (message during this time is "checking network requirements") then says "Can't connect to this network". &nbsp;Every other device in the house (2 android phones, a very new mac laptop, an old Windows Vista laptop, a few others) work without
 any problem. &nbsp;I know it is not typing in the security key wrong; if I type it wrong on purpose, it gives me a different error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>-- Leaving the network unsecured - and then it connects fine! &nbsp;However, I cannot do my work over an unsecured network, so this is not a solution.</p>
<p>-- Using the manual button on the router to tell it to accept the connection, instead of using the security key; same result.</p>
<p>-- Changing the router channel from 11 to 6, as recommended by some other discussions I read. &nbsp;No effect.</p>
<p>-- All the standard stuff: running all the windows trouble shooters (network troubleshooter, internet connections troubleshooter, network adapter troubleshooter), restarting the computer, restarting the router, entirely reinitiating the routers, directly
 setting the IP address after obtaining it from another device - nothing works. &nbsp;The automatic troubleshooters often come up with "Problem with wireless adapter or access point" and recommend restarting the router, which does not help.</p>
<p>-- Turning off the power management feature on the wi-fi adapter, as recommended by some other discussions. &nbsp;No effect.</p>
<p>-- Trying to manually connect by going to Network and Sharing Center --&gt; Set up a new connection or network --&gt; Manually connect to a wireless network, then choosing Security type as "WPA-Personal", Encryption type as TKIP, and entering the Network name
 and Security Key. &nbsp;No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a huge problem for me, and I am very limited in my ability to get around it. &nbsp;I am here for 5 weeks that I am supposed to work remotely and I have no other access options. &nbsp;Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<p>-- Computer is 1st generation Surface Pro, with a Marvell AVASTAR 350N wireless card</p>
<p>-- Router is a D-link N 300 ADSL2+ router (model: DSL-2750U)</p>
<p>-- Router is set to WPA-PSK, 802.11n</p>

                    I am using two monitor in the extended view so that I can drag from one screen to the next. &nbsp;The problem is that I cannot play a slideshow on my 2nd monitor - it goes black and the show plays only on my main screen. &nbsp;How do I make it play on the 2nd screen.
 &nbsp;Thanks.

<h2>            Skype for Mac not showing most recent calls.</h2>
                    I make frequent calls to one specific person, and recently, when the call ends, it doesn't show that there was a call made at all. A small problem, I guess, but still a problem. I'm just a little confused why they aren't showing up.

<h2>            Windows 10 Colors are all kinds of messed up.</h2>
                    <p>Someone was on my work computer and altered the color scheme of it a while back. I have never been able to figure out why it is doing this. Things I've tried</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Change themes and/or color settings under options.</p>
<p>- Change colorblinds modes on and off</p>
<p>- High Contrast changes</p>
<p>- Factory defaulted monitor settings</p>
<p>- Tried making new users and logging on to them.</p>
<p>- New monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>So upon reading opening the file i screen shot for this on another computer, I can see that has to be video card related. The screen shot came out fine. But everything is pink. Might be a driver issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update #1 Video driver updated. Nothing fixed. Also disabled and Enabled again. No fix.</p>

            That means there is some third party driver causing this.
<br />Completely remove everything from graphics using DDU and install the newest copy of the driver available in Safe mode
<br />

<br />
<br />You can head to the manufacturer of your device to get the newest driver.
<br />
<br />Let us know if you require any assistance.

<h2>            Only some photos download from iPhone&#63;</h2>
                    When I plug my iPhone into my computer AND my Surface, only 243 of my 2000+ photos sync. It doesn't recognize them and trying to plug the phone in again doesn't work. I've checked every photo folder and they are nowhere hiding out. Is there some reason
 why these photos are being skipped over, and how do I fix it. I have no other way to get them off my phone.

            <p>Hi Elaine,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try a few tips as below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>a. Unlock iPhone when you connect to the computer</p>
<p>b. Make sure you tap "<strong>Trust this computer</strong>" message on iPhone</p>
<p>c. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>E</strong> and click on <strong>
This PC</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to view picture folders only from your iPhone in Windows 10. If&nbsp;you are trying to sync photos to through iTunes, make sure latest version of iTunes is installed in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I recommend contacting Apple Support Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
