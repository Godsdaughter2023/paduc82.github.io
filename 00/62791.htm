<h2>            desktop gadgets</h2>
                    As of today, November 20 2013, my gadgets don't work.&nbsp; I read on Windows free download page that gadgets are replaced by apps.&nbsp; I used a few gadgets but the one I really want back is the CPU/RAM monitor.&nbsp; The Microsoft FixIt workaround disabled gadgets
 in group policy.&nbsp; Does anyone know what is a good performance monitor or resource monitor that goes on the desktop and most Importantly!&nbsp;is malware free?&nbsp; Thank you.

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you want to add gadgets to the desktop I would recommend you go through the link given below for adding the gadgets.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you want to know about the Perfomance Monitor, I would like to give you a bit information about it:
<br />
<div><strong>Resource Monitor</strong>: Resource Monitor enables you to monitor various aspects of your computer.<br />
It is divided in 5 tabs: Overview, CPU, Memory, Disk, Network<br />
Different tabs perform different function.</div>
<div><strong>. </strong>A Resource Monitor provides a communication, monitoring, and processing layer between the Cluster service and one or more resources. Resource Monitors have the following characteristics:<br />
<div>•A Resource Monitor always runs in a process separate from the Cluster service. If a resource fails, the Resource Monitor isolates the Cluster service from the effects. If the Cluster service fails, the Resource Monitor allows its resources to shut down
 gracefully.<br />
<div>•To work with a resource, a Resource Monitor loads the resource DLL responsible for that resource type into its process.<br />
<div>•When the Cluster service requests an operation on a resource, the Resource Monitor routes the request to the appropriate entry point function of the resource DLL responsible for the resource. The Resource Monitor performs default processing for some resource
 operations.<br />
<div>•A Resource Monitor stores synchronized state data, allowing the Cluster service and resource DLLs to operate asynchronously, checking and updating resource status as needed.<br />
<div>•A Resource Monitor periodically checks the operational status of all of its resources. For more information on this process, see Resource Failure.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Perfomance Monitor:</strong> The Performance Monitor provides you with real-time reports on how various system settings and components are performing. Performance Monitor displays real-time data using performance counters, which are measurements of
 system activity or the current system state. For each counter, Performance Monitor displays a graph of recent values over a time space (the default time space is 100 seconds), as well as statistics such as the average, maximum, and minimum values over that
 span.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Installation Seems to be Hiccuping at Desktop</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 on a Dell Inspiron Laptop running Windows 7 Premium. All seemed to go well. I got the "Welcome" screen, but it seemed to run into trouble loading my desktop and shortcuts. It displays my desktop with a black ribbon at the bottom
 of the screen with the Windows logo on the far left, along with "Search the web and Windows." It flashes from that to black and back again very rapidly and appears to be working on something; then it stops and is static for about 10 seconds before starting
 to flash again. Occasionally, during the flashing,&nbsp;my desktop icons and my taskbar appear&nbsp;- but they quickly disappear. It won't allow me to use anything. If I place my cursor on the Windows logo I get a spiral indicating that the system is working. I don't
 know if it has encountered an error or if it is still "tweaking" things and will eventually load correctly. It seems to have slowed a bit on the flashing, now, and is static more, but I still can't do anything. Is this norma

            <p>Hi Jurble,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows has a set of certain folders which are identified by unique strings referred to as CLSID or Windows Class Identifiers. These folders can be accessed by using the CLSID identifier codes that Windows assigns to each individual folder in the Windows
 Registry.</p>
<p><br />
1.Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2.What steps or posts are you referring to when you say "searched and saw two previous posts on this topic, but neither had satisfactory answers:?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to try deleting the folder from Recent folders. If you are not able to delete the folder from recent folders, you may try to boot the computer Safe Mode and then try to delete the folder from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
a)<strong> Restart</strong> your computer.<br />
b) When you see the computer manufacturer's logo, press and hold the <strong>F8 key</strong>.<br />
c) On the <strong>Advanced Boot Options screen</strong>, use the arrow keys to highlight
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>, and then press Enter.<br />
d) Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
e) Now try to<strong> delete the folder from recent folder.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You can delete this entry by going into registry entry:</p>
<p><br />
Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article:

            1. It happened last Saturday.<br />
<br />
2. This post: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/clsidstartmenuproviderfolder-appearing-in-recent/bf441e35-34a1-45c0-8fb5-cb980a2bb275 and this post: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/at-the-top-of-my-recent-folders-is-a-folder-named/e25e4185-850c-4bab-8f89-c0b5d972ef86<br />
<br />
I deleted it easily enough, but that's not really my concern.&nbsp; My question is <i>
why</i> this folder suddenly showed up, it never having shown up in my Recent folders ever before.&nbsp; Neither of the previous two posts answered this question either.<br />

            This does not resolve my problem. Window 10 does not offer a choice that meets my needs, which is 1920 x 1080. Where can I get this or how do I otherwise resolve the issue. The video card is of no value here.

            did you go through display settings ? , in display settings there should be a detect setting under advanced setting which will show numerous size display setting to choose from, I attached a picture of my Windows 10 display setting which is exactly what
 you are asking for, good luck.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8bc5b04-3914-4a04-9eab-46da7d4eb3e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8bc5b04-3914-4a04-9eab-46da7d4eb3e8" /></a><br />

<h2>            Skype to Skype Call Issues</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Skype for many years now. I've never had call issues calling a friend from my iPhone to his computer. No issues ever when I was at my parent's house or at my college. Ever since moving into my apartment and getting on my own internet
 plan, it's been a nightmare. Originally, I was on 30mbps at my apartment. You would think going to the next plan of 100mbps would fix it but that is not correct. A tad bit more information is that my router is on the ground, but that shouldn't cause that big
 of a deal. I've set the ports from what I've read for Skype, for my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a daily basis, the call drops or has poor connection all day. I've tried making setting changes to my router to no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me, that would be amazing. Below is my router manual.</p>

 Laptop" does not have any issues connecting to the same source.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>I have found many questions regarding this issue, and have completed several steps to correct the issue (with no success) which are listed below.<br />
<span>I have found many questions regarding this issue, and have completed several steps to correct the issue (with no success) which are listed below.<br />
<br />
Method 1: The "Other Laptop" connects without issue every time from the exact same location as the Surface Pro is in, but the Surface Pro does not; connect, stay connected or provides little to no capability when connected.<br />
<br />
Method 2: Internet connection troubleshooter results -&nbsp;<br />
"Connect to an available network"<br />
-&gt; Show me a list of available networks<br />
(Click on) -&gt; MyNetwork (Shows 5 bars) -&gt; (Connect automatically box checked) -&gt;(click Connect) -&gt; Password entered -&gt; "No, don't turn on sharing or connect devices" (selected), -&gt; "Can't connect to this network" -&gt; "Help me solve connection problem" (If I
 actually do this, I'll be in an infinite loop, getting the same results) -&gt; (click) Close.<br />
"Check to see if the problem is fixed" (It's obvious it isn't, but I clicked it anyways) Result - Problems Found "You have no preferred wireless networks"&nbsp;<br />
Explore additional options (click).<br />
Options:<br />
<br />
1. Get help from a friend. (Is this really a best option?)<br />
2. Recovery. I already reverted to the OOB (Out of the Box) configuration with no luck.<br />
3. Online support. Luckily I have several other computers that can connect online to this forum, and find out how to get this $1000 paper weight working correctly.<br />
<br />
Network Adapter troubleshooter (run as administrator):<br />
<br />
1. Select the network adapter to diagnose -&gt; Wi-Fi.<br />
2. Connect to an available wireless network. -&gt; Show me a list of available networks (It's deja-vu all over again).&nbsp; See above results for "Internet Connection troubleshooter" above.<br />
<br />
Method 3: I do not have the ability to connect directly to the router/modem at this particular location. The other topics were very general in nature, and also did not fix my issue.<br />
<br />
I have also done the following with no luck:<br />
<br />
Reboot (multiple times).<br />
Verified that the drivers are current.<br />
The router is broadcasting that it is set to 802.11g<br />
Executed the following commands:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><span>netsh int tcp set heuristics disabled</span></b></li><li><b><span>netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled</span></b></li><li><b><span>netsh int tcp set global rss=enabled</span></b></li><li><span>Then type&nbsp;<b>netsh int tcp show global&nbsp;</b>to verify that practically all the settings are disabled.</span></li><li><span>Finally,&nbsp;<b>reboot</b>&nbsp;the Surface</span></li></ul>
<div><font color="#000000"><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<p>
<span>Still no luck. If this can't be fixed, I'd like to know sooner than later so I can return this tablet, and get something that will better suit my needs. I have been troubleshooting this for (literally)

            Thanks for your help in trying to get this working properly. No the network at work is not a domain network.
<div><br />
<div>NOTE - It may just be because I have trouble connecting to a network, but it seems like every time I am able to connect to a network, a patch is downloaded and I end up having to reboot. I was initially impressed with how quickly the Surface booted up,
 but if I download a new patch every time I do manage to connect to a network, I have to go through the install/reboot dance, and that "quick" boot time, becomes a long miserable wait (last night alone it was nearly ten minutes before I was able to use the
 computer, but then it wouldn't connect to the network).<br />
<div><br />
<div><span>I went home yesterday connected to my home network and the Surface downloaded a patch and restarted. NOTE - It may just be because I have trouble connecting to a network, but it seems like every time I am able to connect to a network, a patch is
 downloaded and I end up having to reboot. After the restart I tried connecting to my home network (the same one I downloaded the update on a few minutes earlier), and it stayed in a state of "limited". Disconnected from my network and tried connecting to my
 "Guest" network, same issue. I shut the Surface down, put it back in the box, taped the receipt to the box, stuck it on the front seat of my car, and will be returning it as soon as I get off work.</span>
<div><br />
<div>I'm done. Trying to get this to work for nearly a month now is ridiculous. I have spent too much time and effort with it, and need to move on. Thanks to all who responded and tried to help me get this working. I may revisit Windows 8 at a later time, but
 right now I see no point in trying any further. I have a laptop that will work (it has for nearly two years, without issue). I would prefer having a tablet sized device for travel (with a full OS, and peripheral ports), but it isn't this one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once again thanks for the help.&nbsp;</div>

The first read out happened while I was online running Modern Warfare 2. The second time I was simply running iexplorer with two tabs one being youtube the other being a simple forum. Any help to correct this problem is appreciated.</p>

            Hi Pseudoping,<br />
<br />
Firstly, I would suggest you to disable/uninstall your Anti-virus software (especially Norton) and try running Modern Warfare 2.
<br />
<br />
If disabling/uninstalling the Anti-virus software ends this blue screen problem, then I would suggest you to upgrade your Anti-virus software to a higher version or update the current software with the latest virus definitions and alerts.<br />
<br />
If this did not work, I would suggest you to update your device drivers (especially display drivers) by visiting the respective device manufacturers. Drivers downloaded from the manufacturer will be the most tested and up to date available. The manufacturer
 is almost always the original source of any driver you find anywhere else. <br />
<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> If you're trying to find drivers for a branded computer system (like a Dell desktop, a Toshiba laptop, etc.), all you need is the exact model number of your complete system. You shouldn't need to identify the specifics of any individual
 piece of hardware in your computer unless you've upgraded it yourself.<br />
<br />
If you’ve the latest drivers, then the cause of the blue screen issue would be a memory problem.<br />
<strong><br />
How do I know if my computer has a memory problem?</strong> <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />

    <title>Cortana Searches the Web but doesn&#39;t open apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enzeruonizuka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana Searches the Web but doesn&#39;t open apps</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, when I tell Cortana to open an application, she does a search on Bing instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I say "Hey Cortana, open Microsoft Word." she instead opens Bing in my browser and searches for "Open Microsoft word."</p>
<p>If I say "Open minecraft." she instead does a search on bing for "Open minecraft."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I talked with a friend on Skype about the issue and shared my screen to show what's happening.&nbsp; His Cortana is opening things for him just fine and I heard her responding to his requests to open things.&nbsp; I then talked to a Microsoft Answer Tech through the
 spiffy contact support app and ended up allowing the tech to connect to my system and look things over.&nbsp; She couldn't figure out why Cortana isn't doing as she's told to either.&nbsp; This is the only problem I'm having with Cortana.&nbsp; She's been telling me jokes
 and singing to me all day just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro with a pretty standard installation, just like the friend I talked to on skype.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?</p>

            I did another reboot today and, now, suddenly Cortana is behaving properly and opening things for me.&nbsp; No idea what may have changed between my attempts and the reboot I did today.<br />

            <p>I'm having the same issue but I've restarted Cortana and my computer many times over the past couple of days and nothing has changed. Any program not on the all apps list is invisible to Cortana and I can't seem to get programs not on the list onto the list.

            <p>Hey bro! I found a solution! So for me, Cortana was not opening Microsoft Word and I figured i out. The technical name for the app is "Word 2013", that is, if you have word 2013. So I said, "Cortana, open Word 2013" and she opened it immediately. I hope
 this helps.&nbsp;</p>

            My issue is that I have to issue the "Hey Cortana, Open Edge" command twice.&nbsp; The first attempt will fail and then the second attempt launches the application.&nbsp; It's very odd.&nbsp; In a previous build&nbsp;I don't recall having to do that.&nbsp;

            This happened to me, too. Then I saw that Microsoft Word 2013 is called "WINWORD" in my program list. Cortana now opens the program when I ask for WINWORD.

<p>I tried it on mine. Both "Open Notepad" and "Open Wordpad" work for me. Maybe try capitalizing your pronunciation? :)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found, based on someone's earlier comment, that "Open Word 2016" does work, whereas "Open Microsoft Word" does not. So kudos on that one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I would like the Web bar that stays at the top of the screen gone. I can't see the top of my windows that I am working in, and this is hindering my work. Please tell me how to remove it. It is the bar at the top with the forward and backward arrows, the
 home button, the browser button, the search bar and 3 other short cuts. It keeps causing unwanted windows to come up when I an trying to work, and it is becoming very troublesome. Please advise on how to remove this, or on how to revert back to the prior version
 of windows.</p>

    <title>Windows Movie Maker&#58; Cannot Import avi Video File&#59; It Becomes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kingmoflax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker&#58; Cannot Import avi Video File&#59; It Becomes Audio, but still avi.</h2>
                    I am trying to make a movie using Windows Vista (64 bit)&nbsp;Windows Movie Maker. I have a .avi video file that I wish to import (frame 640 by 480, 352 kbps bitrate, 30 frames/second, 60.3 megabytes). The file plays normally (audio and video)&nbsp;in Windows Media
 Player. However, when I import the file to Movie Maker, only the audio portion of the file comes through. In other words, when I put the imported file into the moviemaking timeline, I hear the clip but there is no picture. There are no error messages, that's
 just what happens.<br />
<br />
When I&nbsp;view the&nbsp;properties on the imported file, the bitrate and file size are the same as that of the original, but under Source File: File Type it says Audio. The File Location under Source File is correct, and the file extension is still .avi.<br />
<br />
Extra Information: The video file is actually a compilation of several clips run back to back, and&nbsp;saved as one .avi file. Also this compilation was done on a Macbook, though I'm not sure which kind. I think the program used was iMovie. I don't know if that
 makes a difference or not.<br />
<br />
Other .avi clips import normally and work perfectly. This is the only one giving me trouble. Also, under Properties: General, for File Type, all clips except for this one read: Video&nbsp;Clip (.AVI). However this file which won't import properly reads: Video Clip
 (.avi). It is lowercase as opposed to uppercase; again I don't know if that matters or not.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much, I appreciate any help at all; this is an important project to me.

 Media Player. However, when I import the file to Movie Maker, only the audio portion of the file comes through. In other words, when I put the imported file into the moviemaking timeline, I hear the clip but there is no picture. There are no error messages,
 that's just what happens.<br />
<br />
When I&nbsp;view the&nbsp;properties on the imported file, the bitrate and file size are the same as that of the original, but under Source File: File Type it says Audio. The File Location under Source File is correct, and the file extension is still .avi.<br />
<br />
Extra Information: The video file is actually a compilation of several clips run back to back, and&nbsp;saved as one .avi file. Also this compilation was done on a Macbook, though I'm not sure which kind. I think the program used was iMovie. I don't know if that
 makes a difference or not.<br />
<br />
Other .avi clips import normally and work perfectly. This is the only one giving me trouble. Also, under Properties: General, for File Type, all clips except for this one read: Video&nbsp;Clip (.AVI). However this file which won't import properly reads: Video Clip
 (.avi). It is lowercase as opposed to uppercase; again I don't know if that matters or not.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much, I appreciate any help at all; this is an important project to me.</blockquote>
=========================================<br />
FWIW...just because WMP plays a file does not insure that it will <br />
be compatible with Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
There are many types of .avi files and some can be problematic.<br />
<br />
Installing a codec package may clear this up for you but converting <br />
the .avi to the .wmv format before importing into Movie Maker may<br />
be the best idea.<br />
<br />
The following freeware can do the conversion:<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 XBOX app issues SVCHOST.exe high cpu usage</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>i recently did a fresh install of windows 10 after originally upgrading from windows 7. My main issue before was that the xbox app would constantly crash when trying to watch full screen videos. After a fresh a install that bug has now been resolved, but
 now i encounter very high cpu usage when I'm using the apps party chat feature. Both xbox and the SVCHOST.exe in task manager will be using 20% of the cpu usage each causing my desktop temps to shoot up. Suspending and ending SVCHOST.exe causes the XBOX app
 to freeze then close. Is anyone else experiencing this or is there a way around SVCHOST from using so much of my computers resources.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We are sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the steps below and check if it helps in resolving<strong> overheating issues</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Clean air vents and check if air fan is working or not.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Use some software, then, check if your system's fan is working at right speed.<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Do not use your notebook/laptop on a surface that block air vents.<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Thermal pads might be burnt. Try replacing them with new one.<br />
<strong>Step 5:</strong> There might be some fault with the hardware. You can get it checked with professional expert.<br />
<strong>Step 6:</strong> Adjust power settings to your needs. Lower energy consumption will result lower heat generation.
<br />
<strong>Step 7:</strong> Never leave operating laptop with closed lid. This always generates heat inside laptop. You may close lid only if laptop will automatically go into sleep or hibernation mode.<br />
<strong>Step 8:</strong> You may also try installing latest software and drivers from the manufacturer website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding XBOX App freeze, try the methods below and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Please let us know if you're able to continue after trying the above</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model.</li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>In addition to System Imaging, you can backup just your personal files using Backup and Restore, to do that, check out the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/</a><br />

<p>If you want to backup themes, wallpapers and other minor features, Windows Easy Transfer is another option, you can learn more about it
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade.</li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed.</li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications).</li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing.</li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Type: MSCONFIG.</li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</li><li>Click OK.</li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart.</li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>

    <title>SD card reader on Lenovo Z480 not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SD card reader on Lenovo Z480 not working</h2>
                    Hello! (:&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Lenovo Z480 (orginally Windows 7 then updated to Windows 8 64-bit) seem to not be detecting my SD card.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>According to my Device Manager, it says that my Realtek USB 2.0 Card Reader is working.</div>
<div>Looked through the forums for similar problems and tried out the suggested solutions like updating and re-downloading the latest SD card reader driver software from the Realtek site but it is still not working.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you help me with this problem? Thank you (:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>UPDATE (10/10/13)</b></div>
<div>Hi guys! Good news.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After months of attempts to solve this problem, I realised that my driver didn't spoil after all! It was due to the springs/wire being really insensitive!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My solution? Stick something (thin cardboard or paper or the plastic thing that protects your SD cardreader slot) into the slot above non-metal side of the SD card. Or alternatively, try press the SD card down slightly so that the metals can touch.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hope this helps :D</div>
</div>

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
Try the driver download below and let us know if it worked for you:<br />
http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/detail.page?DocID=DS031246<br />
<br />
You could also try uninstalling the card reader through the Device Manager, restarting your computer and letting Windows install it again for you. Be sure to install the above specified driver though.<br />

            <p>Hi Jenny,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable use the card reader. Since you have already tried updating the card reader driver, I woukd suggest that you update the chipset drivers to check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the follwing link, click Select Product. In the sarch box type the laptop model (Z480) and press enter. From the download list, find Chipset and download the Windows 8 drivers.</p>

<p>Do reply if you face further issues. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Missing gdiplus.dll error code</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p><span>I have been using Ccleaner for years and been absolutely delighted with it. I have just updated Windows 10 and the first run of CCleaner worked fine, however when I now try to run the program I get the message that:- C:\WINDOWS\WinSxS\amd64_</span><span>microsoft.windows.gdiplus_6595b64144ccf1df_1.1.10586.20_none_db007f1392e69ef4\gdiplus.dll
 reinstall the program</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally other apps will not run such as Microsoft management console, event viewer, herd protect.</span></p>
<p><span>I ran tweaking.com software to try to repair the problem which gave the following error report:&nbsp;
</span>"Skipping Repair.<br />
Due to a bug in the Windows 10 build 10586 the powershell command used to reinstall the apps and app store instead breaks them and deletes their install folders. Till Microsoft fixes this bug this repair is skipped for this version of Windows.<br />
Current version: 10.0.10586"</p>
<p><span>Is this something Microsoft need to sort out, since it would at least explain why trying to reinstall programs that did work, don't.</span></p>
<p><span>Any help would be appreciated since having spent over 3 hours with a microsoft technician all he could come up with was I needed a clean Win 10 installation, which I would prefer to avoid if possible.</span></p>
<p>
