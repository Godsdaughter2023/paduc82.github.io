<h2>            XBOX not updating account settings</h2>
                    
<p>My credit card billing address has a mistake so I can't purchase anything. When I go to account settings I can edit the billing address and then it says 'account settings saved' but when I go back to check it, it hasn't actually changed. I've tried many
 times. I also tried deleting the credit card information, it also says 'sucessfully deleted' but nothing actually changes. I also tried adding a new credit card and it also says 'successfully added credit card details' but nothing has actually been added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know whats going on, and I can't purchase anything until it is resolved. It doesn't show any error code until I try to purchase something, which just says 'there was a problem purchasing...' or seomthing, which is obvious because the billing address
 is wrong and I can't change it!</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>You should be able to change it in the console.</p>
<p>If it does not work then try clearing your system cache.</p>

<p>Hi jeeustice,<br />
<br />
If clearing your cache and deleting/re-downloading your profile isn't getting the settings to stick once you've changed them, and your unable to make the changes online due to the security proofs being out of date and pending a change then your only other option
 would be contact phone support for your region and they should be able to make these changes for you over the phone.<br />
<br />
Please reach out to them by clicking this link <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us/#0:0:7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> and clicking
<strong>Request a Call</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>The request a call option will only be available if Xbox Suppoort is available in your region, and they are open for business at the time of you clicking the link.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for all the suggested answers, I tried most of the options I could do without phoning support yet.</p>
<p>The problem with my billing address is my ZIP, for some reason whenever I add a credit card it adds an extra character to the front (the first character of my zip is 'G' ) so it adds an extra g at the begining of the zip code to look like 'GG....' and obviously
 the address is therefore wrong.</p>
<p>I tried adding a completely different credit card, this time, the credit card was added but the ZIP is the same as my other card, when I put that zip in, it also added an extra 'G' before the ZIP upon adding. I guess it's taking the billing address from
 somewhere else such as my profile, and in there I can't seem to update it. I will try phoning support if it persists.</p>

    <title>Why are Windows 8 keys not valid for Windows 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rcro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are Windows 8 keys not valid for Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I could understand if Windows 8.1 was a paid update. But it was free. It is nothing more than a service pack update. I imagine MS felt a little heat from Apple because they advertised a completely different feline update as free to take a jab at MS and they
 responded with 8.1. Yet you have all these people with Windows 8 keys that updated to Windows 8.1 and cannot do a simple reset because...</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) they don't have Windows 8.1 media and it is missing files needed</p>
<p>b) If they have a Windows 8 disk, it is incompatible with resetting Windows 8.1</p>
<p>c) they cannot download Windows 8.1 because their key is invalid for 8.1</p>
<p>d) have to do an illegal workaround to download Windows 8.1 to get the reset to work</p>
<p>e) have to have the know how to search, download and create the 8.1 disk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some dope said it's because of the software pirates. Well that makes zero sense. If you have a valid Win 8 key it should work perfectly fine with it's appropriate 8.1 installation/update because the update was, wait for it, FREE. What's to pirate? What's
 the big deal if someone comes from Win 7, Vista, XP and installs 8.1 with a Win 8 key? What's the big deal if they built a computer from scratch and put Windows 8.1 on it with a Windows 8 key? 8.1 is FREE UPDATE FROM THE STORE. The key word there being FREE.
 How does someone pirate something that is FREE if you already own Windows 8? </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are double digit threads in multiple areas with people having incompatibility issues with refreshes and updates due to this issue, and that's just on this forum. That's not even including vendor specific forums and other tech forums. There have been
 ZERO, get that, ZERO valid, informative or relevant answers from MS employees on here as to a solution. There have been a ton of links to useless information. The helpful replies are ones to the trick of starting a valid Win 8 download and stopping it and
 starting a Win 8.1 download. Then having to burn an 8.1 disc and go from there. For people that have no dvd drives, this proves to be a pain. Or they have to go to a usb drive. Regardless, it's a workaround they shouldn't have to do. Heck, one MS employee
 even questioned a person to why they wanted to do a reset. Like it's any of his business. Because I want to. Because I want a clean slate. Because I'm selling it. Because I'm gifting it. Because it's not of your stinkin' business. And creating a new profile
 and deleting an old one as a method of resetting? That's not a solution. That probably just opens doors for admin issues which others have had even when they were the only user ever created. But this strays from the point at hand.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other solution is to get a hold of a Windows 8 disc or do the Win 8 download and get a hold of a drive or put it on a USB stick and then start completely from scratch and go through multiple days of windows updates, and then go through the 8.1 update
 only to leave the next person in the same screwed position should they need to do a reset for whatever reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one of the most amazing FUBARs I have seen and it goes completely unacknowledged as one by Microsoft. I just don't get it. The whole pirating thing just makes no sense to me since the update was FREE and essentially what would have been a service
 pack update in the Windows 7 days. It makes the whole reset feature completely useless for the average user and a complete headache that is time consuming for an above average one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answers anyone? Microsoft employees, care to comment? </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I...map, &nbsp;moderator and wiki editor, &nbsp;and that's what you come up with, bad humor and all? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you own Windows 8, Windows 8.1 is a FREE update from the Windows Store. It is front and center every time you go into it until you update to it. So a .1 update free for all Windows 8 owners is a completely different operating system and renders your Windows
 8 key useless. Makes complete sense. Thank you for so eloquently answering my question. You make complete sense. Can you point me to the rollers emoticon while you're being so helpful?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And last I checked, &nbsp;neither XP, &nbsp;Vista or 7 gave you access to the FREE, &nbsp;that was FREE update to 8.1 in the Windows Store. I tried my old Windows 98 key because that had the number 8 in it, &nbsp;but apparently that didn't work either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that free offer gave you a Windows 7 key. &nbsp;Way to shoot yourself in the foot with that one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that was also based on a limited time frame of buying a Vista machine close to the Windows 7 release.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Try contacting your OEM for the Windows 8 Recovery Media.&nbsp; For a small charge they should be able to supply you with a copy on DVD or USB.&nbsp; This will allow you to reinstall Windows 8 to factory settings as of day one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The above would be the same procedure as if you had corrupted, lost, or replaced, a faulty hard drive, which often happens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My copies of &nbsp;windows 8 are retail. &nbsp;Call me stupid for being an early adopter and trusting in MS to have their ducks in a row. So I should contact Microsoft for this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you guys realize you can't do load 8.1 with an 8 key??? Unless Microsoft finally realized their fubar and corrected things. The only way for us 8 users to download 8 was to open two tabs, &nbsp;one to download 8 and one to download 8.1, then enter your key
 on the 8 download, &nbsp;cancel it and start the 8.1 download. Dumb you can trick your way into the download, but the average user won't k ow how to do this or take the time to research how to do this, &nbsp;and they'll have to start from scratch with 8 and waste a
 ton of their time to go through all the updates to get current again, &nbsp;and then be right back in the same pickle should they need to do it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ad the whole point of the refresh/reset feature was so we didn't have to deal with backups all the time. We backup all of our important files to the cloud or NAS. So now you can reset, &nbsp;reinstall programs and restore files from the cloud. So much easier
 than dealing with manual OS backup and restore. &nbsp;Kinda half the reason for upgrading to 8 outside of the more efficient OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there has pretty much been zero answers given. Just restating the obvious and workarounds for something that shouldn't be a problem in the first place. Not that I don't appreciate the responses, &nbsp;but when the industry writes articles about it being a
 f*****p, &nbsp;and there are double digit threads in this community alone without going to outside forums where there are many more, &nbsp;why should 8 owners have to deal with their OEMS to try and resolve the issue. Why should we have to resort to the old way of image
 backups? More importantly, &nbsp;why is Microsoft (including the moderator above) &nbsp;just ignoring the actual issue instead of just making Windows 8 keys valid for 8.1 and call it a day. &nbsp;The simplest solution, and it's being ignored like it's a non-issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So they finally listened? Will have to give it a try tomorrow night. Trying to sell my two old computers that I updated so the new owners wouldn't have to sit through hours of updates, &nbsp;and I've been stuck sitting on them because I couldn't do a reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I do a reset and utilize the the files from the download, &nbsp;will future resets require the media again or will the system retain those missing files?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And thank you very much for the quick responses. My pain in the **** replies aside, &nbsp;it is much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            The last drivers ever released for your scanner were for XP. You should look for a new scanner which is Windows 7 friendly as HP will never release drivers for it..

<p>Chances are that your friend has set their Xbox back to Home console. This will remove your rights to the games.</p>

            I would recommend not to try to use his account anymore. This is against the rules and ToS and can result in both of your accounts being banned. Setting different Xbox's as your Home Xbox is only meant for use with family in the same household. Sharing
 your account information so a friend can log on and play your games can result in a ban, so if you're having issues now, I would take this as a possible warning and stop trying to use his account and vice versa before something may happen to your accounts.
 Good luck.

            Looks like your console is no longer the home console of your friend's account. Having said that you shouldn't share your credentials. You can ask your friend to login to your console and make it his home console, and you can do the same on his console.

<h2>            Failure Security Options</h2>
                    My computer started freezing all of a sudden. No new programs installed. Ran a complete scan using two diffrent anti viruses, checked for adware, and mal ware. All clean. I noticed sometimes after it freezes that if I wait an hour, it will start working
 again. If I hit CTR, Alt, Del, nothing happens for a while, then screen goes black and I get an error message with the title:&nbsp; Logon Process has Failed to Create the Security Options Dialog.&nbsp; Then on the same box it will say Failure-Security Options, and I
 can only click OK. Then it goes back to my desktop screen and its stays frozen. Then only way I can get it to stop is by hitting th epower switch on the back of the computer. What can I do to solve this?

===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be
<br />
sure to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>For even better and more efficient checking :</strong><br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk -
<br />
if you do not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same 32 or 64 bit and
<br />
they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the physical disks
<br />
cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />

<h2>            Can not download new maps Eskalation Pack 2</h2>
                    

<p>I can not download new maps Eskalation Pack 2 (RUS) Upload up to 99% and says it can not download the map. My account has been registered in the U.S., more than one year, but decided to go to Russia (I live in it) and buy a card in Russian,
 I also play in Russian. But I was a fiasco, the expansion of ports has not helped in my router and created a new ID does not help. I do not know what to do, I am suffering already from the 10 th of this month. Today I received a letter from Microsoft, that
 the rest of my points with the remainder of 1040 translated into Russian. The fact that I bought the cards for 1200 points of silence. Please help me to get the card or refund my points. Thank you</p>

<p>I have the answer to my problem. When I moved from U.S. accounts to their country of Russia. I went, but the confirmation e-mail was not that my account had been transferred to Russia. But I bought these cards. A few days later I received a letter that my
 account is currently in Russia. Probably due to the delay, and it happened. But who's to blame and who will reimburse me 1200 points</p>

<h2>            Windows Tablet Auto Rotate Settings Missing</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded my tablet to Windows 10. Impressed with the OS but not with the fact that some of my tablet features such as the home widow and automatic screen orientation no longer work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I popped into a local retail store and tried a new tablet loaded with Windows 10 and it had different settings options to my tablet. There was a screen rotation on / off and the windows button worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the windows 10 free upgrade have some settings missing ?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an Ipad and Apple upgrades always make the tablet work more efficiently and dont result in things no longer working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help please</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;for&nbsp;posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Since when are you facing this issue, did this issue occur&nbsp;just after you upgraded to Windows 10 or&nbsp;due to a driver/software&nbsp;update?</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of you&nbsp;tablet?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Did you check the settings in your trablet&nbsp;from the action center?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recently upgraded to Windows 10, I would suggest you check the settings in your tablet&nbsp;since&nbsp;by default the auto rotate is set to
<strong>Off</strong>. The steps may differ according to the tablet, however, try these steps and check if you can change the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To go to Action center, swipe from the right side of the screen and find the option
<strong>Rotation Lock. </strong>Change it from <strong>On </strong>to <strong>Off.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</span></p>

            <p>Hi I think the Microsoft Support Engineer has miss read the question. My tablet (Tesco Connect 7) suffers the same problem after upgrading to Windows 10. The auto screen rotation is not working and the Screen Lock option in the Display Settings is non existent,
 there is no screen lock option so I cannot turn it on. The drivers for the Kionix kxcj9 Accelerometer are loaded and the device is working properly, any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>You did not READ the problem here. There is no option in the action center or anywhere else within the windows OS to enable\disable auto rotate. This is a Nextbookup but&nbsp;Flexx 10. I thought I messed up but, nobody's tablet is working properly it &nbsp;seems.
 Hasty Windows rollout!</p>

<p><span>EDIT: Also, was I supposed to get the "Legend" achievement from that too? The one that says to defeat a Legendary Dragon. I didn't get the achievement.</span></p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Was he attacking you the second time? He was not suppose to be attacking you the second time&nbsp;you meet&nbsp;since that is when you are suppose to&nbsp;receive the shout.&nbsp;Anyways, I also left the soul cairn after retreiving the elder scroll. It wasn't until much later
 that i found out that i had to go back into the soul cairn and retreive the shout from the dragon. So i went back and he was perched on a rock right across from the castles entrance (where you first meet senaras mother)&nbsp;I must have completely missed him the
 first time after i left the castle in the soul cairn.&nbsp; I only had to defeat him once though. So what happens is that you defeat him the first time and collect the elder scroll. Then he is suppose to be waiting for you outside the castle entrance on a rock
 and that is when he will talk to you and give you the shout. I think you might have attacked him by accident or maybe you ran into a glitch.</p>

                    Please advise when the issue of the pop up - Your data controlled by you - will be rectified.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is getting very frustrating every time I open a document it pops up.&nbsp; &nbsp;At the moment I am opening many of my documents daily and having to go through the
 process around 30+ times a day.

            Hi, I read what to do on another thread and it worked. &nbsp;Go into either, outlook, excel or word and under your account sign out then sign back in again. Once you have done this it will appear once more on opening something then it goes away the next time
 you do it. No issues now, good luck

</p><p>According to this article here, your games should be available after you have signed into your Facebook account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)">How does Gameroom work?</span><br />
 but we'll consider it based on player demand. </span><br />
<strong>all of your Facebook games automatically appear in Gameroom with your existing levels and rewards</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Taken from:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-gameroom/gameroom-info-support/1931950150353262/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-gameroom/gameroom-info-support/1931950150353262/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>So, once you sign into your Facebook account, you should be able to see all of your games and progress. Is this the case?</p>

<h2>            Combining Pages in XPS Viewer</h2>
                    One of the great features of MDI was the ability to combine pages from several files into one file.&nbsp; I have not found a way to do that for .xps files.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a way?

<h3> &#35;rebeccam  say:</h3>
<h2>            PS&#47;2 keyboard with USB adapter not working with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have a Fellowes ergonomic PS/2 keyboard that I want to use with my new Acer computer. Unfortunately my Acer does not come with a PS/2 port, so I purchased the PS/2 (female) to USB (male) adapter. I have tried a number of suggestions and none of them have
 worked. I have tried unplugging all the USB devices and restarting my computer with only the PS/2 to USB keyboard plugged in. The lights on the keyboard flashed but it didn't allow me to login after pressing any of the keys. I have tried Uninstalling the Unknown
 USB Device driver and restarting, that didn't work. I'm afraid of uninstalling all the USB controllers because I don't want to make matters worse. I also have not changed any of the registry keys or BIOS settings for fear of making my new computer a huge,
 expensive paperweight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to make my PS/2 keyboard work with my new system? &nbsp;Please leave DETAILED instructions and please only respond if you are truly experienced with this issue because I'm not going to turn my computer into a huge, expensive paperweight because
 JohnDoe2 says to TRY this. Thank you very much for your assistance.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forums. Sorry, to know that you are facing this issue. This issue may occur if the correct drivers are not installed for the keyboard and mouse or if USB controllers are corrupted.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to remove and reconnect the USB mouse and keyboard when Windows boots. If issue persist, try connecting the mouse and keyboard to another USB port and check.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Follow these steps.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You need to install the Windows 8.1 drivers/software for the “keyboard and mouse” from the device manufacturer website and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you don’t have Windows 8.1 drivers, you may follow the steps to install the drivers in Windows 8 compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on <strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box <strong>
‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down menu.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click on <strong>‘Apply’</strong> and click <strong>‘OK’</strong> and run the file to install it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue persists, you may try to run “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter to diagnose and fix the issue. Refer this article:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>What if a wired device isn't installed properly?</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3:</strong> To resolve this issue, install the Windows RT, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012 update rollup 2845533, or install the hotfix that is described in this article.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to determine what's happening on your PC, and to provide you the appropriate solution, is it stuck on a certain percentage? Or an update error perhaps? If yes, what is the specific error showing on the screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be helpful if you could send us a screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your reply.</p>

            It hangs on the blue window screen, i.e. the black screen with a small blue window picture.&nbsp; There are no spinning balls.&nbsp; I assume this is on the first restart.&nbsp;

<p>With that being said, since there's no error message displayed at all, then it could be that your PC is still applying the update. The process could take several minutes or hours.</p>
<p>Now, you also mentioned that you ran the diagnostics, may we know what diagnostic tool did you use? Is it the

Windows Update Troubleshooter</a>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, if you haven't tried that tool, and your PC takes to too long to boot than the usual, then we suggest that you press hold the power button of your PC until it completely turns off, then turn it back on, and run the

<h2>            No Sound After Windows 10 Upgrade - tried all available methods</h2>
                    <p>I'm desperately in need of help!!! The no sound issue after windows 10 seems to be nothing new but I can't find a solution that works for me! I have the realtek high definition audio as the audio device and there is neither sound coming out of the speakers
 nor through the headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the methods below and exhausted all the options, still nothing works:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've googled numerous times and spent 2+ hours going through postings and Q&amp;As;
</li><li>I've tried <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">updating the audio driver</span> and rebooted as required, initially it did get an update which gave me hope, but still no sound afterwards; I kept trying a few times to make sure it is truly up to date;</li><li>I've tried <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">uninstalling and re-installing the driver</span> like over 5 times (not to mention I've rebooted my PC 4+ times even though I did not get a message requiring a reboot); I doubled checked that the same version
 of the driver got re-installed every single time, so the updated driver (with a June '15 date) should be up to date for real;</li><li>I've tried changing the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">default audio format</span>, I've tried every single one that is available, didn't work;</li><li>I've tried using the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sound problem troubleshooter</span> 3 times, no problem found.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I am no expert on PC so I can't tell what the problem is, the audio devices are shown as working properly and no problem has been detected but I get absolutely no sound, not even a tiny bit when I turn the volume up to 100, and I do not get any sound using
 the headphone either (I didn't think it would work anyway but I've seen posts where some people mention headphone works for them but not the internal speakers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just want to vent, no need to read the rest if you can help. Any help is appreciated!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've upgraded to Windows 10 once a week ago and had an issue with internet so I reverted back to Windows 7. I found the solution and decided to give it another go, so I upgraded again yesterday. I really don't want to have to revert back to Windows 7 again
 although I do love Win 7, this is ridic! I've had high hopes for Win 10 and this is such a let down, it's like one problem after another, although these problems seem to be floating around for awhile now even before the mass upgrade period, there are no solutions
 and even finding solutions online isn't easy. I really hope I can get this resolved and stick with Win 10. I guess I'll revert back to Win 7 if I can't work out this issue by the end of this weekend, this is such an exhausting and frustrating process, it is
 killing me!!!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>correcting errors in the volume bitmap - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> indigonightowl  say:</h3>
<h2>            correcting errors in the volume bitmap</h2>
                    <p>I recently allowed the automatic updates to run on our Win 7 Professional Media centre. On restart it launched straight into a chkdsk (and because I walked away while it started up, not expecting any issues, I missed the 15 second opportunity to avoid the
 check). It took about an hour and a half to run stages 1-3. After completing stage 3, it is now more than 30 hours into "correcting errors in the volume bitmap" scrolling on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MC has 2 x 2TB NTFS hard drives. (I can't give you much more info than that because I can't get in to check specs properly, but the computer was custom built about 3 years ago and the hard drives are pretty full.) The start up disk is partitioned into
 a 500GB startup plus a 1.5Tb data partition. It is the second 2Tb data drive that was indicated as the drive being checked, not the startup disk. The check found loads of registry errors and issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read what I can find online and there are mixed opinions about whether it is safe or recommended to interrupt the process. So I would like to ask:</p>
<p>1) Should I let it continue? I can't tell if the process has stalled. There is no error message.</p>
<p>2) Realistically, how long can I expect it to take on a 2TB HDD?</p>
<p>3) I didn't start this through a cmd window, so IF I should stop it, HOW do I stop it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any advice.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. We are glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to inform you that, it is advisable to let the check disk process running (check disk should not be interrupted). This process may take place involuntarily,
 if there is any inconsistency or improper shut down to the hard drive. Moreover, the time taken by check disk depends upon the size of the disk and the amount of data that it contains.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The only way to stop check disk process is to restart the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.

    <title>How do I unsync a third party email program so that all my emails are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> remingtonjohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I unsync a third party email program so that all my emails are downloaded in the background&#63;</h2>
                    I am using IncrediMail as my default email program, however since I bought a<u> new computer</u> with Windows 8 and upgraded to Windows 8.1, all my emails are synced and when I go to open an email, the program says syncing and
<b>spins</b> and <b>spins</b> and <b>spins</b> and <b>spins</b>&nbsp;and <b>spins</b> and
<b>spins</b> and <b>spins</b> and <b>spins</b>&nbsp;until finally it opens up. I have an&nbsp;older computer which crashed and before it did that, I was able to download ALL my emails in the background without any problems and open them up whenever I went to IncrediMail...
 Why can't Windows 8.1 just allow IncrediMail download all the emails without having to sync all the emails... This is very frustrating...<br />
<br />
I went into my gmail server and deleted all the emails in the inbox because they sat there for several weeks... To my surprise, the damn emails were synced to my IncrdiMail program without anything being downloaded. When I deleted all the emails in my Gmail
 inbox, lo and behold, all the emails were deleted! What's up with that? Why doesn't Windows 8.1 allow all emails to be downloaded in the background to my computer? I only have my PC, I don't have any other devices that I need to synchronize my email program
 with, it's just plain and simple. How do I configure Windows 8.1 to allow IncrediMail to download ALL emails from Gmail in the background without synchronizing anything?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I looked at some other responses where I's supposed to go into the Microsoft Charm area and press "Windows I" - Not sure if this is the letter "L" or the number "1" (one) or a vertical "Bar" or capital letter "I" (eye)...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I went into "Settings", then "Other PC Settings" there's nothing there of any interest...</div>

<ul>
<li><span>Does the network works correctly using any other means? Like Wi-Fi.</span>
</li><li><span>Did you try the steps provided in the previous response?</span> <span>&nbsp;</span>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Try the methods mentioned below and check:</span> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span><span> </span></strong><span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>C</span><span>onnect the modem directly to the </span><span>computer</span><span>, without using router and
</span><span>then </span><span>check.</span> <span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> </span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Check with different LAN cable and check.</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If you still don't get any lights on the LAN connection, it may be the card is bad.<br />
</span></p>
