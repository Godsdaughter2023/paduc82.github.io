<h2>            Call to UK won&#39;t connect</h2>
                    <p>Hello--I have purchased a subscription for 30 minutes worth of calls to the UK on mobiles or landlines. However, when I try to call the UK number I need to reach, it just rings and rings and says "connecting" before dropping out. I tried sending an SMS message
 and that never went through. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I am doing incorrectly? Do I need "credit" in addition to a "subscription"? This is very confusing, and&nbsp; I really need to make this call.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much. </p>
<p>

 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Skype subscriptions does not cover SMS sending. You need to have Skype Credits to be able to send an SMS through Skype.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the call is not connecting, this usually indicates a connection issue. Make sure that you using a stable connection. You might want to check

<p>
</p><p>Additionally, there are telecommunication providers that restrict calls from unknown servers to protect their subscribers. It is advisable that you set up caller ID. You can use

<h2>            Problem when using Nokia C7 for PC to connect to the internet</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>-I have a Nokia C7 phone, a PC using Windows XP SP3 OS with Ovi suite installed, a 3G SIM card.</p>
<p>-I want to use my phone to be an internet modem for my PC. The phone has been switched to 3G mode.</p>
<p>-The problem is speed of internet connection, it's only 460.8kbps instead of 14.4Mbps (or a few lower) on my 3G network, 3G signal is strong in my place﻿.</p>
<p>-Please help me to improve the speed in this case.</p>
<br />

            1. You cannot reach 14.4Mbps, because the phone's 3G receiver cannot reach that speed, having only a max of 10.2Mbps.<br />
<br />
2. Internet transfer speed is only up to that level because that is the maximum speed Windows would accept data transfer via USB through Ovi Suite software. If you want to exceed such speeds, you would have to use either alternative tethering software if any
 exists, or to make your phone a WiFi hotspot via Joikuspot software and connect using that.

<p><span><span>Hello everyone,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Another possibility is that you have disabled the built in pop-up blocker, but a third party add-on is still blocking your pop-ups. Follow these steps to test your
 browser add-ons:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 any add-on</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>CTRL

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Internet

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Now all add-ons are disabled in Internet Explorer, test to see if the same problem occurs without add-ons. If the problem is fixed then the next step is to enable
 the add-ons one by one to find which is causing the problem.</span></span></p>

 Add-ons</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 the first disabled add-on</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enable</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Surf

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Close<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Internet

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Internet
 Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If Internet Explorer still opens/works correctly, the add-on you enabled is good to stay. Repeat the enabling process for the next disabled add-on and continue this
 process until the problem returns. Then the last enabled add-on will need to be disabled/uninstalled/updated to avoid further problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Removing detected items takes forever</h2>
                    
<p>This is for the offically released version.<br />
The suspected items(total of 7)&nbsp;are just .rar and non-running .exe files. I set action to REMOVE and click on Apply actions. What follow seems to be about half an hour of full scanning, i.e. heavy disk activities. How can deleting 7 files turns into half an
 hour of disk crunching?</p>

            Since the detections are inside compressed archives, that adds overhead to the action. Each infection/threat has a set of actions defined for checking other locations, the registry, etc. in order to clean the threat. So, 7 threats can certainly cause a
 bunch of activity. I don't know that a bug submission is valid, but you can submit the files via the portal:<br />

    <title>Password Expiry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ash8989  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password Expiry</h2>
                    We have a customer who requested we set their password expiry to 90 days, we set this up via powershell and by all means it works for everyone except one user, this is the same user who always had to reset her password every 30 days regardless of what
 policy was in place (it was previously set to never expire) so pretty much from setting up her account she has to reset her 365 password every 30 days regardless of how we try to change this. Any ideas?

            <p>Hi Ash8989,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run the following PowerShell command to set the password expiration date for a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set-MsolPasswordPolicy -DomainName &lt;string&gt; -NotificationDays &lt;string&gt; -ValidityPeriod &lt;string&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>ValidityPeriod - Specifies the length of time that a password is valid before it must be changed. A null value indicates the default value of 90 days will be used.</span></li><li><span>NotificationDays - Specifies the number of days before a user receives notification that their password will expire. A null value indicates the default of 14 days will be used.</span></li></ul>
<p>After setting the password expiration date, run the following command <span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
to retrieve the values associated with the Password Expiry window or Password Expiry Notification window for a tenant or specified domain.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Get-MsolPasswordPolicy -DomainName &lt;string&gt;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the above commands to see the outcome. If the issue still persists, you can provide us with the affected user’s tenant information, see that we can check the account. To protect your privacy, I’ve sent the private message to collect the tenant
 information. Please click <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/newmessage?messageId=a20ea8a8-5e4b-451c-8585-88f5404d042e&amp;threadId=3498c2d1-6bbe-4215-9511-6201ec4c14d7">

<h2>            I have gone through innumerable PCs, OS, hard drives etc. in past 1.5 years common thread seems to be corrupted built in admin</h2>
                    <p>That is identifies as built in admin "S-1-21-1955630605-950701974-2966414360-1001". When searched on an Acer Aspire running Win 8 64 but, search shows the following, " search-ms:displayname=Search%20Results%20in%20Computer&amp;crumb=location:C%3A%5C&amp;crumb=location:D%3A%5C&amp;crumb=location:cdc%3A%2F%2F{S-1-21-1955630605-950701974-2966414360-1001}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lost many PCs a security problem that seems-by consensus of those few who could figure it out-to registry keys, programs, files, BIOS, device managers, disk management with one item in common. The corrupted files were all elevated beyond my capacity
 to remove- or beyond the capacity of any Anti-Virus/anti-spyware programs ( Avast, Microsoft Security Essentials Comodo, Bit Defender, Kaspersky Pure 3.0, &nbsp;Norton, MacAfee, Trend Micro, Panda, .... ad nauseum); remote support ( 4 separate paid level 2 MSFT
 techs, Support.com, Dell, Samsung, HP, Norton, PCeSupport (biggest waste of $$) Tools that have included; HijackThis, Hitman Pro, Combofix, Spybot, Adware, Rkill, TDSSKiller etc.); anti-malware; MBAM, Super-anti malware, &nbsp;Defender; Registry repair tools; Eusing,
 HiJackThis, , ... and so on, and so on. I have had at least 6 PCs 4 running Windows 7, 2 running Windows 8 taken to highest rated local PC repair shop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has cost a fortune in time and money and though I feel like I am fairly close to knowing the reason for the problem, I am no closer to knowing how to keep it from continuing to happen. The few details that have emerged throughout all of this are:</p>
<p>1) It seems to immediately infect any re-installed OS, new hard drive, and new PC. I had hoped to avoid this by switching to Macs but I needed Windows for the software I use professionally. When I boot camped Windows onto the MacBook, that was corrupt in
 the first day it was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Realizing that this had to be something so basic and fundamental in the process of starting a new PC or OS I avoided any internet connection, flash drive or any other possible common denominator I could think of. From my limited technical knowledge, the
 closest I think any program or machine has come to identifying the root cause were the Support.com tech guy who inferred by the behavior of machine(s) that ir was likely the result of a Trojan Horse Attack that he thought was a variant of &nbsp;SireFef. I use inferred
 rather than discovered since all infected PCs seem to block internet access that have downloadable tools that might seem like a threat. Paranoid sounding? undoubtedly, however I will get access blocked results when I try to navigate to sites like Bleepin Computer.
 Pop-ups blocking "Run" buttons, and programs with extensions like .jpg rather than .exe. Early in this process when I knew less than the little I do now, I came across a setting that stated something to the effect, "allow PC to continue broadcasting even when
 internet is turned off/system is shut down". When I saw it originally it seemed as if it must have been referring to something far beyond my technical grasp. Though it still does seem that way, it sounds far more suspiciously malevolent after having spent
 a few thousand dollars on PCs and cures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the many security programs I've tried to use actually had isolated the programs/registry keys that were most commonly infected and identified the infection as MyDoom. SpyBot S&amp;D's free software has been as effective as any of the much pricier alternatives
 but runs into the same problem that stonewalls all the programs that have located issue, i.e. insufficient security privileges to remove or quarantine the infected files/registry keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I have a very limited understanding of the Command syntax, I have tried to follow to the letter any viable suggestion for removing these threats but run into the same "insufficient permissions" problems that are usually the first symptoms of this
 infection. They syntax of the registry keys does not permit modification or deletion of keys that show as corrupt. &nbsp;In the 18 months I have been wrestling with this issue I have seen similar questions go from non-existenent to overwhelming on Windows tech
 support forums. The answers offered by Windows techs never seem to work in real world, e.g. they do not account for grayed out choices, having normal permission granting privileges,&nbsp;read-only, ownership blocked by corrupt NT/System level admin profiles that
 seem to demonically counter every move I attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So given all of the above- should anyone have made it all the way through- I'd truly appreciate any helpful suggestions on what to do- if not retroactively by helping me re-gain use of more than a dozen PCs than prospectively to keep any new OS or machines
 from getting infected? I have been trying to find if there are consumer level hosted platforms that run virtually, literally and figuratively, everything I can possibly keep from any Windows hard drive, hopefully that would include the OS, 3rd party software
 applications as well as data but I'm not familiar enough with the lingo to put a name to what I am seeking. I guess a hosted or cloud service that is Saas/PaaS (unsure if one alternative allows for 3rd party software or not). Sites that I have attempted to
 glean info from seem to already be geared to an IT person who is working with enterprise level software (and budgets). I'm not sure if Azure is similar to what I'm seeking and frankly do not have a very high opinion of the process of getting to a knowledgeable
 person in Windows support. The techs I've encountered after paying the annual support fee ranged from helpful (but unable to fix problem) to unhelpful (and unable to fix problem) to arrogant (and unable to fix problem). I'm not just singling out Windows techs
 but most of the techs who I have paid for their expert services (generally running the same free A/V software I could have run and when nothing leapt out, proclaimed PC fixed. (Since then I've read quite a bit about the infected files either appearing as or
 actually being Windows system files. e.g. CSRSS,exe, $RECYCLE.BIN, Autorun.inf) . Again apologies for length. Cannot figure how to attach logs since this is being written on MacBook. But will provide if possible,</p>

            <p>What specific software do you need for professional use?&nbsp; Looking for a way to still use that, but move to another platform other than a PC seems like your best possible direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newer Windows RT based systems operate on an entirely different ARM based processor and don't allow any access at the levels where you are having your problems.&nbsp; The key will be whether the applications you need are available, since Microsoft Office
 (Word, Excel, OneNote) is included, but only tiled applications can otherwise operate on these systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of what is causing this, it's clear that your situation is not functional for use of a Windows PC based&nbsp;operating system, so you should avoid it if at all possible.&nbsp; Since your MAC apparently continues to operate and you haven't indicated issues
 with it, it seems more useful to leave the Windows PC world behind completely&nbsp;in your case.</p>

            <p>The fact that multiple tools apparently fail to detect and resolve whatever you are encountering is interesting and perhaps telling. Of all of the programs you've listed, if the problem is indeed due to Sirefef or ZeroAccess, we know that Hitman Pro is able
 to resolve it.</p>
<p>More curious to me is what are you doing or what is it about your environment that every Windows OS is affected so quickly. Is the problem, perhaps, with the software that you are installing in common to all copies of Windows?</p>
<p>Have you replaced your router? </p>
<p>In all of the details you've provided, the only thing that stands out is the mention that security sites are blocked as are sites for downloading security software and tools. That is typically associated with ZeroAcess, but ZA/Sirefef does not spread like
 a worm to other machines. It requires you to allow it to infect the machine in most cases, and in rare cases it arrives via a drive-by infection.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to read that you have had a series of poor support experiences, but it surprises me that all of those experiences failed to identify the root cause, particularly the "highest rated local repair shop." If you paid for a service or contract, then
 you should be demanding that they prove that the problem has been resolved.</p>

<p>I tried to respond as I have the same problem. 2 years now. I can't complete what I want to say as I'm being controlled and lost all the info I wanted to say. I will reply next week when I have access to a computer that Is not infected. This is more than
 a worm or Trojan.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp; I have been without a PC obviously for awhile now. I have a new one now. OK I have in the past year started over with a new PC. Router and Network Company. I am on Satellite if that has anything in common to you. It took less than 2 weeks for me to
 start over with the same problem. I do know that there</p>
<p>is commands in almost every file in my pc and I am running with a downgraded version of windows. I bought Windows 8 but the recovery in my control&nbsp;panel is for Windows 7. Also there is a portion of Vista series in my PC. I know there are preload commands
 that install with your new set up of windows. New,</p>
<p>reset, restore, refresh etc. I am still trying to figure out how to stop the problem but it seems that someone is watching as my PC is controlled when I am typing to Microsoft or my security company. My mouse is uncontrollable. It starts with the Preloads,
 then scripting is involved in most files. I don't think I have any&nbsp;good certificates as they have also been tampered with. It seems to be dependant on media, Bluetooth, DCom as they have made me a server and I have no control of how many users are getting
 copies of my PC and personal info. Registry keys are also important and they link to you so no matter what password you use or what security you use there is always a copy of everything you have done on your PC.</p>
<p>You are rotated with at least 3 other users so you don't really know what version of windows you are using. So first preloads that are embedded into PC. HKEY with linked accounts on S-1-15, S-1-18, S-1-19, S-1-20&nbsp; S-1-21 and with the standard numbers that
 go with those Registries plus the Link that connects it to you. Network adapter ras very important as seems to be the only one I can't disable or uninstall. There is 3 groups and then users that are in each group. I think you get the master user connected
 to you first and when you have them set up you are rotated with the other accounts so you are personally setting each one up yourself. I've only figured that part out the past 6 months. They use your credentials in as many ways as they can so all users look
 like they are yourself. Local, Local User, User, Administrator, Owner, Administrators, your personal name in the opposite case. All small case plus all large case and mixed. You have no privacy at all. Even my email is being checked or sent to another as one
 of the user is you and the other is me. In the exact words as that. I am you. They hide and block the scans and also now are running from cds on my pc. I don't have a dvd drive on this pc. Only Sandisk. Also installed a printer on my pc but I don't have one
 installed. The only way I can think of to get rid of the intruders is to eliminate all accounts then block all access to your pc. Then remove the preloads and scripting. This is a problem because they do run in elevated levels and anything I have tried has
 been revoked. They have also changed the standard scripts. ex; system could be sy. I have seen many files but not all will back up on my sandisk as I am denied access. Also I'm not a tech but have been learning a lot as it's frustrating to not be able to use
 your pc the way you would like to. I have had to change all of my credit cards etc. and cannot do anything that gives away all of your info as I'm worried about Identity theft. If anyone finds this helpful please let me know as I'm still fighting with as my
 grandchildren say "the aliens in my PC". They now call me Nanny WhewWhew. lol</p>

<p>Tanya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your issue as Steve mentioned isn't really&nbsp; aren't due to an attack, they are simply misunderstanding the relatively complex design of a modern Windows operating system, its underlying filing system (files,&nbsp;folders and permissions) and the configuration
 and operation of various programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that much of this seems very confusing to most people, but that's simply a side effect of the increasingly complex operating system that Windows has become, partially in order to provide better security and partially to provide for the "extras" that
 you mentioned.&nbsp; Though you may not want these yourself, the simple fact is that to allow others to have them, the support required to make them operate must exist within all systems of a specific Windows version.&nbsp; This isn't really any different than in previous
 versions, there are simply more of them and some of them may be more visible to users than they were in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other cases such as your issues with email, I suspect these are simply changes to the interface that don't make sense to you.&nbsp; For example, the statement that "my email account has a you and a me as me has sent emails to you that were sent by someone
 else first."&nbsp; I suspect that you are using an email program provided by Yahoo! that recently changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask is because one of my cousins' was confused by this same recent change to Yahoo! Mail, since rather than listing your own name or email address as it used to, this has been replaced with either "you" or sometimes "me" in the "from" or "to"
 columns.&nbsp; I can see that the programmers thought this would be both easier to fit on screen as well as simpler to understand, but instead it has simply added confusion for those who don't catch the reasoning&nbsp;behind the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go nit-picking through everything else&nbsp;you've listed, but like Steve, I think it's better simply to state that nothing you've listed seems truly strange to me, just not obvious to someone without our technical background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'll look at my first post in response to ilovemsft, that was intended to offer an alternative to someone who obviously doesn't understand the technical aspects of their computer and so might be better off using something else.&nbsp; Whether or not any of
 that other person's issues were real, the confusion they have and thus the unease this creates in using their PC means that it can never be an effective tool, regardless of whether the current apparent&nbsp;problems are temporarily "fixed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your posts I feel you are experiencing the same basic issue, so my recommendation would be similar.&nbsp; Rather than fighting with the complexity of the full Windows PC, you are likely to be far more comfortable working within the simpler operating environment&nbsp;of
 the newer tablet or convertible laptop like designs that have become available.&nbsp; This will depend on whether you need any programs beyond a web browser, email, the most common Office apps of Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OneNote and others which are&nbsp;available
 from the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I see that you already mentioned a tablet above, so what doesn't that tablet do that you require and possibly we can guide you to a more capable convertible model that does do these things?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>

<h2>            sync issue, only one error</h2>
                    i have a samsung black.&nbsp; my computer runs windows vista and windows mobile device center.<br />
syncing takes a really long time, seems to be around 5 min without much happening.&nbsp; i always get one error tat the end that shows: detail this server could not be reached. this can be caused bye temporary network conditions.&nbsp; this leads me to think that syncing
 should take much shorter than that bc right now it's just outlook emails and contact (no music or anything else).&nbsp; does anyone know wuts going on?<br />

<p>See the other topics about that at the insider parts of this community.</p>
<p>It's as far as I know an issue with the RS2 insider fast rings builds and some older graphiccards/GPUs.</p>
<p>A solution could be to use a standard Microsoft driver, that at least did solve it for some insiders.</p>

<h2>            Onenote crashes when browsing OneDrive&#47;Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently OneNote 2013&nbsp;began to crash when&nbsp;I open it. I googled and mostly found information about deleting the sync cache, which I have done. OneNote will open again now, but if I try to open any notebook on SkyDrive for Business or Office 365 it will immediately
 crash again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to just browse the SharePoint site or SkyDrive location via OneNote and it crashes immediately as well (so I haven't even opened a notebook at this point but it is still crashing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to sign out/sign in, open notebook via browser, etc and they all cause OneNote to crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the event log error:</p>
<span>

<p>
</p><p>One thing I forgot to also mention was that I attempted to do an uninstall/reinstall as well about&nbsp;4 weeks ago when the problem originally occurred. This didn't help but after another day or two with no other changes by myself (including no other windows
 updates)&nbsp;OneNote began to work again. This only lasted for about 2 weeks and I began to reproduce this problem again.</p>

            Since you didn't give much info I will try, go into <em><strong>Settings&nbsp; Update/security&nbsp; Updates&nbsp; Recovery
</strong></em>and you will see <strong>go back to Win8.1 </strong>now that only works if it's been less than 30 days since you upgraded to Win10, now if you are on the Preview build you will need to use the&nbsp;restore media that you made before installing the
 Preview build. not sure what you mean by "reset" Windows10.

            <p>Hi Shirley,</p>
<p><br />
This situation is a notification that your definitions are obsolete and need to be updated OR that it has been a while (too long) since you last ran a scan or both (or some problem causing MSE to think one or the other or both are true even if it's a false
 alarm).&nbsp; So the first question would be, when you open MSE and look at the Home Page, which of the two (or both) is the cause for the notification.</p>
<p><br />
Please check your system clock to make sure it is correct (even a few minutes can matter - but I've seen it say 1978 or 2286 for the year). Resync it with the internet clock. Then reboot and see if that resolves things.&nbsp; If it needs to be changed and keeps
 happening, change the CMOS battery on the motherboard as that's almost always the cause of a system clock problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the reason it says you are unprotected is because updates are outdated, please see the following compliments of Stephen Boots - MVP:

<p>If you are having problems with MSE not updating - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What operating system and service pack?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure to review this post: Check list for installing Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try uninstalling and re-installing MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that fails to resolve the problem, open an email support case:</p>

<p>If it says the reason you are unprotected is because scans are outdated, please check out the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using CCleaner, please see the following compliments of Le Boule:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Piriform has programmed it for some reason to remove part of the MSE History files and it's deleting the files MSE checks to determine the last time a scan was conducted. This file removal has no effect on the antimalware protection provided by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open CCleaner Applications Tab, then Under Windows uncheck MS Antimalware...that should prevent CCleaner from deleting the MS Antimalware scanning history files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per suggestion of MartinHampton you may also need to uncheck MS Management Console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may need to run another quick scan and reboot the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**********************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you use Advanced System Care? If so, see the following compliments of ahaap:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update ASC to the most recent version which resolves most of the problems. If not, continue with the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open ASC, in the upper right corner, click More, Settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scroll to Quick Care, Privacy Sweep, go to Windows, uncheck MS Management Console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scroll to Deep Care, Privacy Sweep, go to Windows, uncheck MS Management Console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If using ASC Pro, you may also need to revise the “Auto Scan” settings in a similar fashion.
</p>
<p>Run another Quick scan with MSE to repopulate the logs and that should do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If using ASC and convinced ASC is the issue but the above didn’t help, check with ASC support for help:

 I am not given the prompt option to log in with my address and password. I knew my acct was not empty, so I logged in on my old computer no problem. Apparently the new Microsoft program has decided it knows more than I do about my accounts!

            <p>I had the same problem. I tried all 3 solutions *Adwcleaner, JRT abd MBAM). They found some malware and I deleted them. But the problem still exists. I am using win 8.1. Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Spreadsheet prints blank&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spreadsheet prints blank&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an issue printing a large spreadsheet that appears to be more than one page, it either comes up blank in preview, PDF and also when printed. This never used to be an issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can print anything else out of excel that is a small spreadsheet i.e. only one page, or has clear page breaks but not a large spreadsheet that I want on one page only (generally A3 print size).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried to check for updates (currently have 14.1.3), made sure the print area is correct and page breaks are fine as well as scaling is adjusted correctly, compatibility between old or new versions are ok. I've even tried saving onto desktop rather
 than server and printing from that or saving as a PDF (comes up blank before I even try printing), I have tried printing from other mac users in the office but same problem exists as well as re-creating the spreadsheet in another workbook and yet the same
 problem persists?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be grateful!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Running on a MacBook with Mac OS X Lion.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks, Toni&nbsp;</div>

            You say that <i><u>saving</u></i> to PDF comes up blank, which means Excel is not outputting anything.
<div><br />
<div>Instead, try using File &gt; <i><u>Print</u></i>. Click the PDF button in the Print dialog and save the PDF. Open that saved file to see exactly what Excel sent to the printer. If that file is empty, then something's wrong with Excel, not your printer driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It appears you have already checked the right things in Excel's interface, so my suggestion is to delete Excel's preferences and try again.</div>
