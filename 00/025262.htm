    <title>Old version of OneNote has supplanted my current Notebooks - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Old version of OneNote has supplanted my current Notebooks</h2>
                    I currently use OneNote 2010 (Windows7) and was cleaning up files. I also found my archived OneNote Notebooks from 2008 and opened some of them to revisit their contents.
<br />
<br />
Hours later I wanted to file something new in OneNote, but when opened OneNote (as I have done trillions of times), I got an empty Notebook saying I had no Notebooks open. Panic ensued, as I had 2 years of information stored there, and NONE of it was there.<br />
<br />
I did find a prompt to open a closed Notebook, and this opened my school file from 2008. But none of my recent work was there.<br />
<br />
Thanks to a friend's help, I was able to do a search using *.one, and I found 512 files (thankfully), from 2008 to the present. I have backed these up on an external drive. Then I shut down the laptop hoping it would revert to the 2010 version of OneNote when
 I rebooted, but this did not happen, and the only Notebook that opens is the old one from 2008.<br />
<br />
I did back up all my data in November, so I have a fairly recent copy of my OneNote work, plus the more recently saved/rescued files. Before I manually try to reconstruct my Notebooks:<br />
1) Why did this happen<br />
2) How do I prevent it from happening again<br />
3) is there anyway to find and restore my intact 2010 Notebooks?<br />
<br />
Please help! Thanks!

            I think you're missing some knowledge about Onenotes file/folder structure.
<div><br />
<div>A Onenote notebook is not a file, it's a folder within the Windows file system. Its name is the name of the notebook, which appears at the top level in the bar at the left of the Onenote window.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Such notebook folder contains one or more Onenote sections, the *.one files. Which are shown as tabs in the Onenote window (under the ribbon).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The trouble starts with the ability of Onenote to open either sections or notebooks.</div>
<div>Using File &gt; Open you can point to a section = *.one file and open it. But this is not a notebook and it will instantly "disappear" after closing Onenote.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To open permantly a Onenote notebook you have to use again File &gt; Open, but point to the notebook's folder and open that folder with all its sections.</div>
<div>Such a correctly opened notebook will stay open after closing Onenote. So will see it open after the next start of Onenote. As it should be.</div>

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice. <br />
<br />
When I got to File &gt; Open, I see one Recently Closed Notebook, which is the old one from 2008 (in Compatibility Mode). There are no other notebooks there.
<br />
<br />
When I go to File &gt; Info &gt; Open Backups, I see <u>folders</u> that contain my recent Notebook
<u>sections</u> (thank goodness they're there!), but I do not see, can can't find a way to make appear, my
<u>entire Notebooks</u> themselves, with all the sections in order as before.<br />
<br />
When I click on one of those folders in Backup, that Notebook section opens. When I click away from it, it disappears, and a new folder appears in Open Backups called "Open Sections."<br />
<br />
Can you help me find my entire Notebooks?<br />
<br />
Thanks again very much!<br />
Jackie<br />

            Hi Bernd,<br />
<br />
I appreciate your help very much. I am still at a loss to find my entire Notebooks though with your help and Chris's (above) I have been able to locate the missing sections.<br />
<br />
You write:<br />
&gt;&gt; To open permantly a Onenote notebook you have to use again File &gt; Open, <b>got it</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&gt;&gt; but point to the notebook's folder and open that folder with all its sections.
<b>Here I do not see any folders. The title of this page is: Open Notebook. The headers are:
<br />
</b>
<ul>
<li><b>"Open from the Web" (with a Windows Live link and Sign In button); <br />
</b></li><li><b>"Open from other locations" (with a Browse button); and <br />
</b></li><li><b>"Recently closed Notebooks" (there is only ONE Notebook here from 2008, which is the only Notebook that opens now or that I can find anywhere. It is in [Compatibility Mode] so I know this is not my 2010 version.</b></li></ul>
&gt;&gt;Such a correctly opened notebook will stay open after closing Onenote. So will see it open after the next start of Onenote.
<b>This has been true of the 2008 Notebook, as you say. But I have several 2010 Notebooks that are completely missing, even though I have found the missing
<u>sections</u> by going to File &gt; Info &gt; Open Backups. </b><br />
<br />
Can you help me find the NOTEBOOKS? <br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

            Hi - There are 5 options to<b>"Open from other locations" &gt; Browse. </b>Here are the results when I try each one<b>:<br />
</b><br />
<ul>
<li><b>File name: Open Notebook </b>(When the drop-down menu to the right says <b>
OneNote Table of Contents (*.onetoc2)</b>. Clicking on OPEN a prompt appears "! A notebook cannot be found at this location. Do you want to open C:\Users\Jackie\Dropbox\OneNote Notebooks\Personal as a notebook?" I said YES, it opened ONE random section (TED
 Talk). My Personal Notebook is now open in the sidebar (YAY) but only contains the TED Talk section, not the many organized sections it had previously. (I notice happily in the topmost ribbon that I am now in Microsoft OneNote, NOT the Compatibility Mode which
 happens when I am in the old 2008 Notebook. Progress!)<br />
</li><li><b>File name: Open Notebook </b>(When the drop-down menu to the right says <b>
OneNote Table of Contents (*.onetoc2;*.one;*.onepkg). </b>Clicking on OPEN, nothing happens; that is, I am back in the TED Talk section. (This Notebook and section now exists when I close and re-open ONeNote).
</li><li><b>File name: Open Notebook </b>(When the drop-down menu to the right says <b>
OneNote Sections (*.one). </b>Clicking on OPEN,a prompt appears: "! OneNote cannot open the specified location: C:\Users\Jackie\Dropbox\OneNote Notebooks\Personal\Open Notebook.one."
</li><li><b>File name: Open Notebook </b>(When the drop-down menu to the right says <b>
OneNote Single File Package (*.onepkg). </b>Clicking on OPEN, a prompt appears: "! OneNote has encountered a problem and cannot complete this operation."</li><li><b>File name: Open Notebook </b>(When the drop-down menu to the right says <b>
All files (*.*). </b>(Here, the file window shows 2 files, Open Notebook.onetoc2, and TED Talk.one). Clicking on OPEN, nothing happens; that is, I am back in the TED Talk section.
</li></ul>
<p>Can you interpret any of the prompts above, particularly the one that encountered a problem?
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have now exhausted all the options for Open from other locations &gt; Browse. No in-tact notebooks were found.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Would you say that my only option at this point is to reconstruct my Notebooks using the backup sections in this Compatibility Mode version of OneNote? Or do I try to re-install the 2010 version of OneNote (and reconstruct my Notebooks from the backup files).
 Or is there another place I might find the lost 2010 Notebooks?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help. This is a real head-scratcher.</p>

Onenote should show a better reaction in this case. There is obviously no *.onepkg file to open.

            Hi Bernd,<br />
Thanks again for your patient attention.<br />
<br />
I used Windows Explorer to conduct the searches as you described. No Notebooks appeared at all, except for the Personal one with the single TED file.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned earlier in the thread, through an earlier Explorer search with the suffix *.one (as you suggest) I did find over 500 .one files dating from 2008 to the present. I have these copied/saved on an external back up as well as here on my laptop.<br />
<br />
But my Notebooks from the past 2 years are... gone.<br />
<br />
One last question for you (I hope). On my external hard drive I have, from November, a backup of all my files. The recent Notebooks will be there -- at least up to November (and I have the more recent backups of .one sections). What will happen if I import
 from the external drive copies of my Notebooks? If you could give me some steps to follow in doing that I'd be grateful.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
Jackie<br />

            At first decide what folder should become the "mother folder" for your notebooks.
<div>Especially "on Dropbox or not". Dropbox works well with Onenote only in the case of ONE user.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a second step create notebooks by creating empty notebook folders by using Windows explorer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a third step fill these notebooks with your old sections (*.one files) using again Windows explorer. You can freely rename them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a last step open the new notebooks one for one with Onenote. Should happen by double click on one of the sections in a notebook in Windows explorer.</div>

</p><p>I checked both those and it wasn't the problem so I created the formula in a different cell and copied it over which seemed to work. I haven't been having problems since. If it happens again, I will contact you again. I think I got rid of all the broken

<h2>            Outlook 2011 for mac showing 2 unread messages but I can&#39;t find them</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This all started yesterday. &nbsp;The icon for outlook showed an unread count and the inbox showed the same number. &nbsp;I have subsequently cleared the inbox but still it shows an unread count. &nbsp;I have searched for unread mail but none can be found.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've checked on my web view of the same account and there are no unread messages there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried restarting outlook and rebooting the mac but these have made no difference.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What has changed and I don't know why is that the doc icon no longer displays the incorrect unread count but the GUI still does.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas what I should do.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello geneg205, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the basic IE reset. Go to Control Panel, select Internet Options, in Internet Properties select the General tab, then select Delete in Browsing history, select Temp files, Cookies, History and Download history, select Delete.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, select the Advanced tab. Select Restore advanced settings, then select Apply. Select Reset, checkmark the Delete personal settings box, select Reset.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign out of Windows 8 and restart your PC, log back in. Hopefully this will allow you to change the Home webpage to anything you want.

<p>There is something else we can try, it's a bit of a longshot, but we might as well give it a go. Please make sure the Surface is plugged in, and the Touchpad is attached (if you have one).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Start screen type cmd. Right click on Command prompt, select Run as administrator from the bottom bar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are asked if changes should be allowed, say Yes. At the command line type sfc /scannow - then hit enter. This will look for corruption in the system32 folder, and attempt to repair it if it finds it, then tell you if it was successful or not.

    <title>Nokia 6300 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> etybagem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6300</h2>
                    I have just bought a Nokia 6300 (Orange) and can switch it on without entering a PIN. Consequently, I went to the security settings to turn on the PIN where I was asked to enter the PIN. I decided on a number and entered it as my four-digit PIN but received
 the message that the PIN was incorrect. I tried re-entering it as 12345, which I thought was perhaps the default PIN. That too was rejected and a message appeared informing me that I could make one last attempt to enter the correct PIN, at which point I decided
 to go no further as I was concerned about blockign the phone.<br />
Please can someone tell me what I am doing incorrectly and also what the default PIN of 12345 is actually for?<br />
Thanks<br />

            You are getting your security code and pin code mixed up.<br />
<br />
The security code is 12345 but the sim card pin code is a 4 digit number set by orange. You should find this code in the paperwork that you received with your sim card or you can contact orange.<br />
<br />
The pin code stops people from using your sim if stolen and the security code stops people from using the phone with another sim or accessing it's memory.

            Hey Kennyn....<br />
I think you should also call orange so that they give you the pin because all pin codes are different for different sims....<br />
Yours cannot be the same with any other..

            It was 1111.<br />
<br />
That is the default pin Orange use for most of their sim cards.

            Hi. Monty
<br />My name is Mila
<br />Independent Advisor
<br />I hope to help.
<br />
<br />	If you do not remember your security question or can no longer access your alternate email address, there is still a method to recover your Outlook.com/Hotmail account. You should only provide as much information as possible about your account to show that it belongs to you. You can also use this method to recover your account in case it is blocked.
<br />
<br />	It is possible that your Outlook.com account is temporarily blocked because we have observed some unusual login activity.
<br />
<br />	We know that having a blocked account is frustrating, but we also want to protect you from cases of fraud or abuse. See how to unlock the account.
<br />
<br />1. Go to <a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx</a> to recover your account and reset the password.
<br />
<br />2. Enter the email address of your blocked account and type the characters you see on the screen and select next.
<br />
<br />3. Enter the code generated by the authenticator application or choose to use another verification option to obtain a text message.
<br />
<br />Notes:
<br />o A smartphone is not necessary to receive a security code.
<br />
<br />o Text messages can come from "MSFT", as a short number or as a mobile phone number. If you have requested a security code, you can trust the incoming message.
<br /> 
<br />o If you do not have an alternate email address or phone number, or can not access them, select I did not receive a code when I asked for a code at login or I do not have access to them when I reset my password and then follow the instructions.
<br />
<br />4. After entering the security code, you must change the password to complete the unlock process.
<br />
<br />	Be sure to create a secure and unique password to make it easier to keep your account secure. Use uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols in the password and try not to use the same password in several accounts.
<br />
<br />	For more tips on making your password secure, see Help protecting your Outlook.com email account.
<br />

<p>Thanks for your responses. I tried multiple times with accurate subjects and was denied. Contrary to what one reply said, there is no option to contact technical support, it is a dead-end. The deny response states something like "You should create a new
 account."</p>

<h2>            Subdomains and Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Is it possible to have a root domain managed by other service and subdomain only pointing to Office 365? For example I have domain called domain1.com that is managed by Google Apps, but I would like support.domain1.com to be managed by Office 365</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Ernest,</p>
<p>We can directly add our subdomain to our Office 365 tenant without verifying the root domain(make sure the root domain hasn’t been added to another Office 365 account).<br />

<h2>            n82 Personal Impression &#40;3 week use&#41;</h2>
                    General observations for anyone considering purchasing an n82. *Stuff between the asterisks indicative of my reaction ;)*<br />
<br />
Firstly, I don't think anyone will deny that it's a great mobile/PDA/Smartphone for its price and size *haggle at an Aussie store for under AU$799 or grab an Asian version from eBay at around $600 including postage*. However there are a couple of things to
 consider before buying: -<br />
<br />
1. The Aussie Version (my version) comes with the following WRITE languages - English, Indonesia, and Pilipino. *Yep* It doesn't include Chinese and there's no upgrade, nor is there any commercial package that gives it Chinese compatibility according to the
 Nokia helpline *my issue is that it doesn't read/display Chinese*. That's despite the fact that the Asian version *imports through eBay* supports Chinese. The ramifications are obvious if you consider Chinese websites, GPS maps &amp; navigation, eBooks and translation
 dictionaries that substitute Chinese characters with rectangular boxes. They really should have all n82 languages built-in or allow language packs to be installed (I have read of mods that you can do to change the phones model number and then use nokia update
 to load the Asian firmware but I'm a bit of a wimp unless someone's gonna guarantee that it won't void aussie warrantee *like even*). I mention this because the market is global and it will assist all future mobile sales. *anyone listening from nokia?*<br />
2. Please upgrade the n82 from v10.0.0.46 to v11.0.117 *hope I got the version numbers right* as soon as possible as it fixed the following glitches that I experienced: -<br />
a) Accidentally pulling out the stereo headphones from the 3.5mm jack while listening to music or doing other stuff no longer causes the n82 to auto reboot or hang.<br />
b) The sound quality of the built in Media player for mp3's appears a tad less muffled (playing via speakers is still less than ideal, with a high pitch *drill* sound when played at full volume, ie something sounds loud but it ain't the music - some older folks
 might not be able to discern it *wink*);<br />
c) Listening to music while using the Nokia GPS no longer causes the phone to hang (needs more testing as there were a few music glitches during multitasking but I gather it's caused by the memory card being accessed for both the music and the maps)<br />
d) According to some users on the internet this update allows the n82 to support 8GB MICRO SD cards as it updates support from fat16 to fat32 file structure (haven't tested yet). Other users have reported flaky Wi-Fi after update but I didn't have any problems.
 Before I forget, this phone refuses to connect to a wireless router if the SSID of the access point is hidden.<br />
e) The updater for the software I used was v1.4.23en. The reason I mention this is because I originally used the web installer 1.6 to auto download the latest Nokia software including the updater (I chose to use Chinese language instead of English via the installer
 - in the hope that it would load Chinese firmware on the phone - long shot but I thought it was worth a try *stupid*. Anyway, long story short, it loaded updater v1.3.5 *OMG* which didn't recognise my n82 so I uninstalled it) The actual update didn't take
 too long (it downloaded 101MB of data from the net and updated the phone - overall 20mins) Oh, I had the n82 plugged into mains power and the MICRO SD card in the slot during the update. Some users posted that you should power off the n82 after completing
 the update before disconnecting it from the usb port or there might be a glitch with the usb connection?<br />
<br />
How well does everything work?<br />
1. Usb file transfers are slow *fact* so some ppl suggest if you get a 8GB micro sd to use an external adapter. Bluetooth file transfer is even slower (100KB/s according to windows) but at least there's no cables *so this is my preferred transfer method*.<br />
2. I find at times that if you install a lot of programs on the n82, the menu system gets sluggish especially when you try to customize standby apps. At first I thought it might be a cpu issue cause there's plenty of free ram, so I checked the speed, which
 some programs indicate as 200Mhz *almost freaked out cause it's suppose to be over 300Mhz according to gsmarena.com*. Other users have posted that these programs don't detect the right speed, anyway, the reason I was concerned is because Realplayer will play
 realmedia files (both on internal memory and on micro sd) but it will regularly pause intermittently *every 5 or so seconds* for 1.5-2 seconds resulting in video being unwatchable and totally out of sync with audio *this is unacceptable given these are small
 1 minute real8 encoded 320x240 clips. Placing the clips into live memory first helps turn the pauses into 0.2second hiccups-but the audio is still significantly out of sync. BTW these clips play perfectly on the win pc version of realplayer*; I find this really
 strange given that the default video capture of the n82 is mp4 at 640x480 30fps - playback on the default media player is just fine. *note though, playback of the same captured mp4 videos on 3rd party symbian players installed on the n82 is very jerky – don’t
 know what's going on*<br />
3. GPS Mapping is great... with a couple of reservations. *I'm hoping that the new v2 Nokia Maps will be way better*<br />
Pros-<br />
-It sure beats carrying around the ubd street directory and this one can tell you where you are in around 5minutes depending on where you are.<br />
-Lists points of interest, parking, restaurants, petrol stations etc.<br />
-Note that you can keep the backlight on while using mapping, although it's not turned on by default (go into settings)<br />
Cons-<br />
-Cursor is hard and slow to move if you are travelling and you want to see the place of interest that is coming up ahead;<br />
-Rivers on the map look like land (they're not defined by a different color, namely blue);<br />
-The route feature is only usable in a practical sense if you pay (example: assuming you don't pay for the upgrade premium service you can route between 2 points and it'll show a set of written directions, click on the directions to go into map view and you
 get a black line linking the 2 points with intermediate points showing you where to turn. It can run a voice guided simulation of your travel at 50km/hr *speed not adjustable*. What it CANNOT DO, is show your route in map view and your immediate gps position
 at the same time *i.e. I don't need navigation directions, but I would like to see whether I'm staying on the routed black line*<br />
-No quick way to save a route and call it back up.<br />
<br />
4. Many little things that get on my nerves can be solved with the *limited* freeware out there: -<br />
a) The n82 has a nasty habit of turning off the display backlight when I want it on for extended period of time. The maximum timeout for display light is 60secs and the standby autolock sets in at 90seconds. Use 'Spoton v0.07' to keep the backlight on, it runs
 in the background after you start it *select backlight on* and it places a yellow dot on the top right hand corner that blinks to keep the backlight on and prevents the n82 from going into autolock/standby mode *BTW don't close it when you see a white screen
 with text, just switch to another program using the n82 menu button*. To alter way autolock works, use 'Mr Lock v1' *trial and error to find your perfect setting, just don't set the timer too short*.<br />
b) You can get certain n82 symbian S60r3 freeware from the nokia website but the bookmark link on the n82 phone browser often suggests there is no downloads available for the n82 *what gives?* Example is the 'Nokia internet radio' which is ok for use with a
 broadband wireless network.<br />
c) The built-in webbrowser doesn't support flash, hence no youtube, dailymotion, veoh, tudou, crunchyroll... Currently, there is limited support for youtube via 'Mobitubia' and 'Emtube'. 'Emtube' was the best *D* flv player - with smooth playback &amp; wide flv
 compatibility overall, speculations suggest that youtube took it down for violation of terms *last version 1.0.10, makes me wanna weep*. The latest version of 'mobitubia' v1.76b3 has problems playing clips that an earlier version didn't have but overall the
 quality and sync for various vids ain't as great as 'Emtube'. Both will allow you to 'cache' into flash memory and play clips later unlike the youtube java version. Some use Opera-mini4 as their web-browser but there are no real advantages, every website is
 a test of patience on such a small screen *good for checking out the weather and news snapshots tho* - opera doesn't gel too well with the n82 barcode reader.<br />
d) cCam v1.03 will allow camera photos without the 'chi-cha' sound but the red light still comes on if you decide to hold down the camera button to focus and it relies on the option key to snap the photo not the camera button;<br />
e) 'S60Dict' for a simple english dictionary; 'SMS Export' to export sms to txt and 'Datamatrix' to generate 2D-barcodes *BTW Firefox has a 2D-barcode generator addin*;<br />
f) 'S-Tris' will give you tetris, but a lot of mobile games don't play too well on the n82. Despite the built-in graphics processor, the awkward response of the middle navigation button is too fiddly and not very comfortable, always try before you buy. *I'll
 stick with the Nintendo DS; mind you I've stopped using my ipod nano 8GB cause I don't have to carry around a cable to transfer tunes via bluetooth*<br />
g) There a quite a few symbian shareware available, so try them and by the end of the trial period you'll probably have more than a couple of reasons as to why you don't want it or need it anymore *kinda sad really*.<br />
h) A lot of freeware applications require self-sign *hassel*, I'm still waiting for the symbian website to be back up but I am eager to try out 'flipsilent', 'PhoNetInfo' and 'activefile'.<br />
TIP: Always try to install 3rd party programs to the micro sd cause you can boot the phone without it to stop unwanted programs loading at startup.<br />
5. Battery doesn't ever last as long as it should - I'm glad I'm not using the n95 cause I seem to run this battery flat daily, just by play Nokia Internet radio out loud on the speakers.<br />
<br />
Eagerly awaiting the n96, but til then the n82 will do for now.<br />
*BTW I started typing this on the n82 but it gave me a cramp, sorry if it’s incoherent, and if there’s anything I’ve missed, I'm sure other members will be happy to reply :)*

            I have had the n82 for almost 2 months now and it is a perfect phone i just wish it had track ball navigation. The classic keypad is a pain when browsing. Another this is the keys are too small and very difficult to use when playing games.

            I agree with the n82user's opinion below.. I bought the nokia n82 black from ebay where the seller from HK. I buy from him bcoz of hoping can read and write chinese character. As I get the phone, I check directly, but I am really disappointed. I really
 hope Nokia can update its firmware as soon as possible so that I can use chinese character as soon as possible. Thanks.<br />
<br />
PS: If there is a way to read and write chinese character in the nokia n82, legally from nokia, can u let me know by posting reply to this discussion threads.

Ok, I was one of the first *guinea pigs* to update the firmware to v20.0.062 using VISTA upon its initial release. The anxiety I went through with Nokia Helpline being, hmm, I can't even say it - anyway, imagine me totally freaking out when I ran into the process
 terminate error and was told by the helpline to restart my computer and do it again. Of course after restarting and trying to follow the prompts it tells you to remove/reinsert the battery and then continuing to update, but as everyone knows by now the update
 prompt will get stuck indefinitely if you do it this way. Rang back the helpline and was told the only way to terminate the update which had run for over 2hours was to pull the plug - of course the update has a clause that says that you shouldn't pull the
 plug - what if the phone turns into a brick as a result of me pulling the plug, will it be covered by warrantee I asked? Helpline danced around my question by saying take it to a service centre and they will determine whether it will be covered - HELLO I'm
 asking a straight forward question, assuming the phone is bricked by me pulling the plug because the update refuses to complete, will it be covered or not? If I can't pull the plug then how long am I suppose to let the update run for? overnight? Helpline -silence,
 then stated - pulling the plug is your decision. BTW, it wasn't a download issue cause the hundred or so MB's was downloaded in less than 3min on adsl2+. Obviously, everyone knows it's a Nokia software error with Vista (Google it if you don't know what I'm
 talking about). I was sooo angry I was afraid I might type something profane so that's why I'm posting now - I've calmed down a bit. :(<br />
<br />
Was the update necessary? Not really, unless you have a habit of plugging in and pulling out headphones or bluetooth incompatibilities. Originally, I hoped the update would allow me to view flash objects directly on the webpages using the nokia webbrowser -
 RESULT- generally, loading flash within the webbrowser is more miss than hit. Flash items would show up as a generic picture icon which you may click on to select to display 'On page' or 'In player'. When you select the first it often turns the icon into a
 broken flash icon or crashes the webbrowser, and if you select the latter it loads the swf into something called 'dmplayer' and then says 'Not enough memory to open file', - BTW only the nokia webbrowser is open, no third party background applications etc.<br />
<br />
I don't use Geotagging (which you can select under camera options) cause most of my photos are taken indoors, or alternatively are spur of the moment; but I did notice loading and the camera taking a tad longer than the old firmware - not irritating tho.<br />
<br />
There is still no inbuilt flv video support despite being able to access youtube without an external player (ie you can't click on a flv file in the file manager and play it directly, furthermore you can't open it in realplayer although that appears to be the
 application that handles online youtube flv video streams). Something that bugs me is that the flv player from opda v1 doesn't work anymore after the update to the inbuilt flashlite3; although it did work before when I was using it with the external flashlite3
 developer edition. It comes up with the 'file format not support' error. If anyone can get it to work under v20 firmware pls let me know, I might reformat the phone to factory state and try to reinstall it fresh. BTW has anyone reformatted the phone and micro
 sd to factory state? If so, can you tell me if panoman v2.2 (a program that came with the Oz version of the n82) and Nokia Maps v1.2 will get re-established on the micro sd. Thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
Other Applications:<br />
Mobitubia has updated to v1.8b4 but playback can still be jittery on many youtube videos and it doesn't look like there's any improvement in compatibility with flv files from other flash video sites like dailymotion, veoh, tudou etc etc.<br />
<br />
Opera Mini v4.1 is a bit of a surprise cause it's become quite respectable - it's speed is quite a bit faster (when the server isn't overloaded) than the default nokia browser and it can finally save webpages (although it saves it as a obml file that firefox
 doesn't like).<br />
<br />
Oh, something interesting I found is that if you plug the n82 into the tv using the video connection cable, the usb connection port on the n82 gets a bit zappy (kinda like a static shock) ;P<br />
<br />
Price of the n82 has gone down again with Aussie Retailers selling Aussie Stock for as low as $575 plus $14 express shipping and they give a free car charger, so it's strange that the last Harvey Norman catalog is still listing retail price of over $900.<br />
<br />
Final Word, still no ability to read Chinese characters with the latest update *Nokia is obviously not reading my post, oh well* :)

            Watching videos on youtube via standard built-in nokia browser worked flawlessly on my nokia N82 black. Right out of the box I could watch standard desktop version of youtube webpage and play any video<br />
<br />
BUT ... suddenly (and I have no idea what has caused this) it stopped working and it doesn't work anymore after hard reset (*#7370*) and even after reflashing firmware.<br />
<br />
1)<br />
<br />
First of all the main youtube webpage looks weird right at the start - the logo YOUTUBE on the top of the page looks as if it had 16 colours (you can obviously see something isn't right with the browser - but this happenes only on youtube webpage)<br />
<br />
2)<br />
<br />
When you click any video it will either<br />
A) crash the browser or<br />
B) whole page will load except the video (the area where the video is supposed to be will stay blank)<br />
<br />
<br />
Any idea what might be causing this? Anyone else having these issues?<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't even get that option. Once I click on an empty field (where the youtube video was supposed to show up) multiple mouse pointers start to show up.

            I think that retailers like Harvey Norman haven't been dropping their price is because many people in Australia don't really know about the N82 and are oging for the N95.

            Thank goodness I didn't run into any problems with this update, unlike last time :)<br />
<br />
Let's cut to the chase...<br />
1. I've noticed that websites using simple flash elements that didn't work under v20 works better after the update. However, those not optimized for mobiles are still slow to load in the nokia browser using wireless g when compared to a v slow laptop on the
 same wireless network. A couple of glitches I've run into when browsing... firstly, there are websites that seem to load and just when the page is almost completely rendered, reloads and renders again, and again, and again... painful... secondly, the built-in
 cache mechanism is flawed, go back a page and you find that it re-downloads a lot of stuff that should be cached (yes, I have tried different configurations of the browser settings and monitored http network packet traffic router side using a sniffer). Loading
 saved webpages doesn't work on a number of sites if there are elements that are scripted (flash ads also throws a wrench in the works) it constantly tries to connect to the network which is kinda stupid. For those who were thinking of suggesting I cancel while
 it's in the middle of connecting/loading and read the 1/2 page that renders... :P<br />
<br />
2. In terms of flashlite3, the n82 will now play flv files saved on the microsd/phone; pretty sure I tested support for both sorenson and vp6 codecs, yah!... unfortunately, I haven't found a way to fast-forward nor rewind the video??? Play, pause and full screen
 playback requires menu digging - not so user friendly (btw realplayer can't seem to see the flv files, despite the fact that it's the default youtube player?). The audio track of the flv's sound muffled (tend to notice it on some clips more than others) and
 all of the flv files show up under media gallery as a broken icons and won't play if you select it (implementation problems)... :O.<br />
<br />
3. Ad hoc wi-fi courtesy of my fast laptop still won't work with wpa (could be a problem with Vista I suppose), n82 restarts if I try to connect, will work with wep tho, but lets face it, ppl on the net can unlock wep in a couple of minutes nowadays so it's
 anything but secure...<br />
<br />
4. Themes can adversely affect flash video playback (makes the video hesitate and glitchy), both for Mobitubia and the inbuilt flash player, took me sooo long to isolate this error and I can't understand why this could possibly be the case - but uninstalled
 theme and it plays fine now so go figure.<br />
<br />
5. Battery indicator appears to be slightly more accurate - previously it would show that there was a lot of battery left and then all of a sudden, run out. However, I feel that youtube clips in mobitubia don't play as long as they use to - can't say for sure
 tho...<br />
<br />
6. FOR ME, the camera application didn't start up faster than v20 firmware and there were no discernable quality improvements with the pics, very nice but at 100% zoom the 5MP pics were still super grainy indoors when shot at a distance beyond the couple of
 meters flash range (image noise).<br />
<br />
7. Music Player, nothing major, other than a change of button color and music tracks added error. Does glitch less I suppose.<br />
<br />
8. I turn off auto rotate cause it drives me insane... I do prefer it post update as it switches the whole screen with a delay but the redraw is faster, if it makes any sense...<br />
<br />
9. The silver on my keypad casing has started to show signs of peeling so it looks like I'm gonna have to buy an n79 when it comes out (hope its keypad ain't as hard to use as ppl say but I suppose I do have experience in this area thanks to the n82).<br />
<br />
10. One last thing, Psiloc Crystal chinese will allow read and write chinese characters - 10 day trial unless you love playing phone reset. Alternatively, you can edit the fireflysung font by decreasing it's size to 70% with orientation top left and save it
 under the resources font folder of your microsd card as a couple of weird font names. That'll allow you to read chinese in nokia web browser but it'll screw up english lettering under the music player and some other apps (cuts the letter in half and only allows
 you to see the top half if I remember correctly). Forgot to mention in my previous posts that you don't have to hold down the camera shutter halfway to focus before taking a pic, simply click and it'll autofocus before taking pic anyway - it came as a revelation
 when I found out(better than my canon digital camera in this aspect). Oo, oo, I was quite amazed that the nokia battery can shoot more than 200 consecutive photos with flash on a single charge (don't think the phone was even fully charged at that point) -
 got bored one day and just kept snapping (btw the phone gets a bit warm)... n82 down to AU$505

 one network, switch to the other network, paste it into Teams, but only have it as an image so it is useless anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's part of a communication standard we need to use and we communicate like this several times per minute across APAC. Would appreciate a response soon.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">CNXJared,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your detailed information.<br />
I also tested and did some research on my side. This is an expected behavior when you pasted a table into Teams. I understand that you don't want the pasted table to be like an image. I would suggest you submit feedback via the link below:<br />

            Hi Teaminds
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Reinstall - If even Reset / Unlink doesn't work - Uninstall Onedrive and install latest version -
<br /> 
<br />Let's try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin). 
<br />
<br />Copy the below line, paste into Powershell and Enter 
<br />taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe
<br />This will terminate any OneDrive processe 
<br />
<br />Copy the below, paste into Powershell and Enter  
<br />
<br />if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10
<br />%SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
<br />if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10
<br />%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
<br />
<br />(Note - It is recommended that you create a backup of your registry before modifying registry as suggested below so that if you commit some mistake, you will be able to restore - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756...</a>)
<br />
<br />Now Windows Key+R &gt; Type Regedit and Enter
<br />Go to this path
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include OneDrive numeric version (example - 18.172.0826.0010 folder)
<br />and from the Accounts folder, remove all the folders inside 
<br />
<br />After that restart computer and install One Drive latest version from this link: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860984</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Rich Text problems in New message</h2>
                    Outlook Hotmail -&nbsp;whenever&nbsp;I&nbsp;create&nbsp;a new message I can enter the address, put the subject then when I&nbsp;click&nbsp;in the&nbsp;message&nbsp;area the cursor normally disappears and I am unable to type or occasionally leaves a massive space at the top of the message and
 the cursor is about two inches long so my message starts a way down the page. &nbsp;The workaround is select plain text from the menu press continue &nbsp;then go back to message format select Rich Text (which it was on opening a new mail) and the message area becomes
 usable. &nbsp;Its been like this for months and now really annoying me. &nbsp;I am using Google Chrome, Windows 7&nbsp;Ultimate&nbsp;and DELL laptop. &nbsp;Any ideas - i just want the Rich Text to work first time without the hassle.

            I have had an issue with Rich Text formatting for months as well. The issue first started in the Hotmail interface, but it has not been fixed or improved in the Outlook interface.
<br />
<br />
Basically, when typing messages, if I make a mistake and have to delete a section, or erase a few letters and then continue typing, the formatting is lost/altered.&nbsp; It may change size, or font, or color.. Or a combination of all three. Additionally, the message
 may appear uniform when I finally send it off, but when I look at it in my saved messages or I get a reply, the message appears different than it did before I sent it.
<br />
<br />
If I click on "edit in HTML" to see the coding, the messages look something like this:
<br />
<br />
&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" color="#000000" face="Tahoma" size="2"&gt;Hi La&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;dies-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;Ju&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;lie and I need your input on where to &lt;font style="font-size:10pt;"
 size="2"&gt;go next with the pre-edit of &lt;i&gt;XXXXX XXXXXXXX &lt;/i&gt;by Mxxxxxx Cxxxxxx&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;. &lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I &lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;finished with my work o&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;"
 size="2"&gt;n it, but &lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;while I was editing&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;, &lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;I &lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;had&lt;/font&gt; understood
 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;that the author would be &lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;approving any non-punctuation
 changes &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;before&lt;/font&gt; it went to&lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt; the editing team &lt;font style="font-size:10pt;" size="2"&gt;for evaluation. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
I've also had a problem with words that I've misspelled initially but manually corrected, still appearing misspelled to the browser. (Meaning the squiggly red line appears below the word.) Additionally, if I right click on the misspelled word, I find that it's
 often reading only a part of the word, which I assume is because formatting code breaking up the word. (And no I am not changing fonts and colors left and right. I'm just trying to type a simple message. )<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Or news about when this bug might be fixed?? I'm using Mozilla Firefox 18.0.2 on Windows 7 Home Premium.

<div><br />
<div>Symptom is open new email , enter email address and subject, go to&nbsp;compose&nbsp;message. &nbsp;Start typing and sometimes the cursor becomes very large and the text being typed appears about 2 inches down the page. &nbsp;Resolution - &nbsp;select text,&nbsp;change&nbsp;to plain text,
 text moves to top of message box , then select rich Text and the problem goes away. &nbsp;This is a new Laptop with all latest updates. &nbsp;Cache and temp files cleared etc</div>

<br />
So I just got around to checking responses this forum and I find it interesting that Kent P completely ignored the larger coding issue and focused on the spellcheck issue, which is relatively minor in comparison to the formatting problems.
<br />
<br />
Also, just to give someone here at Microsoft an update: I have used both Internet Explorer and Firefox in recent months and formatting continues to act up while composing messages, regardless of the browser used. I frequently send messages that look fine to
 me while I'm composing them, but once they're sent appear to be a combination of fonts, sizes and colors. It looks very unprofessional and has caused me to have to compose my business emails in a word processing program and then copy to email so I can be sure
 they are all the same font, size and color. <br />
<br />
When will this problem be resolved?? <br />
<br />

<br />
Since I'm having similar problems to yragdraw, could you please give some examples of add-ons that can cause formatting issues in Outlook? Also, aren't add-ons different for different browsers? So why would the same issue happen across multiple browsers types?
<br />
<br />
As for the issues with pop-up blockers, could you please explain how they would interfere with email? I'm confused about this and am hesitant to give so many MS domains a free pass to hit me with ads. I have kids, and many, many ads these days are not kid friendly.
<br />

Thank you so much. <br />

            Firstly, I started this topic as I was having problems with composing emails. &nbsp;My own issue does not relate to spell checking and may actually confuse MS in trying to resolve&nbsp;this&nbsp;issue. &nbsp;My issue is when I open a NEW mail and start typing (after&nbsp;email
 address and subject entered) occasionally after a few words the cursor goes from being&nbsp;normal&nbsp;size to 10 times its size . The position of the text when I&nbsp;continue&nbsp;typing is about 10 lines down - example&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I start typing then</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>the rest of the sentence is this far down the page. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My only resolution is to&nbsp;highlight&nbsp;all the text, convert to plain text and then convert back to Rich Text. The sentence will then look like this -&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>I start typing then the rest of the sentence&nbsp;is now&nbsp;on the same line.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a new Laptop and I&nbsp;still&nbsp;have the same issue. &nbsp;I use Chrome , Win 7 Ultimate. &nbsp;I can repeat the problem on another PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I agree that I would be surprised if a Pop-Up blocker (which I do not have) would have this affect when composing a new email. &nbsp;I have also changed my Antivirus from when I had this problem - issue persists. &nbsp;I have now got used to the fix I use, annoying
 but it works, unlike Outlook and previously Hotmail. &nbsp;Perhaps it is something to do with the fact that Outlook has a problem getting email - telling me to try later. &nbsp;This has been an issue for a while - maybe that is part of the problem?</div>

            No problem - if thats where somebody said post then please do. &nbsp;My issue is to do with Rich Text but seems slightly different to yours. &nbsp;Resolving the issue might be different in your case compared to mine - wanted to keep it simple as this has been going
 on for some time. &nbsp;The only issue I have is as described - everyhting else seems fine. Thanks

<h2>            Disable sound alert</h2>
                    How do I disable the "alert" sound (the high pitched piano note) that plays when I close a new Microsoft Word 2007 document?
                </div>


            <div role="alert" class="m-alert f-information">
</button>
</span>
            <div id="threadBottomSection" class="">
<div id="allRepliesLink" aria-expanded="false">
            <h2 role="presentation">
        </h2>
<!--InFlight-->
<div id="allReplies">
    
<div id="LastReply" class="thread-message thread-message-enus"
     pagepos="1" msgpos="0" msgsection="Replies"
     translated-to=""
     translated-from="">
            
        <div data-bi-id="message-username-image-link" class="message-user-image message-username-image-link avatar-size-extrasmall circular-display" role="img"
           title="GreatGeek" aria-label="Profile picture" >
            <img onerror='this.className="default-avatar-profile circular-display lime362 avatar-size-extrasmall"; this.setAttribute("alt", "GR"); this.style="display: inline-block";'

            if you hear a sound it, it should come up on all office applications.&nbsp; Go to control panel - Sounds&nbsp;- and disable sound for close program :-)
