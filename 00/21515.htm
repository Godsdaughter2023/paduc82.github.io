<h3> dr. keyeskelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            SETTING UP DISTRIBUTION LIST TO SEND BLIND COPIES OF EMAIL TO SEVERAL PEOPLE AT SAME TIME</h2>
                    <p>Using Microsoft Outlook Web access to send email to fellow University faculty members.....in 2010 version, to do this I just clicked on TO for new message, then it opened up, I clicked on Distribution List, it open-end, I then clicked on BCC and all email
 addresses automatically were entered there and I could send email without anyone seeing another person's email address....Now using Microsoft Outlook Web Access 2013 version.....I can get my contact (or distribution list) up but when I click on "send email"
 all the different email address are visible.....can someone please tell me how to have the different addresses show up only on the BCC line of the new message email I am to send?....Other than just cut, copy, paste from the To line to the BCC line, isn't there
 an easier way as there was in the 2010 version?...Called Microsoft Technicians they say they cannot help and no one I can talk to they said to type my question problem here....appreciate anyone's help....thank you....</p>

            Outlook Web Access is Office 365/Exchange Server and doesn't involve Outlook, the client, so this really isn't the correct forum for your question.&nbsp; As it happens, I have a hosted Exchange account, and, in the Outlook Web App I have access to, I can open
 a new message, click the ellipsis (...) icon to the &nbsp;right of the "Apps" icon, and select "Show BCC".&nbsp; It then appears and behaves like the "To:" button, click BCC:, up pops my address list, etc.&nbsp; I can make this permanent by clicking the Gear icon to the
 right of my name, clicking "Options", clicking "Settings" on the left, and adding a checkmark to "Always show BCC" checkbox under the "Message Format" banner.&nbsp; I don't know if your version of OWA looks the same, but it should have similar capabilities in about
 the same locations.

<h2>            How to check office 2010 activation</h2>
                    hi.<br />
<br />
I buy and sell office software. Recently I purchased a bulk load of Office 2010 Home and Business. The only problem with the software is that it's not sealed and the seller couldn't tell me if it's previously been activated. Is there anyway of confirming whether
 the software had previously been used or activated.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

            You need to check if the <b>Lync</b> is enabled in the <b>Login items</b>.<br />

If it is not then you need to add the <b>Lync</b> application to the <b>Login items</b>.<br />

<h2>            OneNote Class Notebook as a homeschooler</h2>
                    Once again i'm left frustrated - I cannot access this amazing feature as a homeschool parent/teacher. It is frustrating because I want nothing more than to build notebooks for the kids to work on at their pace in some subjects. Others we can do together
 - but the feedback I need from them is different. It just seems ideal.<br />
<br />
Because I am just a school of one in my house, i'm locked out of this feature. It stinks. Period. But we have Office 365, and I don't mind paying for it for a year - we use it across all of our various devices. Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. It works well for
 us.<br />
<br />
I know nothing can be done about it here - I just wanted to vent as I'm trying to sit here and lesson prep for the coming year.&nbsp;

    <title>Resizing UML Diagram Shapes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kirk fleming  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resizing UML Diagram Shapes</h2>
                    I'm new to Visio 2013 and have not used Visio in many years.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My first task is to create a database diagram and I've selected UML Database Notation, dragged an Entity shape onto the page, then attempted to resize the shape as you normally would. The corner controls on the shape each have one single diagonal line
 in them, and none of them allow me to resize the shape. I need to get about 20 entities on a single page--how do I resize them? The question applies to any diagram of any kind, apparently.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>ALL I want is boxes I can put labels in and that I can connect with lines--I don't want the entities to be connected in any way with any database nor do I need to add attributes or in any way simulate or portray integrity constraints. I would use powerpoint
 to meet these needs but someone requested the diagram specifically be created in Visio.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a new default installation of the product and I am the only user.&nbsp;</div>

            Those instructions are for the wrong shapes and the wrong version oif Visio.<br />
You want the UML shapes, not database shapes.<br />
I can't help in more detail as I don't have Visio 2013, only 2003. 2007 and 2010, and the shapes have been changed for Visio 2013.<br />

<h2>            5310 firmware update. Memory card password issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just finished updating my cell phone's firmware (5310 xpress music). I had never placed
<em>any</em>&nbsp;password on my memory card. My memory card was in place during the update process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the update is over, the phone wont allow me to access my sd card, it is asking for a password. I never placed any password in the first place, where am i supposed to get it a password now??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the camera wont work. same problem. I try to open the camera and it asks for a password. How do i fix these issues? Anyone please? I am seriously worried!!&nbsp;</p>

            The password for Camera story is ODD, have never seen such a thing unless it's because the phone is st to save files to the memory card. I can't post links for you because I'm using my phone but click on the Discussions main page link at the top of this
 page, then Under mobile products you'll see a title named Accessories(bottom of the list) click on that then on the thread titled MMC Password. Here you'll find all you need to know bout your memory card password

<p>I just got the solution for my Nokia 3110 classic. Hope it will work for others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My memory card was also asking for password after a firmware update though it was not password protected before upgradation. I tried in many ways. But didn't work. Today I just entered the administrator password of my pc which I generally use to back up
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to God. Because the Nokia Care people had already confirmed that this memory card is damaged and I should buy a new one. I had a lot of useful data on my card which I could recovered by myself today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes.. If you are able to get back all your data, please don't forget to remove the password from&nbsp; the memory card by using the option given in the Memory card.</p>

<p>I found the issue on my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've ever used the "Remote locking" feature - even if you disabled it later - that's what your memory card password is. I remembered this because the Help for the feature stated it shouldn't be longer than 8 characters or you might not be able to unlock
 the card, which is how I figured it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>

                    <p>Clearly this version was not fully baked..&nbsp; I am having more trouble from IE11 than all the prior versions combined.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>NONE of the major sites I need to use, sign onto&nbsp;will work properly with IE11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compatibility mode doesn't help. Resetting the browser doesn't help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Trying Chrome or Firefox does help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprint community locks up and won't display forum threads properly.&nbsp; The bottom of the page is displayed in the middle. Site stops responding.</li><li>My bank doesn't support the browser yet and some banking functions won't work (greyed out buttons, buttons that don't respond, pages that don't display properly.&nbsp; This is one of the largest 3 banks in the country.</li><li>I can't pay my cable bill using IE11.&nbsp; </li><li>American Express website doesn't work properly.. </li><li>Countless others I haven't taken the time to document..&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have no choice but to use an alternate browser..&nbsp; This is the worst product quality of a version of Internet Explorer I've ever encountered.

            <p>Totally agree. I think&nbsp;IE11 is the single worst browser ever.&nbsp; Whatever they did, it is simply incompatible with over 80% of my regular corporate-type sites (i.e., not recreational, but necessary business-use sites&nbsp;like: Amazon.com (particularly the Wish
 List feature),&nbsp;American Express, banking sites, even Silverlight sites.)&nbsp;I find myself using Firefox more and more all the time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Lock ups, malformed content&nbsp;- why Microsoft cannot get a <strong>browser</strong>
<u>RIGHT</u> is beyond comprehension.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And, curiously, I find little media rejection of this browser. It is not my imagination. Maybe as more upgrade to it there will be an outcry. But will it matter? Don't people at Microsoft use this stuff and have the same problems?</p>

            I'd have to agree. IE 11 freezes very frequently and the task manager indicates a 12% CPU load. It takes several minutes to come out of whatever nonsense it is computing. To be frank, it is very annoying. I have been trying Chrome and so far I like it.
 I still keep IE for some compatibility issues, but to be frank IE 11 is by far the worst IE that Microsoft has put out for its customers. Very disappointed

 cant use it with many networking devices... screws up most of the internet sites I connect to.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's so bad I am taking my time personally to just vent as many others on just how terrible and dysfunctional this browser is!!!&nbsp; I too am VERY VERY DISSAPPOINTED!!!!!!</p>

            <p>My main concern is that I cannot create a desktop shortcut that will open.&nbsp; I get this message: "Unable to open Internet shortcut.&nbsp; Http does not have a registered program"&nbsp; HOW can I fix this as it was one of the main features I loved about I.E.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is it possible to go back to I.E. 7?&nbsp; So far I do not like 11.0 and they gave it to&nbsp; me automatically when I reset I.E.</p>

            Is Microsoft listening at all? They seem to have deaf ears. Who are the testers of their beta versions prior to unleashing it on an unsuspecting public. I have made Chrome my default browser. I still like some of IE 11 features, but its frequent freeze
 up tying up the CPU with 15-25% load for several minutes is not acceptable, very unprofessional. Who are these geniuses at MS that put out such garbage?

            As a full time web developer - I have to say this is the WORST browser EVER!
<div><br />
<div>Having tried many things to fix the IE11 issues, I found out that the UserAgent (String) it sends to web servers is Mozilla/5.0 (TRIDENT) - with absolutely NO mention of it even being IE.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This BREAKS everything that .browser files were supposed to FIX - and basically breaks the entire infrastructure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is like naming your car "Porsche", but inside it is a Yugo - and you walk around trying to convince everyone it is a Porsche.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What a catastrophe!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why would they want to "call" their browser Mozilla, yet render in their own way?</div>
<div><br />
<div>There should be a law or standard that needs to be met with regards to this stuff.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In any other industry / business, this would be plagiarism and hijacking.</div>
<div><br />
<div>THE WORST EVER!</div>

So is there a way to disable I.E. (an EASY) way?&nbsp;&nbsp; There's probably no way to uninstall completely, huh?&nbsp; OR can I go back to I.E. 7.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can you tell me how I can tell what version of I.E. I'm running?&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, I didn't want 11 BUT when I tried to make a change to something in I.E., it said 'Congratulations you now have I.E. 11 which I did NOT download.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they allowed to just give it
 you?&nbsp; That sucks cuz I specifically did not want it.<br />

    <title>Corrupt Style in Microsoft Word Template - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adina28  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt Style in Microsoft Word Template</h2>
                    I created a new Word template, and all is well while I am working in the document. However, when I reopen the document after restarting Word, the font for the Normal style (and all styles based on Normal) is appearing bold. If I go in to the Modify Style
 window from the style gallery, the font settings have not changed, and the font style is still Regular. As soon as I exit the Modify Style window (without changing anything, I used Cancel to exit), the font reverts to the correct display. If I save the file
 and close it, the Normal font is fine when I open the file again, unless I exit Word. As soon as I exit Word, restart it, and open the document again, the same thing happens. Does anyone have any idea why this could be happening and how to stop it?

                    I have recently purchased a laptop and have been investigating what security/virus protection software to install.&nbsp; I have looked at Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky etc which offer software that offers complete security/protection for your computer (viruses,

            Hi,<br />
<br />
No program can detect or remove all malware. MSE is an excellent tool to help protect the computer.<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 6.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 6.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> selwynnz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Move OneNote 2016 Notebooks off OneDrive to my PC</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Recently I "upgraded" my OneNote 2010 to the 2016 'free' version and ended up syncing to OneDrive as it kept insisting that I do so to enable Ctrl + N without the "pay for Office 365' errors.</p>
<p>Now I find that MS is going&nbsp; to reduce my current 15GB OneDrive 'allowance' down to just 5GB next month and to keep syncing my 8GB of OneNote files will require me to buy Office 365 which I certainly have no use for!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with OneNote 2016 is that it refuses to change the location to local computer unless I 'activate an eligible Office 365 subscription'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I run my own (retirement) business, I have no requirement to share OneNote at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. So how do I Unshare from OneDrive - I have tested all the suggestions I can find but have not yet found out how to disassociate OneNote 2016 from OneDrive so that it is only used locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, one thing I have not tried is to use the trial version of Office 365 to&nbsp; enable me to move all me OneNote files to my local computer, so:</p>
<p>2: can anyone assure me that doing so will work when I cancel the Office 365 trial?</p>

            <p>I answered your question in your other thread, but I repeat my answer here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your greatest problem is going back to Onenote 2010.</p>
<p>If you cannot go back you have at least to buy a standalone version of Onenote 2016; to be able to work with local notebooks.</p>
<p>To get a local copy of a notebook on Onedrive use&nbsp;<strong>File, Export, Notebook, ONEPKG-format</strong>.</p>
<p>This file can be opened by double click in Windows explorer if Onenote 2010 or a paid version of Onenote 2016 is installed.</p>

<p><span>When I choose</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">any</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>location I first
 get "Using this notebook requires activating an eligible Office 365 subscription".</span></p>
<p>Clicking OK or X then shows "OneNote cannot move the notebook to the specified location".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that this version of OneNote is available &amp; was downloaded as free - so that making us pay to use Office 365 is certainly not free!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To rephrase my 2nd question:</p>
<p><span>If I install&nbsp;</span><span>Office 365 trial version just to move all my OneNote notebooks back to my hard drive will OneDrive 2016 free still work on my local drive
 after I&nbsp;</span><span>remove the connection to OneDrive?&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Bernd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot go back to Office 2010 with OneNote as when it is used in Windows 10 the Win + S has been hijacked, that is why I installed the supposedly 'free' version of OneNote 2016, but it is beginning to look like it will only support all the usual commands
 such as Ctrl + N when it is used with OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks for the tip t<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">o get a local copy of a notebook on Onedrive use&nbsp;</span><strong>File, Export, Notebook, ONEPKG-format</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This
 file can be opened by double click in Windows explorer if Onenote 2010 or a paid version of Onenote 2016 is installed.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p>I will give that a try if all else fails and will post the results here.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1: can I then continue to use OneNote 2016 locally?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect that OneNote 2016 Free will again show the Ctrl + N error message to "subscribe to Office 365', as well as lose the ability to 'Copy link to Paragraph' and then access such links from other notebooks.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Those two OneNote functions are the reason I enabled syncing to OneDrive last week and I can get by without them if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the original reason for having to 'upgrade' from OneNote 2010 to 2016 Free was OneNote 2010's Win + S screen&nbsp;grab (my most used feature) had been hijacked by Windows 10 when I upgraded from Windows 7 earlier this month. There are several published 2010
 workarounds to do this but they are too kludgy to work efficiently - I spent a week trying them out!</p>

<p>To be honest I don't know whether the 365 trial allows the local storage (but I would expect that).</p>
<p>But after killing the trial you are still unable to use your now local notebooks, if you cannot get back your Onenote 2010.</p>
<p>The only way out of this misery is going back to 2010 or buying a new Onenote, for instance an Office Home and Student Edition to avoid a subscription model as Office 365.</p>

            <p>Many thanks Bernd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>2010 is not a usable option now that OneNotes Win + S screen grab has been hijacked by Windows 10 for its own use.
</p>
<p>After I try the Office 365 trial to move the 8GB of data back to my C: drive I will have to look for the lowest cost option to get a fully functional OneNote again. So I &nbsp;will report
 back here in a week or two with my results.</p>

<p>Hi Oliver,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the web app I can receive messages and see the messages I've missed.</p>
<p>In my in box I switched back &amp; forth the filter from view all to view unread, using the quick selection on the left hand top of the inbox message list. I could not retrieve any messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just used another selection mode in the top right-hand filer selection list "unread mail"</p>
<p>All the messages of the past few days appeared as unread, while I have read all of them using my mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched back to full list view and all messages re-appeared and now as read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue what has happened. It looks as if the messages are hidden in the background between unread/read.&nbsp; I have not changed any of my filter settings when the problem occured.</p>
<p>For now the problem seems to be solved, but I will keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll report again if the problems returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now many thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish you a great X-mas</p>
<p>/Eric</p>

<h2>            Loss of Partnership - XDA and Activesync 4.5</h2>
                    I have been syncing my XDA 2i successfully with my work laptop for years - now using Activesync 4.5, XP and Outlook 2007.<br />
I decided to also sync with my home PC running Vista and Windows Mobile.<br />
The PDA synced fine with Outlook 2007 on my PC.<br />
When I returned to the laptop, it did not recognise the partnership - even though both partnerships were visible when it asked me if I wanted to delete one.<br />
<br />
Help!<br />

            My first thought is to delete the partnership on BOTH&nbsp;PCs and reboot.&nbsp; Delete any existing partnerships on the device then soft reset.<br />
<br />
Now connect to one PC, establish a partnership and sync.&nbsp; Connect to the second PC, and see if it will then establish a new partnership and sync

    <title>Cannot connect to secure WiFi router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tr4cyk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to secure WiFi router</h2>
                    
<p>I have seen this problem mentioned&nbsp;and can see similar questions but mostly remain unanswered.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have a problem specifically with the HTC 7 Mozart and WP7 through Telstra in Australia.&nbsp; I have two Mozart's and I wish to connect to&nbsp;the internet when at home via wifi through our wireless router. Telstra deliver out of the box default settings to security
 on their Netgear wireless router for millions of non IT experts Australia wide ("Bigpond"), so basically they are unchanged and would be for most people.&nbsp; I can connect to this wireless router using the key for an iPad, iPhone, Telstras T-Hub and my Netgear
 USB key (Rangemax WN111 v2).&nbsp; But through the&nbsp;WP7 (on the HTC 7 Mozart) I enter the<strong>correct
</strong>password key and it states after 15 seconds or so (with the wireless icon flashing) then states:</p>
<p><strong>_____</strong></p>
<p><strong>Connection unsuccessful. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your phone couldn't reach the WiFi<br />
</strong><strong>network &lt;my network&gt;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Close]</strong></p>
<p>If I enter the incorrect password it tells me so.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;can't see this being a security issue with the router, given I can connect using default security options with almost&nbsp;<strong>any other device</strong>.&nbsp; So offering an answer suggesting changing the router's security settings or allowable MAC's is
<strong>not a solution</strong>.&nbsp; What I am after however is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insight to whether this is an issue with HTC 7 Mozart <strong>OR </strong>WP7?</li><li>Can the issue be addressed as a workaround (short-term) or a fix (in the long-term)?</li></ol>

<p>Someone indicated the Samsung Focus could not connect via WPA2 - that's&nbsp;not my experience.</p>
<p>My focus is currently connected via WPA2-AES with MAC filtering, at N speed.&nbsp;&nbsp; At home, I've used both&nbsp;a&nbsp; Cisco WRT610N, and a WRT350N.</p>
<p>Aside from the inability to customize the WiFi connection that we already know about (can't connect to hidden SSIDs, can't set a static IP), the only other issue I've found is that you can't connect to a network in the 5GHz range.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are broadcasting
 your SSID, but your phone still doesn't see your network, check the range - and change away from 5GHz to fix.</p>

            I have tested Samsung Omnia 7 and LG Optimus 7 with my Netgear WGR614 v8. All possible settings (WEP, WPA, WPA2&nbsp;AES, WPA2 TKIP) are working fine. So if there are any issues it seems to be some combination of influences rather than a bug in the OS.&nbsp;

<h2>            Connected accounts have stopped sending emails.</h2>
                    <p>Afternoon,<br />
<br />
Im having an issue that seems to have started around the end of September 2016 (last week).<br />
<br />
I run a small web server for friends and family and a local charity. This is accessed via different methods so if we focus on one mailbox (Mine) I collect my emails via outlook 2013 on my laptop (My Main PC), the windows mail client on my desktop at home, my
 phone via IMAP using the built in android mail app and finally I also use Outlook.com for web access when needed.<br />
<br />
This has been the set up for the last year and has all been working very well. Outlook is configured with a connected account using IMAP to connect to my mail server to retrieve my emails and SMTP to send them, as I said until last week this has worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
At some point last week we noticed that emails were not coming in via outlook (ok using all other clients though) so we removed and then re-created the connected account, this seemed to fix the issue with the mail coming in but we then noticed that when sending
 outgoing emails they were not going, stranger than that when we send an email rather than going into the Sent Items folder it goes into drafts, there is no info to tell us WHY it didnt send.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate the issue, we need to ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Has your Outlook.com account been updated to a newer version or you still have the older version?</li><li>Have you checked if the SMTP settings on your connected account are properly set?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p />

            I'm having the same problem. I have the newer version (as of Oct 3). After the newer version was installed, I stopped getting email from my connected (Century Link) accounts.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked my port settings (POP &amp; SMTP) on Oct 4 and noticed the SMTP Port was 25. My email provider (Century Link) indicated the Port should be 587; so I changed it to 587. Changing the SMTP Port from 25 to 587 did not fix the problem.</p>

<p>Afternoon,<br />
<br />
Im having an issue that seems to have started around the end of September 2016 (last week).<br />
<br />
I run a small web server for friends and family and a local charity. This is accessed via different methods so if we focus on one mailbox (Mine) I collect my emails via outlook 2013 on my laptop (My Main PC), the windows mail client on my desktop at home, my
 phone via IMAP using the built in android mail app and finally I also use Outlook.com for web access when needed.<br />
<br />
This has been the set up for the last year and has all been working very well. Outlook is configured with a connected account using IMAP to connect to my mail server to retrieve my emails and SMTP to send them, as I said until last week this has worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
At some point last week we noticed that emails were not coming in via outlook (ok using all other clients though) so we removed and then re-created the connected account, this seemed to fix the issue with the mail coming in but we then noticed that when sending
 outgoing emails they were not going, stranger than that when we send an email rather than going into the Sent Items folder it goes into drafts, there is no info to tell us WHY it didnt send.<br />
<br />
Also as soon as we try to send an email the status of the connected account changes to "Pending Update" and stays that way for some time (I assume this means it is still attempting delivery).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me this isnt a massive issue but the charity that I host emails for ONLY use outlook.com for their mail access so this is a massive issue for them, they have a years worth of emails in outlook so dont want to migrate to another service, however its looking
 more and more like this is what we will have to do.<br />

            <p>I am having a version of the same problem on two machines. Outlook.com updated around a week ago on both my and my wife's laptops, and we now both have issues with connected accounts which had previously worked with no problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine refuses to recognise the smtp address of my other account. I go through the "connect a new account" process, and it always fails with a message that says that there is an smtp error. My wife's recognises the linked account but does not import any messages.</p>
<p>In both cases the linked accounts work on Windows desktop and our phones (i-phone and Windows phone respectively).</p>
<p>I have checked and rechecked the pop and smtp addresses and port numbers and both are correct.
</p>
<p>We really need to be able to access our linked accounts, so hopefully Microsoft will recognise there is a problem, and fix it!</p>

            I am experiencing the same problem with the reconfiguration. &nbsp;No emails from one of my connected accounts are coming in. &nbsp;Plus, I am unable to &nbsp;send emails under a special connected account ((have 2 more which seem OK but I rarely use them). &nbsp;I am awaiting
 some very important emails under the special account. &nbsp; I am not techy but the POP and IMAP numbers I saw on another post sound similar to what I saw. &nbsp;The new configuration has totally halted some pending transactions. &nbsp;Has anyone's problem been resolved?

<p>I reckon the phone suffered from a failed update rendering it unusable. I suggest sending the phone to a Nokia Care Centre in your area. They will fix it with no charge if the phone is still within warranty.</p>

<h2>            Project 2007 File Corruption</h2>
                    
<p>I have just started using Project 2007.&nbsp; I have created two projects&nbsp;from scratch&nbsp;and each time I have received the same error&nbsp;after I have used the save as function.&nbsp; Once I use save as my file appears to be corrupt.&nbsp; It shows the project tasks duplicated,
 tasks&nbsp;out of order, blank lines,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the resource names duplicated multiple times.&nbsp; Each time&nbsp;after the corruption when I try to save the file I get&nbsp;the error which reads as follows:</p>
<p>"The file cannot be opened.</p>
<p>Check that the file name and path are correct.</p>
<p>Check that the file format is recognized by Project.</p>
<p>Project files saved in a version earlier than Microsoft&nbsp;Project 98 can't be opened.</p>
<p>If your file is from an earlier version, open it in that version, click Save As (file menu), and save in MPX format.&nbsp; Open the MPX file in the current version of Project.&nbsp; When you use this method, project data is imported, but formatting is lost."</p>
<p>In reviewing other users notes I read that SP2 may solve this issue; however, I am already running Service Pack 2.&nbsp; Also since I have never used Project before and I created these projects from scratch in Project 2007 so it should not be an earlier version
 issue.&nbsp; I am at a lose at what I am doing wrong or what is causing this error.</p>
<p>My current Project install is Microsoft Office Project 2007 (12.0.6423.1000) SP2 MSO (12.0.6545.5004)</p>

<p>Windows Mobile 6.1 Microsoft reader ID Number: 010</p>
<p>I'm still getting this error. 4/10/2010.&nbsp; The last post I see on this was in 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is Microsoft going to fix this?</p>

<h2>            Combining player statistics from multiple worksheets.</h2>
                    I have linked 3 separate worksheets to data for player statistics on yahoo at this link (<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/stats/byposition?pos=C%2CRW%2CLW%2CD&amp;sort=14&amp;conference=NHL&amp;year=season_2012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/stats/byposition?pos=C%2CRW%2CLW%2CD&amp;sort=14&amp;conference=NHL&amp;year=season_2012</a>).&nbsp;
 Each of the worksheets corresponds to a different season (2012/13, 2011/12, 2010/11).&nbsp; I would like to be able to refresh the data in the 2012/13 worksheet but 11/12 and 10/11 won't be refreshed(no need to).&nbsp; I would like to match the data from each of these
 seasons to corresponding player names on a separate worksheet.&nbsp; I want to make separate columns for each season.&nbsp; Basically I want to be able to look a players name up and find his statistical information from the last 3 years (including the current) and then
 be able to perform analysis and rankings from there.<br />

            <p>Here's one way to use Excel to do what you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the sheet with the currnet season's data, insert a new column, labeled Season. Put 2012/13 into cells of that column for every row of data that you have. Then copy the values from the other seasons' sheets, and place those values below the current season
 in the correct columns (do not copy the headers over). For every row of copied data, put the correct season in the season column. When you capture the new updated data, make sure that you completely overwrite the current season's data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delete the other worksheets so you have only one with all the data. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One option is to then select your data table and create a pivot table.&nbsp; Play around with the pivot table: put the&nbsp;stats you are interested into the data fields,&nbsp;with player as the row field, and season as the column field. You can filter by top ten, or create
 other analysis columns....</p>

            I could do that but player names will not match up.&nbsp; Each list is sorted by points which change year to year.&nbsp; I also cannot sort alphabetically because new players are added each year.&nbsp; for now I've copied and pasted the current season names collumn into
 a separate workbook and I'm using vlookup to match data to players.&nbsp; Its working for now but I don't have a way to include information for players who haven't played yet this year.<br />

            The pivot table does all that, which is why I recommended it - try it instead of just rejecting it out of hand.&nbsp; It will sort the data by unique player names, no matter where they appear in the list. If a player is not listed for all years, the data for
 those years will simply not be filled. It can create averages, find max and mins, show the top players by category - all sorts of reporting, without a single formula.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Since the data which you are analyzing is all numeric and since the structure (column headings) in all three sheets would be the same, using Pivot Table would be a good option.</p>
<p>2. Create a spare column titled as Season and under this column show 2012/2013, 2011/2012 and 2010/2011 in each cell</p>
<p>3. Now follow the steps at the following link to create a Pivot Table from multiple worksheets -

http://www.ashishmathur.com/create-a-pivot-table-from-multiple-worksheets-in-the-same-workbook/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may now Pivot your data to Analyse/rank player information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Owen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing your experience on our forum.</p>
<p>Based on my test, if you only insert pdf file and documents as attachments on a page, it will not be read on Immersive reader.</p>
<p>As you only insert them on a page, it will display the message “Sorry, we could not find any text on this page”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, we welcome and encourage you to share your ideas through&nbsp;<a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327186-onenote-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">User Voice</a>. It is the best way to perfect our products and services.
 Many features have been developed or upgraded directly from your ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is not your situation, could you please provide the detailed situation for further analysis?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Qing</p>

Are you trying to take a clip and insert it in OneNote or using a share to OneNote feature?&nbsp; I get the same result as you when I do that.&nbsp; It works, however, if I simply copy and paste into OneNote.<br /></p>
