<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per the issue description, I understand that you do not get sign-in screen when you start your computer. Pressing F12 and any other key does nothing.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do you have any external devices other than mouse and keyboard connected to the computer?</span></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Is this the only user profile on the computer? </span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Were there any significant software or hardware changes made to the computer just before this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do you have Windows 8 or 8.1 installation media?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Before trying any troubleshooting steps I would suggest you to disconnect all external devices if any (Printer, scanner, camera, or any other USB devices) except mouse and keyboard and try to restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>If you are able to login and boot the computer to the desktop successfully after disconnecting all external devices, identify the faulty device by connecting them one by one. If the problem persists let’s try these methods
 below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>We can try different Windows recovery options through Windows Recovery Environment. If you are not able to get to Windows Advanced Startup options, we can try booting the computer with an installation media.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you do not have a Windows 8 reinstallation media you can create one. You might be required to have your Windows 8 product key, you can look for the product key on your machine or contact the computer manufacturer to
 get it.</span></span></p>

    <title>3.5mm Jack Stopped Working, Anyone Else&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ga8r  say:</h3>
<h2>            3.5mm Jack Stopped Working, Anyone Else&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My 3.5mm jack on the new Xbox One S controller stopped working after the 90 day warranty. Controller is now completely useless!&nbsp;<br /></p>

<p>I pay for xbox live gold to talk to and play with friends! But now I can't! And Microsoft won't even try to repair or give me a discounted price? I totally understand the 90-day warranty. But nothing? It's defective! Cmon! I guess I learned my lesson when buying "Launch Editions".. Too many problems with them.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>My neighbor and cousin have both reported that their 3.5mm jacks no longer work either! So who is to say that even if I buy a new controller, what is going to stop it from occurring again? This is not an isolated incident! There are multiple cases across multiple forums, and multiple discussions!<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Also, I've been an xbox customer since I was 3! I played on the Mtn Dew Edition Original Xbox! But, I guess after 14 years it's time to switch to PlayStation or PC?<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I don't have $50/$60 for a replacement controller to replace a controller that I did not break nor altered in any way, it's cosmetically brand-new! Very Very Upsetting! It's even more upsetting when I pre-ordered this Xbox One S Launch Edition and got it the day it came out, while on &nbsp;9$ an hour pay at 16 years old!&nbsp;<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To put the bow on top; Please Reply to this if you have or have had the same issue as me. Maybe Microsoft will open a repair option for the affected consumers; maybe not. It won't hurt to try.
<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Thanks - Ga8r.</p>

</p><p>I&nbsp;got the launch Xbox One S 2TB too, but my audio port is still good.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since it's past that 90-day warranty, it's pretty much&nbsp;"kick some rocks or&nbsp;buy a new controller" warranty status.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>These are your options now:<br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>-&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Is&nbsp;there any dirt,&nbsp;dust, or other&nbsp;particles inside the jack?&nbsp;A common way to&nbsp;clean&nbsp;out a jack&nbsp;is&nbsp;with a gentle swab of&nbsp;a pipe cleaner or a&nbsp;dental brush.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;2.&nbsp;One (lazy) workaround would be to utilize&nbsp;the accessory port. You could use the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/headsets/chat-headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One chat headset</a>, or get that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/headsets/stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">audio adapter</a>.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;3. DIY-repair&nbsp;(further&nbsp;guidance is not supported here in the forums).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;4. Replace outright (through <a href="https://accounts.xbox.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device support</a> or just <a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/list/categoryID.70150400?icid=XBOAccessories_ModF_XBOcontrollers_112316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Do the N editions of Windows 10 have distinct licenses from the normal - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Do the N editions of Windows 10 have distinct licenses from the normal editions&#63;</h2>
                    I've been looking at the feature sets of the N editions of Windows 10, and I find that they appeal to me more than the normal editions. Since they cost the same, just differing in the locations where they're the primary offering, I'm wondering if they're
 actually distinct licenses. If I installed the corresponding N edition on a system that is already licensed for the normal version of that level, would the N edition activate or would I need to purchase a separate license for the N edition?

 between the two?</p>

<h2>            Can&#8217;t wake up computer from Sleep</h2>
                    
<p>If my computer goes to sleep it is proving impossible to wake it up.&nbsp; I have to reboot and then Windows resumes to the state the machine was in when it went to sleep.</p>
<p>I have been in touch with the manufacturers of the computer who tell me that sleep function cannot be used on a computer with an overclocked processor (mine has been overclocked).&nbsp; Is this really the case?</p>

<p>I am not sure about the overclocking. Few of my computers are overclocked and do not have an issue with sleep.</p>

<p>Here is my situation: I am going to back up a Surveillance Camera video file ( file format is avi ) to my window7 's desktop. (windows7 32 bit ultimate) .&nbsp; However, after the back up was 100% done,&nbsp; I can't see any folder or video file was created on the
 desktop.&nbsp; So I thought those are hidden folder / file. Then I go to "folder search orgnize" to uncheck all hidden option.&nbsp; But I still can't find any folder / file in my desktop. And I go back to my Surveillance Camera web and try to back up again. So wired,
 I can see those 2 new folder/ file is in my windows destop when I click on "browser" to choose location.&nbsp; I try to search so many solution online. but none of them works. Can you give me help? thank you</p>
<p>==&gt;I tried to back up that Surveillance Camera video file&nbsp;again by using windows XP sp3. This time, I can see the folder and file show on desktop even I didn't change any hidden option setting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi dennischan,</p>
<p>Surveillance Cameras are controlled and monitored though internet explorer from the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>The "<strong>hidden file</strong> " issue happens when you have certain types of add-ons involved.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are few steps that you may want to try:</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>I'd suggest you try no add-ons mode and then save the video file.</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>You may want to first run Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if that fixes the issue.</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, and select<strong>All Programs</strong> .</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong> , and select<strong>System Tools.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</strong> .</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which
 add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d recommend you to refer the following articles and follow the methods mentioned in the order of appearance to fix the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to optimize Internet Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that doesn't work, you may reset Internet Explorer and then reopen the Surveillance Camera web, it will suggest to install ActiveX control, once that is done, try saving the video file again.</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936213</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</div>

<p>Is it any problem that windows7 can't display any Surveillance Camera video file that download from Surveillance Camera webpage?</p>

<p>Clearly this has nothing to do with IE but everything to do with the quirky W7 file system and its UI.&nbsp;&nbsp; So FWIW I think you posted it in the correct forum in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>FWIW I don't believe those dialogs that W7 shows us.&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to find out what it should be showing us IMO is to use a&nbsp; CMD&nbsp; window and do a dir/a/b/s&nbsp;&nbsp; there (after navigating to the appropriate subdirectory.) Actually that might not show you what
 was going on either because your "Newfolder"&nbsp; might be a "junction"&nbsp; (e.g. an alias for a different part of your drive and then you would only see it with a&nbsp; regular&nbsp;&nbsp; dir/ad/s command.&nbsp; &nbsp; Even then, though you might not see it if your permissions weren't
 correct for that and in that case you might have to use&nbsp; icacls.exe to see it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>So, assuming your Desktop is directly under your user name start by entering this command in your cmd window:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; cd&nbsp; /D&nbsp; %USERPROFILE%\Desktop</p>
<p>then try the simple<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; dir/ad/s<br />
&nbsp;HTH</p>

                    My question to Microsoft is will you ever give some incentive to your customers to upgrade operating systems ? I have been buying Windows since 98 , and if you work that out it's a while ago , I now have redundant license keys for 98 , xp , vista , seven
 , which all seems like a huge waste of my money , I think that you should give a buy back for these keys to be used for less fortunate people , further to that you should offer cheaper upgrades to loyal , long standing users like myself because if I decided
 to change to mac because you keep changing the operating system too much ... well I think you can see what I'm saying &nbsp; Regards from a long time loyal customer Jamie :)

<p><br />
That was the objective of upgrade packages, which Microsoft no longer provides with the release of Windows 8.1. Upgrades use to be incentive the purchase newer release at a cheaper rate versus the Full Package Product</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows&nbsp;95 used the following operating systems as qualifying upgrades:</p>
<p>Windows 3.1, Windows 3.1 for Workgroups, MS-DOS</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 98 used the following operating systems as qualifying upgrades:</p>
<p>Windows 3.1, Windows 95</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows XP used the following operating systems as qualifying upgrades:</p>
<p>Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4, Windows 2000 Professional.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows&nbsp;Vista used the following operating systems as qualifying upgrades</p>
<p>Windows XP</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows&nbsp;7 used the following operating systems as qualifying upgrades:</p>
<p>Windows XP, Windows Vista</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8 used the following operating systems as qualifying upgrades:</p>
<p>Windows 7, Vista and Windows XP</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows&nbsp;8.1 used the following operating systems as qualifying upgrades</p>
<p>Full Package Product only at retail, no upgrade versions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>I think that you should give a buy back for these keys to be used for less fortunate people.</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why should Microsoft buy old outdated products to be used by less unfortunate persons? That does not make any sense.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>further to that you should offer cheaper upgrades to loyal , long standing users like myself because if I decided to change to mac because you keep changing the operating system too much
</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>That does not make sense, what about the value you got from the product? Take for instance, Windows XP, you got over 12 years of support, with updates for the product during that period of time. If you bought Windows XP in 2001 at $300 for the full version,
 divide that by 12. You paid $25 per year for the life of that product. Which is pretty amazing taking into account the average shelf life of software in this industry,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Lets look at the Mac as a comparison. In 2001, Apple released Mac OS 10.0 the same year as Windows XP. With the release of Mac OS 10.1 Apple no longer supported 10.0, with the release of 10.2 the following year, Apple no longer supported its previous two
 releases. This means, the initial $129 you paid for 10.0 lasted for only a year. Apple subsequently released new versions, 10.3, 10.4, (10.4 for Intel which required you purchase a new Mac to get it), 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8. Both 10.7, 10.8 required Macs released
 in the last 4 years to run. At least Windows 7 and XP, I could run it on 10 year old Machines without worry or minor upgrades such as memory.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your basis is that, you paid for these versions of Windows but you got nothing out using them. Its like going to a restaurant, you ate the food and said you want your money back, or you went to a department store, bought some clothes, wore them all these
 years and said you don't like them anymore, but would like a discount on future clothes and would like return the ones you bought for a refund.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry, but it doesn't work that way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, with the Mac these days, Apple is on a trajectory of obsoleting hardware even faster. Yes, they are free upgrades these days to OS X, but what those free upgrades mean, to run the latest version of OS X in the future, you might have to purchase new
 hardware, since Apple might introduce features that can obsolete model Mac and there is nothing you can do about it.

<pre>If you are like me and feel overwhelmed playing in leagues with seasoned Madden players, then this is the league for you! If you have 2 years or less of Madden online experience, then I invite you to join. I'm 31, so ideally, I would like to have mature players aging 25+. I would also like this to be a social league so I would like everyone to be mic'd and partied up when playing your games. Let's have some fun!<br /><br />Message me (GT: Snoop Bawg) for an invitation.<br /><br />Rules:<br /><br />1) No substituting a WR for a TE.<br />2) No quiting early.<br />3) Going for it on 4th down is only permitted in the 4th quarter and you're down by 11+ points or it's a 4th and 1 situation past the 50 yard line.<br />4) The only time onside kicks are allowed is when you are losing in the 4th quarter.<br />5) No running up the score... keep it classy.</pre>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Welcome to Microsoft Community where you can find the answers related to Windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
As per the description provided, it looks like you are facing an issue while playing online games using Windows RT.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
The most common cause is a missing or outdated add-on that’s needed to play the game. Most online games are based on Silverlight, Flash or Java and do require Internet Explorer add-ons to function.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
You will need to make sure that the necessary Add-ons are enabled in Internet Explorer, to do this follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
a. Start Internet Explorer and click the Tools icon and then click Internet Options.<br />
b. Click the Programs Tab and click the Manage add-ons button.<br />
c. From the Show dropdown selection, select Run without Permissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Look for the following add-ons in the displayed list and make sure the Status is listed as Enabled.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Note: When checking to see if the add-on is installed you can also verify the current version of the add-on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
The add-on for Microsoft Silverlight is listed as:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">• Microsoft Silverlight
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
The add-ons for Adobe Flash and Adobe Shockwave Player are listed as:<br />
<br />
• Shockwave Active X Control<br />
• Shockwave Flash Object </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
The add-on for Java is listed as:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">• Java Plug-in (May be multiple add-ons)</span></p>

<div><br />
<div>So overall, am I able to play any Facebook games on my RT?&nbsp;</div>
<div>And</div>
<div>Will there be updates that will allow us to download third party apps like iTunes...</div>
<div>because I think that the RT is a brilliant piece of device that haven't yet been used&nbsp;</div>
<div>to the best of its ability and I feel by adding this tweak will really be useful and relevant.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank You so much :)</div>

            <p>Thank you for your reply Nyima!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was about to follow your suggestions when somebody mentioned a possible issue with the firewall in Bitdefender total security 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the advanced settings there is a feature called "Block Internet Connection Sharing" that once switched off solved the problem completely in an instant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly a feature that turned itself on once Bitdefender was reinstalled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thank you very much for your help and hopefully this will be useful &nbsp;to others that have encountered similar difficulties.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Ok, so small problem.&nbsp; I upgraded my laptop to win 10 home, and my desktop to win 10 pro when 10 first came out.&nbsp; I obtained a product key for win 10 education through my college.&nbsp; I asked the IT guy about the key, and he said that since it was a volume
 key, I could use it on multiple PCs.&nbsp; I first upgraded the laptop, then the desktop.&nbsp; The desktop will not activate, saying it was a use once key.&nbsp; Is there anyway that I can revert back to windows 10 pro?&nbsp; For some reason there are no system restore points,
 and I never received a pro key from when I upgraded.&nbsp; Will a full reinstall of win 10 reinstall pro or education, and will it ask me for a key?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Borderlands Modded Weapons... Gamerscore reset&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>The modded weapons that used to be on Borderlands... would that result in a gamerscore reset? Under the Terms of Use, it could be "considered" external means, but I'm not really sure... It seems like &nbsp;a lot of people would've had their gamerscores reset
 if modded weapons were a bad things, right? Plus there was that update that removed all the modded weapons... thank goodness. (: Any feedback would be appreciated. I've worked so hard on my meager gamerscore to have it reset because of something so petty...
 :(</p>

<p>Microsoft will only reset your gamerscore if you use game saves to obtain your achievements illegitimately. However, they WILL take more excessive actions if you are caught modding/hacking such as gamertag ban and or console ban.

<p>Oh Lord lol.. I'm nowhere near smart enough to actually mod anything :P To be 100% honest the weapon was brought into my game when I had no idea what was going on - it was my first time playing and I was very naive - but I used it for a few minutes and decided
 it was incredibly boring to use, so I tossed it sometime during my game. (: Lol the US Navy's core values are honor, courage, and commitment - and those values extend into my gaming life, as well. (:

<p>cheating in games is so 90's. i used codes for fun. And some achievement if perminted with them. But I never used glitch on my owned. But I haved took advances of developers stupitatey by haved a glitch achievement that allowed you get it from the develooper
 attended way to get it. But that developers doing. They should of fix it when they find out poeple where easy geting the achievement when you post not get the achievement in tghe frist place. And I do it again. If the developers made that same mistake as another
 developer did with there game. &nbsp;But i would used third party devices to get them. No. Becoues it retarded to do so.</p>

            <p>It's an Epson product.&nbsp; If a driver exists, it would be located where the manufacturer puts it - likely Epson's web site.</p>
<p>(All hardware support always has come from the hardware manufacturer - including the software/drivers to allow a device to communicate with an operating system.)</p>
<p>Looking here:<br />
<a href="https://download.epson-biz.com/modules/pos/index.php?page=all_prod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://download.epson-biz.com/modules/pos/index.php?page=all_prod</a></p>
<p>... I see that they start their list of that product line at TM-T88III...&nbsp; And goes up to TM-T88V?&nbsp; So unlikely it is supported in Windows 7 by Epson.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below: 
<br />
<br />1. Change the display settings: 
<br />
<br />Sometimes, the issue may be caused due to incompatible display settings. Changing the settings or restoring them to the default settings might solve the issue for you. 
<br />1. Press Windows key once 
<br />2, Select Settings from the start menu 
<br />3. Click System 
<br />4. In the System window, select the Display tab in the left hand panel (if it isn’t already). 
<br />5. In the display tab, change the size of your text using the bar on the right pane. This should be the bar under the Change the size of text, apps, and other items: 100% (Recommended) You can choose any percentage except for the 175%. Setting the bar to 175% is known to cause the issue. 
<br />After selecting the font size, click Ok and check if the error persists. 
<br />
<br />2. Close Programs like Anti-viruses: 
<br />
<br />1. Press CTRL, SHIFT and ESC key simultaneously (CTRL + SHIFT + ESC). 
<br />2. This should open the Task Manager. 
<br />3. In the Task manager, click the Processes 
<br />4.. The Processes tab has a number of columns, look at the Description column and find the process that is related to the anti-virus. It should have a name for the anti-virus you have. 
<br />5.Select the anti-virus process from the list and click End Process (bottom right corner). 
<br />6. Click Yes when prompted for confirmation. 
<br />
<br />Once done check if the problem is solved or not. If you are still experiencing the problem then make sure there aren’t any other security related programs running in the background. There might be programs other than the security programs that might be causing this issue. Try to turn off as many applications as you can to see if the problem is solved. 
<br />
<br />3. Restart the File Explorer: 
<br />Some of the technical problems can be solved by a simple restart, so why not do the same for the file explorer? It does tend to solve the problem from time to time; to do so, follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Press CTRL, SHIFT and ESC key simultaneously (CTRL + SHIFT + ESC). 
<br />2. This should open the Task Manager. 
<br />3. In the Task manager, click the Processes 
<br />4. Locate and select the Windows Explorer. 
<br />5. Click the Restart bottom at the bottom right corner 
<br />This will restart the file explorer and that will be the end of the problem. 
<br />
<br />
<br />4. Change File Explorer Options: 
<br />
<br />Changing the File Explorer’s “Open File Explorer To:” option has helped solve the issue fr a lot of users. The problems seems to appear if this option isn’t set to “This PC” option. Follow the steps given below to change this setting. 
<br />
<br />1. Press and Hold Windows key and press R 
<br />2. Type control panel and press Enter or click Ok 
<br />3. Type File Explorer Options in the search bar 
<br />4. Select File Explorer Options 
<br />5. This will open the Folder Options 
<br />6. Select the General tab if it isn’t already 
<br />7. Select This PC from the drop down menu in Open File Explorer To: 
<br />Once done, click Ok and the problem should be resolved. 
<br />
<br />
<br />5. Clear the Cache &amp; Create New Path 
<br />
<br />Clearing the cache or history of the Windows Explorer and creating a new path has solved the issue for a lot of users. So, here are the steps for clearing cache and creating a new path. 
<br />
<br />1. In the toolbar, right click the File Explorer icon and select Unpin from toolbar. 
<br />2. Press and Hold Windows key and press R 
<br />3. Type control panel and press Enter or click Ok 
<br />4. Type File Explorer Options in the search bar 
<br />5. Select File Explorer Options 
<br />6. This will open the Folder Options 
<br />7. Select the General tab if it isn’t already 
<br />8.In the General tab, click the Clear button in the Privacy section. 
<br />9.Now, close the Windows Explorer by clicking the X at the top right corner of the window 
<br />10. Right click on the Desktop at any empty space. 
<br />11. Click New and then click Shortcut. 
<br />12. This will open the Create new shortcut 
<br />13, In the dialog box, type C:\Windows\explorer.exe and click Next. 
<br />14. Rename this file to File Explorer and click Finish. 
<br />
<br />I hope it works. please let me know 
<br />
<br />Best Regards, 
<br />
<br />Diego R.

    <title>Upgrade question- Arcade to Slim - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaw lv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade question- Arcade to Slim</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Xbox 360 Arcade console and I can tell it's about to kick the bucket. I&nbsp;found a really nice price on a Xbox 360 Slim, however before I purchase it I have a few questions and was hoping someone could help me:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Can I simply attach my current&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;used on my Arcade console to my Slim... or is that what transfer cables are for? I haven't&nbsp;had a chance to look at the top of&nbsp;a Slim console yet so I don't know if it has the same setup as the Arcade console where
 you simply attach the&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;to the top of the console.</p>
<p>2. The Slim doesn't require new/upgraded controllers... right? I figured not but I didn't want to assume that.</p>
<p>3. I have a wireless adapter on my Arcade console that I currently use to connect to my wireless router. Can I use this same wireless adapter on my Slim or do I have to use the built in wi-fi that comes with the Slim?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.xbox360achievements.org%2fforum%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fsmiley.gif" /></p>

<p>[quote user="JAW LV"]1.&nbsp;Can I simply attach my current&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;used on my Arcade console to my Slim..[/quote]No.[quote]or is that what transfer cables are for?[/quote]Not really. The Transfer Cable allows you to Copy or Move data to and from an original
 360 HDD, but will not allow use of that drive as a HDD or storage device in-game on the 360 S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need HDD space, your best bet is to get a 360 S 250GB. That includes a 250GB HDD. If you're waiting until September, the Gears of War 3 limited/special edition console will come with a 320GB HDD, along with two of the d-pad controllers.[quote]I haven't&nbsp;had
 a chance to look at the top of&nbsp;a Slim console yet so I don't know if it has the same setup as the Arcade console where you simply attach the&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;to the top of the console.[/quote]It doesn't. The HDD on the 360 S fits into an internal bay hidden behind
 a trap door on the right/bottom of the console.[quote]2. The Slim doesn't require new/upgraded controllers... right?[/quote]Correct. All 360 controllers will work with the 360 S.[quote]3. I have a wireless adapter on my Arcade console that I currently use
 to connect to my wireless router. Can I use this same wireless adapter on my Slim or do I have to use the built in wi-fi that comes with the Slim?[/quote]You can use it. If the 360 S detects a 360 wireless adapter attached it will disable the internal adapter.
 Keep in mind only the black WiFi adapter came with the stand needed to use the adapter stand-alone (though if you have a HD DVD drive you can attach either original adapter to it).</p>

<p><em>1, You would need a HDD designed for the slim, the&nbsp;current consoles HDD will not fit in the slim.<br />
<br />
2, If your Slim had a HDD then you can either use an official MS&nbsp;transfer cable or a USB flash drive to
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/Transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">move your content</a>. But if your console is the 4GB you will need to buy an official 250GB&nbsp;HDD if you want to download/install games etc.
<br />
(The 4BG is just flash memory).<br />
<br />
3, The controllers you have for your current 360 will work just fine on your new console.<br />
<br />
4, Your slim has built in Wi Fi so you will not need to use the adapter off your old unit if you do not want too.<br />
<br />
Hope this covers all your questions.</em></p>

            <p>When you say "it won't even reset." Is it because it can't get through the boot up sequence and you can't get to the Home screen, so you can't access the UI to do the reset? &lt;I can only assume that this is the case. If it is the case, there is still a way to reset the console to factory defaults using a flash drive. It will require [obviously] a flash drive, that has 4GB minimum of space to download the files to, formatted NTFS and a Windows based PC.</p><p><br /></p><p>It will also require you to perform a specific set of steps, so you'll want to make sure you've familiarized yourself with the process. I'd read through it a couple of times (if it were me) just to make sure, as it isn't something I'd want to get wrong.</p><p><br /></p><p>The instructions, in addition to a link to the downloadable reset file, can be found <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/browse/xbox-one/console/troubleshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.

            <p>Is your console under warranty? If so send it back to Microsoft, let them fix THEIR mess. If it's not, try Blue's suggestion. In my opinion, you shouldn't be doing his suggestion unless your a mature experienced technician. Best to have someone who actually knows what they're doing, rather than struggle to follow step by step instructions which the normal young person wouldn't even bother with. </p>

<h2>            Changing the position of the ALT-TAB &#40;change active windows&#41; pop-up menu</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there is any way of moving the position of the pop-menu that appears when you cycle through windows when pressing ALT+TAB. It currently shows up in the center of the screen, but is it possible to move it to, say, the left hand side
 of the screen? (The reason I'm doing this is because unfortunately a part of the LCD screen is broken).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>There is no way I know of to move the&nbsp;<em>Alt+Tab</em> graphic to another area &nbsp;of the screen to avoid a damaged screen area. You might try the alternative method of Windows key+Tab to see if that gives you results you can work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, the price of repairing/replacing a laptop's screen have come down incredibly in the last year or so. If you are thinking that it is simply not worth replacing, you might want to investigate what a reputable shop will charge to replace the screen or
 even do it yourself if you feel up to it (there are numerous You Tube videos on the subject). You might find that the cost is half (or less) from what you previously expected it to be.,</p>

<p>Click Install updates. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
</p>

 a key. Wait while the Anytime Upgrade page is loaded, click the Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade to buy it.</p>
