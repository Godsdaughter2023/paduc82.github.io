            <p>As noted, the free upgrade offer is only for Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to work around this is to migrate your computer to the Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview now and you will qualify for the final release.</p>

This represents an unprecedented change in Microsoft's business model of requiring purchase of a license. Windows 10 will be offered two ways to existing Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 users. You will be able to download the update through Windows Update or you can download .ISO media and use it do an in place upgrade. For many persons, using ISO media will be the preferred method since you will have a backup copy for reinstall purposes if needed. Also for persons with limited bandwidth, this will be an excellent way avoid the need to download the update more than once if you have multiple computers. So lets take a look at upgrading to W

    <title>Can&#39;t charge or turn on 6230i - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brucedes---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t charge or turn on 6230i</h2>
                    I have a 6230i, which is about 1 year old, but about last week, the battery ran out, so I tried charging it, but it wouldn't work. Nothing came up on screen, and none of the lights came on, and I'm unable to switch it on. The charger isn't the problem,
 as I'm able to charge other phones with it, so I suspect it might be the battery or the phone itself. Does anyone have any ideas of what I can do to sort the phone out before I have to take it to a repair center? Thanks.

            Could possibly be the battery, I just thought if you remove the battery then try turning the phone on with the charger plugged in and see if that works, but then realised it doesnt as I just tried it, so ignore that one ha ha. Id try another battery in
 it and see if that solves the prob, if that doesnt work, it might either be totally screwed or just might need re flashing if the firmware has gone down the pan for some reason.

            How long have you left the battery on charge for, if it is completely drained of charge then it will take several hours to charge even just a little bit. Try charging overnight and then have a look in the morning.

            If the handset is under warranty you can take it to a carfone warehouse repair centre who will check it out.<br />
<br />
They can also perform a software update.<br />

Good luck

            I have had exactally the same problem with my phone. I have fitted a new battery and it works ok so there is no problem wit the unit but the battery is only a year old and as it is a phone I use in Portugal it only gets used once a month. Surely the batteries
 should last longer than this!

            I have had that problem with my phone as well. I've charged the phone and it will not charge; I've changed the battery and it still won't charge. It worked perfectly last night but it wouldn't turn on this morning. I have dont nothing to my phone that
 would cause this apart from install an update for Visual Radio from the Nokia website.

<h2>            IE 11 not responding, freezing much of the time, crashing occasionally and accepting too many privacy items</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked through the other questions and answers and nothing helped. I have a new laptop with Windows 10 and Internet Explorer preloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE 11 in Windows 10 doesn't respond nearly all of the time when I am online. I get, maybe around 1-10 minutes,&nbsp;and the freezing, not responding and crashing cuts in. I can't tell you how much time I waste on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I have to refresh and if that doesn't work I close IE and open my Norton Utilities 16 and click the one button clean-up function. There&nbsp;are usually anywhere from 300 to 1000s of privacy items removed in the end report (and registry fixes sometimes...).</p>
<p>I have to do this over and over to get maybe 5 minutes or so on average to surf or research or play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is &nbsp;there an upcoming update to deal with this problem? Is there something else I can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>help!....... thank you...</p>

<p>Re: Sachin V on April 12 2016. "I suggest you to <strong>Check </strong>all the
<strong>SSL certificates </strong>in <strong>Advanced Tab</strong> and click <strong>
Apply."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not explain what checking all the SSL certificates actually do or do not do. Can you input on this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After IE 11 reset By Default in IE 11 under the SLL certificates every SSL is checked by Default
<strong>except for SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You did not input what checking all SSL's will or will not do as in, if it will cause security problems? Changes of problems with the security of my PC, etc. I never had problems with IE 11 on Windows 7 being so slow to load as I do now with Windows 10 upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Window 10 Home upgrade from Windows 7 home that was running IE 11 and recently did the IE 11 Tools Option Browsing History delete and reset which normally resets my home page (msn) but it did not reset the home page thinking Windows 10 had something
 to do with not resetting IE 11 properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my IE 11 set/checked to clear all history (cookies and browsing history, etc.)&nbsp;when the browser is closed I find ton's of cookies each day that are still on my PC even after running IE 11 Delete History, cookies, etc. I know this by running a quick
 scan directly after the IE 11 Delete History and reset in that&nbsp;my Norton Security still finds tons of cookies. So it appears that Windows 10 upgrade and IE are not working well as a team&nbsp;and or&nbsp;Windows 10 does not allow IE 11 to perform the way it supposed
 to and used to on Windows 7 with no issues.</p>

    <title>Samsung Focus S &#40;i937&#41; Bluetooth Will Not Turn On - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Samsung Focus S &#40;i937&#41; Bluetooth Will Not Turn On &#40;Problem&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung SCH i937 running 7.10.7720.68. Been using it without any issues for about 8 months. I have several bluetooth devices paired, been able to have mutliple simultaneous connections, swtich back and forth, etc. All working fine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I turned off my bluetooth on the phone and now it will not turn back on. If I flip the soft "switch" it displays "Searching" for a few seconds and then the switch flips right back to the "off" position. Tried rebooting, battery pull, etc., etc.
 No joy. The only thing that I can say may have precipitated this is that I have a bluetooth speaker that was connected to the phone, I tried to connect that speak to my laptop and while the laptop was connecting to the speaker was when I turned off bluetooth
 on the phone (for the very last time, ever apparantly) in order to release the speaker to the computer. I can't imagine why just simply turning off bluetooth on the phone while a completely different device was connecting would completely hose the bluetooth
 stack or profiles or whatever to the point that it will not turn back on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I researched this problem and there are a few other people that have reported the problem. The only fix seems to be a complete Power/Camera/DownVol reformat procedure. I find that totally unacceptable. There's clearly something jammed up in the bluetooth
 configuration and it just needs to be cleared&nbsp;or cleaned out. If I have to reformat my phone (serious procedure for me, many accounts, settings, data, apps, etc.) over something as stupid as this, I am going to be really upset with Windows Phone.
</p>
<p>I called ATT, they told me to call Samsung. I called Samsung, they said it was a Microsoft problem. I called Microsoft and they said there's no phone support for Windows Phone and to post my problem here. Okay, here I am. Please help me.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been a Windows Phone early adopter, I ran out and bought a first gen Focus in fall 2010, I'm an&nbsp;advocate and evangelist. I talk up the platform every chance I get. I have convinced at least 3 other people to ditch Android/iPhone for WP7. Any help
 would be greatly appreciated. This would be my first "bad" experience with Windows Phone, but I have got to say it's a really bad one. If I have to reformat this thing over freaking
<em>bluetooth, </em>when there should be some way to clear or purge the settings... that's going to really upset me. I have way too much time invested in configuring this thing. Please help.

            Update: AT&amp;T just released four updates for the Focus platforms that took my software version up to 7.10.8773.98, however the bluetooth problem remains. I have not yet formatted my phone but not having access to hands-free is rapidly moving out of the
 realm of mere annoyance and in to the realm of a real problem.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I notice that at least one other person has "me too'd" this post so this is really something that Microsoft should be looking into.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I would really appreciate a reply from the moderator to my post. I feel like MS is leaving me (us!) out in the cold here.</div>

            <p>Greetings Lappy486,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Answers Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can certainly understand your concern with this issue. I did review the links and did some research into this issue, if the troubleshooting steps you have tried did not resolve the issue, I am afraid it may look like you would have to perform a factory
 reset on the phone. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One alternative to this would be to restore a backup. Whenever you update your Windows Phone a backup us created in case of issues during the backup, restoring the backup would be one alternative to loading everything from scratch. For more information on
 restoring a backup check out the link below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/basics/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Restore A Backup To My Phone</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I do recognize this is an inconvenient issue and resolution, this does appear to be a common resolution for this type of issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a side note, I noticed that you mentioned contacting Microsoft Support and received the message that we do not support the Windows Phone. This is infact not true. Although we do not have phone based support for the Windows Phone, we do provide 24 hour

            <p>Tim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting a reply. Unfortuntately, this doesn't help me at all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I know how to reset the phone to factory default. This isn't an acceptable solution for a</p>
<p>problem such as this. I would ask that Microsoft put this on a list of known software bugs that</p>
<p>need to be addressed in the next operating system or patch release. Please direct me to a place</p>
<p>or site where I can officially report this bug and ask for an engineering resolution in the form of</p>
<p>a patch or an indication that it will be resolved in the next operating system release (such as the</p>
<p>disappearing keyboard problem).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The Zune software only stores the most recent backup of the phone. As my phone received updates AFTER the problem began (take note of my earlier post), I now have a phone backup that includes the problem and no other backup (all others appear to have
 been automatically erased). This brings up a whole other issue that I have with the Windows Phone / Zune platform, which is why can I not take a backup and keep any number of backups? The only way to back up the phone is to happen to need a software update.
 Hopefully in the next version of Windows Phone we will have a tool to be able to back up the phone. It's actually mind-blowing that a backup tool is not provided for Windows Phone already. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I was told about the mythical chat support over the phone as well, and was directed to the link you sent and either I cannot find any chat support there. If I follow your link, I see a page that askes me to select Windows Phone or Zune. I select Windows
 Phone. Then I see a page with some live tile looking icons that are support categories. There is nothing else on the page. I select "wireless" since that's closest to bluetooth and I select "contact support" since there's nothing else there to click on that
 looks like anything related to live chat, and I am taken to this forum. If there is chat out there, please tell me exactly how to find it because I have looked for many minutes and it's not obvious to me.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, this is a sad day for me. As I said, I was a Windows Phone early adopter, I have bought two Windows phones and convinced others to try the platform. I've talked it up every chance I get and I have been pretty happy with the platform overall.
 But this experience has shattered my perception of the product and Microsoft's support and dedication to the platform. Trying to get support for what is obviously a software problem has been a frustrating maze that ultimately leads to a dead end. The fact
 that Microsoft offers no tools for:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A) Taking a backup of the device, at will</p>
<p>B) Synchronizing apps and app data</p>
<p>C) Synchronizing settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Makes the reformat procedure of the phone a game-ending experience. I will literally have to put tens of hours into this thing to try to get it back to where it was, reinstall applications one at a time, reconfigure all apps, data gone and no way to evacuate
 it,&nbsp;recreate all my home screen groups, etc. etc. etc. the list goes on and on. It almost seems like it's not even worth it, since I have no guarantee that this problem won't happen again or that Microsoft is doing anything at all about it. If I have to start
 all over again and if Microsoft doesn't care to support its users, then maybe I'll just switch to a different platform. I have to start over anyway.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Challenge to Microsoft - convince me why I should stay with Windows Phone. </p>

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no chat support at the link you provided. Here's what happens when I click that link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I am redirected to <a href="http://gethelp.live.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://gethelp.live.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;where a screen says "How can we help you?" and there are two options to click - Windows Phone and Zune. Screenshot linked below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freeimagehosting.net/pgt21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freeimagehosting.net/pgt21</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I click Windows Phone. I am taken to a screen with some icons on it representing topics or categories. There is no option for chat support. (<a href="http://gethelp.live.com/en-us/Pages/wp.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gethelp.live.com/en-us/Pages/wp.aspx</a>) Screenshot
 linked below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freeimagehosting.net/1w3q4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freeimagehosting.net/1w3q4</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3: If I hover over the wireless topic&nbsp;icon (which is the topic that mentions bluetooth) I see an option&nbsp;that says "Contact Us" which is the closest thing I can find to something that could possibly be chat support. So I click on that. (<a href="http://gethelp.live.com/en-us/Pages/wp.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gethelp.live.com/en-us/Pages/wp.aspx</a>)
 Screenshot linked below: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.freeimagehosting.net/dbnvw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freeimagehosting.net/dbnvw</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. After I click on "Contact Us" I am taken to a screen that asks me if I want to contact the mobile manufacturer or use the support forums. Again, no option for "chat support". (<a href="http://gethelp.live.com/en-us/Pages/MSO/wp_mo-oem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gethelp.live.com/en-us/Pages/MSO/wp_mo-oem.aspx</a>)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. I already know that the options for support forums takes me right to here, so I suppose I click on Manufacturer support. I am taken to a screen that says "Still Looking?" Yes, I am still looking. (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/contact-us.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/contact-us.aspx</a>)

<p><a href="http://www.freeimagehosting.net/wuot7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freeimagehosting.net/wuot7</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. This is already a dead end, but suppose&nbsp;I&nbsp;try clicking on "Windows Phone" under "Support"... well now I'm taken to another site with various options, none of which are "chat support". (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/support.aspx</a>)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. So there's nothing on the page for chat support, but suppose I try clicking "Get Support" under "Support Options"... and we've come full circle, back to the same screen in #2.

            Even I have the exact same problem. I have Samsung Focus S. My bluetooth stopped working. I paired up with my car stereo It worked fine untill yesterday (for a day) and then I turned off my bluetooth and turned it back on. After turning it on, it shows
 "searching.."&nbsp; for few seconds and then it automatically turns off. If multiple ppl have the same problem I am sure its a software bug which need to be fixed. I hope Microsoft don't suggest the lame formatting the phone for this stupid problem.
<br />
<br />
@ Microsoft: Is this prob fixed? <br />

            <p>I found&nbsp; no solution to this problem except the factory reset. I finally found chat support under "Zune Music Pass" here:
<a href="https://support.live.com/default.aspx?productkey=oepwp7cf&amp;brand=oepwp7&amp;ct=chatts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.live.com/default.aspx?productkey=oepwp7cf&amp;brand=oepwp7&amp;ct=chatts</a></p>
<p><br />
I talked to the Microsoft representative for a long time and got no solution. He finally convinced me to reformat the phone. Bluetooth is now working again, but I do not feel in any way satisfied by the support I received or my experience with Microsoft. There
 is no admission that the problem is in the software, although it obviously is. There is no indication that Microsoft is working on it. There is no indication that Microsoft takes this problem seriously. There is no indication that Microsoft plans to correct
 the problem in a future system release, let alone a patch. There is no solution offered to help people with the problem to save their files or data or settings. Basically, Microsoft treated me like it didn't really care whether I am a customer or not.

The complete chat session is quoted below. Hope it helps somebody. </p>

You are now chatting with 'Sam B.'.<br />
Sam B.: Hello Lappy486, My name is Sam B. with Microsoft Customer Support and I will be assisting you today. For your records, your service request number is: 1179897514<br />
Please give me a few moments as I review the information you've submitted. <br />
Lappy486: Thank you. <br />
Sam B.: Alright Lappy, so you're not able to turn on the bluetooth on your phone?<br />
Lappy486: I'm afraid that's the case, yes. <br />
Sam B.: I see. Are you receiving any errors?<br />
Lappy486: No, when I press the soft "switch" to turn on bluetooth, it waits for a few seconds and then the switch turns right back off again.
<br />
Lappy486: There is no message<br />
Sam B.: I see. Try turning your phone off, and then removing the battery for about a full minute before reinserting it and turning your phone back on.<br />
Lappy486: I tried that already. It didn't help. <br />
Sam B.: I see. Just a moment, please.<br />
Lappy486: I've been through a lot of troubleshooting already. <br />
Lappy486: If I could summarize for you. <br />
Sam B.: Please do.<br />
Lappy486: I've tried rebooting the device, I've tried the battery pull, I've tried making sure all my previously paired bluetooth devices are turned off, I've tried making sure they are all turned on, I've tried some combinations of on and off...<br />
Lappy486: I've called AT&amp;T<br />
Lappy486: I've called Samsung<br />
Lappy486: And I've called Microsoft<br />
Lappy486: And I've been back and forth with a moderator in the Microsoft Answers forum.<br />
Sam B.: Could you link me to that topic, please?<br />
Lappy486: Basically, everyone is telling me I have to reset the phone to factory defaults.

Lappy486: There are some other people that have posted with the same problem. <br />
Lappy486: It might take a while to read the whole post. <br />
Lappy486: I apologize for my slightly heated tone. <br />
Lappy486: It's been frustrating. <br />
Lappy486: I finally found the chat, obviously. <br />
Sam B.: It looks like you may have missed a part of Tim's last message - he said a possible alternative to a factory reset would be restoring a backup. I can definitely understand how this can be frustrating, but basically the only thing you'll lose even in
 the event of a factory reset is saved application data and call/text logs - your purchased and downloaded apps, all of your accounts, and the contacts and emails associated with them are all recoverable.<br />
Lappy486: No, I didn't miss it. <br />
Lappy486: It's not a viable option. <br />
Lappy486: The backup is only taken right before a software upgrade. <br />
Lappy486: It just so happens that my phone received updates after the problem started.
<br />
Lappy486: So I have a backup, but the backup contains the problem. <br />
Lappy486: This is a complaint I have about the Zune/Phone integration, it's not possible to take a backup any time you want. If it were possible, I wouldn't feel so bad about resetting the phone since I could reconfigure it and then take a backup in case the
 problem happens again. <br />
Lappy486: But in this case, I have no guarantee that the problem won't come back and I won't be right back where I am now.
<br />
Sam B.: I see. In that case, a factory reset is the best option here. As I said, all of your purchased and downloaded apps, your accounts, and the contacts and emails associated with them, are all recoverable.<br />
Lappy486: Yes, I do understand all of that. <br />
Sam B.: I can understand that this is not an ideal solution, but we've exhausted all of the troubleshooting steps available here. If you had not already spoken with Samsung, I would have suggested speaking with them.<br />
Lappy486: At this point, if this is the only solution available from Microsoft then I would like to file an official bug report and an official complaint.
<br />
Lappy486: How can I do that?<br />
Sam B.: There is no bug report to file, because we haven't tried the final troubleshooting step to see if we can resolve the issue.<br />
Lappy486: Let's assume for the sake of argument that resetting the phone does resolve the issue. Can I then file a report?<br />
Sam B.: No, because it would have been resolved.<br />
Lappy486: That doesn't make any sense. <br />
Lappy486: The software is malfunctioning. I am not the only one having this problem.
<br />
Lappy486: There is a bug in the bluetooth software causing this problem. Resetting the phone is not a solution, it's a work-around.
<br />
Sam B.: It's also possible that it's the hardware that's not working properly. We have no way of knowing without a hard reset.<br />
Lappy486: Pulling the battery is a hard reset. Reformatting the phone is reloading the operating system.
<br />
Lappy486: This is like saying that my wireless is not working on my PC and you want me to reformat my hard drive. That's a software issue.
<br />
Lappy486: Samsung has indicated that they don't believe it to be a hardware problem. They indicated that I needed software support which is why I'm here.
<br />
Sam B.: In that instance you could just try installing the wireless device in another computer. Unfortunately there is no comparable method of troubleshooting for us.<br />
Lappy486: So, my point is that this is a bug and it needs to be reported to development. I am trying to be a good citizen here.
<br />
Lappy486: Reformatting the phone would actually prove that it was a software problem.
<br />
Lappy486: I'd like to know what are my escalation options here. I'd like to talk to management if necessary.
<br />
Sam B.: If it worked, then yes, it would, and at that point we could submit that issue to our software engineers.<br />
Sam B.: There will be no escalation on this issue.<br />
Lappy486: Okay, so you are telling me that if I reload the phone software to factory defaults and it works, then we will report the issue to engineering. Is that correct?<br />
Sam B.: Yes, we can do that.<br />
Lappy486: Are you saying that you will not escalate me as a valued customer? <br />
Sam B.: I'm saying that I can't escalate this issue, regardless of who is experiencing it.<br />
Lappy486: Is there any escalation path available to Windows Phone users?<br />
Sam B.: No, not for this issue, because there is no further troubleshooting past performing a factory reset.<br />
Lappy486: Is there an escalation path for other types of issues, unlike this one?<br />
Sam B.: Yes, for example if you have a credit card you can't add to your account and your card company or bank is not preventing any charges, then it is an issue with your account that will need to be resolved at a higher level.<br />
Lappy486: Is there an escalation path for any kind of technical issue, such as where a software feature is not working properly?<br />
Sam B.: In some cases, yes. Not this one.<br />
Lappy486: Does Microsoft want to have an opportunity to diagnose problems such as this one, to understand a problem that is affecting more than one user and to improve the product?<br />
Sam B.: If I escalate the issue, it will be sent back to me by an engineer suggesting that I email you asking to perform a factory reset.<br />
Lappy486: Because the factory reset is known to correct the problem, I understand this.
<br />
Lappy486: Basically, here is what I want:<br />
Lappy486: I would like someone to just say to me "Microsoft is aware of this problem. We know it is a problem in the software, we are working to diagnose it, and it will be corrected in the next version of the software or in a patch"<br />
Sam B.: We do not know that it is a problem in the software.<br />
Lappy486: I see. <br />
Lappy486: This is a case where we do not know if it is a software problem or a hardware problem, and neither Samsung nor Microsoft is willing to say it is their problem.
<br />
Sam B.: This is a case where we have no way of verifying either way without performing a final troubleshooting step.<br />
Lappy486: Okay. I will perform the final troubleshooting step. Will we leave this case open while I do that?<br />
Sam B.: Yes.<br />
Lappy486: Thank you for your time, and for your patience. <br />
Lappy486: For the record, I would not be doing this if I didn't love the platform. I am trying to find a way to work with Microsoft on this, but it's been really difficult.
<br />
Sam B.: I can understand the frustration Lappy, and we appreciate your patience in the matter.<br />
Lappy486: When I have performed the reset and tested again, how will I re-initiate support?<br />
Sam B.: Ah, I thought you meant you were leaving the chat open. I will have to close the case, but it can still be looked at by other agents. To resume support you can just return to chat, or you can respond to the email you'll be sent when I close the case.<br />
Lappy486: Hmmm...<br />
Lappy486: Time to bite the bullet.<br />
Lappy486: I can do the reset now, I suppose. <br />
Sam B.: I will be here.<br />
Lappy486: Tell me, when I do it, will I still have the same software version?<br />
Sam B.: No, you'll go back to the version the phone started with, although since the issue didn't happen after an update, I think we can troubleshoot it before trying to update the phone.<br />
Lappy486: Oh my goodness. <br />
Lappy486: It's going to take hours for the phone to take all necessary updates. <br />
Sam B.: Unfortunately yes, however as I said, we can at least make sure bluetooth works before that.<br />
Lappy486: Is it recommended to delete the device from Zune prior to performing the factory reset?<br />
Sam B.: It's not necessary.<br />
Lappy486: Is there any way to evacuate the call logs and text messages from the phone before performing the factory reset?<br />
Sam B.: There's no official way of doing that, although there is sometimes a utility available from your mobile operator to do so. Typically this costs extra, however. There may also be some 3rd party apps capable of this.<br />
Lappy486: I think just to be on the safe side, I am going to erase content and forget the phone in Zune. I've had some wireless sync problems that might have been related to a previous phone reset.<br />
Lappy486: Okay, here we go.<br />
Lappy486: So, powering the device off. Then when powering on hold POWER / CAMERA / DOWNVOL right?<br />
Sam B.: Actually, you'll want to go to Settings, then About on the device, and then tap "reset my phone".<br />
Lappy486: Does it do the same thing?<br />
Sam B.: It should, I prefer doing it that way because it's a bit simpler and faster.<br />
Lappy486: Hmmm<br />
Lappy486: Something odd happened. Stand by.<br />
Lappy486: Okay, no worries. I must have accidentally had a button held when I turned it back on. It did something weird but I rebooted again and am about to reset through the software.
<br />
Lappy486: I've successfully reset the phone. That was fast. <br />
Lappy486: Interesting. It shows my software version as 7.10.8773.98<br />
Lappy486: All the updates are still present. <br />
Sam B.: I see. That can sometimes happen with the most recent updates.<br />
Lappy486: Bluetooth turned right on<br />
Lappy486: Successfully paired to my headset. <br />
Lappy486: Making a call... works.<br />
Sam B.: Great! I will make sure to forward our chat to the delivery team and they will look into the issue.<br />
Sam B.: Is there anything else I can assist you with, Lappy486? <br />
Lappy486: I still have that backup copy of my phone's image that includes whatever configuration caused the bluetooth to stop working. Would it help the team diagnose the issue if I sent that file to Microsoft?<br />
Sam B.: Unfortunately it would not - we can't accept it because it has personal information.<br />
Lappy486: No log files or anything at all that would help then?<br />
Sam B.: No. Typically issues that are resolved with a factory reset are caused by data corruption - this can happen with age or, very rarely, when downloading something and it gets mishandled by the software. All they need to know is what was wrong, and how
 it was resolved, and they can work out what happened based on that.<br />
Lappy486: Let me include the following information then. <br />
Lappy486: When the problem occurred I had two devices paired to the phone. <br />
Lappy486: One is a Plantronics M100 headset<br />
Lappy486: The other is a Rocketfish RF-SPX15 speakerphone<br />
Lappy486: When the problem occurred was when the RF-SPX15 speakerphone was actively connected to the phone and the Plantronics headset was not.
<br />
Lappy486: The speakerphone became disconnected from the phone because another device connected to it, and the phone was in "connecting" status to the speakerphone. At this point I turned off bluetooth on the phone to release the speaker to the other device.
<br />
Lappy486: Bluetooth never turned back on after that. <br />
Lappy486: I assume that something became corrupted in the bluetooth configuration due to disabling bluetooth while it was attempting to connect.
<br />
Lappy486: It seems to me that this kind of problem should be solvable short of a factory reset.
<br />
Lappy486: For example, the bluetooth software could detect that it had failed to load and automatically clean the configuration.
<br />
Lappy486: Or there could be a utility to clean the configuration of the phone selectively, rather than by resetting the entire phone to factory default.
<br />

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors.<br />
<br />
2. Perform Quick Repair of the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Review following link - https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/manage/office-365-and-windows-10-problems-and-solutions<br />
<br />
6. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
7. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
8. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
9. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
10. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
11. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
12. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
13. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

<h2>            Can&#39;t print to pdf in Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    I am using Windows Live Mail in Office 2010 on a Windows 7 computer. &nbsp;When I select pdf as my printer to make a pdf file of the e-mail message; it will create an unreadable file. &nbsp;It takes the text from the e-mail and changes it to ascii text. &nbsp;This is
 the only program that does this. &nbsp;What is the fix?

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d like to explain that this change is for SharePoint Online public website. It doesn’t mean SharePoint Online will go away.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SharePoint Online public website is a public website service from Microsoft. Those tenants signed up before Mar 9, 2015 has the ability to create new public web site. The tenant signed up after that date can only create private SharePoint
 Online site collections. Users can<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-a-public-website-with-Office-365-a8178510-501d-4bd8-9921-b04f2e9517a5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> create public website from our partners</a>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, if you have SharePoint Online public website (normally it looks like
<a href="https://domain-public.sharepoint.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domain-public.sharepoint.com</a> or https://customdomain.com), please pay more attention to the article mentioned in your post. For SharePoint Online services, you can continue to use it if you have the
 related licenses in your tenant. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Tim</span></p>

<p>Thanks, that was clear.</p>

            AFAIK.. it is just a table in onenote and not an Excel object. hence the formulas will not work and everything has to be entered manually including calculations.&nbsp;

    <title>Change source in copy of Pivot Table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bjw0945  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change source in copy of Pivot Table</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet in Excel for Mac (version 15.32).&nbsp; I have a sheet created via pivot table which gets its information from a 2017 source sheet.&nbsp; I have re-named the copy.&nbsp; Now, I want the renamed copy to obtain its information from a 2018 source sheet.&nbsp;
 Is this possible, or do I have to create a new pivot table from scratch from the 2018 source sheet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any guidance.</p>

<p><span>Hi BJW,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you create a pivot table through getting data source from the same workbook, you have to create a new pivot table to get new data source. The created pivot table is fixed by the data source. We could not modify the pivot table through
</span><span>modifying the data source.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example, you have created a pivot table getting 2017 source sheet. Even if you have created the copied workbook, you also need to create a new pivot table to get 2018 source sheet.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Users password expires</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have an admin question about users passwords.</p>
<p>A user has a notification that password has expired in desktop outlook. Thus he cannot login to receive email. However, the office 365 password still works in the browser, so he can log in to 365 and also OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How can I stop passwords expiring in bulk for selected users?</p>
<p>2. Do I now need to manually reset this users password? I want it to be the same as before.</p>
<p>3. I am wondering why outlook desktop passwords can expire but not account password for the browser login?</p>

            <span>Hi DaveTQM,<br />
<br />
Here are the answers to your questions.<br />
1. How can I stop passwords expiring in bulk for selected users?<br />
You can refer to the article below to make user passwords expire after a certain number of days, or set passwords to never expire.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-your-password-expiration-policy-0f54736f-eb22-414c-8273-498a0918678f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set your password expiration policy</a><br />
<br />
2. Do I now need to manually reset this user’s password? I want it to be the same as before.<br />
Yes, you need to reset this user’s password. And when you reset the password, you can let the user change his password the next time he login to OWA.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Admins-Reset-a-password-for-one-or-more-users-in-Office-365-7a5d073b-7fae-4aa5-8f96-9ecd041aba9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Admins: Reset a password for one or more users in Office 365</a><br />
<br />
3. I am wondering why outlook desktop passwords can expire but not account password for the browser login.<br />
Based on my experience, the password expiry date of an Office 365 account should not be different in Outlook client and OWA. So I would first suggest you reset the password for the customer and then let him use the new password to login to the Outlook client.
 If the issue persists, it will be related to the Outlook client side instead of the Office 365 account password. Then I would suggest you try to repair this Outlook client as said in the article below:<br />

            Off the top of my head my guess would be that your file name (with path) is too long. That's more than 250 characters with the spaces. I don't think the Trademark symbol is helping you any either.

<div>As a test you might try shortening that WAY down and see if it lets you save. At least then you'll know what the cause is....</div>

            You can subscribe to the internet calendar within your Windows Live account.&nbsp; The calendar will show up as a separate calendar under Windows Live Calendar and it will then be synced to your phone and show up as an integrated calendar on your windows phone.<br />
<br />
To subscribe to an internet calendar, log into your windows live account from a computer.&nbsp; Then select the calendar and select the "Subscribe" option (found at the top of the calendar).&nbsp; You will be taken to a screen where you can input the Calendar URL.<br />
<br />
Once you've set up the subscription in your Windows Live account, the calendar will be synced to your phone and should show up in phone's calendar. You can toggle the calendar on and off by opening up the calendar hub, then tap the three dots in the lower right
 hand corner of the screen, find the subscribed calendar in the list of available calendars that are synced to the phone.&nbsp; Tap the ON/OFF toggle button.

<p>We almost have what you want now using the Task View.&nbsp; E.g. press Win-Tab, pick the window you want to "maximize", right-click its thumbnail and choose Move to... New desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once it opens press Win+CursorUp.&nbsp; When I close the window I see the Task View
 again and could close the desktop that way or apparently with Win+Ctrl+F4 (looks obvious now that I see it but I admit I didn't think of it.)</p>

<h2>            Build 17046</h2>
                    I have 2 computers. 1- HP Envy 750-114 Desktop.&nbsp; This unit updated w/o problems to 17069 then 17074. All worked extremely well.&nbsp; 2- HP-Pavilion 15-bk151nr convertible laptop. This unit is stuck on Build 17046.&nbsp; I have tried all the fixes recommended in
 the forum. Then I did a full reset keeping nothing, updating the required HP drivers only.&nbsp; It remains stuck. error &nbsp;0x80070020.&nbsp; Next attempt was to reinstall the original OS from HP recovery disk W10.&nbsp; Unit updated to 17046 without problem and has been stuck
 there for a month. Any ideas?&nbsp;

            Did you install the insiders as a clean install or as an upgrade? as that system came with some bloatware from HP which maybe causing issues, try removing any of the 3rd party Virus/Malware programs using the tools from the makers of such programs, also
 remove anything plugged into Media/USB slots and if using a docking station try upgrading removed from the dock.

<p>There are some older AMD processors that are blocked from getting the newest builds, due their incompatibility with the Spectre and Meltdown OS fixes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You may be able to create an ISO for 17046 using files from the successful PC.&nbsp; There are user scripts to do this available online, such as uup-converter-wimlib, or UUPtoISO.&nbsp; Then you can do a clean install of 17074.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another method would be to run recoverydisk.exe to create recovery media on a USB stick for 17074.&nbsp; Then use that to install to the Pavilion 15.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you tried this one already?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_mac/transferring-my-yearly-subscription-from-a-windows/62f78777-e35d-40c9-938f-47a6417105d2">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_mac/transferring-my-yearly-subscription-from-a-windows/62f78777-e35d-40c9-938f-47a6417105d2</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Slides automatically going blank in PPT 07&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. aterius blank  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slides automatically going blank in PPT 07&#63;</h2>
                    For some reason I've got a couple of slides in a PPT 07 slideshow that are going blank of their own accord after all of their animations have run.&nbsp; One slide is relatively simple--just a text box and two small images--and the other is a bit more complicated,
 involving a large image, a small image, several text boxes, and several shapes (arrows).&nbsp; Both of these slides work just fine until the final animation runs.&nbsp; Once that animation has completed, each slide goes immediately and without prompting back to its
 original state, i.e., just an empty background.&nbsp; I have no idea what's causing this as all of my other slides are working just fine.&nbsp; I can find no particular setting to alter this behavior.&nbsp; Please help!

            Are you sure they are not transitioning to the NEXT slide and that slide is blank until the first animation there runs?

            Is it possible that you have exit animations assigned to the objects on those slides?

<p>Apart from added exits as Kathy says I can only repro this in two ways:</p>
<p>As above -The first click takes you to the next slide the click after starts the next slide animations</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>The animations are "with previous" +&nbsp; but they have "Hide on next click" selected in effect options</p>

            <p>I had the same problem loading a slideshow created by someone else a few years back, into PowerPoint 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked all "Hide on next click" settings and slide animations. Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally created a new slide, and one-by-one copied and pasted the objects over to the new slide. It worked. So after that, I deleted the slide that wasn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That doesn't solve the issue about what was causing this, but at least it is a work-around.</p>

<h2>            Rafflecopter no longer working after upgrade</h2>
                    I added the Windows 8.1 upgrade and IE 10 and now I cannot get Rafflecopter to open in my book contests (I'm a book reviewer). This is necessary. I have tried rebooting, updating all computer upgrades, etc., to no avail. Does anyone have suggestions?

            Thank you so much for your reply. I'm not getting any error messages. The Rafflecopter simply won't open. I did try this suggestion to no avail. It still doesn't work. I do not know what to do. Do you have other suggestions? I'm willing to try virtually
 anthing at this point.

            This did not fix the problem. &nbsp;Rafflecopter starts and says loading but doesn't actually load.

            I am still having the same problem; I have tried for MANY hours to contact Windows, to no avail. NOTHING has fixed this problem. Apparently, Windows does not care that their customers hate the software, are experiencing extensive problems, and are losing
 business as a result. I actually tried to chat live and the person SAID she was going to transfer me to someone else, told me to have a good evening, and disconnected the chat. This was after I had waited patiently for her to transfer, so the disconnect was
 quite deliberate. Clearly, Windows went live with the upgrade long before it was ready. I have been posting warnings wherever possible to tell people to avoid this extremely defective product and have told them about the lack of customer service. I will continue
 to do so until Windows helps me get this problem fixed. I have serious issues with my hands, making any time working on the computer incredibly painful. I should NOT have to suffer because Windows doesn't want to help me. From what I

            <p>Trying to use Windows 8 with Rafflecopter giveaways - a big headache!</p>
<p>Tried Chrome FF and now IE which is probably the lesser of the evils.</p>
<p>Never had any problem entering before Windows 8.</p>
<p>Makes me wish I had my older computer.</p>
<p>Any tips would be appreciated.</p>
