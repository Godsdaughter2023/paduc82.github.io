<h2>            Computer freezes when trying to fax using Windows fax and scan</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows Fax and Scan</p>
<p>Using a Windows 7 64 bit OS.</p>
<p>All was working well with Windows Fax and Scan until i ran some Windows updates the last few days. All of sudden, when trying to fax a document out, the system basically hangs when hitting the dial/send button and then just disappears. No fax ever goes it.
</p>
<p>Did a system restore of 7 days back and cleaned the registry (cc cleaner)&nbsp;and then all also unistalled the Windows Fax Scan program from the control panel, restarted the computer and&nbsp; still same thing happens. Very frustraitng as i use this all the time
 and NEED to get it to work again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any leads of ideas??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have been having the same issues with our Windows Fax &amp; Scan on our new Windows 7 64 bit OS</p>
<p>I used it fine on my old computer which also ran Windows 7 64 bit OS with no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I also discovered I had issues with my DVD RW - It would not write to the DVD</p>
<p>The Status window would just disappear and although the drive could still be heard running it disappeared from my system if I clicked on my computer. I had to restart the computer or disable and re-enable the device under the device manager - (it did see
 it there)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP Support replaced the DVD RW because they thought the optical RW was bad, however it did not fix the problem. On working with HP Support a new Tech had us delete two registry files and restart the computer. This fixed the DVD issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the issue I am having with FAX &amp; SCAN seems similar, and sounds the same for the others I read about seeking a solution to this problem I wonder if this is a Registry isssue??? I am not familiar enough with Regedit to do this on my own, but would appreciate
 MS looking into this as being a solution to the issues with this software. I would prefer NOT to have to buy FAX software, but if Windows Fax and Scan does not operate consistently so that I can count on it to both SEND and RECEIVE faxes I will have to turn
 to other options. Please let me know what you find.</p>

<p>Recentemente comprei o Gears of War Triple Pack, e tentei resgatar o código para os mapas extras mas aparece código inválido. O jogo veio lacrado, com o selo do xbox 360, o cartão com o código veio com a tarja removível cobrindo o código como deveria ser.
 Tenho certeza que não estou digitando errado. Gostaria de saber o que fazer.</p>

<p>A unica forma conhecida de se conseguir esse pack é ter uma conta na Live US, e montar uma conexão VNP com algum servidor que esteja nos EUA.</p>
<p>Acho isso a maior sacanagem, não ter o DLC do all fronts aqui no Brasil.</p>
<p>Todo o resto do mundo usa VPN pra pegar esse pack, infelizmente.</p>

<p>Galera.... é simples....</p>
<p>O pack All Fronties NÃO tem na Live BR, por isso, que tem conta na Live BR não consegue restagar;</p>
<p>Na Live USA, tem o conteúdo, porém é bloquado por VPN. Ou seja, você só vai conseguir se fazer aqueles esquemas de "maquiar" o seu IP;</p>
<p>É possível que o pacote chegue ainda esse ano à live BR, e se isso acontecer, vai ser liberado e todos que possuem o cartão de download, vão poder resgatar numa boa.</p>
<p>Só temos que torcer que isso aconceça logo.</p>

<p>Infelizmente não Tiagox, gostaria de ter visto, mas não.... estou com esse pacote para baixar também e até agora nda...
</p>
<p>Eu estou na esperança com esse lançamento da nova dashboard (que está previso para ocorrer amanhã), que junto com ela venha algumas promoções na Live e novos conteúdos.</p>
<p>À alguns dias, nem promoção na nossa live tinha, hoje, existem poucas mais existem.</p>
<p>Alguns jogos que forma lançados à anos e tinha nas outras lives, não tinham na nosa... Recentemente, apareceram alguns...</p>
<p>É nessa esperança que estou torcendo que saia logo não apenas esse, mas vários outros conteúdos para o Brasil.</p>
<p>Agora, se nem com esse lançamento sair algo, aí é só VNP mesmo...</p>

<p>Cara, sinceramente, faz VPN logo.</p>
<p>Na época que começaram a falar de migração, de Live Brasil, etc. a maior bronca do pessoal eram justamente os mapas do Gears 1 e 2 que sempre foram bloqueados pra nós. A Microsoft não fez nada pra resolver esse problema em mais de um ano de Live, não vejo
 isso acontecendo agora por conta de uma atualização de dashboard.</p>

    <title>Strange BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brunop. barbosa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been facing BSOD once a week aproximately. It happens randomly. I am very confused. I don't know if it is a hardware or a driver issue and I don't know how to figure it out and solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>- run Memtest for 9 passes with no errors;</p>
<p>- run prime95 to stress CPU for several hour with no erros;</p>
<p>- run FurMark to stress GPU for hours with no erros and temperature below 78º C;</p>
<p>- run official diagnostic programs for Kingston SSD and Seagate HD in "full mode" and no errors found;</p>
<p>- run chkdsk and found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe useful facts:</p>
<p>- I have changed recently the motherboard because the previous one was faulty. After some time using the new one, the BSOD problem started. The previous motherboard was faulty because wasn't delivering enough power on USB ports to turn on external HDs.</p>
<p>- I noticed something strange in Windows 10 with the new motherboard: although BIOS read correctly 8 GBs of RAM, Windows only read 4 GBs (in Task Manager, it showed 8.0 GB DDR3, but only 4.0 GB in memory use). I formatted the SSD drive, reinstalled Windows
 and the memory issue persisted. Then I solved the problem by changing the memory slots on the motherboard (now Windows reads 8GBs).</p>
<p>- Motherboard firmware is up to date (I updated it from the official website and confirmed later the update in BIOS settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems quite an enigma to me.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the dump files and other files I think that can be useful to solve this issue:</p>

</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

    <title>You thoughts on Advanced Exchange and Shipping. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            You thoughts on Advanced Exchange and Shipping.</h2>
                    
<p>I would ask for no assumptions here if any reader has not dealt with the problems in Advanced Exchanges. I would ask that if you didnt experience it then please again do not assume. I would like to get honest details of people experiences with this. Thanks
 in advance for complying :)</p>
<p>I did the Advanced Exchange and they of course used FedEx for shipping, being a previous Shipping Specialist for "Kinkos" during the turnover I know how bad they can be. Amazon for example uses UPS mostly on its two day shipping and in 13 years living in
 my home have never EVER had a package disappear.</p>
<p><br />
I was home all day and checking the door constantly for when a truck went by , or if my dogs barked or I just assumed a package was at the door. I mean it is a 500 dollar Xbox ONE that I was expecting so of course I would sit on my step practically all day.
 Around 2:45 I checked my doorstep, no package. At 3:20 I checked my doorstep, no package. At that point I went to Fedex dot com and tracked it just to make sure it was still going to arrive on that day, sometimes the deliveries do get delayed which is understandable.</p>
<p><br />
Upon checking the site it said it was delivered at 2:38 and the driver left it at the door. I immediately called FedEx first to let them know I did not get the package. I then called Microsoft to let them know I did not get the package. I told both of them
 that I was home all day and that I was close to the door all day .</p>
<p>I asked the boss at the dispatch terminal that night to please update me on what the driver says. He told me that the driver said "I left it at the door and a lady came out and got it". Now first I can tell you this is false because my wife never answers
 the door and I dont expect her to on her day off. The next day I was expecting a different package from FedEX and waited out all day to catch the driver and ask him. HE told me "I knocked and left it at the doorstep". Which I can tell you that is also false
 because if he knocked on the door at least 2 of my 4 labs would have been barking up a storm. I told him that his boss said that he said a lady came out and took it. He then said "I was talking about a lady up the street. (now why if asked about MY delivery
 would he talk about a ladies delivery up the street ??). I then asked him that if he knocked on the door did he hear anything, He said no. I told him that how come if he knocked then how come my dogs didnt go wild ? He said he did not know why.</p>
<p><br />
So right there we got two conflicting stories from Fedex. He lied about the knocking and his story did not match up with what his boss told me. Pretty suspicious huh ? I cant prove he dropped the package at the door. Fedex can scan ANY package at any time and
 mark it as delivered, even if they were to drop it into their car. So I filed a police report on Tuesday and told them the conflicting stories just to make a record of it and to also cover my bum.</p>
<p>At this point in time it is in the hands of Global Escalation Support. I have been checking in at MS to see if anything has been done and they tell me that they are backlogged on cases. So How many cases do they have with lost packages to be backed up ?
 Now FINALLY&nbsp; the GES contacts me Yesterday and tells me they normally dont stop the "countdown timer" that handles the 14 day return period but he will escalate that to his manager.to attempt it That is so far ALL he has told me. Today he seems to have been
 off because he never replied back to the list of questions I asked which was stuff like "how does this work now?" etc.</p>
<p>So I am asking anyone with experience on this . If you can answer my questions then great. I am only asking though what happened in your experience and please no assumptions.</p>
<p>1) I had 14 days from the date of "delivery" to return my faulty Xbox or they will charge my the 500 dollars. Has anyone had experience with this or experience with not making the deadline ? I of course will not send my console back because the deal was
 that I would using their package and the label the supplied. As well as I would not ship out my console without confirmation they will even still ship me a console after all this is said and done. I mean I cant charge THEM a 500 dollar deposit if they dont
 ship me a replacement console.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; If your package was lost how did the case come out ? was it solved in your favor and did they tell you they would send out a new one and say you werent responsible for the loss ? How long did it take ?</p>
<p>3) Did they send you out a new console automatically and not recharge you the 16 dollar fee ? Did they do a temporary hold on another 500 dollars on you when they did ?</p>
<p>4) Were the professional or were they complete idiots like the ones that work in Customer Service who give you a different answer every time yo call ?</p>
<p>5) if they DID charge you the 500 dollars because the return package was late how long did it take for it to show up in your account ? Did they refund you once your console DID show up ?</p>
<p>6) Did you get some kind of email saying "We got your console and no signs of tampering so you can now not have to worry about that 500 dollar deposit" ? Or did it get taken out of your account at a later date.</p>
<p>Any suggestions you can do to help ease my mind would be great and any details of what you had to go thru would be great too.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for your cooperation in advance and thanks for reading. Have a great day.</p>

<p>I have just got off the phone with these folks at customer support. Idiots. All of them. The first time i contacted them, they sent me to Tim in some department, and Tim let me know that they were going through an update, and wouldnt be able to access my
 account. So what can you do Tim? After telling him i needed an advance return, he told me he wouldnt be able to do anything, and to call back in 30-60 minutes. I then told Tim this was a stupid problem. This was a stupid problem for both of us. Then Tim hung
 up on me. Thankfully i was still using the live customer support chat thing, and Hans arranged for a call back.
</p>
<p>I received the call back in about 3 minutes, and Jenny was able to do everything i needed. Huh... Anyways, after going through all this they decided to let me know that is was a $15 charge, and a $500 hold. While i dont agree, it makes sense. Whereas with
 the xbox360, they sent you a box, you packed your busted one up, and when they received it, shipped you another busted one. "refurbished" i think they called it. When i asked jenny if there was any other option, as i dont just have $500 dollars to "hold,"
 she said they could do a repair. 3-4 weeks to repair.</p>
<p>While i'm not a gaming "junkie" anymore, that doesnt sound very reasonable. </p>
<p>Charge me money-</p>
<p>i get product-</p>
<p>product doesnt work-</p>
<p>wait for updates-</p>
<p>get updates-</p>
<p>product still doesnt work-</p>
<p>gets worse-</p>
<p>try to get help-</p>
<p>charge me more money. </p>
<p>Why, when i purchase this product on Good-Faith, do I have to pay to get their busted, malfunctioning product fixed?! This is outrageous. And no one cares?! Thats the part that really irks me. We dont have a choice, so thats what we have to do, and they
 just get more money.</p>
<p>After all this i wait for Christian, a call center floor manager, and speak to him about all this. I asked him if there was ANYONE i could talk to, ANYONE! Promptly he replies, "no." There was no one i could talk to, email, no cell phone, or anything. To
 which i replied, Bill Gates has an email, how about someone a little lower now the line. "I'm sorry, i wouldnt have that information, if i did, i would give it to you." While i wholeheartedly believe what Christian said to be true, THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.
</p>
<p>Then i asked if i could just get a refund on the xbox, games, and controller. I mentioned xbox live, but also said that was debatable, so forget it. He said that would have to be through the retailer. This is not the fault of my retailer! This is Microsoft's
 fault. They sold me a bunk product, just like the first xbox 360's! This is a Product's Completed Liability issue. Microsoft manufactured these products, guarantee them, then charge us money to fix them. Stupid problem...</p>
<p>Why is there no one to talk to or contact? Why are we not holding Microsoft accountable for their products? Why are we paying for their mistakes? How can Microsoft Online Support be so stinking terrible?!</p>
<p>I even asked if there was anyone to just appease my disgust. "No."</p>
<p>I suppose i am just going to have to change me allegiance. But PS is terrible, and WII is a joke.
</p>
<p>In response:</p>
<p>1) Update in 3 weeks i suppose.</p>
<p>2) Im sure it will be, as Neither FedEx or UPS ever find my house.</p>
<p>3) They have charged the $16.28 to ship it here, and have place the hold.</p>
<p>4) Professional idiots.</p>
<p>5) They better not.</p>
<p>6) Its a crap shoot. Update to follow.</p>
<p>I do suggest that WE, the people who expect to get what we were promised in return for money, force/strongly encourage THEM, Microsoft, to fix this crap. This is seriously stupid. I also suggest that no one try to use Microsoft customer support, EVER. Just
 take the product outside smash it to smithereens, and mail the product back with a note stating: I have fixed your defective product. Along with a bill for the sum of the amount paid for purchase, and the shipping for the fixed product. Then go buy a book.
 I am so fed up with Microsoft, this is outrageous and i can only hope that some day it be criminal. If i buy a defective product from Wal-Mart, they take it back. No issues. If i want my money back, i get it back.</p>

<p>NOW After a few weeks of no response and me complaining they say "the ownership of the case was lost" and now I have to start off at square one.</p>
<p>So they are telling me they can make an operating system and cant make a program that tells them there are still open cases left ?</p>
<p>Its been 64 hours since the supervisor I talked to "reopened" the case. No response yet. They said it would be within 72 hours. I normally wouldnt hold them to it but so many mess ups , and now its been almost three weeks with nothing happening at all.</p>
<p>I wont even get into the mess ups by FedEx in this case and many others. Hence the reason I stepped down as FedEx Shipping Specialist.</p>

<p>I, fortunately, didn't have any issues with my advanced exchange. &nbsp;I made sure someone was home to get the package because I knew they would leave it at the door. &nbsp;I didn't want to risk it being stolen or lost.</p>

<p>I recently had to go through this nightmare. XBox1 is a scam. I had spoken with 3 reps to do the exchange, I had told them I purchased this unit used. I told them there was damage on the back of the unit which was there when I bought it. It worked for 3
 months no problem. The reps told me don't worry if you do the advanced exchange you won't be charged for anything. That came from 3 different reps, not one, not two, three.....so I took the chance of sending it in. As I had explained to the reps I don't want
 to take any chances of sending it in to be charged $400 when I can just pay 250 and get one from Game Stop or other retailer.</p>
<p>Today I got an email saying they are going to charge me $400, claiming it has been tampered with. Now like I told the rep today, I was told if I did the advanced exchange I wouldn't have to worry about the damage to the rear or anything else. That as long
 as my old unit made it, I was ok and everything would be alright.</p>
<p>The service rep said, well they are sorry for what the other service rep had told me, but that isn't their problem. They told me they do not have to uphold any promises or conditions made by their customer service people. He said that they should have read
 me the terms and agreements when we were on the phone. Like I told him, supposed to is a big word, I mean you aren't supposed to speed when driving but how many of us do??? He laughed and was like ya all the time. When I asked about the tampering, I told him
 that I informed them of the damage on the rear of the xbox and he said oh well. I also told him that I would like to work something out as I like Xbox but I'm not going to spend 400 when I could just pay 250, that I was promised there wouldn't be a problem.
 I'm not rich, I'm not going to throw money away like that. He basically told me that they do not care, it is not their problem. That I can pay 400 dollars or else. Now sure what else is...but I guess we will see.
</p>
<p>It kills me that they don't care about losing customers. I also have a ps4, and if they want they can come get their xbox1, but I'm not paying 400 and I'm not returning it till mine is returned. I only got it because I got a good deal on the ps4 if i bought
 it too. Which I've had no problems with the PS4, better load times, better graphics, and their customer support WAY BETTER...</p>
<p>Obviously Xbox 1 does not need customers and I hope this message gets to someone and they contact me back to try and fix this.</p>

<h2>            USB port not recognizing mouse and other peripherals.</h2>
                    I have a logitech wireless mouse that has been working on my computer (Fujitsu A6220) for the past 2.5 years, but now the Device manager for the USB ports says that it doesn't recognize the device.&nbsp; I travel and on a couple of occasions I've returned from
 a trip and plugged it in and it worked for a few days.&nbsp; I have the same issue with my printer and an external drive attached to USB ports.&nbsp; I've also tried a USB mouse that is not wireless and same issue.&nbsp; The mouse works on other computers.&nbsp; I've tried updating
 drivers and get a response the the best driver is already installed.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So, could this be a hardware problem?<br />
<br />
The error message I get is:&nbsp; Windows stopped device (Code 43)&nbsp; Port_#0001, Hub_#000<br />

<h3> cru hunter  say:</h3>
<h2>            El Shaddai&#58; Rise of the Metatron - Surprisingly Good</h2>
                    
<p>So I downloaded the El Shaddai: Rise of the Metatron demo from the Marketplace since i was bored and wanted something fun to try out. I never kept tabs on this game prior to the demo, but I did see occasional pictures of it and it looked original. I had
 no idea. I have to say, this game was surprisingly good. The combat is a little stiff, but the gameplay is interesting and the art direction is amazing. One critic described the art correctly: If Lady GaGa made a videogame, this would be it.</p>
<p>If you're in the need for something original and fun, try out El Shaddai. It's surprisingly good. If anyone tries it out, let me know what you thought.</p>

    <title>How to set Windows 10 to ALWAYS open maximized windows when clicking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ipablo  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set Windows 10 to ALWAYS open maximized windows when clicking on the shortcuts for the File Explorer or pinned websites of the taskbar</h2>
                    <p><span>Straightforward ideas which did NOT work for the File Explorer </span><span>shortcut</span><span>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the File Explorer <span>shortcut</span>of the taskbar&gt; Right click on “File explorer”&gt;Left click on “Properties”&gt;Under ‘Shortcut’; Select ‘Maximized’ for the field ‘<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">R</span>un:’</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on an empty space on the desktop &gt;Left click on “New”&gt; Left click on “Shortcut”&gt;Type “explorer” (without quotes) and select “Next”&gt; Select “Finish”&gt;Right click on the shortcut&gt;Left click on “Properties”&gt;Under ‘Shortcut’;
 Select ‘Maximized’ for the field ‘<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">R</span>un:’&gt;Remove the old File Explorer icon from the taskbar&gt;Pin the new shortcut on the taskbar</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open File Explorer&gt;Maximize its window&gt; Hold the Ctrl key when closing it</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Indeed, none of the three methods above is able to make File Explorer be opened on a maximized window in all cases. In fact, the only way in which File Explorer is opened on a maximized window is making sure that its corresponding window was maximized
 before closing it. Otherwise it will remember that it was not maximized when it was closed, so the next time that I click on the File Explorer shortcut
</span><span>to open it again, it will not be opened on maximized window.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that this issue seems to be restricted to File Explorer. For instance, if I use any of the three methods for the taskbar
</span><span>shortcuts</span><span> of Word, Excel, Paint, etc. their corresponding windows will ALWAYS be maximized, regardless of the fact that they were not on maximized windows when they were closed for the last time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>For the pinned websites </span><span>shortcuts</span><span> </span><span>(which still are currently opened with Explorer 11 on Windows 10) I cannot find any parameter to change the size of the window to be opened at all. I have tried: right click on
 the </span><span>shortcut</span><span>&gt;Right click on the particular name of the pinned site&gt;Left click on “Properties”</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, the only (apparent) way to make it be opened on a maximized window is to remember to maximize its corresponding window before closing it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>In summary, <strong>I would like to know how to make the File Explorer or pinned websites be opened on maximized windows REGARDLESS of the fact that their windows were maximized or not when they were closed for the last time</strong>, knowing that
 the methods I’ve just described did NOT work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance </span></p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>That sounds like a completely different problem, like a virus or some kind of corrupted files. Of course, when I click on the button to manually maximize the windows it works as expected. Then, I’d try the following (in this order, and restart
 your PC after trying every step and check it the problem is solved before trying the next one):</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Check the shortcut. Right click on the icon of the program that is not working properly (I think that by “EI” you meant to say Internet Explorer) and select “Properties”. On the ‘Shortcut’
 tap, click on “Maximized” for the field “Run:”</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Make a full virus scan using your antivirus software or Windows Defender. For this latter, open the Start Menu and type ‘Windows Defender’ and select “Windows Defender
</span><span style="color: rgba(127, 127, 127, 1)"><span>Desktop app</span></span><span>”. Go to the “Update” tab and click on “Update”, then wait until Windows Defender is updated and then go the “Home” tab, select “Full” from one of the radio buttons on the right. Then click
 on “Scan now”.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restore the shortcut. Right click on the icon of the program that is not working properly and select “Properties”. Then select the “Previous versions” tab and restore the shortcut (if possible).</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Update your display adapter driver. Open the Star Menu, type ‘Device Manager’ and select “Device Manager
</span><span style="color: rgba(127, 127, 127, 1)"><span>Control panel</span></span><span>”. Then expand “Display adapters” to see the name of your graphic card. Right click on it and select “Update Driver Software…” and follow the steps to update it (who knows this may be
 the problem…).</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restore your PC without losing your data. Open the Star Menu, type ‘Restore’ and click on “Create a restore point”. On the “System Protection” tab select “System Restore…” and follow the
 steps. Notice that this </span><span>fifth </span><span>option may also be very useful if after updating the driver the icons look horrible (as, indeed, it happened to me once) as you’ll restore the previous driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Good luck! I hope this helps.</span></span></p>

<p>Using Windows 10 Home, version</p>
<p>After recent updates all windows open in an extremely small way, I constantly need to use small square top right to bring them to the size I like.&nbsp; I have checked properties on shortcuts, when programs are not open and ticked open maximised but this makes
 no difference when I open program. &nbsp; Also have looked at settings display but it looks okay to me&nbsp; What should I try next&nbsp; ?</p>

            Hello, ZaneleLe.  You need to consult the documentation that came with the printer, which can be accessed online here: http://bit.ly/2yvHF4b.  This is not a problem with Windows.  You can find additional help at the linked Epson Support site.

            Hello .  I'm Greg, a Microsoft MVP here to help you.

What I do is go into the Settings on the printer and run all of the Maintenance tasks to see if it can fix it.  

But if it checks out rather than just junking the printer I would try it on another PC to see if it works there.  If so I'd Clean Install the printer which saves time and solves many problems:  

Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:

Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  

Right click Start button in Windows 8/10  to open Apps and Features  (or in Windows 7 type it in Start Search) to Uninstall all the printer software. Restart.  

 Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui/s /t2     

 Right click result to Run as Administrator.   

Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about

            Hello
<br />
<br />We're sorry for the trouble this has caused. Please, could you provide more details about the issue.
<br />
<br />What exactly is the problem with Facebook? 
<br />
<br />Is there an error? 
<br />
<br />I advise first you need to find the album that the photo is located in and click on album to open it. Click on “Edit Album”, below each photo thumbnail is a symbol with a blue person that shows number of people tagged in photo. Click on symbol and the names of those tagged will appear in description box. For each name you would like to remove tag click the “X” next to name. When done with all photo changes in album click Done.

<p>When I start up my pc and get to the screen where I need to enter my password, sometimes the NumLock key is activated, sometimes it isn't. This is really random.</p>
<p>I have the same problem on 2 different pc's, one win 8 and the other win 8.1</p>

            I think I found a solution that works permanently:<br />
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiqhMktjD3A<br />
<br />
It is also a change in the register but not the one I have read in most posts.<br />
<ul>
<li>You go to the register</li><li>Open HKEY USERS</li><li>Open Default</li><li>Open Control Panel</li><li>Click on Keyboard</li><li>On the right side you get 4 keyboard items<br />
</li><li>InitialKeyboardIndicators has a number as data &gt; 2147483648</li><li>Doubleclick on InitialKeyboardIndicators </li><li>In the small window you get you change the last 2 numbers from 48 to 50 and get 2147483650</li><li>Click on ok</li><li>Close the register window</li><li>Try again<br />
</li></ul>
<p>I have been trying now for more than 10 times and it keeps coming up on time for the login screen no matter if it is a cold start or a restart... I hope it will last :-)</p>

                    Did latest batch of updates to Win 7 this morning and at end it had me restart.Well it hung for a bit while restarting, and is now stuck on "Preparing to Configure" during reboot. Can boot to safe mode and I have read and tries various fixes from this

            <p>So, to be 100% crystal clear. You are saying that you CANNOT just download the manual Windows 10 installer, install it over your existing windows 7/8 installation and then activate it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead you need to WAIT until you get the notification by Microsoft using the Get windows 10 app, then do the upgrade through that process instead. Otherwise you won't qualify for the free upgrade to Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition keeps crashing.</h2>
                    When I start playing my world it works just fine, but 10-20 minutes into the game it freezes, then it crashes and closes the application. But when I get back on it takes me back to the same position that I was in when it froze, so I guess it saved it for
 me. But like I said it does this every 10-20 minutes and sometimes even sooner.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Performance and stability issues with games on Windows 10 may be due to one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A corrupted profile data associated with the game </li><li>An outdated version of the game </li><li>Outdated Windows 10 OS </li><li>Software conflicts </li><li>Server Interruption</li></ul>
<p>To determine the root cause of this issue, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages after the game crashes or closes during gameplay?</li><li>Are you playing the game online or offline?</li><li>Have you tried playing other games to check if the same issue occurs?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your device before encountering this issue?</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, we recommend running the Windows apps troubleshooter provided on this

<h2>            Blue Screen with IPv6&#47;IPv4 Reboot Errors - How can I roll back to my previous operating system&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I began getting the blue screen and reboot errors shown below after installing Windows 10.&nbsp; I've gathered it's a driver error for my network card but the company that manufactured my network card does not have a driver update yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c5b2310-d47f-4347-81be-99cc517fcd81" height="207" width="469" />&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da0dce4f-8170-48b8-9c35-79baffafa84c" height="183" width="474" /></p>
<p>I've almost completely given up on Windows 10 as this error occurs multiple times a day and every reboot takes almost 30 mins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to roll back to the windows 8 OS previously installed on my Lenovo G760?&nbsp; I have no idea where my Key is but I registered the OS when purchased so I assume it's retrievable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a problem that can be solved easily or should i just get a new system?
</p>

            <p>First you can install a legacy driver in compatibility mode</p>
<p>Second not sure what that message is about but I suspect it is not networking because win 10 can boot w or w/o a network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third if you can boot (ever) we can probably find and fix the issue without reverting which may just make this worse</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick reply.&nbsp; I went to the manufacture website and found a win10 driver.&nbsp; I installed it hoping it would resolve the problem but I crashed again not long after.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found the DMP files though the last date modified was "9/25/2015" so i'm not sure how helpful it will be.&nbsp; But the crashes started previous to that date so perhaps...

<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably<em> without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. Did Win7 64-bit come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7,<em>or did you upgrade from Vista to Win7?
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor;
 TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer;
<em>CCleaner Registry Cleaner</em>)?</p>

    <title>Windows can&#39;t load profile&#47; can&#39;t find profile on start up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roguemodel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows can&#39;t load profile&#47; can&#39;t find profile on start up</h2>
                    This happened yesterday while my computer was running. I looked at the screen and it was blank except for the default wallpaper. I restarted the computer and got this message when the personal settings were trying to load in an "user enviornment box" "windows
 cannot load locally stored profile, this may be a security issue or driver error"......and then "Windows cannot find local profile and will open a temporary profile".&nbsp; It looks like it opens back to the day I bought the computer. No files, no favorites, nothing.
 When I leave the computer on it goes back to that blank screen and I have to restart with the same result. Any ideas? Can I fix this? Thanks! mike
