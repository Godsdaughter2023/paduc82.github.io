<h2>            we can&#39;t sign you in with this credential because your domain isn&#39;t available.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a small company with 25 Computers, which are connected to the domain server and hold Windows 7 Pro licenses. We also have a Windows 2012 DC/AD.</p>
<p>We are in the process of moving the Operating System on all the machines to Windows 10 pro (or enterprise - we do have licenses).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started testing three machines by upgrading them to Win10 Pro back in 2016 from 7 to 10, then join the windows server to which they were more than happy to accept. but shortly after, I could not log into the PCs with domain users unless the profile
 was already made. so if the domain account exist in the system, I can log in, if not I get the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"we can't sign you in with this credential because your domain isn't available, make sure your device is connected to your organization's network and try again. If you previously signed on this device with another credential you can sign in with
 that credential".</strong></p>
<p>Local accounts work, the passwords are correct 110% and am not able to login, I can ping the DC, in fact I can remote into the server from the same PCs. and they all act the exact same way.</p>
<p>The closest answer I got was on this site:</p>
<p>http://samba.2283325.n4.nabble.com/We-can-t-sign-you-in-with-this-credential-because-your-domain-isn-t-available-td4720917.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>to which I assigned the DNS on the PCs to the DC server. and still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also am up to date with my windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>help is appreciated not just for me but all those who need it :)<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>
<p>

<h3> matthewcarlson1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headset</h2>
                    My astro a10 headset worked with both controllers on my xbox one. It stopped working on one of them. Been fine with my other controller for months, stopped working. Headset is fine works on everything else. All my setting are good, audio, not muted etc....
 pretty sure an update made it stop working which is ridiculous but anyway not sure what to do about my 50 dollar headset that works, but not with 2 controllers. Works on my old wired controller, so i tried connecting the 2 that dont and still nothing. So either
 bad update, or i so unlucky have TWO bad plug jacks? I dont think so

<p>I believe this happened after removing a Trojan virus found by Windows Security Essentials however I cannot be sure.</p>
<p>I use Windows 7 operating system.&nbsp; I found on IE version 11 an add-on with Conduit reference and I remember removing that too.&nbsp; I do not want the Conduit tool on my IE!&nbsp; I understand that it is a type of spyware.&nbsp; How do I get rid of error message at startup?

                    <p>How do I get rid of unwanted entries in the metadata autocomplete drop-down boxes in my windows music folders.&nbsp; Specifically in the list of genres.&nbsp; It seems that anything I've ever typed in the genre field is in the list.&nbsp; The list is very long and includes
 mis-spellings, genres I no longer wish to use, etc.).&nbsp; Unwanted entries don't seem to go away if I don't use them.&nbsp; Is there anyway to fix this?

            In case you didn't see my reply at the bottom, I'm posting it here as well.
<div><br />
<div>I had the same issue, and finally found an answer with the Registry Editor. &nbsp;It is explained here:
<div><a href="http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/AutoComplete.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/AutoComplete.htm</a>. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Run regedit, then select HKEY_CURRENT_USER -&gt; Software -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Mediaplayer -&gt; Autocomplete. &nbsp;There you will find lists of Autocomplete items, and just delete the ones you don't want to have there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            Microsoft Support Engineers seem to assume that everybody has a genuine bootable XP installation CD with Service Pack 3 on it.<br />
<br />
The fact is, that most people that look for help in the MS Answers forums have never seen a genuine bootable XP installation CD in their life and wouldn't be unable to get their hands on one.&nbsp; It is extremely unlikely that "your manufacturer" will send you
 one of you contact them, but that always seems to make it into the advice sooner or later.<br />
<br />
MSE replies that have links to KB articles or other ideas that begin with "insert your XP CD-ROM..." usually don't go very far after that and somebody else has to step in and really do the fixing/helping.&nbsp; That is a shame.<br />
<br />
The usb.inf file is also not one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after, so there is no backup copy on your system.<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).&nbsp; I think it should be the same for XP Home SP3.<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in this folder (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\inf<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, it may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys) so you will have to manually add the proper extension to the file when you
 download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called usb when the file name really needs to be called usb.inf (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to
 change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that will resolve your issue or not, but at least you will not be missing the file.<br />

            USB.inf should be in \windows\inf (%systemroot%\inf actually).&nbsp; Who manufactured your system?&nbsp; In most cases, you can (and should) generate the installation and/or recovery CDs/DVDs.&nbsp; What Service Pack level is your Windows XP Home Edition?

<h3> davidjrust  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;System Not Found&#34; During Password Recovery on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've gotten myself into a fix where I have never had a password on <strong>Windows 10</strong>. I just, simply, never wanted one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a recent restart (following trying to troubleshoot why my mouse device was being detected but the cursor was refusing to move) I did something (fat-fingered some keys or clicked something I didn't notice) and, suddenly, the next time I logged in, Windows
 10 was asking me for a password. This was a password I did not have nor ever create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through quite a few hoops, eventually downloading the for-pay version of
<strong>"Windows Password Recovery Tool Ultimate"</strong>. And although I launched it on my laptop and burned the resulting start-up software onto my USB drive, I'm unable to get it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used both the <strong>BIOS </strong>and the standard <strong>f12 </strong>
(choose boot-up drive) to get the "Windows Password Recovery Tool Ultimate" to load. The problem is, when it does so, it gives me an error message&nbsp;<strong>"system not found"</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've have searched everywhere but not found a solution for this. None of the options to reset the password or create a new account work without the system being found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something really obvious, here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

By design Remote Desktop [RDC] users must have a password.</p>
<p>Your options would be to create a password for the user account your trying to login in with on the RDC host PC or to create a special user account, with password, that you only use to login in with RDC. Keep in mind the account user ID and password you
 use to login is for the RDC host and not your RDC client.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Home PC = PC1, users Dale (administrator, automatically a member of the Remote Desktop Users Group), Sue (standard user)&nbsp;and Jim (standard user and member of Remote Desktop Users Group)</p>
<p>Laptop = PC2, users Stan (administrator)&nbsp;and Sue (standard user)</p>
<p>When connecting to RDC host PC1&nbsp;from RDC client PC2&nbsp;login with either the Dale or Jim account and password. Sue is not a member of the Remote Desktop Users Group or an administrator so that account can not be used.</p>
<p>In all cases use a strong password and make sure Network Level Authentication [NLA] is enabled and used. NLA is supported by Windows 7/Vista/XP SP3 clients.</p>

<p>When calling over your home LAN use either the computer name or its LAN IP. From a true remote location use the public IP of your router or a fully qualified domain name if you have one setup with a service like No-IP.com (free).</p>
<p>Personally I also recommend disabling RDC connections on the laptop RDC client, unless of course you wanting to remotely control the laptop (unlikely). Also remember to use a Public network location on the laptop when away from home and on any type of untrusted
 network, ie. bar/restaruant/library/etc.</p>

<p>Trying to download the update but the status bar just stays at about 1% and eventually times out after 3 tries. &nbsp;I get the error code&nbsp;"3cd6-3f45-a080-0f00-8007-2746" which apparently means "Failed to download the update" (duh!) but the troubleshooting articles
 don't seem to help. &nbsp;I've cleared the cache, ensured I have enough space, opened all ports, tested my connection (which was successful) and tried to re-download several times.</p>

<p>Why isn't this available as a USB/CD download yet? &nbsp;I can download things fine on my computer, it's just via Xbox Live that it continuously stuffs up.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but "wait a week" is kind of a crappy solution. &nbsp;Was looking forward to playing the Borderlands 2 DLC this weekend, but if I can't get on Xbox Live, I can't download it. &nbsp;If whatever janky network problem isn't going to be fixed, then
 the update should be available on the website. &nbsp;I can't imagine it takes much work... I mean, it's already available for download through Live.</p>

tried your suggestion, thanks.&nbsp; did so despite the set up instructions specifically directing to rest and lift finger on pad.&nbsp; slid/ran my finger over the sensor slowly per your method for over 5 minutes with no results.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            Xbox Switches</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;I heard about a survey that you can do to get an extra home xbox switch. I followed all the instructions on how to get there, but upon arrival, I apparently wasn’t elligable for it. I was wondering how I can become eligable, or how I can get an extra
 home xbox switch.

            Hi Jay.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />It appears Diskpart says that D is the RAID array.  
<br />
<br />I see nothing but problems with RAID for eight years daily in forums - not one single case in thousands mentioning RAID where it wasn't failing and/or lost all data.  I would not even consider running RAID in a consumer setting, especially because there are much faster SSD's and larger drives available.  The only good reason I ever heard for running RAID is for using huge media files that cannot fit on the largest hard drives.  
<br />
<br />Can you back up the data now - as I've also never seen a case where it was truly redundant and all data wasn't lost when it failed?  Then break the RAID and test the drives using diagnostics and a full Disk check:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>

<br />
<br />If the drives pass then I'd reformat them independently to use as storage.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>OK.&nbsp; So, first of all, you seem to be assuming that this RAID array is for the purposes of speed or storage.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; It is a RAID 1 array.&nbsp; It has been working fine for YEARS.&nbsp; It has survived an outright drive failure (a couple of years ago), upgrading
 from 500GB to 1TB, and the transition from Windows 7 (with Intel Matrix Storage Manager) to Windows 10 (where Microsoft broke the ability to use the Matrix Storage Manager GUI to monitor RAID rebuilds, build new volumes, etc., and will now only "allow" drivers).&nbsp;
 All of that happened without a hiccup, aside from the one outright drive failure.</p>
<p><br />
So, there is your first case "where it was truly redundant and all data wasn't lost".&nbsp; This array truly did survive a drive failure.&nbsp; Yes, there are lots of mistakes N00Bs can make when working with arrays, but my experience is such that I know what to do and
 what not to do.<br />
</p>
<p>My system drive is SSD, yeah, for speed.&nbsp; This RAID array has lots of data, some programs, etc. - SSD would be a too-expensive alternative.&nbsp; Sure, I could replace it with a single drive, and lose the valuable redundancy.&nbsp; But guess what:&nbsp; that ain't gonna
 happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, diskpart indicates that drive "D" is my RAID array, which is correct, and on Volume 5.&nbsp; However, it shows no evidence at all from diskpart of the \Device\HarddiskVolume6 referred to in the event log 98 entries.&nbsp; That is darned suspicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The intel BIOS utility indicates that the RAID array is fully operational, i.e., there is no sign of a drive failure.&nbsp; &nbsp; I know exactly what a drive failure looks like, and this isn't it.&nbsp; (It typically shows up first as the Intel controller putting the
 array into a degraded single drive mode and recovering after a rebuild, before finally giving up on the drive alltogether).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, when I did the CHKDSK /F after the first set of messages, there were no errors found at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present my working assumption is that there is nothing wrong at all with the data on the drives or the drives themselves.&nbsp; My working assumption is that Microsoft changed something that caused this, or, perhaps, that the new and un-improved Google Backup
 and Sync is involved.&nbsp; The former is because this developed so very recently.&nbsp; The latter is because I have also seen some&nbsp; performance issues from the new Google sync that occur at login, that go away when I configure it to not start at login, and that the
 most recent messages showed up shortly after I restarted it to mirror a backup I do periodically up to Google.&nbsp; But I also note that Google Backup and Sync is NOT configured to do anything with D: (its mirror is on Z:), but that hasn't stopped it from pounding
 the snot out of all of my drives when it starts up, as determined from the performance monitor disk activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my best guess is that Microsoft has managed to introduce a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, one thing I will do overnight is run the BIOS utility and have it check the integrity block by block.&nbsp; I have, rarely, seen cases where blocks can get out of sync and thus return different data for read requests to the same block.&nbsp; I typically spotted
 them when an image backup using Clonezilla or one of the commercial products would complain about a verification error.&nbsp; But I have only seen that once or twice over the past 7 years lifetime of this array.&nbsp; If that is what is going on, then the "rebuild"
 will fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that still doesn't explain the Volume6 oddity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[BTW, I spent 36 years in various technical roles (systems programmer, DBA, network design and support, PC hardware support and on and on), all the way from pre-360 mainframes, PDP-11's, VAXen, PCs, Unix boxes, servers, hooking our organization of 5000+
 people up to the Internet, open source, languages beyond count, formal education in computer hardware design, operating systems and compilers.&nbsp; I know what I am doing.]</p>

            So, a quick check revealed that there is no rebuild built into the ICH10R BIOS ** AND ** Microsoft saw fit to make the Intel GUI software that provided that function incompatible.&nbsp; Sooooo, I may have to look into what I can do with, say, an Ubuntu Live
 CD and/or a USB stick to do a rebuild.&nbsp; Good grief.&nbsp; Thanks a lot, Microsoft.

<p>Fortunately, I *was* able to just re-install iata_enu, level 11.7.0.1013, downloaded from the Intel site.&nbsp; (That was the same level for RAID drivers that I already had after the Windows 10 upgrade).&nbsp; That included the Rapid Storage Technology GUI, and it
 correctly displays the status of the drives, etc., so the API seems to be functioning correctly.&nbsp; So I should be able to do a verify this evening.&nbsp; I expect that will go just fine.</p>

<br />Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase or build computer?
<br />
<br />2a. Did the computer come with WIn7 preinstalled or...?
<br />
<br />2b. How did you get Win7 installed on the new drive?
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS; self-built)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

<p>OK, so here we go.&nbsp; The information below comes from over 100 pages of system logs that I keep whenever I change anything on my system!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, after installing the intel RST GUI client (which probably also reinstalled the drivers) version 11.7.0.1013 (matching the drivers), and rebooting, and running a volume verify overnight, exactly one block mismatch was found and corrected.&nbsp; It
 was found very early in the process- almost immediately, so the error was on a very low numbered block.&nbsp; After that completed, I ran a chkdsk (no /F - in read only mode) and it found no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer the questions above, pursuant to the removal of the Intel RST GUI (which others have also noted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See:</p>
<p>https://www.janbambas.cz/intel-rapid-storage-technology-disappears-windows-10/</p>
<p>https://superuser.com/questions/1124174/after-windows-10-upgrade-how-do-you-view-the-status-of-your-raid-array</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The computer was purchased and installed around November, 2010.&nbsp; I spent a few weeks setting up all my software, testing, etc. before migrating off of my previous machine.&nbsp; I started using the machine for everyday tasks in January, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2a.&nbsp; The computer came with Win7 Ultimate preinstalled.&nbsp; I do not recall ever doing a re-install.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally the system ran on a 120GB Intel SSD, but that was imaged using the Intel-provided Acronis image tool, and replaced with the current 256GB Intel SSD in December 2015.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In December 2010 I diagnosed an issue with the on-board Marvell controller, and acquired a Marvell PCIe controller to use in its place, but that was also problematic. Originally drive D: was on a RAID array on the replacement Marvell controller, so in April
 2011 I backed up the data and restored it to an array built on the Intel ICH10R raid controller.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In January, 2013 I installed the current level of Intel RST RAID drivers, 11.7.0.1013, after having issues with having to do a raid re-build every time Windows crashed.&nbsp; After that, the RAID array was rock solid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In March, 2016 I upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In October 2016 I applied the "Anniversary Update" (1607).&nbsp; At that point, it *appears* that the Microsoft update removed the Intel RST GUI, according to my notes, though it is possible that the original Windows 10 upgrade removed it.&nbsp; The anniversary update
 was installed 10/7/2016, and I noticed that the RST GUI was gone 10/18/2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled the RST GUI (and the RAID drivers, I expect) at the same level, 11.7.0.1013 on 11/14/2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2b.&nbsp; See 2a.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; The computer was manufactured by Cyberpower Inc.&nbsp; But this is not relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; As far as I can remember, no Norton or McAfee application was ever installed on this machine.&nbsp; However, I note that sometimes a Java or Adobe install will require removing a checkbox to avoid installing a McAfee scanner, so it is possible that at some
 point such a thing was installed.&nbsp; However, as soon as I would have noticed it, I would have removed it.&nbsp; I have used Kaspersky A/V since the machine was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; As far as I can remember, I have not run either the Norton removal tool or the McAfee removal tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, In Feb. 2017 I had installed Cura 3D printer softwware, which caused system crashes, and I ended up going back to a system restore point a couple of times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Windows 10 Pro, Version 2703, Build 15063.726&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first instance of the event log with&nbsp; these IDs was on 11/7/2017.&nbsp; My event log goes back to July, 2017.</p>

<p>OK, well, this is getting a little ridiculous....&nbsp; What does ANY OF THIS have to do with the fact that the event log refers to a volume unknown to DISKPART.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a.&nbsp; The only A/V I have ever used on this machine is Kaspersky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b.&nbsp; Heck no.&nbsp; There was no reason to scan it.&nbsp; Remember, this was a separate data drive (D:), not the OS drive.&nbsp; The reason for moving to the ICH10R was clearly identified as a hardware based issue, based on switching drives and ports and cables connected
 to the Marvell RAID controller.&nbsp; There was absolutely no reason to believe or even consider that malware was behind the instability on the Marvell controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Again, the only A/V I have ever used on this machine is Kaspersky.&nbsp; And, THERE WAS NO REINSTALL.&nbsp; I recall the Intel/Acronis imaging tool running as a standalone, not under Windows, and copied the NTFS partition data, MBR, the reserved partition, optionally
 expanding the NTFS partition in the process.&nbsp; Also, this was my C: drive.&nbsp; The RAID array went untouched during this process (D:).&nbsp; (I also made my own image backup using Clonezilla in advance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I used the Microsoft Media Creation Tool to download a 64-bit setup and placed it on a USB flash drive, and ran the setup.exe to do the Windows 10 update, as the window (tee hee) for the free upgrade was reported to be closing.&nbsp; [I successfully used
 a DVD to upgrade at least one machine, but this machine treated the DVD created from the downloaded iso as though it was empty.&nbsp; I upgraded two other machines before I did this one.]&nbsp; I paused protection in Kaspersky before I started, as I had run into issues
 with that on a previous Windows 10 upgrade on another machine.&nbsp; The upgrade to Windows 10 went without any hitches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; I triggered the anniversary update manually, after imaging the drive, uninstalling Kaspersky (which failed claiming another install was in progress), rebooting, uninstalling again (once again got a message about an MS Office&nbsp; install in progress), Rebooting
 again, Running Windows Update, discovering I had to stop the print spooler service (LPD), check for updates, unchecking "defer upgrades" and then checking for updates once more, at which point it found the anniversary update (1607).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I believe that I triggered the Creator's Update on 7/27/2017 via the Windows Update dialog under Settings.&nbsp; My notes just say "Major Microsoft Update", and the update log has an entry "Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703..." and under "Other
 Updates" an entry "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703" -- I presume this last one is the Creators update</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Windows 10 Pro, 1703, Build 15063.726&nbsp; (2703 was a typo - I will go back and edit the post if this system allows for that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; As far as I know, I have not seen the Fall creator's update (1709) offered to this machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ed.&nbsp; I did help one person recover their networking functionality after that fall creator's update made it such that only the Microsoft browsers would run, nothing else, netstat would not display IP addresses, etc. -- separate post.&nbsp; Had to use the Settings
 =&gt; Network &amp; Internet =&gt; Status =&gt; Network reset link to rebuild his network stack to recover.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp; I have not done anything to prevent driver updates via Windows Update ("Do you want to automatically download manufacturers' apps and custom icons available for your devices" is set to "Yes".&nbsp; [BTW, near as I can tell, that only applies to 3rd party
 drivers, not Microsoft's, anyway.]&nbsp; That said, please read the earlier post, and you will see that the Intel RAID drivers I am running are the very same ones I had under Windows 7, and those I installed myself; they did not arrive via Windows update.&nbsp; &nbsp;As&nbsp;
 far as I can recall, Windows Update never touched my Intel RAID drivers.&nbsp; (On the other hand, it did offer updates early in the timeline - 2010/2011) for the Marvell RAID controller, and really messed things up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>No, I don't care to humor requests for information that are clearly just grasping at straws, and that take a fair amount of time and effort to generate .&nbsp; If you don't have any idea why the event log might be referring to a volume that DISKPART shows to
 be nonexistent, then why not just say so, and leave it at that?&nbsp; Or not respond at all.</p>

<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; That maybe someone else had seen this kind of thing before, and would provide some enlightenment.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 6 Onboard WiFi Adapter Issues With Local Networks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nsomnia001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 6 Onboard WiFi Adapter Issues With Local Networks</h2>
                    <p>Just recently about the time of the June Windows 10 update, my wifi connection was lost for a little bit. I restarted and was fine. This started happenign more often and took some Adapter restarts and playing with drivers versions to keep going.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A little more testing made me realize tethered phone "ethernet" worked fine as did all my WiFi devices on wireless G and N (I believe) however the stock USB WIFi adapter and with only 2 USB ports (with an Amazon adapter to fix the ridiculous lack of ports)
 still did not work as was not a solution. Finally roughlly bertween 3 days ago to today so around the 21st which I beleive is when all the June 2019 updates finally finished getting downloaded and installed only a tethered phone "LAN" connection would work
 at all.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My USB wifi stick and the stock onboard pcie adapter showed networks, just not mine, and would not connect. I still thought it was related to the update but I did some Googling after it really started to interfere with my life and work. I found the last post
 of the first result going from 2015 Surface 2 I believe until a very recent Surface 6 Pro post of the same issue said it was related to updates scheduled as tasks or services in Windows (Related to Chrome on his I believe).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So today after a full day of switching evey setting and slwoly trying all the ideas in that thread and that I could think of I again read this person disabled Chrome Updater. I opened Glarys Utilties and disabled a ton of servivces related to anything Chromebrowser
 based (Chorome UpdateUA &amp; 64, Brave (chrome based) excact same update tasks and anything that just seemed like it might be similar a bunch of scheduled tasks that matched the original post and my exact same and 2+ exact same client tasks I disabled. A TON
 of stuff I felt wasnt needed perday in my experience or just seemed "off".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I sit on the onboard WiFi adapter connected to my router/modem of which I thought an update to it I did caused this, followed by the above plus a ton more and everything seems hunky dorey. We'll see after a few days again however.<br />
<br />
After that starts the process of re-enablding all the **** I disabled or uninstalled/deleted etc. the last few days and see if anything sticks it head up so that it can be fixed somehow. I consider myself a computer nerd and usually can track down and fix any
 issues within an hour or two at most especially with all the tools I had at my disposable and Im glad I havnt had to reinstall Win10 or revert to a previous build (yet, fingers crossed. That was my next step I dont use sysRestore points etc. on a 128gb high-end
 device., Just no storage, thats my next "homefixit task"...)<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone have, had, heard of this issue and realized the same temporary 'fix' and come to any final conclusions that can be passed onto the community or the respective developers to fix as I'm sure people running Chrome based browsers with Marvell network
 adapters or any non LAN based networks as it is I suppose (I hate wifi but alas no cable ability on this).<br />
<br />
Would be good to get some reports other than the couple on that post lasting the last 4.5 years with tons of different setups and get this possible fairly common setup issue from happening to people and driving them mad, this totally ruined my thus-far first
 time full legit Windows and stock settings + common and above common security software and practices. I was going to try installing a RC or pirated version of win10 if this didnt work as Surface added stuff and BitLocker were my next ideas, after resettings
 the router/modem which made no sense.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all, hope to hear some thoughts or success/failure results and will update if this lasts after I get all my stuff back running on its on and get some sleep.<br />
<br />
//Posted as a discussion not a question as at the moment its the most stable I've seen since the first fix attempt will update. (This could go in install, update and repair sub-category too, coin-toss)<br />

<p>Well after the whole evening went without a hitch: I woke up to same issue, BUT I rebooted and it went back fine. We'll see, and I'llk double check the service/tasks at some point and do some googling abou chrome specifically with network cards on pcie/surface.
 We'll see, hope someone finds this helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Edit: INTERESTING. It happened again as soon as I got going in chrome, turned off "run chrome in the background" right clicking on the system tray icon and it instantly connected.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Gonna do some googling today for sure, as well as here, maye reddit. We'll see what google has to say first now that I have more deatils that its something about background serices or something possibly.<br />
Hope this gets me somewhere:&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Creation Tool.</h2>
                    <p>Hey so im having an issue creating a bootable USB drive for windows 10. I want to do a fresh install of it on my computer. So i fire it up and choose to create a bootable USB drive, select my drive and what not. Things go and start installing. But once it
 finishes the USB drive is empty, no files on it. Whats going on? Can i not create this even if its right in the options?</p>

<li>The user (I have the same problem) downloads the tooll</li><li>The user downloads the image.&nbsp; </li><li>The tool verifies the packager - presumably with a checksum hash.</li><li>After the tool verifies, it unpacks the image to prep install or the ISO build.</li><li>The installer then hangs.</li></ol>
<p>You can rule out the server because the package is verified at step 3.&nbsp; The installer tool would&nbsp;not progress past that point if your server theory was correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody at Microsoft know if there was a rush on the unit testing for the installer?</p>

            <p>Does anyone have an answer yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am to having the same problem, it worked about 2 weeks ago and I was trying it again today, it gets all the way to Creating Windows Media to the thumb drive just like you and then at about 50-60% it errors out and all I can do is close it and try again,
 the thumb I use is a patriot blitz 64Gb, it is clean as a whistle from about 4 re-formats today and 4 failures, I did the English Win 10 pro version 32 bit (x86) I mean it is not a big bother because we can get the ISO and burn it to dvd or use rufus to burn
 it to a thumb,&nbsp; but I was just liking the creation tool and then wham it errors out, oh well we will never find an answer to this one but I contribute to computer help forums and did a screen shot of the how to's for this tool,&nbsp; now I have to re-do it and
 have no explanations why the post is void other than it does not work. maybe because the first time was a beta as we are testers and now the RTM is not working with it,&nbsp; that's all I can come up with at the moment.&nbsp; This is my computer specs and here are some
 screen shots.&nbsp; Actually the first time I used it was on August 1st 2015 12 noon Seattle time and it worked fine.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue. I could't wait so decided to use media creator. I asked it to update my system, and it tells me time and again 'that something happened'. So I'm back to waiting, but I'm afraid that when 8.1 will try to update via the slow and
 'normal' way the same problem occurs. What is happening?</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I&nbsp;downloaded the toll for Win 10 Home 64-bit.</li><li>Run the tool which downloads the image.&nbsp; Took a while, big image, slow connection.</li><li>The tool verifies the image - presumably with a checksum hash.</li><li>After the tool verifies, it unpacks the image to prep install or the ISO build.</li><li>The installer begins and then hangs at between 50% and 60%.</li><li>After some time (over an hour) the tool closes on its own leaving the USB stick empty or inaccessible.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be an issue with the tool, not a server issue.&nbsp; I used a 4 gB data traveler USB stick.</p>

<p>Yes, this is happening to all the emails I try to forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the app installed on a Surface Pro 3 and also an HP desktop, and it fails to forward in both apps.</p>

<p>There are different reasons why you are experiencing this issue.&nbsp; Sometimes, an outdated application or incorrect server settings may affect the behavior of the app.&nbsp; We recommend that you first install any pending updates for the Mail app, then check if
 the email server settings are correct.&nbsp; You can refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/POP-and-IMAP-server-name-reference-8361e398-8af4-4e97-b147-6c6c4ac95353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link

If the email has a link or video or image in it, try removing it and resend. My wife sent me an email from her Yahoo email and I opened it with the Mail app that comes with Windows 10. Tried to reply, but got that 'Something went wrong ...' message. Removed
 the link and tried again and it went through.

    <title>Task Scheduler MMC could not create snap-in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Task Scheduler MMC could not create snap-in</h2>
                    I'm working on someone else's computer who for weeks and weeks has been getting a message about the "SQM Consolidator has stopped working." I researched it from my place, and found an instruction to disable it in the Task Scheduler. So that's one of the
 things I'm here to do. Only when I try to run the Task Scheduler, I get the message about "MMC could not create the snap-in" for Task Scheduler. I researched that here , and ran the SFC. At the end of that, "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files
 but was unable to fix some of them." I can paste the text of the CSB.log here if you want. I'm scratching my head and feeling like I'm wasting time with dead ends. Can you help?<br />

<h3> blacknblu3b3rry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tooltip for &#34;...&#34; URL&#47;search results&#63;</h2>
                    hello. as far as the URL itself goes, it is easy enough to see in the status bar at the bottom in your browser. however... i remember long ago that, if you would hover your cursor over the the actual search result, a tooltip would show letting you read
 the full title-thingy of your search result(s).<br />
<br />
<div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2ffGGQu77.png" /></div>
<br />
<br />
as you can see in the image, there is more to the title result, but we can't read it unless actually clicking the URL to visit. (in this particular example, visiting the URL shows us the full title is "Is there a way to add a tooltip that shows a result of
 a search on <span><em><strong>a table's field?</strong></em></span>" )<br />
<br />
i don't remember on what version of Windows we stopped seeing this tooltip, but... i DO know it used to show up. is there a way to restore this?

<h2>            Apps not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my desktop PC from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Home last October.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recovery period was over, Windows 10 started acting up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a system upgrade, many of the apps stop working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These apps include Windows Store, Mail, Calendar, Calculator, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of Mail &amp; Calendar are now showing as "@{microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_17.6416.4200" in the start menu, while Windows Store is showing as "@{Microsoft.WindowsStore_2015.23.23.0_x64_8wekyb3d".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether other system apps are also not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the system file checker in administrator mode and the resulting log file has 80K+ lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to run Windows Store troubleshooter but it says Microsoft Account required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DON'T WANT TO SIGNIN WINDOWS USING MY MICROSOFT ACCOUNT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use Add-AppxPackage to re-register these apps, I got various errors, such as merge failure with C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Micro...\resources.pri, or the manifest file not found (due to corrupted install location).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Get-AppxPackage output for Windows Store and Calculator:</p>

</p><p>Since this is an upgrade from Windows 7, I have a large number of programs already installed. I would not consider re-installing Windows 10 as a viable option. If I have to re-install everything, I might as well switch to a Mac right now.</p>

</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<br />3.- Expand the category with the hardware you want to update.
<br />4.- Right-click the device, and select Update Driver.
<br />5.- Click the Browse my computer for driver software option.
<br />6.- Click the Browse button
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<p>I followed the steps but got to message that my device (a new Acer laptop) was up to date. Was no choice offered to update drivers. Not sure what to try next.&nbsp; It seems to have something to do with this being a new laptop.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>HP Probook 6570b uefi bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ratnik bgd  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Probook 6570b uefi bug</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to install Google Chrome OS to boot alongside Windows 10 on my Probook 6570b. As Chrome needs UEFI, i had to change mbr to gpt and to install GPT Windows 10 Pro x64.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my PC boot, there is a HP logo instead of Windows logo, PC is slow as **** and doesn't recognize my D drive.</p>
<p>Windows made all the partitions for system, msr etc. and my C drive is 300 GB.</p>
<p>Another 700 GB is gone, even after I made new partition D 500 GB. Other 200GB I want to use with Chrome OS.</p>
<p>Any suggestions for this bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I was using GPT Windows 8.1 on the same lap top, 2 years ago, and it was just fine. So I assume this is Win 10 related.</p>

            <p>Don't know there are a stars, I didn't curse.</p>
<p>So, I managed to fix memory with Ubuntu Live USB.</p>
<p>But there is a still HP logo instead of WIndows while booting up.</p>
<p>SO I tried with inital Windows 10 to fix this and hp logo is gone. Anniversary update brings back HP logo and removes Windows logo.</p>
<p>This is not the case with Bios, just with uefi.</p>

<p>Hello ssovets,</p>
<p>I can increase or decrease sound by only one increments by moving the mouse or scroll. I suggest you decrease the sensitivity of your mouse and see if it makes any difference.<br />
<br />
The Volume Control in Windows 7 is&nbsp;capable of managing sound settings for each multimedia application installed on your PC versus Windows XP where you could only make a systemwide change that was the same for all applications.&nbsp; To access the Volume Mixer click
 on the small volume icon on your taskbar.&nbsp;To make individual application settings, click on the<em>Mixer</em> link at the bottom of the Sound control icon.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this has helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Surface RT &#40;Gen1&#41; battery capacity is not visible in the powercfg battery report</h2>
                    <font><span>
<p>You can create a Battery Report.&nbsp; Open an elevated command prompt on the SurfaceRT device, and type in:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>powercfg /batteryreport</p>
</blockquote>
</span>
<p><br />
</p>
</font>
<p>This report shows my battery capacity as "unknown".</p>
<p>Also Windows desktop is unable to report the remaining battery time of the device.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is the case since day1 on Win RT 8.0 (currently I run Win RT 8.1 RTM). </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For the reference: </p>
<p>Battery name: X865745 </p>
<p>Manufacturer: Samsung </p>
<p>Chemistry: LION </p>
<p>design / full charge capacity: -- mWh (literally like this, no values are seen here)
</p>
<p>cycle count: 51</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is this an acknowledged defect of the Samsung battery / defect of early Surface RTs shipped in 2012 December / defect of Windows RT, or this is an individual issue on my Surface RT only?</p>

It doesn't show estimated times. Not a fault there.<br />

1) what kind of troubleshooting have you done: <br />
there is nothing to do here, it does not report the battery capacity since day 1, period. I cannot replace the battery (as its non-replaceable) with an other one to check if it behaves differently.<br />
2) Tried a Refresh or Reset?<br />
It works like this since day 1, so I am not going to refresh or reset my OS due to a blind guess just to loose my apps and settings.
<br />
3) Are you seeing any discrepancies in other functions or apps? <br />
Irrelevant question, skipping it<br />
4) All updates installed?<br />
As you well know already, on win RT the end-user (owner) isnt allowed to disable WU, so all updates are installed, yes.<br />
5) When was your last full shut down and start?<br />
Irrelevant question. For the record, it does not really matter, as this unit was shut down completely at least 2 dozen times in the last 12 months.<br />
<br />
I would be more happy, if somebody -who is actually an owner of a similar device- would reply to this thread with his/her own experience. I am not really moving forward with the "official" support resources.<br />

            Even MS staff doesnt know if this is by design or hardware-software malfunctioning? The silence suggests you want to withheld a known product defect / design issue.<br />

            <p>It sucks to say, but this wasnt resolved at all. Because I couldnt get the attention any knowledgeable person from the MS staff, the bling guesses from the not-so-experienced staff didnt lead to anywhere, I had to conclude this is by design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest shame to all the MS staff who were involved in this thread, that I found the answer to my question on a 3rd party site here:</p>
<p>http://www.wpcentral.com/connected-standby-and-why-its-important-surface-pro-3</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>One side effect of the AOAC and Connected Standby mode is that the battery icon on the desktop will only tell you the percentage of battery left but not the time estimate, like traditional laptops. So if you're wondering why that isn't there any longer,
 there you go.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The missing battery capacity issue (the original starter issue of this thread) still remained unanswered, unacknowledged and ununderstood by Microsoft support people here. Thats what I call: "knowledge of their own in-house product?" --&gt; total failure!<br />

            <p>I know, nobody cares, but some small update (dont worry, issue still not resolved and seems it will never be):</p>
<p>
</p><p>my original 2014 December Surface1 RT touch screen partially lost the ability to sense touch at the right side of the screen (kinda sucks if the touch sensor does not sense touch input, do you agree?) so I applied for a replacement. I got a brand new device
 (or at least MS didnt tell me if it was actually a refurbished one) and this "newish" device also doesnt report the battery capacity, so I file this as design defect.
