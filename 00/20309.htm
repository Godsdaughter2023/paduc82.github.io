    <title>Review&#58; Windows 10 build 10049&#47;10061 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andre da costa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Review&#58; Windows 10 build 10049&#47;10061</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p><span>With Microsoft’s annual developer conference Build fast approaching; I thought I should take some time out and talk about my experiences with the latest Windows 10 builds. It’s been an interesting start to 2015, before the new year arrived Microsoft
 took a break issuing builds while they tightened up things in anticipation for a more polished build presented at a Preview Event in January at the company’s Redmond campus. This build turned out to be 9926 and it stayed with us for quite some time. So much
 so it got a lot of Windows Insiders disgruntled wondering what was happening and why they were not seeing a consistent flow of newer builds. Microsoft finally relented and issued its first build since January, build 10041 at the end of March, almost two months
 after that long drought. Microsoft followed up with an even more refined build, 10049 which showed further UI work and inclusion of universal apps and the new Spartan web browser.</span></p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p><span>Since then, the drought looked like it was making a comeback, not for long though. The company soon followed up with another build, 10061. With BUILD less than couple days away (as of this writing); we are likely to see an even more polished feature
 set. Since then, news has leaked that Microsoft will likely launch the milestone RTM (release to manufacturing) build at the end of July 2015. This is both exciting and worrying to many since Windows 10 even though it has come a long way since October 2014
 still feels extremely rough around the edges and numerous complaints and reports I and fellow Windows Insiders continue experience leave me with a feeling of, I hope this major release is not being rushed. Honestly, I don’t think it should be, even if Windows
 10 had to be delayed until summer 2016, I personally would prefer that. Windows 8.1 has matured nicely and I am sure Microsoft could work on some extras to deliver between now and fall that could rejuvenate some interest in Windows devices expected later this
 year. </span></p>

here</a> for a larger size. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>SETUP</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 build 10049/10061 so far have only been distributed through Windows Update. Personally, I find the Windows Update mechanism for newer builds disastrous. I think the last build I had successfully updated to through Windows Update was 9860.
 Microsoft had provided .ISOs for every build up to 10041, but it looks like they are skipping it for build 10049/10061. I personally attempted to update from 10041 through Windows Update and it fell flat. It successfully downloaded, but after a restart and
 booting into a new setup experience, it remained stuck at 30% and wouldn’t move. Because bandwidth is not a luxury where I live, I decided that I am not going to waste anymore and just downloaded a .ISO file for builds 10049/10061 someone created from a ESD
 file and uploaded to a torrent. It successfully downloaded in 20 minutes. I honestly did not want to do it, but I had no choice. In less than 15 minutes I had build 10061 up and running from a build to build upgrade using the ISO file compared to the more
 than 3 hours it would take using Windows Update. I am not the only one who has experienced this fiasco and seriously it concerns me. I personally believe Windows Update was just never designed to deliver software this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4105cfe-6ae1-4dc1-a4c0-2f31fe7577a3" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Windows 10 shows its new slicker setup experience.</em></p>
<p><span>The fact that the download through Windows Update takes a considerable amount of time and this is a compressed file that is expanded after it is downloaded, then it has to reboot and actually install the build which can take anywhere between 2 to 3
 hours; It’s just unforgiveable knowing this is not a guarantee to work well. This is definitely reminding me of the update experience many faced when updating from Windows 8.0 to Windows 8.1 and even Update 1. Microsoft needs to have an option built into the
 new Windows Update mechanism to pause the download, suspend, resume and let users download it at their own pace. So they don’t have to spend every waking moment to check if it downloaded or not. The advantages of the Windows Update method are lost between
 downloading and installing. Microsoft should just push this release as a .ISO and give users instructions how to create a bootable copy on a DVD or USB thumb drive.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A participant on the Windows 10 Insider Forums discovered the best way to work around this bug is to disconnect from the Internet (wired/wireless) after the download reaches 100% then let the installation proceed. Some users are facing issues with
 finding the update even though they are on the Fast branch. A work around for this is to reset the software distribution folder. This is not something I think will be considered a desirable experience when migrating to Windows 10. Considering that many Windows
 users are contented with Windows 7 and those who went through Windows 8.0, 8.1, Update 1 are not that enthused for another round of frustration and troubleshooting. So that’s setup in a nutshell, still a work in progress, still unreliable, still not recommended.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>OOBE</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Other aspects of Windows 10 still remains disappointing. There are a lot of users who do not want to sign in using a Microsoft Account. Microsoft needs to relent on this and let users have the clear choice of signing using a Microsoft Account or a
 Local Account. The Local Account option is too hidden resulting in complaints from users they are being coerced into a Microsoft Account. Don’t get me wrong, I like using my Microsoft Account with Windows and I see the clear benefits, at the same time, there
 are a lot of users who simply don’t want this functionality no matter how great it is. Another issue users are reporting is the inability to create a user account. The only work around for this is to initiate a clean install (for some, this means starting
 from scratch with build 10041 since there is no ISO for 10061). I personally have not experienced the problem, but it’s a common occurrence for many on the Windows Insider forums.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f829b9fc-67d7-494b-977f-dac5db6c7d90" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Yep, you still have to go through with this. The Windows Team could at least do a 1 minute tour.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p><span>Why can’t the Windows Team move installing modern apps portion from OOBE to the setup phase? I find it absolutely annoying that I have to go through this waiting period every time I install a new build of Windows 10. Does Microsoft really expect users
 to always go through this provisioning every time a new build of Windows 10 is released even when the product has launched? At least install them in the background and let the user reach the desktop so they can start using their computer. Microsoft Office
 365 has a clever capability as part of its Click to Run Technology where you can use parts of the suite while the rest downloads and installs in the background, I recommend the Windows Team look into this for Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p><span>Since build 9926 Windows 10 includes a Rollback feature as part of its Update and Recovery tools; which allows installations of Windows 8/8.1, Windows 7 and Windows 10 builds to be rolled back to a previous version or build. I tried it out with Windows
 7 and it works as intended. Any apps installed after upgrading to Windows 10 though will be removed. It’s a handy feature and will be an important layer to troubleshooting installations of Windows 10 that might fail. I still recommend you create a thorough
 backup before upgrading though (System Image). These are some of the niceties of the OS I like which I honestly believe Microsoft should have delivered as far back as Windows Vista.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>DAILY USAGE</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 build 10061 features minor improvements and if you have been diligently updating to each build, there is not much to see on the surface. Coming from Windows 7 or even Windows 8, the OS feels like a familiar but dramatic departure. Build
 10049 reintroduces the Network Fly out (for Windows 7 users, View Available Networks). This function is definitely a convenience, since past builds required opening Settings and connecting to Wireless Networks from there. Network Fly out is quite buggy though
 and does not reveal available wireless networks on initial click. Usually there is a delay or you have to toggle the Wi-Fi tab on and off until your network connection appears. It also lacks functions like the ability to define a connection as metered. You
 can of course access this function from the familiar Show Available Connections Pane in Settings. I hope by the next build these limitations are fixed.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0888b0ea-9e9c-4dc6-a9f4-87fcc04017be" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span><em>Significant improvements, Network Flyout makes a return, with a vastly updated Notification Center.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p><span>Notifications sees some refinements and basically works as intended. I am able to quickly view and read incoming email, view app notifications and information about system updates, although I notice those are not working when I click on them or if
 it is the intended behaviour. Notification Centre is a useful addition to Windows and was long overdue, its centralized and definitely makes it easy to remember where to check for common task users will often skip or forget about. Remaining in the Notification
 Area, there are still some issues that exist, the Battery Notification itself is buggy and I notice there seems to be a bug in this build where my computer is not automatically hibernating and an issue with a battery not available for use. Users will notice
 that Windows Defender now makes a return to the Notification Area for quick access. There is still no context menu for scanning files or folders. Either way, it’s not a big deal since I will be replacing Windows Defender with a more effective third party Antivirus
 utility. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>START</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Start is slightly improved over previous builds, featuring improved visuals, apart from that, the only noticeable changes is the addition of default locations for File Explorer, Settings and Documents. There is still no option to move the Cortana Search
 within the menu itself which would be a better option for persons might not want to have the Search box always present on the Taskbar. The All Apps menu has not changed either, featuring the alphabet layout of programs and groups, I personally preferred the
 layout in build 9841. A Customize option remains curiously greyed out from the Taskbar and Start menu properties which probably suggest there are more options to come. Since build 10041 I have started using the Start in full screen mode more often, with build
 10061, I have moved back to a semi Start menu like experience where I get the best of both worlds. I never had a problem with Windows 8’s Start Screen, I just wish it had embraced the parts of Windows that made it a success, such as the Taskbar which is always
 on screen, quicker access to your application library and the ability to easily manage and customize modern desktop apps. The Start menu improvements in build 10061 are welcome, it’s now resizable, features quicker access to Power Options in the lower bottom
 of the Start screen and a slicker design with an option for transparency and a variety of colour choices available in Settings &gt; Personalization.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I miss Jump list on the Start menu, a feature introduced in Windows 7, the only place you will find it now is on the Taskbar and its limited to classic desktop apps only. I really would have love to see this feature make a return. The new modern Settings
 app includes the option to pin frequently accessed Settings on the Start screen itself. I do not like the fact that when you do this though it just pins a generic cog on the Start screen. Some uniqueness would be nice, but I guess with time not being a luxury,
 the designers can’t bother to create a unique pictorial representation for each setting.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can easily rearrange and create groups on the Start Screen. I like how it’s much easier to rename them too, just hover at the top of a group and a field box will be displayed indicating the ability to name or rename a group. I also like the vertical
 layout instead of Windows 8/8.1 horizontal menu or the semantic zoom if you are still running Windows 8.0, makes it feel more familiar and approachable. Focusing a bit more on Tiles, it looks like you are limited with what you can do in Windows 10. The option
 to turn off live tiles for instance is not available. This is an option I think is necessary since it’s a bandwidth leaker and since I am on a metered connection, I would rather not have these apps downloading data in the background.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>SETTINGS</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In Windows 8/8.1 Settings went through a schizophrenic period in regards to configuration Tools. First it was a hidden PC Settings modern app that featured limited options for customizing your PC. Later it evolved in Windows 8.1 to add more capabilities
 lessening the need to access the desktop Control Panel. In Windows 10, you can pretty much find all you need without turning to Control Panel. First of all, its windowed, but it’s very stoic and focused. Cleverly broken down into nine categories consolidating
 the plethora of items into groups of logical areas of the system. Users will of course miss the flexibility of Desktop Control Panel (which is still there by the way) in this new Settings app. You can’t for instance view all settings which I think would lead
 to more confusion considering the wealth of tools the OS includes for adjusting your Windows configuration. The great thing is, there is almost a modern equivalent of what you would find in the desktop Control Panel. Of course some areas such as Power Options,
 Personalization still lead to areas of the classic Control Panel, but its minor. You can stay in settings for most task. Privacy is a lot richer in functions with the ability to limit what apps can access in a variety of areas which include Location, Camera,
 Microphone, Contacts, Calendar, Messaging, Radios, Account Info, Other devices, Feedback and Speech/Inking and Typing.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>SEARCH</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Search is an integral part of Windows, the company first demonstrated this commitment with Windows Vista which included Instant Search. Windows 10 includes a comprehensive solution that is very impressive an example is the new Microsoft’s Digital Assistant
 Cortana first featured on Windows Phone 8.1. Although Cortana is a big part of using Windows 10, I am limited by my bandwidth, so my experience with Search is specifically around local activities. Local Search breaks down search results into several categories:
 Documents, Apps, Settings, Photos, Videos, Music and Email. Search also splits your results between those on your local drive and OneDrive.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85d15e2e-e099-480b-9807-be2887550592" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span><em>Search in Windows 10 litterally puts it all at your finger tips.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p><strong><span>APPs</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 introduces a wider selection of modern apps, many of which end up replacing traditional desktop applications. The first one I discovered was Calculator, now a modern app, the experience comes across disconcerting at first, but eventually
 you accept it. It provides the middle ground between a mouse/keyboard and touch optimized experience. I am also pleased it launches just as fast as the old Calculator, I was starting to worry when I encountered it in previous builds after seeing a splash screen
 each time I launched the app. The benefits of the modern app model with an app such as calculator its more flexible, you can actually maximize it into a full screen app for instance. The app also shows off some of the changes to modern apps in Windows 10,
 a hamburger menu provides quick access to settings of the app so you can on the fly switch to Scientific, Programmer and Converter modes. Not only is it touch friendly but works just as great with a mouse.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Music and Video were updated and pushed outside of build 10049 through the Store beta. The apps feature significant improvements and I can safely say, it’s time to retire Windows Media Player and forget about using third party apps like VLC. The great
 thing about Music in particular it actually looks and works like a modern juke box. Of course, its touch optimized, but I feel right at home in the app. Music is of course part of Microsoft’s Cloud mantra and the app integrates with Microsoft’s Cloud Storage
 OneDrive, you can sign in and access your synced music library from OneDrive itself. The app features standard juke features such as music categories for your library: album, artiste, songs, now playing and options for creating play list or importing from
 third party apps such as iTunes. At the bottom, you will find common player controls for scrubbing through a track, play, forward, volume, shuffle and repeat. Of course, Music app reveals some of the minor flaws of Modern apps in Windows 10, the lack some
 of the truly small but unique features of Windows 7 such as Jump List support and Live window controls such as (fast forward, play) you would find in an app such as Windows Media Player.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 features two come backs now bundled with the OS, Mail and Calendar. Versions of Windows dating back to Windows 95 included a Mail client. Windows Vista was the first to include a Calendar app. Windows 7 removed these apps and bundled them
 as part of the Windows Live Essentials package you had to download. The new mail and calendar apps are clean in design and are easy to use. Account setup is quick and easy especially if you are already using a Microsoft Account with your Windows 10 setup,
 just connect and that’s it! Mail allows you to add accounts for Microsoft’s popular enterprise mail server Exchange or other popular third party services such as Google Mail or even Apples iCloud. While reading this, you will notice that both Mail and Calendar
 are separate modern apps. Calendar is not an integrated part of the Mail app for instance, unlike Outlook which includes an integrated calendar. If that is something you like, then Outlook will remain the best choice. Although I don’t see it as a disadvantage,
 sometimes all you need access to is just your Calendar. Both apps are touch optimized and features large icons that will be more friendly for Tablet users. They work just as well with keyboard and mouse.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In celebration of its 25</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> anniversary, Windows 10 also sees the return of the popular time killer, Solitaire. Windows 8 did not come with built in Games like previous versions of Windows and I believe it
 riled up a lot of Windows users who loved having their favourite card games. Although you could always download these from the Windows Store, I believe it was lost on persons they could do so. To be honest, I launched it but it quit instantly, so there seems
 to be some work to be done before its fully ready. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Photos app now includes the album feature, but crashes immediately after opening. So that’s my time with Photos.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>OFFICE for TOUCH</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Windows finally sees a modern touch optimized version of Office and its only for Windows 10. If you are using Windows 10 on a desktop/laptop form factor with no touch support, you are not missing anything. The apps can be downloaded from the Store
 beta. Only Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote (which comes bundled with Windows 10) are supported. Makes sense, I can’t picture Project, Visio and Access having a pressing need to be touch optimized. The apps are extremely basic and features just the essential
 features necessary for a touch environment and that’s the way it should be. The key here is document fidelity that is optimized to work with touch. If you have content to prepare that requires the precision of a mouse and keyboard, desktop Office remains the
 best choice. If you own a device like Microsoft’s Surface 3, I am sure these new revisions of Office apps will be a welcome.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Project Spartan</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Project Spartan is Microsoft’s next generation web browser that will succeed the 20-year-old Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer 11 will be the last version of the web browser, but Microsoft will continue to maintain it for legacy purposes, knowing
 that Project Spartan will not feature the full compatibility of IE that has been specifically targeted by many web sites and also thousands enterprise Intranet websites. Project Spartan is based on a new rendering engine called edge.html. The promise of this
 new web browser is no compromise, allowing web developers to easily build sites just as they easily do today for competing web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, both of which have nearly halved Internet Explorer’s market share over the past
 10 years. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am not going to go into the technical refinements, but discuss more about my experience using the web browser on a daily basis like I would IE, Firefox or Chrome. First impressions, it has a long way to go. In fact, when I was using it in build 10049,
 both it and Internet Explorer had a serious virtual memory bug that caused Windows 10 to hang up requiring a cold boot. That issue seem to have been resolved in build 10061, but the browser is severely lacking functionality in comparison to its predecessor
 and other third party web browsers. I notice the app stays resident in memory just to give the illusion it loads fast. I also notice it displays a splash screen, something I have not seen since Internet Explorer 5.5. Another thing I notice it lacks some customization
 which I hope to see fix before the OS launches. For instance, the Favourites bar can’t be customized, so links I commonly access are pushed off to an overflowing menu, but I can’t drag them around. The browser does feature some improved capabilities, for instance,
 you can on the fly adjust settings which displays a quick sidebar where you can do things like turn off flash, quickly set your home page and adjust cookie settings. The browser though failed when I noticed I had left my PC for a while. When I returned to
 use it, all the tabs I had open were missing and the app simply reloaded the home page.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b52d695-c168-4611-adcc-35b4a06f09a5" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span><em>Microsoft's successor to Internet Explorer; Project Spartan - still a work in progress.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p><span>Some keyboard commands like F6 no longer work. Even when click in the Address bar, I can’t select all the text using keyboard or mouse. Organizing areas of the web browser such as Favourites is quite limited, although I do like the new consolidated
 view where you can access not only Favourites but your reading list, downloads and Internet History.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How does it do in web browsing? The Spartan browser functions quite fine in this regard, I am able to access and view many popular web sites such as Google News and all the many tech and news web sites I visit daily. I do notice some web site controls
 such as comment sections do not load properly or not all, in particular Disqus comment systems will fail or not work.
</span></p>

</p><p><span>Modern apps after have come a long way from their immature days on Windows 8.0. They are usable and you can go through a full day without experiencing any problems in ‘some’ of these apps. Understanding that Windows 10 is still in development, I am
 sure a lot of work is being done to make them more robust and ready to truly succeed desktop apps. Of course, with crashing I am seeing in apps like Photos and limited capabilities of Project Spartan, two apps I would describe as being essentials to any computer
 use, there Microsoft should put significant human resources to ensure these two are as full featured and functional as any classic desktop app. Modern apps need to also support some of the missing classic features of Windows 7 like Jump List and Live Preview
 controls. For instance, Project Spartan does not support Tab previews from the Taskbar like Internet Explorer which is strange and there is no Private Mode.

</p><p><strong><span>FILE EXPLORER</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Not much has changed in File Explorer. The Favourites link Navigation Pane is now called Quick Access. When you launch File Explorer, it defaults to Quick Access view which displays your recently created or accessed folders, along with a collection
 of your most recently accessed files. You can of course change this from the Folder Options. This PC introduced in Windows 8.1 sees some light changes. Storage properties displays a revised visual donut chart instead of the old 3D pie chart we have been seeing
 since Windows 95. Users will also notice a new icon set with some describing the look reminiscent of defunct 90s OS BeOS and a Recycle Bin that curiously looks like it came off the Windows 95 desktop.

</p><p><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is just the tip of the iceberg. There is certainly more areas I could have covered, but six pages of content seems like a lot of cover for a still evolving OS. Windows 10 has a lot riding on it. Summer seems like a very ambitious schedule to launch
 what some are describing as a make or break it release. Since October, I have been through more downs than ups and I know I should be understanding that this OS is still under heavy development. With rumours speculating a possible launch at the end of July,
 I can’t picture Windows 10 possibly going out with everything in tip top shape, considering there is still a numerous amount of unfinished UX work, along with a still high rate of unstable code throughout the OS. The distribution experience in particular is
 a concern; I hope the Windows Team surprises me. Windows Update experience is one word: terrible, not just distributing the code, but the lack of flexibility. Many are assuming maybe Windows 10 will launch in a barebones state with features and apps delivered
 through Windows Update and the Store over time, likely repeating the same ‘it gets better with time’ philosophy of Windows 8/8.1. Something users surely won’t tolerate.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The most important audience to sell this OS to are developers and that is where BUILD comes in. Windows 10 needs to be an enticing story, the idea of Universal applications that span desktop, tablet and phone is an important strategy. The company has
 been toting this since Windows 8 launched but it has not come to fruition until now. The app experience is still woefully lacking on mobile for Windows Phone. Although I have not looked at that variant of Windows 10, it is critical to its success, since Microsoft
 is hoping both desktop and mobile can feed off each other’s success. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 still remains between a rock and hard place. It needs to embrace its mobile future fully, but it can’t isolate a healthy market of nearly a billion Windows 7 users who the company is enticing with a free upgrade. A needed market to give
 this OS the clout it needs along with the dominance that so far has escaped its flagship Windows 8.1 release. Windows 10 though is in the right direction. I believe the Company is listening to the feedback, making it the OS that a Windows 7 user will feel
 right at home in while offering unique experiences on new form factors, there is a chance for Microsoft to reclaim some glory it has lost over the past 3 years, something it can afford to further loose.</span></p>

I personally looked forward to reading them, but looking at the future, this methodology of covering the latest version of a Windows release will eventually become obsolete.

<p>Hi Axlu,</p>
<p>Please check if you have the same time zone set in your device, PC and Outlook as well. And make sure that you have enabled the day-light savings option, if applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also could you be more specific about your issue.<br />
<br />
Which operating system do u use?<br />
Which model handset you use?<br />
Which firmware version do you have in your mobile? ( *#0000# will reveal the details)<br />
Are you trying to connect thru cable or thru Bluetooth?<br />
Which version of OVI suite you use?<br />

<p>Hi I have the same problem.&nbsp; I have spent hours and hours on it.&nbsp; I have uninstalled ovi and all nokia software, then reinstalled it all, then synced.&nbsp; No joy, all my appointments are one hour out. Had to manually delete them all from the phone.&nbsp; But now
 they are incorrect on outlook as well.&nbsp; Have to delete them manually from outlook and put them all in again.&nbsp; Didn't have this problem with pc suite.&nbsp; so installed pc suite and guess what? same problem!&nbsp; so is it something to do with Windows 7?&nbsp; It is driving
 me crazy.</p>

<p>- please ensure your time settings are correct (or in sync) on the PC side and on the device side (including Daylight Savings). Instructions available in this discussion thread.</p>
<p>- ensure you have the latest version of Ovi Suite (check also ovi.com for new version)</p>
<p>- ensure your data in OLK is correct (take a backup of your OLK calendar)</p>
<p>- clean up all the calendar events from the device</p>
<p>- execute sync</p>
<p>During the sync Ovi Suite will raise a warning about deleting the items, choose "Sync without deleting". After that your data should be correct on the device (if your time settings are correctly set and in sync with PC side).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this will help you to get the situation stabile.</p>

 and still my phone is one hour out (earlier on phone than on PC; we are in summer time here in NZ if that is relevant to the direction of the difference) EXCEPT that one of my recurring appointments (and only one of them, and the only one that starts on the
 half-hour rather than on the hour) is correct!&nbsp; Go figure</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is alluded to above as well and I suspect you would notice inconsistencies in MSOutlook when daylight saving came into effect if not, but mention it again just in case - do you also have those in MSOutlook 2007 set correctly and the alternate time Zone also?</p>

<p>OK, I have borrowed a phone that I have found exhibits the same behaviour, a 2730c - it had never been synced with MSOutlook before so the behaviour was not known to its user. I have had a play with it on a Win 7 64 bit, MSOutlook 2007 PC&nbsp; with location
 set such that daylight saving is in effect in order to replicate your situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not get Alles solution to work on it.&nbsp;The only way&nbsp;I could get it to sync correctly with Outlook was to have automatic update for&nbsp;daylight saving&nbsp;on the computer disabled. Unfortunately when one first turns off daylight savings update on the PC&nbsp;MSOutlook
 is inclined to screw its own times up for&nbsp;existing events, but it is the only work around&nbsp;I could find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all cases when automatic daylight savings adjustment was activated on the PC the times for events stayed correct on the equipment they were entered on but synced incorrectly to the other equipment i.e. an event entered on the phone always stayed correct
 on the phone but synced incorrectly back to MSOutlook and vice versa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The zone and daylight saving settings on the phone were of no consequence to the syncing behaviour.</p>

<p>I had the same problem, and I managed to sort it out, trying everything you said and something else. If it helps, the point was I had the wrong time zone on the phone. I live in Spain, which is GTM+1, and somehow my device had GTM+2, although the time displayed
 on the screen was the right one for the season. Once I had the right time zone and the right time at the time, I switched the device off and turn it on again, then I synchronized it and it worked. I didn't need to have my computer's daylight saving update
 disabled at all.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This may have happened with a privacy-related app I downloaded, but have since removed. That's my hunch, anyway. I've tried the easy solutions, but I'm open to suggestion - even the most basic. I also hoped I might find 10532 on ISO to do a fresh install,
 but it's update-only. I may have also deleted my most recent recovery, as well.. so that may or may not be an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do own a product key for W10 Home x64 - So if I can't resolve the insider issue I may just go with a fresh install and go retail from here - But I would rather continue to be an insider.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Edit: I was able to retrace my steps in reinstalling the program that I suspected may have caused my problem in the first place and undoing all privacy-related changes it made. I no longer have the "Some settings are managed by your organization" warning,
 and I am able to chose fast/slow rings for insider updates. However, I have since restarted and searched for updates but do not see the a newer build available.</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 Installation Loop</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>I have a Windows 7 machine that I'm trying to install Office 2010 Home and Business on that just won’t install correctly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It seems to install correctly but doesn’t ask to restart after the installation and doesn’t make the file extension associations. The machine use to have Office 2007
 on it but doesn’t anymore. I pretty much uninstalled everything I could find related to any version of Office and have deleted the Office directory under Program Files and it still didn’t work. Every time to start an Office App it restarts the configuration
 process. I’ve also disabled all services in Msconfig before installing to no avail.</span></span></p>

    <title>Sending Documents to OneNote using Firefox through &#34;Send to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zaklantz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending Documents to OneNote using Firefox through &#34;Send to OneNote&#34; Option in the &#34;Print&#34; Box Dialog.</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently encountered a problem while trying to print a document on Firefox to OneNote 2013.&nbsp; A friend of mine suggested sending the document to OneNote by clicking the link to print the document, opening the dialog box, and selecting the printer type as
 "Send to OneNote."&nbsp; I tried doing this, but after the file downloaded it opened up OneNote, nothing appeared but the notes I already had.&nbsp; I am a little concerned because under the "Where" dialog it says "nul:" which makes me assume that the file destination
 is no where.&nbsp; I have added a picture below of what I mean.&nbsp; Does anyone know anything that could help?</p>

            Hi Ling,<br />
<br />
In most cases, when you set up an account to your phone, it will advise you to set up a pin lock for the security of your accounts associated with your phone. Regarding your concern, the pin lock is part of your phone feature and not on the account attached.
 To sort this out, we recommend that you contact your phone developer so that they could assist you with removing the pin lock on your phone.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need clarification.

<p><span><span>Hello Mar42,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Answers Community!</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To expand on what Robert Aldwinckle posted above, you can access Internet Explorer (No add-ons) by:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start Orb</strong></span></span></p>
<p>

<strong>System Tools</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Internet Explorer (No add-ons)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you don’t get the “Internet Explorer has stopped working” messages then you will just have to find which add-on was causing this to happen.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Tools</strong></span></span></p>

</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Toolbars and Extensions</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under
<strong>Show:</strong> click <strong>All add-ons</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click any add-on</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Press
<strong>CTRL + A</strong> on your keyboard (this should select all add-ons)</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Disable all</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click

<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Now all add-ons are disabled in Internet Explorer, next step is to enable them one by one.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Tools</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Manage Add-ons</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the first disabled add-on</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Enable</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Close</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Surf a few pages</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Close
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Again test to make sure you still aren’t receiving the “Internet Explorer has stopped working” messages. If all is well then the add-on you enabled
 is good to stay. Repeat the enabling process for the next disabled add-on and continue this until the error message returns. Then the last add-on enabled will need to be disabled/uninstalled/updated to avoid further problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>

Test to see how your symptoms change if you run in No Add-ons mode.<br />
<br />
You could also test to to see how your symptoms change if you disabled auto-recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;<br />
<br />
There may be some clues in the Event Viewer about what is happening.<br />

            That is a good point Mark. I tilt my phone on something just to give it air space to circulate air. I do not use it for a long time only because if I am sitting at my monitor, I can use my surface. I just use it because I can and it is fun every once in
 a while.

<p>I don't think it will but I would monitor the temperature by touching the phone to see if it is getting too hot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I do not use it for lengths of time. If I were going to, I would use my Surface just because it has the ability to keep itself some cool.</p>
<p>It is just not something I would worry about. It was designed for Windows Phone but clearly, the function is the same on your S10. I've used it on my Galaxy Note 9 a few times for up to 45 minutes (or more) and did not notice anything extraordinary for heat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a thought</p>
<p>Warm is one thing but "HOT" is another. Streaming a movie might make it run hot but normal usage should be fine. If you are streaming, just check it to keep tabs on the temp.</p>

<p>Went to use the continuum puck with my S10 today.&nbsp; Couldn't get it to work.&nbsp; I'm guessing Samsung changed something to break it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I plug in the phone, I get an "HDMI connected" and then "HDMI disconnected" which keeps looping back and forth between the states.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bummer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>… time passes ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got HDMI with Dex working with the Puck again.&nbsp; Had to toggle the "HDMI mode" in the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now the USB keyboard isn't recognized...&nbsp; Nothing is ever easy.Anybody know something to trigger the keyboard working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>… time passes ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried it again a few days later.&nbsp; Back to the "HDMI" cycling and I can't get it to stop it.&nbsp; Even after trying toggling the HDMI mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the cable and HDMI are okay, because I can still use it with my Windows phone just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>,,, more time passes ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was reading online where someone was having trouble getting and actual Samsung Dex stand to work.&nbsp; They finally connected the phone to the stand with the power not plugged into the stand.&nbsp; Then some things worked, but they were powered by the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried unplugging the power to the Continuum puck.&nbsp; Then I plugged in the phone.&nbsp; I don't remember what happened, but then when I plugged the puck back in, Dex started working normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disconnected the phone and reconnected it, the looping HDMI messages reappeared.&nbsp; So I unplugged the puck and plugged it back in and the Dex worked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(p.s.&nbsp; To get the Dex mode to go into effect, I had to drop down the menu from the top and then tell it I wanted to use the available Dex mode.&nbsp; Don't know if there were other ways to do that.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>… time passes ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried it again (several months later) and can't get it to work in Dex mode.&nbsp; Yesterday I got it to work in screen mirroring, but now I can't get anything to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing the looping of HDMI connected and disconnected is the problem, but no idea how to control that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole thing kinda sucks.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard missing underscore character and possibly asterisk</h2>
                    
<p>I can't figure out how to type the underscore character "_" with the on screen keyboard and I really need this.</p>
<p>I also have a password that contains the asterisk key "*" and there's a key on the keyboard that's just a large dot so I tried that and it doesn't work. I can work around that problem by changing my password but the missing underscore character is a huge
 problem.&nbsp; Is it there and I'm just not seeing it?</p>

<h2>            Header Status field reappears after deleting email using X Ribbon.</h2>
                    I have deleted the Header Status column from my Inbox View, but when I use the Delete X function in the Ribbon to delete any email in the Inbox, the Header Status column reappears. This does not occur if&nbsp;you delete an email using the Bin X symbol to the
 right of the email.&nbsp;Why does the Header Status reappear and is there a bug fix for it?

            It started happening after I created a new Outlook Profile. I am on Outlook Version 1902 (Build 11328.20158 Click-to-Run). There is no problem with deleting emails, the problem is with the Header Status Column. If you remove the Header Status Column (either
 by right clicking on the Header Status and selecting "Remove This Column" OR by going into Edit View and removing the Header Status Column from the view, all is fine, until you delete an email using the Delete function in the Ribbon, then when the email is
 deleted, the Header Status Column reappears.&nbsp;I did a&nbsp;full Office Repair and the problem persists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for getting back to us Robert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I tried to replicate your concern, this is how the Outlook desktop app works. As you have noticed after deleting an email, the next email on the Inbox pane will be highlighted. You mentioned that you deleted the&nbsp;<span>Header
 Status column and I assume that you are referring to hiding the Header Ribbon.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c0b71bf-548c-4886-8b0e-582075b8edd7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c0b71bf-548c-4886-8b0e-582075b8edd7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Take note that the Header Ribbon will still appear once you click the Home tab and use the delete icon there. As long as there will be a next message the header ribbon with the delete icon will still appear.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Calendar Reminders</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got 5 mailboxes added on my Outlook Profile, one of them is mine and the rest are my colleagues mailboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need only my calendar reminders and don't need to see my colleagues calendar reminders. My colleagues also need their own reminders so we cant switch them off in the web - app. Cant find any option in outlook 2016 to configure it accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to carry out this task please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Balasz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The reminder comes from the organizer. Unless the organizer uncheck
<strong>Reminder</strong> on OWA or on Outlook, then you will receive a notification.
<span>Reminders is an Outlook option and cannot be&nbsp;changed for each calendar. Ideally, you should not receive the reminders for others calendar's entries unless you are an organizer or attendee to that meeting request.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In line with this, we would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on what you think would make Outlook Calendar even better. If there is a tool or feature that you need but can't find in the app, please visit our
<em><strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Suggestion Box</a></strong></em> to give us feedback, or vote for the features that others have requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We'd love to&nbsp;</span><span>hear from you</span><span>. </span><span><span>Your feedback helps us know which features are most important to you.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry If I wasn't very clear about my problem, let me try to explain it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got different mailboxes added to my outlook profile and I am getting remainders from all mailbox accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't want to see others reminders, because its confusing, but cant switch them off because they need their own reminders</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance for that to switch the reminders off only from certain emailboxes, but only for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to get the reminders from my email account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 not accepting new password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrs_joshica  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 not accepting new password</h2>
                    I appreciate any help given to me.<br />
<br />
I set up Outlook 2013 shortly after my company changed email providers to the Microsoft Web App. Once set up it both worked and synched properly. After changing my password my Outlook stopped receiving emails and will not take anything but my old password to
 log in. I see the test email that Outlook gives when going to my email box, and I am able to both send receive in my normal email without issue, but Outlook will only send and not receive any new emails. For the life of me I cant understand why Outlook is
 logging in with my old password and not my new. I have tested my Outlook web app and it does log me in properly under my new password that Outlook 2013 will not accept. Can anyone help me?

            Outlook 2007 will continue setting up your account. You'll be asked for your user name and password before Outlook 2007 can connect to your account.<br />
Please Make sure you entered your full e-mail address (for example, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) as your user name. You may be prompted to enter your user name and password several times before you connect.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, it is suggested to try the following steps :<br />
1.Run desktop setup to update the configurations in your computer.<br />
2.Create a new email profile. To do this, you can refer to “How to create a new email profile in Outlook 2010, in Outlook 2007, and in Outlook 2003”.

            Hi, Thanks for getting back to me.<br />
<br />
The exact message appeared in a window headed: <br />
Setup Errors<br />
<br />
The message then read:<br />
Setup is unable to proceed due to the following error(s):<br />
To install and use this product you must be running one of the following operating systems:<br />
<br />
x86 platform<br />
-Windows 7<br />
-Windows Vista SP1<br />
-Windows XP SP3<br />
-Windows Server 2003 SP2<br />
<br />
x64 platform<br />
-Windows 7<br />
-Windows Vista SP1<br />
-Windows Server 2008<br />
<br />
Correct the issue(s) listed above and re-run setup.<br />
<br />
(OK)<br />
<br />
end of message.<br />
<br />
I am trying to install onto my mothers computer - which has just had Windows Vista re-installed. I cannot see mention of any service pack - could this be the problem?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
Roger<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try some of the same repair steps using bootable installation media...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if any of the steps you have taken have made any changes that could be a problem or not...</p>
<p>It kind of depends on when they failed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation media needs to be created properly for the type of Bios your machine is using...</p>
<p>UEFI and Legacy Bios have different requirements..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be helpful if you could download a ISO for Build 15063 (1703)... It is a bit more reliable for repair functions..</p>

<p>Since this was posted to the Insider section of the Forum, it could be that you are running an old, expired build of Windows 10 Insider Preview.&nbsp; If that is a possibility, try entering your BIOS and changing the date back to before it might have expired.
 If you don't know that date, try June, 2018.&nbsp; You could also change the BIOS date from a Command Prompt by entering
<strong>date</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then see if Windows will start. If it does, find the place in Settings to disable automatic date and time updating and make sure the date is again set to be prior to your current build's expiry date (which you can display by running
<strong>winver</strong>).&nbsp; Then you can upgrade to a new Insider build, or to the current public build, if it is newer than what you now have.</p>

    <title>word count x of y in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spo22a  say:</h3>
<h2>            word count x of y in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>Currently the Word count is displayed at the bottom of the word document but in previous versions (Mac 2008 and Office 2003 for PC) it also displayed the word count up to the cursor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if the cursor was half-way through a document 3000 words long, then it would display (1500 of 3000).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to replicate this functionality in Word 2013? I'm aware that I can highlight the text above and it will show a word count for selected text, however the frequency with which&nbsp;I need to do this would make the x of y display very helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. As per the issue description you want the word count to display word count up to the cursor is verses the total number of word in Word document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Word 2010 or Word 2013, the word count will display the number of word present in the document. Also when you highlight the words it will display the number of highlighted word versus the number
 of words in the document. This is by design. I would suggest you to post your suggestions in the feedback forum mentioned:</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            OneNote 2010 Default Font will not change what appears in the document</h2>
                    In OneNote I went into options and changed the default font to Arial 12.&nbsp; But every time I start a new document (or press &lt;END&gt;&lt;NEWLINE&gt;) the system keeps switching back to Calibri 11.<br />
<br />
This is the only place this occurs.&nbsp; I don't have problems with Word 2010.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Mention the type of user account you are using? Is it a Standard or Administrator type account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing the Font in the Basic Text group under Home tab will not change the default Font in OneNote. To change the default Font used in OneNote goto File, Options
 and General.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have already tried the above steps and failed to set the new Font as default, then repair Office 2010 installation and check how it works.</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/project-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx#_Toc269981340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/project-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx#_Toc269981340</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are trying to edit a list or notes that was already created using Calibri font, then changing the OneNote default font would not work unless the font of the
 list is changed manually (by highlighting the content and changing it). Changing the default font only works for the new Paragraphs, Sections, and Notebooks...Etc.</p>

<h3> vaidas_n95  say:</h3>
<h2>            question about nokia n95 video player</h2>
                    hy there,<br />
<br />
i read a lot about best video players for nokia n95 but theres no final decision whats best ??<br />
for example i use divx mobile and it plays just .avi files.<br />
can it play .mpg (mpeg) and .wmv files?<br />
or all mobile players supports just .avi files and nothing other?<br />
<br />
now about quality, maybe theres mobile codec pack to download? what about 3gp quality ?<br />
<br />
one thing i understood that without converter theres no way to upload and watch videos am i right?

            I don't know what you mean by "best video players" . Each video player offers something different.<br />
<br />
DIVX player offers playback of divx and xVid encoded files (AVI, XVID)<br />
<br />
CorePlayer supports a lot more formats as do Smartmovie.<br />
<br />
No player plays WMV or MPEG files because the WMV codec is not included in the device and for MPEG well a video file of good quality in MPEG-1/2 format would be just too big. A full length movie at QVGA in MPEG-1 is about 3 GB!<br />
<br />
Since WMV is a Microsoft codec, Microsoft would need to licence that to Nokia the way they licencesed the WMA codec.<br />
<br />
3GP quality. What do you mean?. 3GP is a container and as such it has no intrinsic quality attached to it. The quality of the video has to do with the codec, the bitrate, the resolution, the framerate and the encoder used. You can get pretty decent video quality
 while using a 3GP container by using MPEG-4 codec and a high bitrate and framerate.<br />
<br />
About uploading, it depends on where you want to upload. Videos created by the phone can be 3GP or MP4 so as far as the service that you are uploading to supports these formats you should be able to upload videos. If by "uploading" videos you mean getting videos
 into your N95 then the answer is:, -it depends. If the videos you have are compatible with N95 then you don't need to transcode or convert.

AFAIK, smarmovie DOES only support xvid, divx, to play AVI files like divx player but way better than divx player. Core player seems to have lots more codecs and containers.

            Ok, but you can use the smartmovie PC client to "convert" many formats into smartmovie compatible formats, right?<br />
<br />
Anyways, I stand corrected. :)

            Hi,<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP!!<br />
<br />
I have just bought a Nokia N95 &amp; I am loving it!! the only let downs for me is the Flash (there are some much better qualitiy camera phones/flashes out there), &amp; the Video Formats.<br />
<br />
I am trying to find out if you can play other video formats on the N95 such as AVI,MPG etc.<br />
<br />
people keep telling me I can convert them, but I would much rather be able to install another player that supports those formats straight away so no conversions have to be done.<br />
<br />
does something like this exist??<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Matt :-)

            Real video format .RM and .RMVB can be played in N95 provided they are QCIF, CIF or QVGA resolution and the bitrate is 256 kbps max.<br />
<br />
Also the codec must be Realvideo 8,9 or 10.<br />
<br />
There's not a lot of content (that I've found) that follows these rules so you need to convert if you want to use Realvideo format. But since MPEG-4 and AVC are more widely used they are more practical to use than RealVideo.

            According to my OXFORD Dictionary&nbsp;<strong>ELIGIBLE </strong>means: "<em>Ability to do something properly".&nbsp;</em>And Garym please note that if Microsoft has released Windows 10 for Lumia 535 it means that Windows 10 will work without any problems on that
 phone because the phones which were not able to run Windows 10 properly were left out for getting the official build of Windows 10 Mobile! Don't you remember?
