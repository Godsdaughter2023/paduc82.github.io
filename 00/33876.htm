<h2>            Splash screen hangs, get No TPM or TPM has problem message, and netbios.sys file corrupted.</h2>
                    
<p>Gateway splash screen hangs for at least 45 seconds on POST before laptop proceeds to boot Windows Vista.&nbsp; Gateway reps not very helpful, recommended system restore or factory recovery.&nbsp; Also tried clean reinstall of Vista but I still have the slow boot
 and critical/warning messages in the Event Viewer in Performance and Reliability Monitor in Vista (all are codes numbered in the 100s).&nbsp; Ran Windows Memory Diagnostics (found no problems) and hard drive has no issues either.&nbsp; Ran CHKDSK and both the C (main)&nbsp;and
 D (recovery partition) are clean.&nbsp; Gateway DID suggest running SFC.exe (System File Check), which I did and I got the following message: "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them" and I saved the CBS.log and CBS.persist
 files to my Desktop, as well as the netbt.txt files (I performed a reboot and enabled boot logging).&nbsp; I'd be happy to upload these documents (Notepad files) if anyone can make sense of the rather cryptic messages.</p>
<p>When I am presented with the splash screen, upon hitting F10 key, instead of going straight to Boot Menu (like it used to), I get the Phoenix Technologies screen which lists BIOS version 95.10 (built April 2008; my laptop was purchased in August 2008) and
 also says 3063M RAM passed, etc.&nbsp; BUT, I get the message "No TPM or TPM has problem."&nbsp; Have no idea how to fix this, let alone fix the issue with the apparently corrupt file netbios.sys, located at C:\Windows\system32\drivers\netbios.sys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If ANYONE can suggest where to go next (OfficeMax suggested that I might have a motherboard issue) or how I can repair/replace this file (since I think it is probably what is causing my issue), please post.&nbsp; Again, I should reiterate that reinstalling Vista
 or doing a repair reinstallation does NOT fix the issue with the corrupted file.&nbsp; Please advise!!&nbsp; Thanks!<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Jonathan H,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>You probably have to update BIOS (Basic Input/output System) with the latest firmware available from the manufactureâ€™s website.&nbsp; Also enable TPM (Trusted Platform Module) in BIOS manually.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>

<br />
My BIOS version is already the most up-to-date one they make for this laptop.&nbsp; I flashed the BIOS although it didn't have any effect on performance.&nbsp; BIOS version is Phoenix Technologies v. 95.10 (build date of April 2008; there isn't a newer one per Gateway
 website).&nbsp; As for enabling TPM in BIOS manually, I don't know how to do that and I don't even think there's an option to do that in the "Advanced" tab in the BIOS (it's pretty bare bones and doesn't offer much in the way of features).<br />

            Upon pressing the F10 key at splash screen, I am presented with this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Phoenix TrustedCore (tm) NB<br />
Copyright 1985-2006<br />
<br />
BIOS version 95.10<br />
System ID: A87R1010<br />
Build time: 04/08/08 17:01:39<br />
CPU=1 processors detected, Cores per processor=2<br />
Intel Core2 Duo CPU *** Email address is removed for privacy *** GHz<br />
NO TPM or TPM HAS PROBLEM<br />
3063M System Ram Passed<br />
2048 KB L2 Cache<br />
System BIOS Shadowed<br />
Video BIOS Shadowed<br />
<br />
Press &lt;F2&gt; to enter SETUP<br />
<br />
Hard drive is Hitachi model HTS542516K9SA00 160GB.&nbsp; Intel G9xx (don't remember the exact number) chipset.<br />
<br />
<br />
I should note, again, that there is&nbsp;NO option in my BIOS menu(s) to enable or disable TPM or shadowing of System BIOS or Video BIOS.&nbsp; I don't know why that is but...<br />
<br />
I attempted to fix problem by flashing BIOS but I already had the correct version, anyway, and Geek Squad also said it wouldn't dramatically improve performance (I am not sure I trust those guys, anyway, since I started having this problem just weeks after
 they did an optimization; besides, they charge more than any other repair shop in St. Paul, Minnesota).&nbsp; BIOS file can be found at Gateway support under "Drivers and Downloads."<br />
<br />
Other considerations:<br />
<br />
I have run SFC.exe in command prompt at various times by typing <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and pressing ENTER.&nbsp; Sometimes it comes back without "integrity errors" and other times I get the message "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was
 unable to fix some of them.&nbsp; Details are included in the CBS.log...The system file repair changes will take effect after the next reboot."&nbsp; The file in question that appears to be corrupt (Perhaps there is more than one system file that is corrupt) is
<strong>C:\Windows\system32\drivers\netbios.sys</strong>.&nbsp; The CBS.log and CBS.persist files are saved on my Desktop although the messages are somewhat cryptic to me (I am a moderately advanced user).&nbsp; How can I upload these Notepad files to my post to aid
 in troubleshooting?<br />
<br />
I have reinstalled Windows Vista and/or attempted a System Recovery per Gateway suggestions (Their support is just awful, worse than Dell's!) to no avail.&nbsp; AND, it turns out I accidentally wiped out the ENTIRE recovery (D) partition when I restored from an
 Acronis disk image backup (which contained both partitions)!&nbsp; So now I just&nbsp;show one disk drive (the hard disk, C)!&nbsp; Once that D partition is gone, it is gone, believe me!&nbsp; Now I have to pay Gateway $20 for a System Recovery disc (the recovery disc I created
 only contains drivers and applications shipped with the system but can't be used to restore recovery partition).&nbsp; This disc can be purchased at
<a href="https://secure.tx.acer.com/RCDB/Main.aspx?brand=gateway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.tx.acer.com/RCDB/Main.aspx?brand=gateway</a>.
<br />
<br />
Thought of downloading/trying to use Debugging Tools for Windows x86 (I have only used that once before to fix blue screen STOP error messages so I don't know if that tool would do me any good).&nbsp; Thoughts?&nbsp; Ran RegCure by ParetoLogic but that doesn't do anything
 that would repair the netbios.sys file.<br />
<br />
Ran Windows Memory Diagnostics and the memory is OK.&nbsp; Ran Hitachi Hard Drive Fitness Test and the HD is OK.&nbsp; Thought of purchasing one of those USB-powered cards that does motherboard diagnostics (plugs into USB port and serial port) since it has been suggested
 that I might have a bad motherboard.<br />
<br />
I enabled boot logging and the saved <strong>ntbtlog</strong> to Desktop also.&nbsp; ALL of the drivers loaded EXCEPT the following:<br />
<br />
<strong>\SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\NDProxy.SYS<br />
\SystemRoot\System32\DRIVERS\srv.sys<br />
\SystemRoot\system32\drivers\parport.sys<br />
<br />
</strong>In Reliability and Performance Monitor, CPU meter shows some "spikes" in CPU usage and so on.&nbsp; I don't know know to what extent this is normal.&nbsp; I ran SpeedFan from a USB flash drive and found also that CPU temps were as follows:<br />
<br />
<strong>Core 0: 69 C<br />
Core 1: 74 C (definitely overheating, I should say)<br />
<br />
(These stats are as of 11/19/09 at approximately 3:50 am CST)<br />
<br />
</strong>I have gotten probably ten different opinions from ten different people, all of whom have varying degrees of tech/IT experience.&nbsp; Please help!!&nbsp; I WILL take it in for reputable repair if I can't pinpoint this very troubling (what is apparently a hardware)
 issue but I want to find out as much info before I do.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>I should also note that no&nbsp;TPM device shows up in Device Manager in Windows Vista.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to track down the device, let alone the driver, is proving to be&nbsp;very&nbsp;frustrating.&nbsp; Can't enable OR disable in my BIOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I DID run a BIOS scan using a utility manufactured by Phoenix Technologies and it found problems.&nbsp; Of course, now they want me to buy their $30 product!<br />

Gateway does NOT do a good job of maintaining the most current drivers, etc. in their "Drivers and Downloads" section in "Support."&nbsp;</p>

Should I try that?&nbsp; Someone else suggested that the issue is caused by Northbridge problem (mobo).&nbsp; Did you simply used a can of compressed air to clean out the dust bunnies and other ____ and now it works fine?<br />

            Well, I tried cleaning the vent with compressed air to no avail.&nbsp; Still get the same stupid "No TPM or TPM has problem" message in the BIOS summary screen.&nbsp; Also, disabling the Quiet Boot Mode in the system BIOS doesn't do anything, either.&nbsp; I still get
 the splash screen hang and the stupid message/BIOS summary screen upon hitting F10 key.<br />
<br />
Can SOMEONE PLEASE CONFIRM what may be causing this issue?&nbsp; I have encountered it running either Windows Vista (which is what my system came with) or Windows 7 (which I installed in January 2010 and use to this day).<br />

<br />
<br />To repair your PIN &amp; picture password:
<br />Open File Explorer and browse to this location:
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC
<br />Delete everything within that folder
<br />FYI if you can't see the AppData folder make sure in file explorer you go to the view tab and options - change folder and search options - view and select 'show hidden files, folders, and drives.
<br />
<br />Make sure to do this as Administrator logged in.
<br />Also, just keep clicking Continue if you get the message "You don't currently have permissions for this folder"
<br />
<br />If you can't get past that screen then right click the NGC folder and go to properties and click the Security tab.
<br />Click Advanced.
<br />Click Change beside Owner and type in Administrators and click OK.
<br />
<br />Now try emptying the NGC folder again, once done close all the windows.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings-&gt; Accounts-&gt;Sign-in Options
<br />Click Add a PIN again and set your PIN
<br />Try again.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work try creating a new account profile.

            Thanks for your response.&nbsp; However, your information is no longer accurate as of two weeks ago, when Microsoft pulled support from SETs which also pulled support for tabbed file explorer.&nbsp; It is no longer available and is part of a Microsoft LARGE inaccuracy
 sometimes referred to as a lie.

<h2>            Skype keeps updating</h2>
                    I have the keep Skype up to date turned off and this is the second time it has updated on its own. I can't work with the new Skype, I have to read hundreds of messages a day and the bright color schemes combined with white text are incredibly straining
 on the eyes . How can I stop this from happening or is there another "color" I can choose besides bright blue, orange or pink? Or am i just eternally doomed to keep reinstalling the old version?

    <title>LiveKernelEvent 141 Causing GPU crashes after windows update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            LiveKernelEvent 141 Causing GPU crashes after windows update</h2>
                    <p>Relevant info:</p>
<p>Motherboard is a gigabyte z97x with the latest bios</p>
<p>GTX 1080ti</p>
<p>Latest Nvidia drivers (tried clean reinstall)</p>
<p>Windows 10 pro Version 10.0.17134 Build 17134 (Latest updates)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed in multiple games (Deus Ex: HR, Bf1, BF4, GTAV) That the screen will lag and then freeze. Seemingly the game will continue in the background because I still get sound, sometimes sound that even responds to inputs. Yes, I'm overclocking cpu and
 monitor. However my overclocks have been stable for nearly 3 years now, and I do not believe them to be the issue. I also do not believe this to be a hardware problem because I can run furmark, and heaven benchmarks maxed out for much longer than games without
 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reliability history gives me this:</p>
<p>Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;LiveKernelEvent<br />
Code:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;141<br />
Parameter 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ffffe70e2d96b1f0<br />
Parameter 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;fffff804fb84ec88<br />
Parameter 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />
Parameter 4:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;26b0<br />
OS version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10_0_17134<br />
Service Pack:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0_0<br />
Product:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;256_1<br />
OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10.0.17134.2.0.0.256.48<br />
Locale ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1033</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also notice deviceCensus.exe crashes, not sure if related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had four windows updates that happened right before (Within minutes) the first crash. They are:</p>
<p>- Installation Successful: Windows successfully installed the following update: Definition Update for Windows Defender Antivirus - KB2267602 (Definition 1.271.1003.0)<br />
</p>
<p>- Installation Successful: Windows successfully installed the following update: 9WZDNCRFJBMP-MICROSOFT.WINDOWSSTORE<br />
</p>
<p>- Installation Successful: Windows successfully installed the following update: 2018-06 Security Update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4287903)<br />
</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Installation Successful: Windows successfully installed the following update: 2018-07 Security Update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4338832)<br />
</p>
<p>The last clue:</p>
<p>I ran the windows store troubleshooter that found a problem with apps crashing and not responding. It reset the apps successfully, but the problem continues. I suspect that this update is the culprit: 9WZDNCRFJBMP-MICROSOFT.WINDOWSSTORE, but I'm not sure
 how to fix it. I've tried disabling as many options as I can for the windows store and telemetry, but the problem persists. I'm not sure where to look next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Sorry, gpu is not overclocked except for factory overclock. </p>

<p>Thanks for the response. Sorry, I don't have a minidump folder and cannot find any dump files, although they are enabled. Just to be clear, I'm not experiencing BSOD's, I can usually either alt+tab, Win+d, or open task manager with crtl+shift+escape and
 kill the process via keyboard. </p>

<p>Okay, I think the error causing my problems is this one: http://www.mediafire.com/file/1a7udd552hge8zd/SuspectLog.evtx/file</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Doom causes my rig to crash quickly, so I started it up at 3:12, gamed for 3 minutes until 3:15, and then hard reset the computer after freeze. Aside from the unexpected shutdown errors this log was the only one in that timeframe. Oddly enough
 though, it occurred when the game started and not when the game crashed.</p>

            Okay, so I reinstalled windows from a fresh install. I narrowed down what is happening to be the infamous Nvidia TDR failure. I believe my previous copy of Windows was detecting the TDR correctly, but was failing to handle it properly. Now with the fresh
 install it still occurs, but sometimes recovers successfully. I'm still working on fixing it.

    <title>Windows 7 Pro will not connect to wireless printers on any wireless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrismarshhw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Pro will not connect to wireless printers on any wireless network</h2>
                    <p>I have exhausted probably 25-30 hours researching and troubleshooting this problem. After a complete hard drive reformat, and fresh install of Windows 7 Pro and over 300 windows updates and current driver updates I can not connect to any wireless printer
 on any network.</p>
<p>-I have determined that it isn't the printers, it isn't the networks, it isn't the routers.</p>
<p>-I am confident that it is something probably quite simple with permissions or registries but I am unable to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a Dell M4500 Precision Laptop. It isn't joined to any particular workgroups or domains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log onto the HP site via internet I can print to any of our HP printers. Outside of that, Windows will not find the printers. When installing the printer software manually or using HP Print and Scan Doctor I can get them installed and they show ready.
 When I send a print to any of them, the queue receives it and then changes from printing document to error. Physical printer never receives the command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can ping the printers. Please help me figure this out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows Vista machines, windows server machines, another precision laptop, and my macbook pro, all print to the wireless printers without any&nbsp; problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled all firewalls with no results. I have powered off laptop, printer, router, powered on router, printer, laptop; reset routers, reset printers, nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just this laptop!</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. It is ANY wireless printer. However, I am working with two specifically. They are HP Envy 5530 and 5642.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. No error codes. Windows just can't find printers. When I manually install them, as mentioned in previous post, the print jobs show in the queue as printing then change to error and never print. There
 are no error codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Experiencing for about a week, since item 1 above.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1,2, and 3,&nbsp;all done multiple times prior to making my post on this board. None of them are successful at fixing the problem.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As I mentioned in previous post, I have researched for hours, read, and done, all of the basics that you have mentioned and more. Nothing works.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Text size too small.</h2>
                    I just received my new Lenovo W550s ThinkPad in the mail today and I love it. But, whenever I open programs I newly downloaded, the text size in the program is itty bitty. The text size and app size on my desk top and I've tried changing the font size
 in settings/preferences, but it doesn't change the size in the programs. I am running on Windows 10. Here are some screen shots of my desktop and various programs open. As you can see, everything is extremely tiny. Especially in Blender. Yet, my desktop is
 at a normal size.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63df64f7-ecf8-4df9-8cc1-9766786fb102" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78caeac2-b51e-406f-98d3-46f4abecfd75" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba5835b8-085e-4253-a454-9099c4dc669d" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71e621e6-7d33-4e4b-a7e6-f20e0d1af056" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1955c712-e548-43fd-9e96-cff62231240b" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90906d91-cdd5-4d1c-8d73-27476abbbedd" />

<h3> cooltrain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete Recycler and System Volume Information folder from external storage disk</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I accidentally copied the above two folders to my Seagate Freeagent Go External disk. Now I cannot get rid of them. I'm running Windows XP Home. I have tried the solutions previously posted including deleting in Safe Mode, Changing permission in Safe Mode
 and downloading Unlocker. Unlocker had some success.in that it deleted most of the files contained in the two folders but not the folders and subfolder. Recycler has one sub-folder (S-1-5-21-823518204-8134977) size 85 bytes. The&nbsp;system Volume information Folder
 is empty.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I run Safe Mode I get two options to log in. One as Administrator. The other as a user account (Tommy) I set up that also has me listed as Administrator. When I log in as Administrator the two folders do not appear on the external drive. when I log
 in as Tommy they do appear. I thought I would try to delete the Tommy user account which contains the preferences I prefer, however, I don't seem able to do that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to delete these two folders from my external drive without re-formatting the disk?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>You don't want to delete System Volume Information.&nbsp; Leave it alone.&nbsp; It is automatically created and deleting it is neither desireable nor necessary. The Recycler is probably an artifact from having deleted files while the drive was attached, was created by Windows, and should be fine to be left alone. </p>

@Cooltrain: This is how I emptied the Sys Vol Inf directory : go to control panel-system-system protection. Select the drive with the Sys Vol Inf directory, click configure, click delete, confirm, done.
<div>If that doesn't work, turn system protection on that drive on, move the slider all the way left, confirm, click delete, turn system protection off again.</div>
<div>Neither method actually deletes the directory, but I did recover 30+ Gigs of drive space</div>
<div><br />
<div>To empty $RECYCLE.BIN, I use an excellent program CCleaner (free for private use). After running CCleaner I could simply delete the directory ...</div>

            I have both these files in my D: disk driver. Even though it shows empty but space is still occupied. This is how I delete them. No need extra software to download.
<div>You go to Control Panel\Systems and Maintenance then go to Disk management right mouse click to the disk volume and format.
<u>Problem solved.&nbsp;</u></div>
<div>But keep in mind that after formatting all the files inside the disk folder is empty so saved the others file in different location.&nbsp;

<p>I have the same issue.&nbsp; I am trying to use Exchange as well.&nbsp; I was told that because my work is still running Windows 7 that Windows 10 is not will not work.&nbsp; How can this be???? I also bought the Lumia 950 and could not set up my work email account.&nbsp; I
 have a Lumia 925 running 8.1 and had no problem? Makes no sense why Microsoft would not have this fix when they are trying to attract more business's.&nbsp; I have since then returned my Lumia 950 bought an iPhone (because my IT department said it works much better)
 and now I am considering selling my Surface Pro 4 in favor of a the new a new ipad.&nbsp; I absolutely hate that it has to come to this.&nbsp; Please help before I make the plunge to the dark side of Apple.&nbsp; I still have time to return my iPhone.</p>

    <title>Unable to login after Windows 10 update. Can&#39;t use PC. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to login after Windows 10 update.  Can&#39;t use PC.</h2>
                    <p>After a WINDOWS10 UPDATE I am unable to log onto my (HP 9200z) PC :&nbsp; When entering my password on the initial login screen, Windows10 returns the error message: &nbsp;"Security policies on this computer are set to show info about the last interactive sign-in,
 but Windows couldn't retrieve that info.&nbsp; Contact your network administrator for help."&nbsp; Effectively, the PC is now not accessible, NOT USABLE .</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a single, stand-alone PC, so no "network administrator."&nbsp; The correct password is used, caps are not on, and work around attempts are unsuccessful. &nbsp;&nbsp;Went through the "blocked account" instructions, and
<strong>changing the password did not fix</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In SAFE MODE I CAN log into the PC.&nbsp; Did a Clean Boot as recommended.&nbsp; Never-the-less, when returning to normal operation I again encounter the same login failure as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, able to login in Safe Mode but not otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I regain access and control of my PC after this Windows10 update malfunction?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Update Causing Black Screen of Death</h2>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>My PC Configuration:-</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OS</strong> - Win 7 Professional 64 bit <br />
<strong>CPU</strong> - AMD FX-6100 <br />
<strong>Motherboard</strong> - Gigabyte GA-78LMT-USB3 <br />
<strong>Memory</strong> - Corsair Vengeance 1600 Mhz 8 GB <br />
<strong>Graphics Card</strong> - ATI Radeon HD 5450 1GB <br />
<strong>Hard Drives</strong> - Crucial MX 100 - 256 GB (Primary C:) Seagate Barracuda - 160 GB Seagate Barracuda - 500 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Error Messages </strong>- None</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Additional Information</strong> - <em>(Prior to the BSOD)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No additional hardware were installed.</li><li>No additional third party software were installed.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Checks Made - </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SSD check using Crucial Storage Executive + Third party tools - PASSED</li><li>Updated GPU driver to the latest version from AMD</li><li>SFC Scan To Detect Corrupt Windows Files - PASSED</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for some information about this <strong>Black Screen</strong>&nbsp;issue. My PC started having a black screen without cursor about 4-5 days back. I ran all the hardware checks and driver updates but still continued having the black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I had to do a clean install of Windows 7 Pro x64 yesterday and after installing the essential drivers like Ethernet and Graphics I rebooted and the PC was working fine. Later I proceeded to installing the Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the first batch of 40 updates and rebooted - everything went fine.
</p>
<p>I installed the second batch of 20 updates and the <strong>black screen re-appeared</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I had to again do a clean install of Windows and so far, without installing any Windows update, I have rebooted the PC at least 20 times and everytime it booted fine. So I am pretty certain that it's a rogue patch from Windows Update that is causing
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am wary of installing the updates and I am proceeding with extreme caution, installing updates only in batches of 10 and that too very old updates around 2013 - 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I proceed further, I would like to request the members if anyone knows of any update that was released in Feb 2016 that has been known to cause this Black Screen of Death. I certainly don't want to make a clean install again. I have already done that
 twice yesterday</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes Safe Mode was accessible to me and I did update the Display Adapter to the latest version but that didn't stop the Black Screen from re-appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for as restarting explorer.exe, I cannot access the Task Manager when I'm stuck at the Black Screen, the only option left for me at that point is to force reset my PC and log on to the Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">In addition to the above, I've tried:-</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Booting with Low Video Resolution (640 x 480)</strong> - It worked for the first time, but the following attempts to boot with the same setting was met with the Black Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> - Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disable Driver Signature Enforcement</strong> - Didn't work.</p>

            <p>I think I have finally zeroed in on the rogue patch that was causing the issue. It was the new graphics driver for my ATI Radeon HD 5400 GPU. I checked it by downloading it straight from AMD and the black screen appeared, I rolled back and downloaded the
 driver offered by Windows, the same black screen appeared. I rolled back again and was able to log in normally</p>
<p>

<h2>            Skype audio &#40;bluetooth beatsx earphones&#41; automatically doesn&#39;t work when video turns on</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help to solve the issue. I have my beatsx bluetooth earphones which work perfectly fine when picking up audio and voice with other applications. I have already reinstalled all drives and made sure when my beatsx are connected they are set as default
 audio devices. I have also made sure settings in skype are set to the default device for both audio and video. I have tried all alternatives already by selecting the audio speaker source to be jason's beatsX stereo - nothing works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect on a call, during the dialing phase, I can hear sound playing in my earphones. However, when the video finally connects. All audio breaks down. I cannot hear anything that is coming from the other party, however they can pick up my sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise, I have attached screenshots. I dearly need this to work as all my work is conducted across skype. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your response. Unfortunately I did both, resetting and also reinstalling and both solutions didn't work. I have a suspicion&nbsp; that something's wrong with detecting my speakers (earphones) when on call. As it works when it is dialing in and immediately
 when I cut the call. I hear sound going through my earphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken a screenshot here as you can see from the top left hand side, speaker isn't working. I have tried having it detect via default device or the beats x device and both don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your continued help.</p>
<p>

    <title>Restriction in opening websites from MS Office Outlook emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s.k.l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restriction in opening websites from MS Office Outlook emails</h2>
                    When I click on a URL/website that someone has sent in my email (I use MS Office Outlook 2007), I'm unable to open it and I get this notification:<br />
"This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect in this computer. Please contact your system administrator".<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;got this problem only after installing Win 7. <br />
<br />
How do I remove the restriction?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thanks.

<h2>            Disabling WLIDSVC disables Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    I am having frequent shutdown problems with the Windows Live ID service,Event ID 1530, leaking registry handles. When I disable the service Windows Live Mail fails to start. The problem is that the service, which is normally set to manual, starts when
 Windows Live Mail starts but doesn't stop when it closes. It continues to run, sucking up system resources and eventually causing shutdown problems. Is there any way to disable WLIDSVC and still use Windows Live Mail ?

            Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
No that doesn't help, the problem is actually fairly complicated. The problems produced by WLIDSVC are intermittent and probably the result of some sort of conflict with another program but it would be very difficult and time-consuming to somehow try and figure
 out which one.<br />
<br />
The real issue is that WLIDSVC is tied to Windows Live Mail, and for no apparent reason. I&nbsp; only have the one account, I don't have IM or other accounts that require Windows Live ID.. Other e-mail clients can fetch Hotmail items without requiring an additional
 service running and without requiring that you have to sign in every time you check your mail.<br />
<br />
The WLIDSVC starts when Windows Live Mail starts and continues to run, unnecessarily, after it closes. WLIDSVC sucks up a lot of system resources while it's running, then causes problems at shutdown. Since it's a completely unnecessary service the sensible
 thing to do would be to shut it down, and it makes no sense to me at all that doing that means you can't continue to use Windows Live Mail.If you don't want WLIDSVC then you should be able to still use Windows Live Mail, there is no apparent reason why running
 Windows Live Mail means having to run an unnecessary and problematic service that I don't need or want.<br />
<br />
If the choice is between using Windows Live Mail and therefore having to use WLIDSVC, or using some other e-mail client that performs better and doesn't require unnecessary services to run, then the choice is obvious. But it seems to me that there should be
 some way of using Windows Live Mail without being unwillingly forced to accept WLIDSVC, which was what I was inquiring about in my OP. It makes little sense to put a lot of time and effort into fixing a totally unnecessary service that I don't need or want.<br />

            <p>If you don't have any of the other WL programs installed (Photo Gallery, Movie Maker, Messenger, Family Safety, Mesh and Writer) and you don't sign in in WLMail, you may be able to do without the sign-in assistant. Otherwise not.</p>
<p>When I check the resources being used by the two WLID services,&nbsp;I find them modest. If you are seeing more than, say, 10000-15000KB in commit charge or more than 15 threads, there's something wrong.

            Hi, thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
Even if I'm not signed in in WLMail the program still won't open if the WLID service is disabled. I tried signing out of WLMail, then closed the program, disabled WLIDSVC, and tried to re-start the program, unsuccessfully.<br />
<br />
What confuses me is why the service is necessary at all. With other e-mail clients I've used all you have to do is enter your Hotmail password and user name once when you first set up the program and that's it. So it's just completely unclear as to why WLMail
 won't run without it. It is clearly not necessary to have that service running to obtain access to my Hotmail account. So there just doesn't seem to be any reason at all why using WLMail is entirely dependent upon running a completely unnecessary service that
 doesn't actually do anything.<br />
<br />
I've recently tried Zimbra Desktop, which is a much more stable and reliable program, and quite a bit more feature-rich than WLMail.And it has no problem obtaining my Hotmail items without requiring an additional authentication service.So given that the WLID
 service is a poor performer it doesn't make any sense to continue to use WLMail. It just seems baffling to me that they would make the use of WLMail completely dependent on an additional service that does nothing except cause conflicts with other programs.<br />
<br />
I appreciate you taking the time to reply, thanks again for your thoughts.<br />

<p>The WLID service could easily have been incorporated into wlmail.exe, so you wouldn't have noticed it running. However, its functions are also required by other programs and services in the Windows Live suite. It&nbsp;makes sense to split it out to avoid duplication

    <title>How to reset color defaults in windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to reset color defaults in windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Cannot find where to identify the various components of screens, nor can one change colors for different elements. &nbsp;Very Frustrating! &nbsp;I will settle for restoring factory defaults. &nbsp;Help!!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to fix the colors, which just made every thing worse. &nbsp;And it appears there is no way to undo stuff in windows 10. &nbsp;Surely there will be some way to restore the color defaults?</p>

<h2>            Theme for desktop &#47; Edge</h2>
                    <p>Before windows 10, you could download a theme from Microsoft. Once downloaded, you could open the theme pack and select photos to use, on the desktop. &nbsp;You can no longer select photos within a downloaded theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edge loads pages slowly or hangs up loading. &nbsp;Example: a slideshow will hang up and you have to wait for the next slide. Never a problem with Chrome.</p>
