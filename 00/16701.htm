    <title>Secure redacted Word Document&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carolejeanx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Secure redacted Word Document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently a client wanted a totally secure (read only) redacted document.&nbsp; I would think if it were passworded and protected as read only there would be no way to be able to strip the black redaction fill from&nbsp;the redacted text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a highly confidential court document, and I wasn't here to assist in the project.&nbsp; She did not protect the document and ended up printing it to pdf docs, but the client was able to strip the black fill and get readable text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, the document was scanned as a .pdf and the project was completed in that fashion, although the client had requested a Word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm uneasy with advising how to proceed forward with this type of request.&nbsp; I would prefer to only ever send a .pdf if it's highly confidential and/or redacted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recommendations anyone?</p>

<p>Like you, I would use a print &gt; scan to pdf (not save as pdf or print to pdf).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise it depends in large part how the redacting is done. If it is done through text boxes, shapes, shading or background the text is still there. If it is done through
<strong>deletion</strong>, the redacted material is not present once the document is saved and closed. If done through deletion, I would copy the redacted text to a new document. This is a very laborious process. This all also assumes that track changes is
 not turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they really want a Word document, I suppose you could print, then scan into pdf, then convert to Word. This would require Word 2013 or later to directly convert the pdf to a Word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, when you transfer the original word document, even with deletions, confidential information may be included in metadata. This includes headers and fooers, including ones that you may not be displaying.</p>

    <title>Insider Build 15014 not displaying text in some windows. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark_wilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insider Build 15014 not displaying text in some windows.</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue where text in some Windows controls like DialogBox, ListBox etc is not showing up. &nbsp;Some of this is in applications that I wrote, and some of it is happening in other applications such as Windows Installer. &nbsp;For example, I launch an MSI
 file and it opens up an empty Windows Installer window with buttons but even the buttons don't have text.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install of build 15007 on a different partition for a test and it does not have this problem. &nbsp;Both systems are using the same Nvidia driver so I've ruled that out. &nbsp;All non-Microsoft services have been disabled. &nbsp;Malwarebytes has scanned the
 system and found no problems. &nbsp;Windows Defender is being used for malware protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a list of all processes running on the working system (15007) and as a next step I'll try killing all processes not on that list on the 15014 system to see if the text comes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other troubleshooting steps that I should try before rolling back to an earlier build?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I was waiting for your response I decided to create another user account on the computer.&nbsp; When logged in as this user the problems did not happen.&nbsp; I returned to the original account and the problem had also disappeared there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking it was possibly a corrupted profile issue I created a new profile and migrated all of my data to the new account.&nbsp; Things are still working OK and build 15019 is in the process of installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q1: This happened after the 15014 update.</p>
<p>Q2: There were no error messages on screen or in the event viewer.</p>
<p>Q3: The latest update is currently being installed.</p>

            <p>I thought it was fixed but when the computer was started this morning the problem had returned.&nbsp; I have not installed build 15019 yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SFC /scannow and there were no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran DISM /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth and it said:</p>
<p>The component store is repairable.</p>
<p>The operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth </p>
<p>
</p><p>but I didn't have an ISO of build 15014 so the web page said to create one with MediaCreationTool.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran that and told it to create an ISO file and it downloaded information for about 7 hours, got to 99% complete and said: "There was a problem running this tool" and gave an error code of 0x80190190 - 0x90017</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa95d9a8-c718-4b4e-a2d3-5f00c504d8d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa95d9a8-c718-4b4e-a2d3-5f00c504d8d6" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately MediaCreationTool deleted the contents of the \ESD directory when it terminated so I'm hesitant to run it again and get the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least the temporary fix of logoff, log in as a different user, then log back in as yourself seems to be working.</p>

            <p>The system has now been upgraded to build <strong>15019</strong> and the problem persists.&nbsp; To illustrate what is happening I tried to run the EXE program to install the Windows 2003 Platform SDK [en_platformsdk_win2003.exe].&nbsp; The screen displayed this window.</p>

</p><p>I signed out and logged on as another user.&nbsp; Then signed out and logged back in as myself.&nbsp; I tried the installation program again and the correct display was received as shown below:</p>

<p>The problem still persists.&nbsp; To prove that it wasn't some existing issue with previously installed software I reinstalled Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This system is a clean install of Insider Preview build 15025 installed from an ISO.&nbsp; Windows Update updated the video driver to the most recent Nvidia video driver.&nbsp; No other changes have been made, and no other software was installed.</p>

<p>Problem: Randomly, after starting the computer and trying to run an application, a window will be created that displays no text.&nbsp; This window's dimensions are larger than expected.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signing out of the current account and signing back in as the same user&nbsp;restores normal operation.&nbsp; The window is now the correct size and text is displayed in the window and on buttons. This has been happening since at least build 15002.&nbsp; The attached two
 screenshots are from the setup program for "ON1 Photo Raw 2017".</p>

<h3> dhackwith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Conditional Formatting Reset</h2>
                    <p>I have a recurring issue with Conditional Formatting where I will set about 7 or 8 rules all color coded, and it will work for a few days at most before I switch back into calendar view from my email and all my color coding gets reset. I'll check Conditional
 Formatting and there are no rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened since Office 2013, and continues to happen in 2016. Is there a reason why it keeps resetting, or is this just a bug? It takes me a good 10 minutes to set everything back up.</p>

            Are you customizing one of the predefined views or creating a new custom view? I highly recommend copying a view then customize it - don't customize the default views. (You can make copies of the custom view as backup but I don't think you'll need it. .)

    <title>Pivot table showing incorrect value - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe78man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot table showing incorrect value</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">I got a pivot of a table where the filter shows an incorrect value.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">The analyst name is A in the filter (set retain values to none to prevent old data) but if you go to the table, the same
 line has the analyst B (which is not showed in the filter). If you double click on the line in the pivot table it generates a sheet with the data where the analyst name is B despite the pivot showing A. This table is updated once a month, it worries me because
 I often do this, update my raw data and update the pivot, now that I have this precedent I cannot trust the information is correct.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">At first glance it seems that for some weird microsoftnian reason the pivot table is showing A where in the actual raw table
 is B. I've confirmed this by looking for a key unique data and could confirm this. I tried changing the source and re-selecting the raw table, refreshing the pivot table after changing the "Number of items to retain per field: None".</span>I
 need to understand what is happening, if I create a new pivot table of the same source it brings the correct data, but recreating the pivot tables is something I'd like to avoid because the file is complex, with VBA behind it and many cells using the information
 of the tables (3 pivots from the same source with a slicer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody knows what might be causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to workaround it, what I need is to prevent the actual issue because now I cannot trust this is not happening again without me noticing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your willing to help but I won't share the file as it contains sensitive information. The issue is solved, I know how to workaround it, deleting the pivot table and creating it again or changing the source and then back to the original do fix
 it. My concern is that this can happen again.</p>

            Right-click on the file and select Open With.

                    <p>LISTEN UP INSIDERS !<br />
<br />
As a businessowner i already have decided to boycott Microsoft as long as they continue to force their ModernUI, Store, Apps, Skype, Onedrive, the dysfunctional startmenu, p2p updates and a non-controllable Windows Update...and the list goes on and on...down
 Our throats !<br />
<br />
I won't support that Windows will be some sort of a toy or mobile OS for high end desktops. Therefore i have sold off all my Microsoft stocks.<br />

Read 5th comment from above here and see for Yourself that we, the disappointed insiders, aren't welcome here any more:<br />

            Okay..... The Linux-destros should be impressive... I didn't like them. They are too geeky!!! I HAVE tried the Ubuntu... it ran good - but not so good as the Windows-Previews..... Even this Build - 10041 runs better than Ubuntu! When Windows-previews fails,
 there is often a solution for this, or I live with the problem, because it IS ONLY a Preview.

            Andre has been very cordial and helpful many times over.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure he does&nbsp;would have&nbsp;the latest build installed on a different computer besides the one he is using for personal use with build 9841. How else would he know how to provide help with people
 using the latest build? Anyway, I think the author of this particular thread needed to go back and reread that contents of the post he referenced along with following up on Andre's threads. Personally, I think this thread I am now responding to is out of context&nbsp;to
 the subject.

<p>
</p><p>Andre has been very helpful and has a valid and useful take on things that should be respected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want Microsoft to have a good, versatile and flexible OS, and am happy to pay for it. I still use XP and Windows 2000&nbsp;where necessary&nbsp;and appropriate. I use Windows 7 as my main OS, and have no problem as long as it continues to be supported at least minimally.</p>
<p>I dislike Windows 8.1, but I do use it. I recently bought a Windows 8.1 WimBoot tablet. It works well enough, but I was surprised by how poor 8.1 is as a tablet OS. I am still using Android tablets for day to day simple lookups on site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of Microsoft's other products are built on the basis of a solid OS, so they do need to get the development of W10 and related OS's right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently very stressed trying to get a second server here working the way I want on CentOS &nbsp;Linux. It is not going well, and I can't see Linux being viable for anyone who doesn't have a lot of time and&nbsp;wants to do anything except the basics. I like
 most of the concepts behind Linux, but it doesn't support most of my outboard gear, and can be very time-consuming and pretty impenetrable&nbsp;to configure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think most innovation comes from small companies with a good idea. I am not convinced that Microsoft's reliance on "Corporate Partners"&nbsp; to validate their development direction is sensible, as I worry that it will lead to a narrow vision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will continue to test W10 and will continue to feed back my observations in the hope that they might be acted on.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>To me, it seems a little early in the development of what will become Windows 10 to give up on it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I have told Microsoft repeatedly that I, as well as most of my clients, just want a solid operating system that will operate the selected hardware, according to its design capabilities, and run the chosen software (that I will install), with
 in any way. </p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, despite the complaining of those who try to fault the various builds as though they were finished products, I see the OS shaping up nicely toward a good finished product .... now, please note that I said the OS,
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to convince Microsoft to either make two versions available, allowing a choice between a common sense OS, and an OS loaded down with crapware, or, at least, to make a design that provides for the quick, easy, (like, one button) removal of all
 crapware .... and, I am willing to wait to see what develops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for all the complaining about the start menu (which hasn't been developed yet, but is just a mish-mash of stuff thrown in, as a placeholder), you don't need to ever see it .... just put a shortcut for each of your programs on the desktop .... then, with
 one click, you're in the desired program .... if you wish, categorize them into folders, then it will take two clicks, (like it would to use the start menu). To shut down, restart, or whatever, just right click the start button for you choice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really think it will all shape up .... the question is just about the easy avoidance of the crapware.</p>

<p>I agree here linux mint Rebecca 17.1 mate desktop for the everyday desktop user that wants functionality and toys for desktop, Built in office that matches Microsoft office, and lot more, irc clinet to server, programming to phone development, software to
 hardcore xml,c++ and more. It is easy as you can type. Linux crew has some nice help to get you going. Who knows maybe some here would be a great contribute to the crew.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use to stand up for Microsoft and have been bashed by everyone trying to defend Microsoft, windows 8 series. With the development of windows 10 and what it is now. I dont care to ever use Windows ever again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>We are confined to one browser, one search, the others just cause havoc, we are confined to Microsoft and what MS thinks we should have, all else fails. Linux I can use every browser on the market with exceptional speed and compatibility. These are not half
 of what linux can do</p>

According to Andre Da Costa must insiders that don't like what Windows 10 has become stop use Microsoft's products.<br />
<br />
He recommends us to start use Linux or Mac instead.<br />
<br />
As a businessowner i already have decided to boycott Microsoft as long as they continue to force their ModernUI, Store, Apps, Skype, Onedrive, the dysfunctional startmenu, p2p updates and a non-controllable Windows Update...and the list goes on and on...down
 Our throats !<br />

I won't support that Windows will be some sort of a toy or mobile OS for high end desktops. Therefore i have sold off all my Microsoft stocks.<br />

<h2>            Memory Card Help For Nokia 3110c</h2>
                    
<p>When I click on the memory card folder on my phone, it says that it isn't formatted. I looked on the Nokia website and it says that on the options list there should be a
<strong>Format memory card </strong>option but there isn't. My computer doesn't have a Micro SD slot. How can I format the memory card?</p>

<p>Connect your phone via USB with your computer in "Mass Storage" mode (I´m not sure if your phone can do this...) --&gt; go to windows explorer --&gt; right click on the drive that corresponds to your memory card --&gt; choose format</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That should work if it doesn´t you´ll need a micro SD adapter for your computer, don´t worry they are really cheap! :)&nbsp;</p>

    <title>scanpst not complete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve r2  say:</h3>
<h2>            scanpst not complete</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to office 2013 from 2010. In 2010 I was experiencing frequent issues with Outlook crashing. I also ended up with a corrupt un-openable archive.pst which scanpst.exe could not fix.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At first outlook 2013 ran fine, but now it is hanging after a few minutes. several problems:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) send-receive hangs</div>
<div>2) After emptying the deleted items folder and restarting Outlook the deleted items are still there</div>
<div>3) After any activity Outlook hangs (not responding) after a minute or so.</div>
<div>4) I get an error 0x80040600 trying to read the settings of the archive.pst file</div>
<div>5) Outlook says it can't open archive.pst because it is not unicode</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried running scanpst.exe on both my main outlook.pst and archive.pst</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I get this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"An error has occurred which caused the repair to be stopped. Some modifications may have been made to the scanned file."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice on what to do next? Do I need a third-party tool to fix my corrupted pst files? Any recommendations?</div>

            <p>If pst's are becoming corrupted that is being caused by an external (outside Outlook) problem.</p>
<p>Its very unwise to upgrade any software if you are experiencing issues, unless you know specifically that an upgrade cures a known bug, which is not the case here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would run both disk checks and memory tests and review what add-ins/coms/sync tools&nbsp;are in use with outlook.</p>
<p>I'm assuming also that the pst's are located on the local drive, and not on a network or other external device.</p>
<p>I trust also that you are not using any third party maintenance utilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some third party pst repair utilities are shown here</p>

    <title>Microsoft 10 Update Version 1607 - No Longer Able to Use Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buckeye00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft 10 Update Version 1607 - No Longer Able to Use Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I realize that the 1607 update on x64 laptops is an epic mess. &nbsp;Amazingly, I had to connect to ethernet after it removed my wireless drivers and didn't replace them - who thought that was a good idea? &nbsp;Now I discovered it has corrupted my Outlook 2016 access.
 &nbsp;I am receiving the "Cannot start Microsoft Outlook 2016. &nbsp;Cannot open the Outlook Window. &nbsp;The set of folders cannot be opened. The information store could not be opened." error. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried opening outlook in safe mode - no joy. &nbsp;I tried to reset the nav pane - no joy. &nbsp;I tried to uninstall the update itself - no joy. &nbsp;I tried to go to my prior restore points but magically they are all gone - the only one the system now retains is the
 one after v1607 and before I fixed my wireless drivers. &nbsp;This last one amazes me since I've carefully created restore points over time due to the many issues I've experienced with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone from Microsoft or the community have a suggestion for me that doesn't involve re-imaging the laptop and re-loading my entire life - again? &nbsp;Because I've tried virtually every remedy that I can locate for these errors and none are working.<br />
</p>
<p>This is the fourth time Windows 10 has created issues for me. &nbsp;I've been a loyal microsoft user for decades but I'm about to join the Apple crowd. &nbsp;I might've made time to go to the Apple Store and inquire --- if I could open my Outlook calendar to see what
 conflicts I have. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Normal.dotm file not recognized when I copy it to new MacBook</h2>
                    <p>I wish to use the Word 2011 Normal.dotm file (containing the large number of macros I use regularly) to a new MacBook. &nbsp;When copy the Normal.dotm file via OneDrive (in Finder on the old machine, I select the Normal.dotm file, Command-C copy it and then paste
 it to One Drive), and then copy it into the Word startup folder of the new MacBook, it is not recognized; nor does it become available (for macros) when I click on the transferred Normal.dotm file &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even more odd, I tried to create a test macro on the new machine. &nbsp;The macro records and saved properly, and, using finder, I do not see another Normal.dotm file where is could have been saved; the much larger copied Normal.dotm is not updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there somewhere other than a file Normal.dotm where a macro could be being saved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone explain what I am doing wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Word 2011 the Normal template is located here:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>/Users/&lt;your login name&gt;/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>With Word 2016 (Mac) the Normal template is located here:</p>
<p><strong>/Users/&lt;your login name&gt;/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't recommend using the 2011 Normal template with 2016. I believe you will encounter issues if you do. I would make a copy of the 2011 version, giving it a new name. Then I would attach that renamed version to an open blank Word 2016 (Mac) document and
 use Organizer to transfer the Macros, AutoText, and Styles you want from the 2011 renamed version of Normal to the actual Word 2016 (Mac) template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The function that attaches a different template to a document is the <strong>Templates and Add-ins</strong> function. The same function also opens the
<strong>Organizer</strong> function of Word. You access the Templates and Add-ins function from the Tools menu on Word's Menu Bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            SSO Smart Link with Yammer</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm trying to provide an SSO experience for Yammer Enterprise Users.<br />
I'm following this article to"&gt;
community.office365.com/.../using-smart-links-or-idp-initiated-authentication-with-office-365&nbsp;to</p> create my smart url.
<p>But I'm unable to create a working Url. <br />
The best result I'm able to achieve is that the user is redirected the his Office 365 start page.<br />
My expected result is to redirect users to the Yammer page after ADFS Signing.</p>
<p>Any advice is welcome.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Ika, </p>
<p>I'm also trying to create a smart link that will allow direct sign into our Yammer Enterpriser service. &nbsp;We're using ADFS 3.0 and have a reliable smart link for OneDrive but am struggling with other services e.g. Yammer, Sway, etc.</p>
<p>Have you had any more success?</p>
<p>Thanks, Ryan.</p>

<p>I haven't tried Sway, but Yammer and the rest work for us.&nbsp;If you haven't already, read through
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn800661.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up single sign-on in a Yammer network</a>.&nbsp; There was a form that we had to complete and send to Yammer support before SSO would work for us.&nbsp; If you've done that already, then&nbsp;redirect your URL to
<a href="http://www.yammer.com/contoso.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yammer.com/contoso.com</a> (replace contoso.com with&nbsp;company domain).&nbsp; We use IIS to redirect and also have the option "Redirect all request to exact destination..." checked.&nbsp; Works as advertised, users
 don't have to log on, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there are some changes coming up in the near future with Yammer / SSO / DSync (Yammer Sync).&nbsp; DSync is different than DirSync and I think MS is going to integrate DSync into DirSync so that there is only one Azure sync tool.</p>

    <title>Speed Issues when Loading a Project in MS Project Professional 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> themeatwad82  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speed Issues when Loading a Project in MS Project Professional 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi Again All!,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My employer has recently completed the transition of MS SharePoint (and MS Project Server) from the 2007 products to the 2013 versions.&nbsp; Once all of our data was migrated over, and all projects were published to load the enterprise resources into the projects
 (the projects seemed to come over without the specific resources loaded into the "Build Team from Enterprise" section), we noticed that opening a project (and subsequently opening the "Build Team from Enterprise" tab) both take an incredibly long time to open
 when compared to the same project in the 2007 environment.&nbsp; I've posted below how long various projects we're working on took to open in our 2007 Production Environment, followed by how long the same project took to open in our 2013 Environment.&nbsp; BTFE stands
 for how long it took to open the "Build Team from Enterprise" section of the project when we needed to add/remove an individual from a project.&nbsp; This was done from different computers at different times of the day, and the results posted are the&nbsp;typical amount
 of time&nbsp;the project took to open (rounded to the nearest whole second - this was done using a stopwatch):</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff8614bc-1c49-41ee-b207-51e6a81eaa95" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that seems to be a common thread is that, the more individuals attached to a project (and the more tasks involved), the longer the project takes to open (i.e. larger projects took more time to open).&nbsp; We've been working with our Systems Administrator
 to resolve the issue, but seem to have hit a&nbsp;road block&nbsp;at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me (a person who has very little technical knowledge in this area), it feels like what's happening is that whenever we open up MS Project Professional, it's trying to synchronize the data to the resources from PWA (which comes from our company's Active
 Directory), and link them up to those tasks.&nbsp; Projects that have no resources attached initially open and close quite quickly (even with lots of tasks listed), and if I put in the name of a fake person (as opposed to using a person in the Build Team from Enterprise
 section), everything also opens very quickly (similar to the 2007 environment), but as more Enterprise Resources are added to the project, and more tasks are assigned to them, whenever I go to open the project, it takes longer than before they were added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so my question is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone dealt with a similar issue, and if so, how did they resolve it?&nbsp; If not, any ideas (or thoughts on how I could better explain this to the administrator - who doesn't have much familiarity with MS Project and Project Server, just as I have very
 little with the other side of the coin) on what steps I should take next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always, any help is greatly appreciated, and I thank you for your time in advance!&nbsp; And Dale, if you're the person who helps me again, I cannot thank you enough for the countless times you've helped me in the past!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daryl Wiser</p>

            <p>The best source of answers for Project Server questions is in:</p>
<p>http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=projectserver2010general%2Cprojectonline&amp;filter=unanswered&amp;sort=lastpostdesc
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, were you at SP3 with Project Server 2007 and ideally plus the latest cumulative update before migrating? If not I would update PS2007 to SP3 + CUs first, then migrate to PS2013 SP1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also need to search MSDN for white papers on best server setup for 2010, its quite different from 2007 as Project Server is now based entirely on SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also buy a seat for Project Online (about US$39/month) and test your project files on it as a performance comparison.</p>

<h2>            I was stuck in a Blue Screen &#40;e1i63x64.sys&#41; loop for 9926 build install - potentially solved</h2>
                    <p>So I went to install and everything was fine, until I hit some error and got a blue screen with a &nbsp;IRQL_NOT_LESS_EQUAL – e1i63x64.sys error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after not being able to rollback or move beyond the blue screen (it got as far as the new desktop a few times, but still **** out)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I was forced to do PC repair (as I seemed to have no other options)- still getting the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FINALLY, I unplugged the network cable and put in a USB Wi-Fi dongle I had. That did it... It appears it was a bad driver on the NIC. (Intel 82583V Gigabit Network Connection)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows update didn't catch it prior to the upgrade- BE CAREFUL!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only went through all this trouble as I've heard this build fixes issues with Oculus Rift DK2 :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#LifeinBeta</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Confirmed- it is the NIC. Once I was stable, tried to plug in Network cable and CRASH. Windows Update has no new driver for this.</p>

            I am having this exact issue, hopefully we get a new driver for "Intel(R) 82583V Gigabit Network Connection" as it makes build 9926 unusable due to blue screens.

<p>Yes, fresh installs do not fix this, just tested this morning and ran into the exact same issue. It is definitely an issue with the driver.</p>

</p><p>I have the same motherboard as you, but I did have a spare NIC, plugged in the other one and all is working properly. I will keep watching updates/fixes and let you know if I find something that works. I will give the attempt in the link a shot and report
 back when I get home.</p>

            <p>Ok here is what I did, and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Goto the ASUS CROSSHAIR V FORMULA-Z Driver Download page, Select Windows 8 64 Bit (Not 8.1!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the Intel LAN Drivers Dated "2013/10/21" and you can pick a place to unzip them (but remember where of course)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the New Build via PC Settings, and when it says it needs to reboot unplug the network cable and proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When its done and you are at the desktop open device manager go to the Intel 82583V, right click, and click update driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select "Browse my computer for driver software", Select "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer", Click "Have Disk". Now browse to where you unzipped the Driver files (or do it now) and go to this location inside "\Intel_Gigabit_XPVistaWin7-8_VER181590_VER181610\Other_OS\PRO1000\Winx64\NDIS63"
 and then select "e1q63x64.inf" then click Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you are done, plug the network cable back up and try out Build 9926.</p>

<h2>            excel 2013 - can&#39;t format chart data points</h2>
                    <p>I saw a post where the choice between bar and pyramid figures in a chart is available in the Format Data Series pop-up.&nbsp; That part of the pop-up is blank in mine.&nbsp; I want to do a scatter chart and choose datapoint style and size - nothing in the popup for
 them either.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see is a "Change Shape" button, always grayed out&nbsp;in the Format ribbon - probably nothing to do with it..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW MS "Support" has had me running in circles, on my 9th contact and on hold for two hours for the "ProPLus" team, if there is one.&nbsp; Are we not supposed to use them?</p>

<h2>            Restore a user&#39;s OneNote page AS AN ADMINISTRATOR</h2>
                    <p>Very simple problem. Very difficult to find any info on administering OneNote. A user seemed to have somehow lost almost 100 pages in their notebook. Is there a way to look in their recycle bin and recover these.... pages?.... as an administrator? Or, do
 I really need to log in as them and/or have them share the OneNote.... page/notebook/whatever with me, the global administrator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following web pages are not helpful to an administrator, at least when they're trying to be an administrator without basically inturrupting the end user and taking their time to do what it seems an administrator should be able to do in the background.
 There just doesn't seem to be an "Admin" section or anything for OneNote:</p>

<h2>            Change Skype ID after transitioning</h2>
                    <p>I had a Skype account which I did not want linked to my Microsoft account. It was an old Skype account, like before MS got Skype. Inadvertently I merged the account with the MS account. I don't remember if it happened automatically - it was a long time ago
 and I left it like that. Now I want to change the account or delete it and make a new one or something like that because my credentials have changed. Turns out this is not possible. My old account is a male account. I'm trans so naturally now that things have
 settled I want to change my accounts. But I can't change my Skype ID... HOW DO I CHANGE IT??? I'm a developer but the docs and the support on this one are just a nightmare...<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With every other service that I ever used it was possible to change your username and email. Not with MS and Skype. If you are trans you are stuck with your old credentials. This is deeply offensive. I cannot use Skype like this. Consecutively I can't use
 the other services, including Windows, Office, etc. I feel discriminated - I just want my Skype ID changed. As of now I'm thinking about moving to Ubuntu or just buying a Mac, my colleagues are Apple aficionados anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is outrageous and I'm frustrated to the point that I want to sue everybody.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change my Skype ID?????</p>

            Hi Irina 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Your understanding is all right. My sincere apologies. It is not possible to change Skype ID / Skype Name. This is one of the heavily demanded features and under consideration by Microsoft.
<br />
<br />However, you can change your Display Name.
<br />
<br />Login to your account
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a>
<br />
<br />Click on Edit Profile &gt; Edit Profile to enable in Edit mode &gt; You can change your Display Name here
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.       
        </p>

            Hello Irina.
<br />
<br />There should be no any issue to change Skype name in your profile.
<br />
<br />But I think you mean Skype ID. Fot this, you are right, we can change emal, but not Skype ID.
<br />
<br />If you need a new Skype ID you can create a new account. When you use email adress fo the regystry all part before @ goes to the Skype ID.
<br />
<br />For all feedback and ideas please contact developers (on the community you can find the same users like you).

<p>Yes, I mean Skype ID. My current Skype ID is associated with my Microsoft account. I can't create a new Skype ID because my email is already used by the old Skype&nbsp;account - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. If I enter that email when trying to create a new account it
 says the mail is already taken. So I log in with that email and I get my old Skype. I then try to change the email - I click on Settings, Account &amp; Profile, but guess what - the email there is not *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, it is a very old one, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. So
 I can't change the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I could change the email and free *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and then use it to create a new Skype ID I will still not be able to associate this Skype ID with my Microsoft account -&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is one GIANT, HUMONGOUS, ENORMOUS MESS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel offended and discriminated and furious and I don't know...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that you don't care about trans people, what about other people??? People who accidentally link Skype accounts to the wrong Microsoft accounts - what about them??? How is this even possible? Who is writing that software, making such decisions???
 What about people that change their names for other reasons??? </p>
<p>
</p><p>This MESS is OFFENDING not only to TRANS PEOPLE, but to ALL PEOPLE!</p>

<p>I already tried that option. It has been possible to change the display name in Skype for CENTURIES.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my Skype ID changed (I don't care how) - it is searcheable and visible and what not. I don't want a male Skype ID with a female Display Name. This is discrimination - the rest of the people might be ok with using their old Skype ID with whatever new
 Display Name they have. I'M NOT OK WITH THAT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the old days if you wanted a new Skype ID you would just roll a new Skype account. THIS IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE WITH THE SKYPE + MICROSOFT INTEGRATION. I wanted to do that. I can't because it means essentially creating everything from scratch and tied to
 my Microsoft account are my Windows, Office, OneDrive and other services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change my Skype ID??? What kind of a mess is this???</p>

            Hello Irina. 
<br />
<br />Thank you for your reply.
<br />
<br />Please notice that you are on the community where users like you hekp each others, we cannot change rules / products etc.
<br />
<br />How I have mentioned above Skype ID cannot be changed, if you need different Skype you should create a new account.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if my tone was a bit hysterical. I was just furious. I don't want to offend anyone. I just want this fixed, one way or the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not able to create a new Skype account because:</p>
<p>1. The current Skype account is already integrated with my Microsoft account. As explained above these cannot be ulinked; see this link for more info -&nbsp;<span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/link-skype-account-to-different-microsoft-account/961068d1-eeba-409a-befc-2ddbec5a0048</span></p>
<p><span>2. The current email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is already associated with this Skype account. When I log in Skype and try to change that email so that I can "free" it to create another Skype account I see another email,
 *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. So I can't even change the email and use it for my new Skype account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm not able to change my Skype ID for obvious reasons.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm ok with completely deleting my current Skype account and creating a new one, but I'll have to use an email that I don't actually use and additionally leave the current integrated Skype account with the male ID.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you know a way around this let me know. Deleting the Skype account might help, but it seems that this is not possible too - you can only delete your Microsoft account - https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/how-to-delete-my-skype-account-without-deleting/8e82bf29-30ee-43c8-b950-7870eb405607</span></p>

            Hi. Option to delete old account could really help.
<br />
<br />If you need your outlook name (email address)  that you should:
<br />
<br />1) Rename old account. Add a new oulook name, make it primary, delete old name.
<br />
<br />Article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12407/microsoft-account-change-email-phone-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12407/...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Only notice after this old name would be available for the new registration, but only after 30 day.
<br />
<br />P.S. if you directle delete old account that time for deleting it would be 60 + 30 days.
<br />
<br />Yes, it is a bit mess. I can suggest you use renaming option with 30 days time frame or just create a new account (a bit change the name).
<br />
<br />Have a nice day

    <title>Problems with Word and graphics on mid 2010 macbook pro &#91;Program - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Word and graphics on mid 2010 macbook pro &#91;Program crashes except when QuickTime is recording the screen&#93;</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my mid 2010 macbook pro by inserting a new SSD and installing Yosemite. Everything works fine except that there are som minor glitches with the graphics, something that has been reported by many users with the same setup.<br />
These glitches are quite annoying, but in my case they have not interfered with my work until recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed Office for Mac preview some weeks back, I've been looking forward to the new Office for Mac for a really long time now.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now to the problem.</p>
<p>Starting up Word works fine, typing is no problem. However, when I try to mark the text something weird happens to the graphics, the "rainbow wheel" appears and the program does not respond when I type on the keyboard. Sometimes this stops after 4-5 minutes
 but usually the only way out is to shut down Word.</p>
<p>I decided to record this problem using QuickTime player and post a thread here showing it, however that just
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">solved the problem</span>. When QuickTime is recording the screen Word start working just fine.</p>
<p>I tried using my mobile phone to record the process but I couldn't turn off the autofocus so it turned out very blurry (can try it again if it is of any interest).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to this problem?</p>

<p>Can you explain this better? What exactly are you doing when you "mark the text"? Marking it with what &amp; how? Where do these graphics come in? Are they already there? How are they inserted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can upload a sample and provide instructions on how to duplicate the problem that also would be helpful.</p>

            <p>English isn't my native language but I'll try to explain it better.<br />
<br />
Marking might not be the word I'm looking for. The error occurs when i try to select a word or parts of a text by double-clicking or using left-click &amp; hold and moving the marker. When I do this the program stops responding to keyboard inputs and the "rainbow
 wheel" appears.</p>
<p><br />
The graphics part came out wrong as well I suppose. I'm not referring to graphics in the document (Images or graphs). I think the problem is related to the computers graphics (hardware/software) settings somehow.
</p>
<p>Because when I use "New Screen Recording"&nbsp;<span>in QucikTime Player to record the this error in Word it does not occur.</span></p>
<p>So i think that when I start a screen recording something changes with the computer graphics and there is no problem.<br />
<br />
To replicate the problem I assume that you would need the same setup as I have.<br />
</p>
<p>MacBook Pro (15 inch, mid 2010)<br />
2,53 GHz Intel Core i5<br />
4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3<br />
Intel HD Graphics 288 MB<br />
Yosemite version 10.10.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Start Word</p>
<p>- Open a new document</p>
<p>- Type "Hello"</p>
<p>- Select by double-clicking</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is when the error occurs, marker starts blinking and the rainbow wheel appears. If you are patient wait for 4-5 minutes and the program might start responding to input from the keyboard again. However if you try to select something again the error will
 occur.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do the following the problem will <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Open QucikTime Player&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">-&nbsp;</span>File Menu &gt; New Screen Recording<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Start recording the screen</span></p>
<p>- Start Word</p>
<p>- Open a new document</p>
<p>- Type "Hello"</p>
<p>- Select by double-clicking -&gt;&nbsp;The text is selected without any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that explains it better :)</p>

            <p>Thank you that is helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately however I can't reproduce the problem on my two machines. Of course I don't have the same hardware as you but I can't understand how the problem would be hardware related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try a few things?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First run Disk Utility.app, located in your Applications/Utilities folder and use it to Repair Permissions on your Primary Drive. When that completes restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next run the Font Book.app program, which is located in your Applications folder. After it opens go to File &gt; Validate Fonts and let it analyze all of them. If it finds problems you must resolve them. Usually that means trashing duplicate fonts, regardless
 if they are enabled or disabled. When that completes you need to cold start your computer. Which means a full power down, and then waiting 2 - 3 minutes before powering it back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you then start Word, do so while holding down the Shift key and keep holding it down until the blank new document appears. Now try testing Word again. Does the problem still happen?</p>
