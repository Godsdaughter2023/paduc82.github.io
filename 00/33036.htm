    <title>Windows 10 Wont boot up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Wont boot up</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently got my hands on a refurbished Opti Plex 780 series and I am starting to have problems after I came back from work. When I try to boot the computer up it shows a black screen and occasionally if you wait long enough it would show vertical orange/white
 stripes from the monitor. The only thing that works is the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Del and after pressing F12 it leads me to the boot options (Note: The other Function Keys do not work except for F5 which runs an On Board Diagnostics Test).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are 4 options that are available for me to click on: </p>
<p>1) Onboard or USB CD-ROM Drive </p>
<p>2) System Setup</p>
<p>3) Diagnostics</p>
<p>4) Intel(R) Management Engine BIOS extension (MEBx)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to run diagnostics but after 10 minutes of waiting it comes out with an error saying,
</p>
<p>"<em>Error Code 0146"</em></p>
<p><em>"Msg: Error Code 2000-0146"</em></p>
<p><em>"Msg: Hard Drive 0 - self test log contains previous error(s)</em></p>
<p><em>the given error code and message can be used by Dell Technical Support to help diagnose the problem. Do you want to continue testing?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked into the error code and I have read some solutions that claim that replacing the Hard Drive disk will help get rid of the problem BUT this was from 2010-2012 which I highly doubt works with 2018. Another theory I have looked into was After
 people updated the computer in any sort of way the Computer decides to have a "vertical orange and white screen" when being turned on. This commonly happened when Bitlocker is installed and somehow glitches. The solution that they proposed was updating the
 BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have tried going into the MEBx and I get this "login" and I have to type in a password. I got lazy and decided to look up the password and enter "admin" and it leads me to creating this new password for the MEBx. I tried multiple attempts and it keeps
 giving me the error "<em>ME password change rejected"</em> and from there doesn't let me go anywhere else besides this new password I have to enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly don't know where to go from there and I am not much of a computer genious so much help would be appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance ~ Max Chang</p>

            HI Max.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Confirm the hard drive test  with another bootable diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />If the disk passes then everything possible is here for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the drive is failing,  I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best Upgrade one can have - lightning fast, faster than a new higher-end PC without one, especially if you do the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br /> .
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to my problem but I think I haven't specified my limitations clear enough. The problem I have is I can't go to my desktop of any way of any sort, it only displays a black screen or Orange/White vertical lines. so running application on
 the PC is out of the question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have tried booting into Safe Mode with Networking with F8 but nothing came from that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to try to reinstall Windows 10 but I am afraid that all of the data that I have in the hard drive will be wiped out clean which is something I cannot do. Although I am considering getting the Bootable Diagnostics but I would like some details on what
 it does since I don't know much about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>[edit]&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the pictures of the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://photos.app.goo.gl/kTRNMRYL4wMRQxXg7&nbsp;</p>

<p>I specifically gave you steps using only bootable tools because I realized you could not start Windows.
<br />
<br />
You need to rescue your files first as a hard drive can die at any time so not having them backed up in real time is reckless. Here's a method to use the bootable Windows 10 media you're going to need for repair or reinstall to rescue files to a USB drive:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a><br />
<br />
Then you'd run the bootable hard drive diagnostics I gave you to know the condition of the drive because if it's failing there's no need to proceed with it and it should be replaced.&nbsp; If the hard drive is failing I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best
 upgrade you can give your PC - lightning fast, better than a new higher end PC without one.<br />
<br />
Follow the included instructions or a video you find for your model via Google to swap it in and do this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come
 back to report another problem:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not then I gave you an entire checklist to try bootable repairs using the same WIndows 10 media.&nbsp;

            Alright I will try the Bootable Diagnostics tonight and I will update you on what happens. Sorry for earlier I am slightly upset that this happened at the worst time.

            <p>Hi Mir,</p>
<p>Thanks for the post. I understand that when you connect the Headphones to the back panel it works fine whereas when connected to the front panel it does not work
 correctly.</p>
<p>The fact that you have tried various Headphones and have found the same issue, also the Headphone work fine when connected to back panel shows that there isn’t
 any problem with the drivers. If drivers were the issue it would not worked when connected to back panel.</p>
<p>So, I would advise that you contact the computer manufacturer or a Techshop as this seems to be a hardware issue.</p>

            <p><span>Hello</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your advice.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately as indicated previously I had tried everything including the suggestions in your post. &nbsp;It would have taken too much time and space to list the
 things that I had tried.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>HOWEVER I think that I did find the source of this extremely frustrating situation.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span>I found the solution by pure chance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have 2 machines : Desktop and Laptop which both share a Homegroup and share folders + files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I normally switch on the Desktop 1st before the laptop.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This evening I found that the Sleep facility on the Desktop worked
<strong>EVERY</strong> time. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>HOWEVER</span></strong><span>, when I switched on the Laptop and allowed it to connect to the
 Homegroup automatically, the Sleep function on the Desktop <strong>STOPPED </strong>
WORKING.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>This behaviour is something that I could not have predicted or anticipated.&nbsp; In fact this behaviour makes the situation even more infuriating as I could not find anything
 on the internet or in&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span>&nbsp;community forums about this SPECIFIC issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can someone explain to me why this should be case and if there is a workaround?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>

            <p>This is a common problem on laptops.&nbsp; I presume yours is a laptop, and likely a few years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get frustrated.&nbsp; Simply shut the computer down.&nbsp; The startup time is likely not more than a few minutes longer, and how often do you do that.&nbsp; Multiply that by a few minutes and how much of your day are you really talking about.</p>

            <p>Maybe you can find someone who has the answer for you.&nbsp; I have been supporting PCs for 13 years now.&nbsp; They now number 162.&nbsp; I have seen this problem many times.&nbsp; You can spend days trying myriads of solutions.&nbsp; My conclusion is simply that accepting that
 it does not work has a relatively small inconvenience that results.&nbsp; As a technician, I would not waste a whit of time trying to resolve it.&nbsp; Do you really want to spend 10 hours trying to solve this problem in order to save the owner 5 minutes a day?</p>

                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>
<div>@virgin.net</div>
<div><b>Did you receive an error code or message? </b></div>
<div>No</div>
<div><b>Please enter the error code or message you received </b></div>
<div>none</div>
<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Mail are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I use windows live mail to monitor both my hotmail and my virgin.net account.&nbsp; Yesterday I opened WLM to discover that the storage folders I use for receipts, personal mail and my business correspondance were completely missing.&nbsp; I tried searching for the mails
 within wlm, aswell as the within windows and under different file extensions.&nbsp; <br />
The emails and folders are not in the WML folder (with the view hidden folders selected) and are not in trash.&nbsp; They havent been moved elsewhere and I haven't mucked around with any email settings recently.&nbsp; I also checked within WML for settings that might
 affect the visability and these were set to view all messages/folders.&nbsp; All of the folders within my MSN account are fine and the INBOX, SENT, DRAFTS, JUNK and DELECTED are visable under the Virgin.net section and I have received new emails into these.&nbsp; The
 missing folders/messages are not in any of these folders.&nbsp;<br />
When I searched windows I found no trace of the email senders or the email titles (unless&nbsp;I had replied and were therefore visable in the sent folder but without attachments.)<br />
I am desperate to recover the folder entitled CAKES as I am in the process of decorating a wedding cake and this folder contains all the details!<br />
Please can you help, none of the online solutions I have found on your site or through google have so far been of any use.<br />
Many thanks</p>

            Hi, I already tried this and it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
There are two email accounts that are monitored, my msn and virgin.net.&nbsp; Aside from the seperate section for storage folders (which shows previous archives and recovered mails) I save emails under folders under each of these accounts.&nbsp; It is the folders under
 the virgin.net that have just dissapeared.&nbsp; I have tried all of the obvious solutions, but the folders and mails have just plain GONE.<br />
<br />
Please help, your solution did not work.

<br />
Have you tried to access your account through web and check if the emails are there?<br />
<br />
For the mean time please verify if you have located the local directory of your account correclty by referring to the location below.<br />
<br />
<strong>C:\Users\<em><u>User name</u></em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail<br />
<br />
Note</strong>: Please be informed that the local directory may vary depending on where you install your Windows Live Mail and also&nbsp;enable to&nbsp;show all hidden files and folders before locating it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi, yes I located that folder, checked that it was unprotected/unhidden and the emails and subfolders were definitely gone.&nbsp; There was no trace of them. I&nbsp;searched&nbsp;my whole&nbsp;system for the email titles and also just searched for associated file extensions
 and went through the results.&nbsp; The emails were not there. <br />
<br />
I can access the virgin.net inbox online, but the messages were not in the inbox, they were messages that I had saved in subfolders under the virgin.net email section on windows live mail.&nbsp; These subfolders were a part of windows live mail not virgin.net.&nbsp;
 While my mails also went into this online account, the folders containing years of mails do not.&nbsp; Luckily I bought a new laptop last july so i have saved this import and have all those historic emails, but anything after july has been lost.

Removed and restored non-windows live account as instructed, unfortunately the folders remain&nbsp;missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything else I can try, I don't understand how this can happen?&nbsp;

            Hi <span>honeylovesthumper,<br />
<br />
For clarification, you mentioned&nbsp;on your&nbsp;previous post that you have 2 email addresses that are added in Windows Live Mail and the folder that's missing is a non-Hotmail account? If so, I suggest you contact your email provider since after reconfiguring your
 account in Windows Live Mail it still didn't fix the problem then there's a big possibility that it's already a mail server issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>To construct the folders under this account heading I used Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; They were not constructed using the non-hotmail account, I used the WINDOWS LIVE MAIL to construct these folders.&nbsp; I right clicked whilst hovering over the email account name
 in the left hand folder viewing pane and selected "new folder" to create each folder.&nbsp; I then placed, initially the imported old emails from the other computer, back in july, then each new email after that was filed in the appropriate folder.&nbsp; These folders
 were not part of my non-hotmail account settings, they were part of WINDOWS LIVE MAIL and as such should have been in
<strong>C:\Users\<em><u>User name</u></em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail,
</strong>which they were previously.&nbsp; They DISSAPEARED from this folder!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I very much doubt this has anything to do with my email provider as, apart from&nbsp;talking to your program and allowing the&nbsp;NEW emails to be downloaded into&nbsp;the WLM&nbsp;inbox, I don't see how they could control the folders created in YOUR program.&nbsp; If they can I would
 be very worried.&nbsp; I feels like this issue is being palmed off on my email provider, rather than being taken seriously by yourselves.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you could explain to me HOW the email provider could access windows live mail and delete my created folders, I might have a chance of explaining to them why I am asking if&nbsp;my problem&nbsp;was a server issue.

            Hi <span>honeylovesthumper,<br />
<br />
We would like to confirm on when was the last time you accessed the missing folder and the actions you did before you discovered that it was missing? In addition, are you positive that you have not deleted any of the missing folder from the email client? This
 issue has still an unknown cause as Windows Live Mail only synchronizes to your email account and will not override anything unless configured to do so.<br />
<br />
You may be able to selectively recover the deleted folders using the Previous Versions component. You will need to know the name of the folders that were deleted. Here is the step by step procedure.
<br />
<br />
1. You will first need to select the Show hidden files option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Open Windows Explorer and click Organize / Folder and search options. Click the View Tab.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>b. Place a check mark in the Show Hidden files, folders and drives option. Click Apply/OK.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>c. Close and restart Windows Explorer. <br />
<br />
</span>2. Open the WLM Store folder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>a. Navigate to the following folder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>C:\Users\your name\ <span>AppData</span>\ Local\ Microsoft\ Windows Live Mail&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>(Where 'your name' is the name of the account that you use to logon to Windows 7)&nbsp;<br />
</span><span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. In this folder you will see all of the WLM storage folders. Each email account will have its own group of folders.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>c. Any general storage folders that you created will under the main Storage Folder item.
<br />
<br />
</span>3. Make a copy of the Windows Live Mail folders previous version.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>a. Right click the Windows Live Mail folder and select Properties / Previous Versions Tab.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>b. After the list populates, select a version of the folder with a date and time prior to when the folders were deleted.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>c. Click the Copy Button. In the Copy dialog box, select the Desktop as the location to place the copied folder.<br />
<br />
</span>4. Move the previous versions of the deleted folders to the WLM store folder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>a. Go to the Desktop and open the copied WLM folder. Locate the folders that were deleted.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>b. Right click the folder and select Copy. Go to the current WLM storage folders and paste the folder into the same location where it was deleted from.<br />
<br />
A</span>fter you have retrieved all of the deleted folders, you can delete the copied WLM previous version folder from the Desktop.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<h3> surge2011  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted wake-up from hibernation</h2>
                    
<p>I have disabled the network card's wake-up capabilities, but it didn't help. If I wake the system via mouse or keyboard the system log says "USB main hub" as the cause of ending hibernation, but the system log (Power-Troubleshooter) doesn't seem to know
 the cause of last night's sudden wake-up. It says "unknown" about the cause. Currently, the only devices which (according to powercfg) have wake_armed are the mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>Also, I've noticed that the log shows Kernel-General changing the system time just prior (a few seconds) to an unwanted wake-up.</p>
<p>There were no tasks planned, too (checked the task scheduler's library, maybe that's not a check thorough enough). There is no specific time at which the sudden wake-up takes place, but usually this occurs about one or three hours (including any time in
 between) after the start of hibernation. Though today and yesterday it happened at around half past five in the morning.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check the Wake-ons in the BIOS and even check maker's site (System or motherboard) for<br />
an updated BIOS. Usually have wake on lan, network, modem and others. <br />
<br />
In Device Manager check the major devices - Double Click on - Power Management tab.<br />
<br />

    <title>Vista display distorted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zigszoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista display distorted</h2>
                    After what appears to be a recent Vista automatic update - our display has become extremely large &amp; distorted. In the display settings the resolution is at the lowest setting (4-bit!)&nbsp;and will not allow me to change it. Initially - the monitor was just
 going to black and the only thing that could be done was to turn the system off and restart. That's when the distorted display started. I've tried restoring to a date prior to the problems beginning and though the monitor no longer goes to black, I still cannot
 get the display to return to 'normal' size. I can't disable the anti-virus to try to re-install the video &amp; monitor&nbsp;drivers due to the screen size&nbsp;because I can't see all areas of the program on my screen!

<p>Hi Zigzoo,<br />
<br />
Start your computer in safemode:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</p>
<p>Click the Start button , click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Do one of the following:</p>
<p>• If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
• If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp; Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Restore the display adapter driver to its previous version:1.&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.‌&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password
 or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Double-click the category containing your device driver, and then double-click the name of the device you want to restore to a previous driver version.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; Click the Driver tab, and then click Roll Back Driver.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: If rollback is not an option, then uninstall the display adapter driver and restart the computer.<br />

    <title>Running Directx Applications causes BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt_gst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Running Directx Applications causes BSOD</h2>
                    Last week I attempted to play a game that uses intensive directx, a game i've been playing on this system for over a year now, and suddnely got a BSOD.&nbsp; No big deal i assumed, those happen from time to time.&nbsp; Well, it was a big deal, every time i tried
 to reload the game i'd get another bsod after about 30 seconds.&nbsp; I tried reinstalling the game and it didn't help.&nbsp; To make a long story short, here's what i did to my system for no success ( have isolated the issue, look below these fix attempts to see):<br />
-complete system restore<br />
-upgraded my old ram with new sticks of ram<br />
-tried many different driver setups<br />
-tried reviewing all of my blue screen errors to see if i could isolate the problem<br />
-ran chkdsk<br />
-uninstalled faulty drivers completely with the guru3d application<br />
-tried directx versions 9, 10, and 11<br />
etc etc.<br />
<br />
The problem i've found is my graphics card and/or drivers.&nbsp; At this current point in time, i am using windows with them uninstalled (using standard vga chipset adapter instead) and have no experienced any bsods at all.&nbsp; furthermore, when i do reinstall my drivers
 and attempt to run anything in directx, immediate crash.&nbsp; I just want the excuse "your graphics card is faulty/broken" to be the last option.<br />
Specs:<br />
-(laptop) Toshiba Satellite L455<br />
-Intel Celeron CPU 900 @ 2.2GHz (no overclocking)<br />
-Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit<br />
-(new) A-Data Technology 2x2gb RAM<br />
-Toshiba NBWAA motherboard<br />
and the graphics card i believe is the issue (copy and pasted name which is why it's so exclusive):<br />
<a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/graphics/4m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>Mobile</em> Intel®
<em>4</em> Series <em>Express Chipset Family</em></a>
<p>I've tried both drivers of dates 6/9/2011(the one i was using originally) and the 4/5/2011 versions.&nbsp; I can't upgrade to the version later than that because i get an error "Your system does not meet the minimum requirements."</p>
<p>There were no updates, software, or hardware changes from the day prior to problems to the day of problems.&nbsp; I've been searching all over the internet for someone with a similar problem, trying troubleshooting solutions they've been given, and have found
 none so i'm resorting to asking myself.&nbsp; I am really hoping my video card itself isn't broken, and there's something i'm just not doing.<br />

            We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
&nbsp;*Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive or"Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please also run MSinfo32 and upload the output as well.<br />

<br />
How To Find Drivers:<br />
- search Google for the name of the driver<br />
- compare the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
- visit the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
- if there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />
<br />
The most common drivers are listed on this page: Driver Reference<br />
<br />
http://www.carrona.org/dvrref.php<br />
<br />
http://sysnative.com/drivers/<br />
<br />
- - Driver manufacturer links are on this page: http://www.carrona.org/drvrdown.htm<br />

            i was unable to find: tos_sps64.sys<br />
<br />
what i did was simply download the .sys drivers and threw them into the drivers folder, replacing the old drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; is that ok?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
i'll reinstall the display driver and restart my computer and see if it helped.<br />

            Thanks for all your help, but it seems we've located the problem.&nbsp; The worse case scenario has happened and we've concluded the graphics card hardware itself is bad.&nbsp; We've ran multiple recovery options and replaced components and drivers.&nbsp; No bluescreens
 occur, just crashes happen.&nbsp; We even managed to upgrade my chipset to the newer 45 series version.&nbsp; From the pixel tears we concluded it was the graphics card and the computer is at the end of its life.&nbsp; Thanks for the help, however!<br />

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker Project Reset to Initial Save Version</h2>
                    <p>I've been working on a movie maker project for the past week. I had loaded many video files into it, edited said video files, and saved consistently after each change was made. I recently reset my laptop, and the project is, for some reason, now reverted
 back to its initial save version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The project was a soccer highlight video, and I had a lot of small clips extracted from long video files (~1 hour each). I saved the project after editing each long video file, but after resetting my laptop, the project is now only two long video files which
 I had edited the night before. All of my small clips that I had extracted are no longer in the project.</p>

            Hello <span>irish whiskey,<br />
<span><br />
There are 2 possible causes why you've encountered this error message. </span>
<ul>
<li><span>Incorrect POP3 settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) - check with your provider if it is required or not.
</span></li><li><span>Firewall is blocking the ports (usually port 25) - Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to
 do so.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Kindly check your POP3 settings, listed below are the information&nbsp;to configure your account.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>POP3 Server:
<strong><span>pop3.live.com</span></strong> (<strong><span>port 995</span></strong>)&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>SMTP Server:
<strong><span>smtp.live.com</span></strong> (<strong><span>port 25</span></strong>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please try to configure your account by following the steps provided in the Solution Article below:<br />

<p>When connecting my Mobile phone to my laptop, Windows Media Player is syncing music. However this is being transferred into the "Files" folder instead of the Music folder. There&nbsp;isn't a way to make&nbsp;the music move to the&nbsp;correct folder and so nothing can

<p>Please could you let me know how to make it work??</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 keeps muting, why&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ligia.e.mejia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 keeps muting, why&#63;</h2>
                    My surface 4 keeps muting and I am not able to bring the volume back until I restart the computer. I try to click on the volume icon on the bar and it just ignores my clicks. I also tried to search for the volume master in the settings and it is not allowing
 me to click on it. Again, it ignores my clicks. It is a bit frustrating because I am in the middle of an assignment when it happens and needing to restart is a huge distraction. What is the problem?

<p>Hi Ligia, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused by an outdated or corrupted audio driver. However, running the audio troubleshooter may help resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To run the troubleshooter, select the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>button, type<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong><span>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Troubleshoot&nbsp;</strong><span>from
 the list of results. Select&nbsp;</span><strong>Playing Audio</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If running the audio troubleshooter does not resolve the issue, try to uninstall and reinstall the audio driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Device Manager</strong> in your search box and click on the <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Expand <strong>Sound, video, and game controllers</strong>. <br />
</li><li>Right click the default audio device driver, and click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Installing Surface and Windows updates may also help resolve the issue. Click on this

<h2>            I can&#39;t sign out of my account that doesn&#39;t exist</h2>
                    I've been trying to sign out of my Windows account, since I realized I had already made one through Xbox, and my computer wasn't cooperating with me so I went to the Microsoft website and closed my account there, but when I went to the PC Settings menu,
 it prompted me for a password for an account that doesn't exist. I've tried every single password I could have possibly used, even recreating the account of the same e-mail, and resetting the password to that a lot of times but nothing has yielded results.
 Is there any way to sign out of my non-existent account without formatting my computer?

<p><span>Hi hacwriter,</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following steps to make sure the system is running fine.
</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to
<strong>perform a clean boot</strong> to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue. To perform a clean boot we will have to run System Configuration Utility. :</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under
<strong>Selective Startup</strong>, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to select the <strong>Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable All</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click
<strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6. When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>7. After the computer starts verify whether you can download files.</span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB
 article to narrow down the exact source:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under
 “Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is useful.</span></p>

<p>Bad blocks happen on a hard drive. It's not unusual. When it happens, Windows marks those block as unusable, so the operating system won't try to store anything in them. They're still on the drive - they can't be fixed - they're just being ignored, as if
 they don't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you get it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever the third-party contractors Microsoft hires for technical support come up against something that's not in their refrence manual, they want you to ask in TechNet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What&nbsp;<em>is</em> a problem is if you continue to get bad blocks over a relatively short period of time. That might be a sign of impending disk failure. In that case, run the drive manufacturer's own diagnostic test (it's on their website) to find out what's
 going on.</p>

            Facebook is not one of the options in Notification &amp; action. It is a setting within Facebook.

            I know its been half a year since this post started, but what I wonder is, if there is supposed to be no application that is on in Windows 10 for Facebook, and you are getting alerts from them when new notifications appear on your Facebook page, then how
 is Facebook accessing your computer to give you a notification in the first place (being there is no application present for Facebook that is)? If they are doing that, are they monitoring your web habits all the time? Is windows 10 calendar giving them access?
 Somehow they activate the action of popping a notification up on your screen even though you do not have Facebook open, or have a Facebook application even on your computer (with knowledge of it being there). Some tech there should be able to figure this out
 and let us know.<br />
<br />
Thank you

            <p>If you are using Google Chrome for a browser, they have snuck a rather unethical setting in there on you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)"><span>chrome://settings/contentExceptions#notifications</span></span><br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)"><span>I am&nbsp;not&nbsp;sure if there is a similar invasion of this setting in MSft IE or Edge browsers.</span><br />
