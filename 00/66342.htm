<p>Sorry mate can't help with Game but HMV are showing £21 trade or £19 cash on their replay app thing.</p>
<p>I would be a bit dubious about Game giving what they say on that PDF file because it's a month old now, and in my experience HMV usually give a little more.</p>

<p>After next weeks DLC is released you can expect the trade in price to fall even lower as there's not going to be any more &amp; everyone rushes to get rid of a game they will never play again.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Have you made any changes prior to this issue?<br />
2) When exactly you are receiving this error?<br />
3) What is the exact error message you are receiving?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to start the computer in safe mode and then try to shut down. See if the message appears again.
</p>
<div>
<p><span>To boot into Safe mode refer to the steps provided below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><b><span>Restart</span></b><span> the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Start tapping the <b>F8</b> key.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>You will get <b>advanced boot option window</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Select <strong>Safe Mode</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong>&nbsp;If the issue doesn't occur in the Safe Mode,&nbsp;I would suggest you to restart the computer into a&nbsp;clean boot and&nbsp;try to shut down again.</p>
<div>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After the trouble shooting steps please refer to clean boot link to put the computer back to normal start up mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!!! I did something (no clue what) but now I can't play games on games.com. It says I need the Java Plugin, but when I try to download it I get a message that it's already installed &amp; when I say re-install it says it can't. I have tried with Java 6 (which
 does in-stall, but still get the same message about needing Java to play games) &amp; Java 7, which won't install at all. I am not, obviously, computer literate, only friendly, so any answer must be given in a 'how to fix for dummies' type of response! Thank you
 in advance for any help you can provide for this fix.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>Initially it started with Phantom Touch Problem, It would randomly click anywhere in screen. First i thought it was problem with touchscreen, but problem was not occurring when i disabled touch-pad. So after going through lots of page suggestions and forums,
 It concluded that updating drivers and windows version could solve it, so I updated touch-pad drivers in device manager under HID components, but it said I have best version of drivers in device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i updated the version of Windows and followed by lots of other minor updates, ghost touch problem is solved, even with touch-pad enabled, now it is not randomly clicking anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I cannot click using Click-Buttons, only can click by Tap. Single Finger tap for Left-click and Two Finger tap for Right Click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it doesn't click when press touch-pad. I makes a sound of click but no affect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also run Diagnostic tool, but cannot find any issues</p>
<p>Could it be anything else that disabled click on touch-pad?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ab54502a-5b1d-4efb-90c5-072905961285" title="GUNJANDAVE">GUNJANDAVE</a><span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for bringing this up to Surface Community. I'm sorry to hear about your touchpad and thanks for the detailed summary of your concern. I just wanted to asked some few questions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What was the last option&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you've already updated the drivers, I suggest to proceed on doing a Fresh Start on your Surface Device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To use </span><strong>Fresh Start</strong><span>, select
</span><strong>Start</strong><span> </span><span>Windows logo Start button</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;
</span><strong>Settings</strong><span> </span><span>Gear-shaped Settings icon</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;
</span><strong>Update &amp; security</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Circular arrows Sync icon</span><span> &gt;
</span><strong>Windows Defender</strong><span> &gt;</span><strong> Device performance &amp; health</strong><span>. Under
</span><strong>Fresh Start</strong><span>, select </span><strong>Additional info</strong><span> &gt;
</span><strong>Get Started</strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note:</span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Fresh Start</em></strong><span><em>will remove most of your apps, including Microsoft Office, third-party anti-virus software, and desktop apps that came pre-installed on your device. You will not be able to recover
 removed apps, and will need to manually reinstall these apps later. You may also lose your digital licenses and digital content associated with apps, which may impact your ability to use these apps or app-related content you paid for.&nbsp;</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><em>Please let us know if there are some progress on it by posting..</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><em>Regards,</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><em>Edd</em></span></span></p>

<p>Dear Edd,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response, but effort was in Vain!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As suggested I did a fresh start to my laptop, all the applications restored, settings restored, everything like new, but still, Click buttons aren't working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now I have latest version of Drivers, Windows, all updates installed, Reset once, yet TouchPad isn't working properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I there any changes on settings that could help? It was working perfectly fine, just randomly started with some glitch kinda situation, I learned from other forums that it is called phantom touch, where it would randomly click anywhere on screen, and later
 after all the updates, random touch issue is resolved but now I cannot use TouchPad to click. Now I can only Tap to click and tap using 2 fingers to right click.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else I can do to resolve it?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi this is my first time on here! Okay so let me get into it, I've been playing a lot on my PC and after a long time away from my Xbox one, i decided to get back on to watch movies and play games. I tried going into the "my games and apps" and every time id click on it, the screen would go black until i pressed the Xbox button to go home. i can't open any games or apps on the dashboard without the screen going black and it either taking me back to the home screen or the screen staying black. What would however work is me going to the store and launching things like Netflix from there. Not, however games, games would have the same black screen effect when launching from store. Also things that need an apparent update don't launch and tell me there's something wrong like my&nbsp;network, however I know this is not the case as my Netflix works perfect when launched from the store. I can't even watch bought movies. Now this brings me to the end, where i thought maybe the Xbox needs an updat

            <p>OK, so, I was just able to get my Xbox to update by hitting the try again button over again. However that still did not solve the black screen issue. The Xbox wont start up any game period. It just stays on the home screen when i try to open a game from there. Going to "my games and apps" still is not working and just sends me to a black screen until i hit the Xbox button and go back home. The only difference post update on xbox one is that i now can no longer launch any kind of app from the store. I used to be able to launch netflix and watch movies but it does not react at all to me pressing launch on anything. I used to be able to go to my movies from store but that no longer opens either.</p>

<h2>            Need my Windows 7 to be in Polish</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've a laptop that came with Windows 7 Pro English OS. I'm after getting a new notebook and would like to pass the old one on to my parents who do not speak English. I know that with this version of OS the Language Packs that allow changing the display language
 from Windows interface are not available. Can I however download a Polish version of Win7, do a clean installation of a new OS system and activate it using the code supplied originally with the English version of the OS? Could someone please drop in a link
 here where I could download Polish version of Win7? I hope what I describe here is possible and could get my parents a working PC they will be able to do internet browsing and skypeing with grand kids. Thanks very much.</p>

            <p>Microsoft do make new editions better, but there comes a point where there have to be major changes where&nbsp;the original base model for an operating system is no longer capable of supporting the latest advances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that you are using the third party utility 'Vistalizator' to do it. Bear in mind that using it could cause other issues in Windows 7. Make a full backup of your installation before making the changes..

<h2>            backup error 0x80070002 windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, can anyone help with an error 0x8007002. I get this error while trying to create a security backup of my pc. It will start to make a copy and stop at about 97%. Im backing up on a seagate external HDD. Also, I noticed a file that was not there before,
 on the eternal drive. The file is named "logs" and contains one subfile called "cores" and several text files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not sure if thats the problem, also, a couple of days I deleted a user account from the pc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any helpwould be of great use. Im running windows 10 64bit. The seagate is NTFS format. I had made a backup when I initially bought the machine before upgrading from windows 8.1 to 10 home.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found several options and none of them seemed to work and I am not sure about others as I dont consider myself too tech savy and did not wish to create a bigger problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is welcome...</p>

OneNote would not longer work on my machine so I uninstalled OneNote and attempted to reinstall from the app store. Now I get a 'Purchase error' of 'Sorry, this app can't be installed because your PC might not meet some of the requirements. Go to the app's

<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are not at all happy with the advice provided in the last post, however if you won’t do this the issue will remain the same with the old profile. Whereas the new user can become as the old one and you will not lose any data and
 once you move the data you can delete the old user account so it does not duplicate the items.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you still don’t wish to perform this step, then you may have to reset the computer and
</span><span>I highly recommend <strong><em>backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device</em></strong> before attempting it as your computer will be restored to default user.</span></p>

<div>The linked screenshot shows the applications I have pinned to my taskbar. I have Chrome, WoW, Calculator, Paint, Kindle, and TeamSpeak pinned. When I click on the icon to launch an application, the icon is replaced by the button for the launched application.
 That screenshot also shows that the WoW icon remains on the taskbar, even when WoW is running. The WoW button is added to the right instead of replacing the icon.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I wanted to know if there was a way to make every icon behave like the WoW icon. I understand there are various programming executing each other when WoW starts which may be causing this. Regardless, I want all the icons to open applications in the way
 that the WoW icon opens WoW.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to get the pinned icons to always remain in place? Any running applications would then add little buttons to the right of the icons.</div>

            There's unfortunately not. &nbsp;In fact, WoW likely shouldn't even behave that way (if you were to pin the running instance, it'd probably take on the "right" functionality).
<div><br />
<div>This was designed to make it easier and avoid duplication. &nbsp;For example, Outlook used to show an icon on the QuickLaunch, another icon when it's running, and at least one icon by the clock (plus another if you had new mail). &nbsp;Contrast that with Windows
 7. &nbsp;Today, Outlook gets one button. &nbsp;If you have new mail, the indicator shows up on the same button. &nbsp;It doesn't move (catch me if you can) just because you run it. &nbsp;That gives way to another benefit: if it's the 2nd icon, it's
<u>always</u>&nbsp;the 2nd icon. Users are confident about where it lives. And since it never changes, you can press Windows-2 to launch it (or switch to it). &nbsp; You never have to say "<i>your mail is here. Unless it's running, then it's
 here. Unless you minimized it, then it's by the clock. Unless it's hidden, then its in this popup. Unless it's not, then it's in the QuickLaunch"</i>. &nbsp;Yikes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>BUT... I understand that you might want to open more than one copy of a program. &nbsp;If you opened it, and now it's a button, you might think you can't open another fresh one. &nbsp;You can do that by clicking with your mouse scroll wheel (just like you open a
 link in a new tab in your browser). &nbsp;If you don't have a scroll wheel, you can shift-click (same as browsers there too).</div>
<div><br />
<div>This leads to a lot of consistency, plus you don't have 2 (or 4 or 5 if you're Outlook... geez) icons all over the place that all go to the same program.</div>

<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">We have a very large Enterprise Customer who uses Work folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>We need to know how we can remotely monitor a Windows 2016 Work Folder server to ensure that all Work Folder clients are successfully synchronising. We have
 come across a technical article from Microsoft that states a Windows 2016 Work Folders server no longer supports the 'last successful sync' stamp for a user. We have had a case with our customer whereby a user had 70GB of data in their local client Work Folder
 folder but the data was not synching back to the On Premises server. Had the user lost or had a technical issue with their laptop then the user would have lost all their data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The statement from Microsoft below was made in the technical forum article below.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Skiffie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may disable the sound enhancement in Windows 7 and check if the issue persists.</p>

</span></span></span>Under the Programs list, click
<b>Sound</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>Playback</b> tab, click the
<b>default sound device</b>, and then click the <b>Properties</b> button.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The default sound device has a green circle with a checkmark.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Use one of the following procedures depending on the sound hardware and that tab name that is shown:</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>SoundMax:</b> Click the

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main page of the Skype for Windows 10 application will show you your chat list. You will need to click the contacts icon to view your contacts list. However, there is no option to sort your contacts so your online friends will show up first. But your
 online contacts will have a green circle beside their profile pictures.</p>

<h3> sharonvallance  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard directly from Microsoft. When it arrived it all worked fine -&nbsp; connected to my laptop no problem. I stopped using it for a short while (2 months) and when I switched it on it didn't connect. When i looked in the battery
 compartment the batteries had leaked. I have replaced the batteries as I thought maybe they had run out but the same thing is happening. I cannot get the keyboard to connect with my laptop. I have looked at the control panel and it identifies that the device
 is descovable and working correctly however when i try to type nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried in vain on numerous occasions to contact Microsoft for assistance but without success. Is there something that I need to do to get it to work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated</p>
<p>

            1. Let's try to register / reregister the .dll file
<br />
<br />Type CMD in Windows Start Search box (Cortana), right-click on Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator.
<br />In the elevated Command Prompt, type regsvr32 /u avc_ax_742_jpeg.dll, then press Enter. This will unregister the dll file.
<br />In the elevated Command Prompt, type regsvr32 avc_ax_742_jpeg.dll, then press Enter. This will register the dll file.
<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work, run SFC/DISM

            If these are contacts are part of your Microsoft Account, then you would have log into outlook.com, export them as .csv then import them into Gmail. There is some compatibility issues between Gmail and People app relating to activesync.

<div>Anyway, this is my ish:</div>
<div>I have a Windows XP laptop that connects to the internet via the wireless network (NETGEAR router is inside the main house). I would like to connect my Windows 7 computer to the internet using the laptop's connection. Win 7 &amp; Win XP would be connected
 via cable.</div>
<div>Is there an easy-ish answer to this? (Doesn't have to be too easy as I do know my way around systems... I can turn them on :)... )</div>
<div>Thanks to you so much... this has been a problem for a while now and my experimentation is not anywhere near successful...</div>
<div>Regards</div>

            Win 7 PC &amp; Win XP laptop are next to each other. The NETGEAR router is inside - connect to it with the laptop, but I want to access the internet with the Windows 7 PC. Also, is it not possible to configure my Mega 105 router to act in the same way as having
 a wireless laptop. So, plugging in the PC via cable, it picks up (or is permanently connected)? Without having to worry about mac addresses'n configuration madness 'n stuff?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>I am assuming that you want to do this because it avoids you having to by a wireless adapter for your Win 7 PC.</p>
<p>I have replicated your situation on my PCs and it works.</p>
<p>Firstly, it may be that you need a special Ethernet cable called a crossover cable. It may also be that you do
<strong><em>not</em></strong> need this cable and that an ordinary ethernet cable will suffice. I am going to assume that your Win 7 PC has a modern network card, most times this means a crossover cable will not be needed. I will come to how to determine this
 later.</p>
<p>I am making some assumptions here about you having a 'normal' setup, so if something doesn't pan out as I anticipate let me know exactly why and I will help further.</p>
<p>The first thing you might need to do is on the router. You need to make sure that the router is allocating ip addresses in any range other than 192.168.0.y</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start then click Run, type cmd and click OK</li><li>In the resultant black window type ipconfig and hit enter</li><li>If the gateway is listed as 192.168.x.y where x is anything other than 0 then nothing needs to be done</li><li>If the gateway is 192.168.0.y then you need to alter your router's settings to allocate ip addresses in the range 192.168.1.y</li><li>Your router is not known to me so I cannot give you specific instructions right now but if you give me the exact make and model I can probably find this out for you.</li><li>Once you have done this, verify with ipconfig again to make sure the gateway is now 192.168.1.x</li></ul>
<p>Next you must change things on the XP laptop</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start then click Run, type ncpa.cpl and click OK. This will open Network Connections.</li><li>Right click your wireless network connection and click Properties. This will open the properties of your wireless connection.</li><li>Click the Advanced tab and tick 'Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection' and click OK. Click Yes to the resultant message about ip address 192.168.0.1</li></ul>
<p>Connect the laptop to your Win 7 PC with an Ethernet cable. Your router was probably supplied with one of these.</p>
<p>Now you must change things on the Win 7 PC</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start then&nbsp;type ncpa.cpl and click OK. This will open Network Connections.</li><li>Right click your&nbsp;local area connection and click Properties. This will open the properties of your wireless connection.</li><li>Click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties. This will open the TCP/IP properties.</li><li>Click Use the following IP address</li><li>Enter 192.168.0.2 for the IP address</li><li>Enter 255.255.255.0 for the Subnet mask</li><li>Enter 192.168.0.1 for the Default gateway</li><li>Click Use the following DNS server addresses</li><li>Enter 192.168.0.1 for the Primary DSN server</li><li>Click OK</li><li>Click Close</li></ul>
<p>I think that should do it provided that your Ethernet cable does not need to be of the crossover variety. To determine if your cable is OK</p>
<ul>
<li>On the XP laptop click Start then click Run, type cmd and click OK</li><li>In the resultant black window type ping 192.168.0.2&nbsp;and hit enter. You should get 4 successful replies from 192.168.0.2</li><li>On the Win 7 PC click Start type cmd and click OK</li><li>In the resultant black window type ping 192.168.0.1 and hit enter. You should get 4 successful replies from 192.168.0.1</li></ul>
<p>Now open a web browser and see if it all works.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            Good grief .. :) Beautiful instructions. I was able to follow them&nbsp;to the letter. They did exactly as they were intended, except for 1 tiny detail... didn't work... :) But I've been thinking... it doesn't happen often, when it does I like to splash out...
 See, this is the "setup" I have my Win 7 desktop PC sitting next to my Win XP laptop. Inside the house, there's the NETGEAR wireless network. There are no security pins or anything like that. Just bring laptop inside and it picks up the network.
<div>So, I've got what appears to be a crossover cable so I'm thinking cable from Win 7 to Win XP and use Win XPs wireless internet connection to connect to the internet from Win 7. Now please, I know you know all this but I wanted to try and make life harder
 for myself... being an apparent masochist and all... I have the Mega 105 router - supplied when signing a contract with Telkom South Africa. I thought that just may be, since it is wireless also, that I could cut the laptop out of the equation completely,
 connect Win 7 via cable to Mega 105 - Mega 105 connects wirelessly to NETGEAR network inside the main house, thus supplying me with well earned internet access, and a greater ambition to heal the world... :)</div>
<div>How does that sound?</div>

            Ooooh, almost forgot... When I connect the Win 7 PC to the XP laptop, the laptop loses it's wireless. I can see the laptop in my Network window on Win 7 - don't see Win 7on laptop and although it still shows that it's connected, I am not able to access
 the internet...
<div>...being as you are the advisor and I am the advisee, when would you say it's a good time to throw in the towel and dispose of said PCs in the nearest swimming pool - I've got 1 close by, shouldn't take too long :)</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm sorry it didn't work out.</p>
<p>The laptop 'losing its wireless' when you connect the cable would explain it but I cannot explain why this should be. Maybe someone else watching this thread can? The only other thing I can think of might be that the two PCs probably are not on the same
 workgroup (in my experiments they were). Did the final two ping diagnostics work or did they fail? Can you be more specific about what happened that tells you that it doesn't work?</p>
<p>Yes you could just connect the Win 7 PC to the router with an Ethernet cable. That would be preferable to the 'internet connection sharing' that you tried from my instructions above. In this case the internet connection sharing is handled by the router.
 I just assumed that this was not possible due to physical constraints such as the router being in a different room, otherwise I would have recommended it anyway. Before trying this you should undo all the changes made in my instructions above. Reverting TCP/IP
 (v4) to 'automatic' settings <strong>on both PCs</strong> and unticking the&nbsp;'Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection'&nbsp;on the XP laptop&nbsp;should do it. If you altered the router you should not have to revert back unless
 you want to.</p>
<p>Unsecured wireless networks are not recommended. I would suggest that you protect your internet connection from unwanted use by setting up WEP encryption (or better still use WPA if your XP hardware supports it).</p>

            <p>You are making&nbsp;life difficult for yourself. The easiest and best way is to install a wireless card in the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failing that, you set up ICS on the laptop.. </p>

<p>You will need to connect the Windows 7 PC to the laptop via an ethernet crossover cable. A standard Ethernet patch cable will NOT work..

            <p>Hi MIke,</p>
<p>I have already said as much and given full ICS instructions above. Also, you do not necessarily need a crossover if one of the NICs auto-senses the cable type, which an awful lot of modern NICs do. When I tested this all out with my PCs I did not need a
 crossover cable, it all worked fine with a regular Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>Also, it transpires that the OP could actually connect to the router with a regular Ethernet cable,&nbsp;which is even more easy, not to mention cheaper, than buying a wireless NIC.</p>

<p>Hi Renato,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting us know about your concern. We suggest that you try the solutions below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The diagnosis and repair takes about 15 minutes as it would check for both Windows and driver updates. It will automatically install any missing updates for your device. Click
<em><strong><a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></em> to learn how to run the toolkit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Force shutdown your Surface to ensure all updates are applied.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button for a full 10 seconds, until the screen turns off, then release the power button.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.If that doesn't work, use this two-button shutdown process to make sure your Surface completely turns off.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</li><li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</li><li>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</li><li>The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.&nbsp; &nbsp; </li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Clean the connectors on your Surface Book.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Detach the Clipboard from the keyboard.&nbsp; &nbsp; </li><li>Clean the pins on the connector with a pencil eraser. Rub the eraser back and forth across the pins.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</li><li>Wet a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol. Clean the pins on the long, narrow part of the charger that you plug into your Surface. Rub the cotton swap back and forth across the pins. After you are done cleaning the connector pins, make sure that the pins are
 dry, and then reattach the Clipboard to the keyboard.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify us so we can get back to you and provide you more answers.</p>

            Hi Renato,<br />
<br />
May we know when this issue began?&nbsp; Was there any update installed on your Surface device prior to this?&nbsp; If the issue began after installing an update, here are some steps that we suggest you do to try to resolve this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/4023533/surface-restore-or-reset-surface#Reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Run System Restore</strong></a> - This would allow you to keep your personal files and apps that came with your Surface
 but then, it would remove changes made on your settings, and drivers that you have installed.<br />
<br />
If the first step did not resolve the issue, then we would be forced to move to the next step which is
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/4023512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating a recovery drive</a></strong> for your Surface.<br />
<br />
Please let us know of the results by replying back to this thread so we could further assist you.
