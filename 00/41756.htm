<h2>            Desktop icons change size on every reboot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one of my Windows 10 PCs, each time I reboot, my desktop icons change to a slightly larger size. &nbsp;I left-click the desktop and select View &gt; Classic icons. &nbsp;The icons are then the size and arrangement I want. &nbsp;However, when I reboot (or shutdown and restart),
 the icons appear but they are slightly larger than how I set them. &nbsp;If I left-click the desktop and select View, none of the three choices are selected. &nbsp;I can select Classic icons and them I'm good to go until I next reboot. &nbsp;The size change isn't huge, but
 it's big enough to be a nuisance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of left-clicking the desktop and selecting View, I can click the desktop and then hold Ctrl and move my Logitech mouse scroll-wheel one click back to get to the Classic icons size I want. &nbsp;(Ctrl+Shift+4 also resets the size to Classic icons.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Googled this and explored every lead, but I haven't been able to solve it yet. &nbsp;I have two Windows 10 PCs--desktop that's having this problem and a Dell laptop that works fine. &nbsp;Both have Windows 10 Home installed with all updates applied. &nbsp;View &gt;
 Auto arrange icons is off; Align to grid is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be very grateful for any help with this.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Riel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started experiencing the issue several months ago. &nbsp;There were no changes made to the computer prior to this starting. &nbsp;This is a computer that is a few years old, having started with Windows 7. &nbsp;I took advantage of Microsoft's free upgrade to Windows
 10, and it worked perfectly after that upgrade. &nbsp;Somewhere along the line, this problem started. &nbsp;I can't identify exactly when, but I'm always current on Windows Updates, so perhaps one of the updates changed something that my system "didn't like."</p>
<p>
</p><p>System specs: i7, 16GB RAM, SSD C: drive, 3 other internal drives, dual monitors, 2 ATI video cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Riel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read through the thread you linked to and was surprised to see the very last post on the thread said this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It was actually Logitec setpoint that was causing it. I disabled it on start up but even if you start it after windows is all booted up it still made my icons go up a notch in size! How the mouse and
 keyboard app would have anything to do with the size of icons is beyond me but that is what was doing it!"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use a Logitech mouse with Logitech SetPoint Control Center v.6.67.83. &nbsp;I disabled SetPoint on startup and my icons did not change size!! &nbsp;Success!! &nbsp;However, I rely heavily on being able to program my mouse buttons, so my problem is not really solved.
 &nbsp;I suspect there is one setting in the SetPoint Control Panel that is causing the problem, but I have not yet been able to identify it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps someone else has run into this and can help. &nbsp;In the meantime, I appreciate your help. &nbsp;I will post back with any additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify.... 2 PCs, both running Windows 10 Home. &nbsp;Both use a Logitech MX 600 Cordless mouse with Logitech SetPoint software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop -- Logitech SetPoint Control Center 6.68.83 -- DESKTOP ICONS CHANGE SIZE ON REBOOT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop --&nbsp;Logitech SetPoint Control Center 4.80.103 -- desktop icons DO NOT change size on reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I disable SetPoint on the desktop, the icons do not change size on reboot. &nbsp;The problem is definitely related to version 6.68.83 on Windows 10. &nbsp;I tried uninstalling 6.68.83 and reinstalling -- same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found SetPoint 4.80 online and downloaded it, but it wouldn't install. &nbsp;I tried W7 Compatibility Mode, but that didn't work either. &nbsp;(I'm not sure how I got 4.80 on the laptop, but it works fine.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to find a previous version of SetPoint that W10 will allow me to install and hope an earlier version won't have the "icon change size" problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>You don't need Setpoint which just checks for driver updates that are already handled by the OS via Windows Update.&nbsp; It's bloatware which wants to run at Startup (like all bloatware) so it can spy on you.&nbsp; Best performance of Windows can be assured by not
 letting anything start with Windows that you don't want and need yourself up and running when you hit the desktop.&nbsp; The rest are freeloaders, none of which need to start with Windows.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I know that I do not "need" Setpoint. &nbsp;However, I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
WANT</span> Setpoint because I use a Logitech mouse with multiple buttons, and I like the ability to program each button for my specific needs. &nbsp;(I guess one could say that one man's bloatware is another man's useful tool.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Right-clicking on Desktop, then Refresh works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your "W10 Performance...." document is excellent. &nbsp;Actually, I've already done most of those scans in my effort to troubleshoot this issue. &nbsp;No errors found. &nbsp;(I use Defender plus regular scans with Malwarebytes, Ccleaner and Glary Utilities. &nbsp;No errors.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Late this afternoon, I called Logitech tech support. &nbsp;It's very refreshing to speak with someone right away, even for an old product that's long past it's warranty. &nbsp;The woman I spoke with couldn't fix the issue, but she passed a trouble-ticket up the ladder
 to an engineer. &nbsp;I will post back here with updates.</p>

            Thank you for your reply. I am asking because I <strong>was</strong> "signed out". I learnt that one fairly quickly after getting calls when I had just closed skype without signing out.

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade - Administrator Rights Lost - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade - Administrator Rights Lost</h2>
                    <p>I have been having what sounds like&nbsp;a common&nbsp;problem with administrator rights since upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Since installing Windows 10 I could not access my Outlook .pst file because I had to be an administrator. As the only user on my laptop, I have set my account to Administrator. Also, if I create a new Outlook account, with different details, it creates a
 .pst file for that account. When I go into Outlook it says it can't access the .pst file as I don't have administrator rights. If the person who set the Outlook account up doesn't have administrator rights, surely they should still be able to access the .pst
 folder that they created?...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to save files in folders such as Pictures, it says I cannot as I do not have administrator rights.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9779802-ccf2-416e-8bdd-5c40794b7a00" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I go into the security details for the file and it shows my Microsoft log on user name as having Administrator rights, with full control.It also seems to show me as a home user,&nbsp;who doesn't have full control.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/344693e8-56b2-4b7b-ac0e-bd7b0652219c" /></p>
<p>When I change the home user control to full control I can then save files in the folder, but it seems to be that I am only giving the home user account full control because I have the Administrator rights to do so. Also, if I change the folder so that the
 home user ID has full control, if I then create a new folder inside that folder, the new folder cannot be accessed because I need Administrator permission. Now unless I am wrong, I must have some sort of Administrator rights to upgrade the home user control,
 and if I am only&nbsp;logged on as the home user, why would it let me create a folder that I didn't have the rights to use?...</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment this is not only frustrating, but it is rather silly. I am wishing I didn't upgrade. The only problem is, I have heard people say that they have gone back, but have still not resolved the Administrator rights issue. I guess my only option is
 to wipe the laptop and reinstall Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone at Microsoft can explain this rather strange problem and resolve it, that would be great. Most of the answers currently tell you how to create an account with administrator access, but I am already logged on as an administrator...</p>

            <p>This does seem to have allowed me to create a .pst file that I can now access. It still will not allow me to access the old .pst file. It is also allowing me to save pictures and documents in the folders I was unable to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Ravindra for your advice. This does, however, sound like a workaround, as opposed to a solution. I now feel I have compromised security and am currently not prepared to change ownership on any files that are currently owned by "System".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft need to address the point that despite logging on as an administrator and allowing me to make certain changes that require administrator rights, it is not allowing me to access or save certain files as it does not recognise me as an administrator.
 Changing ownership of certain folders to "Everyone" instead of "Administrator" is an inconvenient workaround that I feel compromises security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Ravindra.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro hard disks slow access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro hard disks slow access</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
a couple of weeks ago I moved from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 Pro (currently version 1809).<br />
<br />
I have 5 hard disks and windows 10 Pro is doing what Vista 64 bit was doing in that far time I had it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>First</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn off Windows, the machine, the case, the hard disk whatever you prefer, continue to run for like 10 second before actually turned off. This didn't happen with Windows 7, with it in fact, when I did start/power/shut down, the screen turned off
 and the pc as well.&nbsp;<br />
This delay in turning off, was actually something that Vista 64 was use to do.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second</strong><strong><br />
<br />
</strong>This is actually the real pain. With windows 10 pro, it's like if the only hard disk always ready, is C: where the system is installed.
<br />
When:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>I try to get access to one of the other drivers by directly clicking on the icon</li><li>I try to get access to some folder in the other drivers</li></ul>
<p><br />
The system take its time, nothing really happen. It's like if the other hard disk after sometime get frozen and this is even more evident when I try to lunch a software from one of these folders.&nbsp;<br />
It also become annoying when for example I've lunched Photoshop, I'm working, I'm taking a break leaving PS open and when I get back and I click on some Photoshop function, nothing happen, I have to wait.&nbsp;<br />
All this times, you can clearly hear the hard disk where the software is installed, suddenly "run", like if it was in a sort of sleep modality I don't know how to describe it but this is exactly what Windows Vista 64 was use to do at the dawn of its time.<br />
<br />
If windows was a person and not a machine, this would be the conversation:<br />
<br />
Me: "Hello buddy, please pass me that software on the shelf G"<br />
Windows 10 Pro: "ZzzZzz...Zzzzz"<br />
Me: "Yo! I'm talking to you!"<br />
Windows 10 Pro: "uh? what? who? ah yeah shelf...mmm"<br />
Me: "Shelf G, the software xxxx!!!"<br />
Windows 10 Pro: "Yeah yeah, here we go shelf G, software xxx"<br />
Me: "Thanks"<br />
Windows 10 Pro: "Zzz...Zzzzz...<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Srnnk</span>..."<br />
<br />
I don't understand why I didn't have this problem with Windows 7 Ultimate.<br />

            Hi Lcks.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Did you do an in-place Upgrade which most enthusiasts won't every run because they'd expect endless issues like this?  What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />2) You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />3) I would also troubleshoot performance with all of your 4 storage hard drives unplugged to see if the problem persists.  If not then plug them back in one at a time to find which one is causing the problem so you can move the data off of it, wipe with at least Diskpart Clean command and then reformat in Disk Management.  Remember you need to power down to unplug the hard drives, avoid static shock on the components by touching case metal before reaching inside, don't work on carpet.  
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 the Media Player Settings-Media Pro, Media Lossless, etc.&nbsp; I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I'm learning a lot thanks to&nbsp;help from people like you. Thank you.&nbsp; I guess I'm stuck ripping all future CDs&nbsp;in mp3 or WAV mode to my computer??&nbsp; Thank
 you again, RickJ41</blockquote>

<h3> judyschmauss  say:</h3>
<h2>            No notification sound</h2>
                    <p>I woke up this morning and discovered that the new version of Skype had been downloaded onto my Mac. I can get everything to work, but I no longer get the little beep that signaled I have a new instant message. My mic is working. My speaker is working. And
 I get the sound from a coworker who has an older version, but don't get it with a coworker who has the upgraded version. How do I get the sound back?</p>

<p>I've found that if I keep the window closed, but the app still open, it will make a sound when I get a new message. So I read the message and close the window. Pain in the butt, but at least I'm hearing the sound now.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many possible reasons why you are seeing this error message. It can vary from system file corruption, incompatible/outdated driver or a missing Security Account Manager. When this error occurs, there is really no way of booting properly. On the
 other hand, this can be resolved by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Remove all external devices connected to your computer except your mouse and keyboard.</li><li>Perform Startup Repair by creating an installation media. You may follow the steps provided under the
<strong>Using the tool to create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) to install Windows 10 on a different PC (click to show more or less information)
</strong>section in this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</li><li>Once the tool has been created, insert it to your computer, and then start your computer.</li><li>When your computer starts to load, press <strong>F2</strong>/<strong>F8 </strong>
or <strong>F12 </strong>continuously to change the boot option. Select the drive with the installation media.</li><li>From the <strong>Windows Setup</strong> window, select <strong>Next</strong>, and then Repair your computer.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, and then <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Startup </strong>repair and follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>

<p>No it was one I got a little after the gears download codes were given out. I tried to use it but it said I still had Xbox live and if I wanted to give it to a friend, but I decided to save it for when I ran out. When I checked the messages on my Xbox it
 was gone. Guessing it expired.</p>

            <p>Hey there AztecFlameGod13.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we're unaware of any promotions providing 1-month of Xbox Live. If you're able to find more information as to which promotion this was associated with we are happy to look into it, but as of now we're unable to provide you with a code. Thank you for your understanding. </p>

<h2>            Why Is &#34;Allow this file to have contents indexed in addition to file properties&#34; Not Checked For Downloaded Files&#63;  What Does The &#39;Lock&#39; Mean Over The PDF Icon&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I download a lot of e-statements from various company websites.&nbsp; Typically, they are PDF files.&nbsp; When I was downloading these monthly statements to my WinXP Pro SP3 PC, I had no problem.</p>
<p>Then I got this Lenovo T410 Win7 Pro x64 laptop and I've noticed some differences when downloading these documents.&nbsp; First, I have company-named sub-folders set up under the 'My Documents' folder.&nbsp; Both the 'My Documents' folder and all the company-named
 sub-folders have the Advanced Attributes set to 'Allow files in this folder to have contents indexed in addition to file properties.'</p>
<p>These sub-folders and their files were copied from the WinXP desktop to the Win7 laptop.&nbsp; All went well - no problems.</p>
<p>Now, I am downloading new e-statement files directly to the Win7 laptop and I have noticed 2 issues:</p>
<p>1. When these files are downloaded, they are shown with a 'lock' over the PDF icon in front of the file when displayed in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; What is the 'lock' telling me?&nbsp; What does it mean?&nbsp; Why is the file locked?&nbsp; Here is a screenshot showing the last
 2 files downloaded displayed with the 'lock' over the PDF icon:<a href="http://i52.tinypic.com/rjnwb8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i52.tinypic.com/rjnwb8.jpg</a></p>
<p>2. For all new files downloaded, the default Advanced Attributes setting is to have 'Allow this file to have contents indexed in addition to file properties' unchecked (not selected).&nbsp; This is the opposite of all the files that had been copied over from
 the WinXP desktop.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; What do I have to change to make this option selected by default?&nbsp; Here is another screenshot of the file option I am talking about:<a href="http://i51.tinypic.com/157gpxd.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i51.tinypic.com/157gpxd.jpg</a></p>
<p>I want Windows Search to be able to search the contents of files, including these downloaded PDF files.&nbsp; Is this a UAC issue?&nbsp; I use IE8 - is it an IE8 issue?&nbsp; Is it something else in Win7?</p>
<p>I should mention that I ran into file copying problems shortly after starting to use this Win7 laptop and found this solution to the problem:<a href="http://www.windows-stupidities.com/This_file_came_from_another_computer_and_might_be_blocked_to_help_protect_this_computer.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windows-stupidities.com/This_file_came_from_another_computer_and_might_be_blocked_to_help_protect_this_computer.php</a></p>
<p>I previously made the Group Policy edit as described in this article to both the WinXP and Win7 PCs.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help,<br />

Hi Gary,</p>
<p>The file isn’t checked to be indexed because this is an alien file that was downloaded. The lock on the file indicates that you do not have permission to use the file.</p>
<p>We recommend you to change the security permission on the folder where files are stored and apply access permissions to sub folders and files i.e. locked files and check if you can open them without any problem.<br />
a. Right-click the file or folder, and then click Properties.<br />
b. Click the Security tab.<br />
c. Under Group or user names, click your name to see the permissions you have.<br />
d. Apply Full control.</p>
<p><strong>See <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What are permissions?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once you've taken control of the file and unlocked it, you can then index it as well.</p>

<p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>From your first post I'm not 100% sure if you can access the files with a lock on them. Can you clarify?</p>

<p>If by "access" you are asking can I open the files - yes I can.&nbsp; I have Adobe Acrobat Standard 9 installed and I can open the files just fine.</p>
<p>The only problem I am having is after downloading, the file properties are NOT set by default to allow the contents to be indexed.&nbsp; Every time I download a new statement, I have to remember (most times I forget) to go into the file properties and check that
 option box.&nbsp; It's a real pain in the rear.</p>
<p>That is one of the things about the lock icon that confuses me.&nbsp; On the surface, it would seem to indicate that the file is in some way locked, but I can open it.&nbsp; I have not tried to print one, however.&nbsp; When I get home and have a printer, I will see if
 I can also print them.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I just tested one of the files with the 'locked' icon and yes, I was able to print it.</p>
<p>So, I'm not sure at all what the 'locked' icon means.&nbsp; These files do not appear to be locked or restricted in any way that I can tell.&nbsp; Only that the files properties do NOT default to allow the contents to be indexed, which is what I am wanting to do.</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>The lock icon <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">does not mean</span> that Gary has no permission to use the file. &nbsp;On the contrary, it means that Gary<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is the only one that has permission to use the file</span>.
 &nbsp;The lock means the file is private.</p>
<p>You can mark any file as Private by<strong> right-click &gt; Share With &gt; Nobody</strong></p>
<p><strong>Locked files can be indexed without any modification.</strong> &nbsp;In addition, unlocking the file means the file is available to others on the network.</p>

<p>Great information, Shawn - THANKS!&nbsp; Obviously, I am still learning the differences in file security/UAC between WinXP and Win7.</p>
<p>So the locked icon and allowing the contents to be indexed are two separate issues.&nbsp; I did some testing.</p>
<p>If I download a pdf directly into a subfolder off My Documents, then 1) it displays the locked icon AND 2) the file properties are set to NOT allow the contents to be indexed.</p>
<p>If I first download the same pdf into the Downloads folder, then 1) it does NOT display the locked icon AND 2) the file properties are STILL&nbsp;set to NOT allow the contents to be indexed.&nbsp; If I then drag this file from the Downloads folder to a subfolder off
 My Documents, then 1) it does NOT display the locked icon AND 2) the file properties are STILL&nbsp;set to NOT allow the contents to be indexed.</p>
<p>Educated with this new information, my 2 questions now become:</p>
<p>1) Is there a Win7 setting I can change so that I can download any file (like a pdf) directly into any My documents subfolder so that it is shared/not private/with no locked icon?</p>
<p>2) Is there a Win7 setting I can change so that I can download any file (like a pdf) directly into any folder (like a My documents subfolder) so that by default it's file properties are set to allow it's contents to be indexed?</p>
<p>Side-note: why am I not getting an email when someone responds to a topic?</p>

<p>Hello, Nikki</p>
<p>Modifying a files properties automatically would require third party software. That being said, I am unaware of any such software that does it.</p>
<p>As to why you are not receiving an email, it is a known problem, see the following post for more information:<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/answersfeedback/thread/c7c78b6f-dcf1-4a74-bab4-26cd7387772e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/answersfeedback/thread/c7c78b6f-dcf1-4a74-bab4-26cd7387772e</a></p>

<h2>            HTC Windows 8x won&#39;t sync to microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>As I've stated, I have a HTC Windows 8x phone, recently and randomly my Microsoft account will not connect on my phone. My account was connected on my phone until a few days ago. I can still log onto my account with no problem on the computer. Every time
 i go to connect my account on my phone a message comes up and says " Can't connect. We're having a problem signing in. Make sure you have good reception. If you do, the problem may be on the other end. Wait a little while and try again." I've been getting
 this message for days now. I have already reset my phone to its factory settings TWICE. My date and time are correct and my reception is perfectly fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point i'm extremely frustrated.. I've read numerous posts online about this and have yet to find an answer. Can anyone please help!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for the reply Jayant! Unfortunately, neither of the steps provided by Mark and Andy fixed the problem. Before I did a hard reset on my phone (which was on Wednesday 10-28) my Microsoft account was synced to my phone until about Sunday. Oh, and
 my Microsoft account does sync under the emails +accounts outlook email tab, but not under the Microsoft account tab. My Microsoft account is the same as my hotmail/outlook account. Thanks!

            You're not alone.&nbsp; I've been having connection issues for over a week.&nbsp; None of these suggestions work.&nbsp; I reset my phone last night and now I can't even get my Microsoft account to link at all so I've lost all my contacts.&nbsp; I can sign in to my accounts
 on a PC but that doesn't help my phone.&nbsp; At this point nobody at Microsoft has realized there is a legitimate issue on their end.&nbsp; Hopefully if enough of us speak up they'll realize soon and things fixed.&nbsp; I'm over my phone being a paperweight.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have this problem. The standard solution provide for this issue was</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify the Date/Time</li><li>Reset the phone and try.</li></ul>
<p>Neither of these works. I wonder if this has anything to do with number of reset we do on the phone. This device (htc 8x) where i have the problem, is one that i had to reset many times due to h/w problem. &nbsp;Everything works fine on my lumia 920.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm if the issue is related with limit to the reset count? (if any?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried adding all other accounts, everything works, but I am unable to add the primary live id, which we need for store access etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide us with a solution for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...</p>

            <p>I found the solution to my problem!&nbsp; This will totally reformat your phone (not just the soft reboot that your phone has built in).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Everything works on my phone again from doing it.&nbsp; You need a PC with Windows 7 or higher, a USB linking cable and a well charged battery in your phone.&nbsp; Its surprisingly simple and takes about 30 mins"ish" to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p><span>I have the same problem and since Microsoft changed the security software our phones are rendered useless everything that they have given me to try doesn't work..!!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Security Certificate Expiration on HTC 8X (PM23300)</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>On Monday, October 19, 2015, a security certificate on the Microsoft authentication servers was updated. This certificate change causes customers using AT&amp;T HTC 8X devices to be unable to log into and use a variety of Microsoft services.&nbsp;This
 severely impacts the device experience.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How does that affect you?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The HTC 8X device uses a security certificate named SHA-1 (pronounced “Shaw One”) to authenticate you on Microsoft services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox, Windows Store, etc.
</li><li>This security certificate has known vulnerabilities and is being replaced across the industry.
</li><li><strong>Microsoft</strong> began replacing this certificate in their authentication servers on Monday, October 19, 2015.
</li><li>After this certificate is replaced, the HTC 8X device can no longer use <strong>
Microsoft </strong>services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox, Skype, etc. </li><li>Because of the age of the device operating system, the only way to change the HTC8X security certificate is to change the device firmware using the
<strong>Microsoft</strong> Device Recovery Tool.
<ul>
<li>It cannot be changed by an Over the Air (OTA) update.</li></ul>
</li><li>This process should take about <strong>45 minutes</strong> to complete.</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>AT&amp;T HTC 8X devices with Windows Phone 8.0 can’t use features that need a Microsoft Account
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Symptoms</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Starting on October 20, 2015, AT&amp;T HTC 8X devices running Windows Phone&nbsp;8.0 will not be able to authenticate to the Microsoft Account service due to a problem updating an SSL certificate.
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When using an app or feature that requires <strong>Microsoft </strong>account authentication, you may see some of the following errors such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>"We can't connect right now. Please wait a few moments and try again." </li><li>"Can't connect. We're having a problem signing in. Make sure you have good reception. If you do, the problem may be on the other end. Wait a little while and try again."
</li><li>The Windows Store will present the following message when attempting to download, purchase, or update apps:&nbsp; "<strong>Microsoft</strong> account service is unavailable at the moment try again later"</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Resolution</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Back up your files to a PC and use the Windows Device Recovery Tool (WDRT) to re-flash the device.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Transfer any files (such as photos, videos, and downloaded music) you would like to keep to an alternate location.&nbsp; To do this, connect the device to a PC and use File Explorer to manually move the files from the phone to the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructions for using
 File Explorer to transfer files can be found here: <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/apps/sync-documents-using-my-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>Use the&nbsp;WDRT to re-flash your device with a replacement ROM image.&nbsp; You can find instructions and the download location for the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>When the recovery tool is completed, your device will be re-flashed to the original factory state with an updated OS image.&nbsp; You’ll then go through the setup process.
</li><li>If your device was set to back up to the cloud, you can sign in with the same Microsoft account you originally used, and you will see a “Restore” option during setup.&nbsp; This will restore many files and settings and help you download your previously acquired
 applications. </li><li>Once setup is complete, you can transfer any files you copied to your PC back to the device.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this, connect the device to a PC and use File Explorer to manually move the files from the PC to the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructions for using File Explorer to transfer

<h2>            Windows 10 -- No sound after restart</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently got the windows 10 update on my pc and i'm having a heck of a time getting everything to work. First problem is, i have no sound. The computer acts as if everything is running A-OK but i can't hear anything. I have a creative soundcard and with
 some hickerydo i can get sound (installing creative sound drivers) but it only works for 1 restart. Usually, the next restart then the sound moves to my monitor (which is plugged into my gtx 770) and the next restart i lose it all together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to go to device manager and disable/uninstall realtek / nvidia high def audio, but they both come back upon restart. I'm at a complete loss of what to do now, it's so infuriating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. I would assist you further from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description of the issue, I understand that the drivers for the audio device is not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the below recommended methods and see if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1</strong></span></p>
<p>Initially, I would suggest you to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and see if the issue is related to&nbsp;any software conflicts that may arise the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow below the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.&nbsp; </span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>

            <p>It was a design decision. They removed the startup sound (I guess the forgot to remove the toggle for it, but no matter what you do it won't play.</p>
<p>"When we modernized the soundscape of Windows, we intentionally quieted the system. Using Windows 10, you will only hear sounds for things that matter to you. We removed the startup sound because startup is not an interesting event on a modern device. Picking
 up and using a device should be about you, not announcing the device's existence."</p>
<p>I guess support didn't get the memo in time :P</p>

<p>Ditto here as well.&nbsp; I can get the sound to work after sleep or hibernate mode, but when I do a cold start I have to uninstall the card in device manager and reboot to get the sound back.&nbsp; Windows just doesn't seem to save the settings permanently.<br />

            <p>I got mine working and i'm not quite sure how. On the creative forums there's a windows 10 support pack. I installed that thing and restarting i would still have the same issue -- no sound. &nbsp;I Reinstalled it probably 20-30 times trying to fix the issue,
 I even downloaded some windows update troubleshooter to hide the realtek audio driver update. That didn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then somewhere along the way, the sound started working again on restart.. The only thing i think i did was restarted the computer, had no sound. Changed the creative console launcher from 'game mode' to 'entertainment mode' and back again. After that, the
 sound works perfectly fine on reboot without me having to do anything. I'm not sure what my exact fix was, but everything i did definitely helped.</p>

            I would start by booting the machine into Safe Mode, by clicking Shift+Restart. If the problem occurs there too then it's probably caused by a faulty video chip.

            You either need to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate and download the English language pack or reinstall Windows 7 Home Premium on your computer using either the recovery discs that came with your computer or the built in Recovery partition and select English
 as your default language:<br />
<br />
Please note, you will need to backup your personal files and reinstall your applications if you choose the option to reinstall:<br />
<br />
<p>If you bought your computer with Windows 7 Home Premium edition in a bilingual region like Montreal, Canada, it comes with two languages English or Français.
</p>
<p>During system initial set up process, you can select English or Français as the system language as shown below:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwindows.fyicenter.com%2f0911_Windows_7_System_Language.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.<br />
<br />
- Samsung uses ESC on most of its systems<br />
<br />
- HP uses F9 on most of its systems<br />
<br />
- Fujitsu uses F12 on most of its systems<br />
<br />
- Acer uses F12 on most of its systems, but you often need to go into the BIOS to enable it<br />
<br />
- Dell uses F12<br />
<br />
In general, look at the screen during POST for a hint about what is possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Upgrading to Windows 7 Ultimate option:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You will first need to do an Anytime Upgrade from Home Premium to Ultimate in French then you can download the English Language Pack through Windows Update.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
To get additional MUIs by using Windows Update<br />
MUIs are available through Windows Update as optional updates. They aren't installed automatically.<br />
<br />
Click to type:&nbsp; Windows Update.<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
In the left pane, click Check for updates, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.<br />
<br />
If any updates are found, click Select optional updates.<br />
<br />
Select the MUI that you want, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
Click Install updates.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.

    <title>problem with onboard GMA X4500 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roderickcarabott  say:</h3>
<h2>            problem with onboard GMA X4500</h2>
                    <div>I have an onboard GMA X4500&nbsp; on an ASUS P5G41T-M/USB3 mainboard, which has a VGA and HDMI output. System is windows 7 32bit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am connecting the VGA to a monitor and the HDMI to an HDMI-composite adapter box (product page link:
<a href="http://www.port-ta.com/products/258.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.port-ta.com/products/258.html</a>&nbsp;) &nbsp;the driver switches to clone display automatically as soon as I power up the hdmi box (which should be the secondary display and the vga monitor the primary).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So far so good.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However the problem is that the picture from the box is a flickering blue screen, but during bootup it is ok till the windows 7 logon screen. Also if I uninstall the drivers for the graphics card it works well, but of course the pc will become very limited.
 I have the latest driver from your website and have tried as well with the driver (older) that came with the mainboard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Would you please be so kind to offer me your assistance on this please?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing this to the community. We would like to isolate this issue that you're having right now.
<span>What other security programs do you have running beside Windows Defender? Having two or more security programs with the same functionality might cause conflicts. Is this the first time you encounter this issue? Have you try to manually restart the device?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We will wait for your response.</span></p>
<p>
