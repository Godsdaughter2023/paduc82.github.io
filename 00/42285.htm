            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. As I understood on your concern, you want to change the time of the photos from 7 seconds to 3 seconds. Please verify if you're editing the photos within Movie Maker and you want to change the duration of the photos
 that you're using. If yes, you can change all the photos duration to 3 seconds instantly. Note that when you add a photo within Movie Maker, the default duration of a photo is 7 seconds. Please follow the steps below on how to change all photo duration to
 3 seconds.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Movie Maker</strong> </li><li>Load all photos that you need on the program </li><li>Click <strong>Ctrl+A</strong> on your keyboard </li><li>Go to <strong>Edit</strong> tab and change <strong>Duration</strong> to <strong>
3.00</strong></li></ol>
<p>This should change your slide show to 3 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you have a different inquiry, please provide us more information for us to assist you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Oberwald</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. Unfortunately for me I contacted ESET support before Microsoft Answers; they gave me a comprehensive reply but their opening remark was to the effect that this was not an ESET issue. some of their suggestions did not work because
 of incorrect&nbsp; syntax but others made no difference. So I am left between a rock and a hard place.</p>
</blockquote>
Sorry to say so but the ESET people are passing the back. If I wrote a virus scanner for Windows, should I expect Microsoft to adjust Windows so that it recognises my product or is the burden on me take all the necessary steps to ensure that my product complies
 with the Windows standards?
<div><br />
<div>If you cannot resolve the issue with ESET then why not install Microsoft Security Essentials? It's free.</div>

            <p>Hello Matthew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs because the inbox SATA driver is being used for the SATA controller on your computer. In the current design of Microsoft SATA driver stack, the device write cache will be enabled after every power cycle (computer resumes or reboots). This is
 a by-design feature in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information helps.</p>

<p>Fortinite can actually be quite taxing if you use a high resolution and settings. You didn't mention V-Sync, but I think I can</p>
<p>assume V-Sync is not enabled in the game or Nvidia Control Panel or Geforce Experience. Yes ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your may be expecting too much of your MX 130 though. In your case it looks like you would have to use mostly</p>
<p>low settings @1280x720 to achieve around 77 fps with Fortnite.</p>
<p>- This review has benchmarks for Fortnite and a lot of other games. Your machine should get similar results depending on cpu.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-MX130-GPU-Benchmarks-and-Specs.258054.0.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-MX130-GPU-Benchmarks-and-Specs.258054.0.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Thing is. You are not supposed to expect games to run at 120fps because the monitor is capable of 120 Hz refresh rate.</p>
<p>The reason a monitor with a 120 vs 60Hz refresh rate is desirable is to avoid having to use V-Sync to prevent image 'tearing'
</p>
<p>when your machine <em>is</em> able to run a game faster than 60fps.</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p><em>"...both the 120hz monitor and the 60hz laptop"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to squeeze every drop of performance out of your MX130, using only one monitor at a time</p>
<p>may help some. </p>
<p>Using the laptop monitor would allow for the best graphics quality relative to the processing power of your Mx130,</p>
<p>but even at low resolution the extra size of your external monitor is likely better for quick target acquisition when</p>
<p>gaming online.</p>
<p>.<br />

<p>Thank You for the reply. I agree I haven't put that much information in the description. But yes, I don't have V-sync on and I get about 140 Fps on low-medium settings. And this is when I'm both: projecting the laptop to only the 120hz monitor and with both
 screens/monitors on. So theoretically speaking, I should be able to see difference in fps/hz.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in the description, the final problem was trying to change the Monitor output to the stronger GPU (with 140 fps). But I can't and It's sad, now, to know that you might not be able to use a higher refresh rate for laptops.</p>
<p>

<p><em>"both the 120hz monitor and the 60hz laptop screen are using the weaker GPU ( Intel UHD Graphics 620)."</em></p>
<p>Ah! I missed that both screens are using the Intel UHD gpu. Was thinking you were getting 60 Hz&nbsp; using the Nvidia gpu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I get about 140 Fps on low-medium settings."</em></p>
<p>Same resolution on both monitors as well ? Certainly a <em>whole</em> lot higher frame rate than the review running @ 1280x720.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"...trying to change the Monitor output to the stronger GPU"</em></p>
<p>- I don't use laptops, and don't know all the ways to force games to run on the dedicated gpu, but I would be inclined to disable the laptop monitor while troubleshooting the problem. This&nbsp; will take it out of the equation, and insure the external monitor
 is identified as monitor #1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are you able to open <em>Nvidia Control Panel</em> when running on the external monitor ?</p>
<p>- Are you using a driver from the mfg of or your laptop ? The driver supplied by the mfg of the machine is generally the most suitable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Intel graphics does not support 120 Hz, so if the game is launching on the external monitor using the Intel UHD graphics Windows</p>
<p>will automatically switch the monitors refresh rate down to 59/60 Hz. </p>
<p>When this happens, even if the Nvidia gpu does take control when you sort out why the games are not using it, you will need to
</p>
<p>re-set the monitor to 120Hz.</p>
<p>

<h2>            New laptop &#40;Windows 10 Pro&#41; can login to one computer but not another</h2>
                    Just bought a new Lenovo Legion, upgraded to Windows 10 Pro. I have two existing Windows 10 Pro computers on my private home network. One lets me access it across the network using&nbsp;known login credentials, the other says the password in incorrect and it
 won't let me login. The other two computers see each other just fine. Both the other computers use local logins with same account name and password. Why won't the new laptop get to one but not the other?

<p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the description that you provided, there are settings that we need to configure to resolve this issue. However, we need to do some troubleshooting steps to isolate the cause of this problem. Before we proceed, kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Are you using HomeGroup?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the error message that you are getting when logging in to your computer? Make sure that you remove all personal information.</li></ul>

<p>Sounds like I'm having inconsistent network issues like lots of other people are. After I had visibility of (but couldn't actually login to) my other two computers on my household private network, I turned on the new machine to do some screenshots for you
 (in response to your offer to help troubleshoot), and all the local machines were gone from the network again! So I couldn't do anything!</p>
<ul>
<li>But you asked about Homegroup - this is another sore point. I can't use Homegroup, because at some point during my upgrade a year ago from Windows 7 &amp; 8 to Window 10 Pro, somehow a phantom Homegroup was created. None of my computers claim to have created
 it, and none can join it because we don't have a password for it. At some point, I got a password for it (can't recall how) but when I tried to join it, it disappeared. I can't create a new one, because each computer says one exists, but if I try to join the
 phantom Homegroup, it then disappears and there's nothing to join. VERY FRUSTRATING. So I've abandoned all attempts to use Homegroup, and Microsoft accounts, and am using local accounts to share between computers (until yesterday, when new laptop wouldn't
 let me login to existing computers).</li><li>On the plus side, I noticed last night that when old computer A is logging into old computer B, it doesn't use the local account name "Carol", it uses the account name "owner" (same password works, apparently). So I turned on the new laptop again this morning
 and all the local machines were missing from the network. After searching around in frustration for anything I might be able to do again (found nothing, BTW), all of a sudden, they appeared again! So I tried to attach to computer B (the one I couldn't get
 to before), and instead of using Carol as the account name, I used "owner". Voila! All of a sudden I could see everything. So it's all completely mysterious why it wasn't working before and why it suddenly is working now, but I think Microsoft has some serious
 networking issues in the software.</li></ul>

<p>I had the same problem, and after trying several things I've found the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After you've selected the area you'd like to snip go to file print. Then click on preferences. Click on the Effects tab. Default is set to actual size. I changed it to Print document on: (then select the size of paper your using). I also clicked the Scale
 to fit box underneath that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This worked for me because the image I was printing was roughly the size of my whole monitor screen. Because of the display setting being set to 150+% zoom then the image would not print correctly with the above adjustments</p>

<p>I had the same issue with several different clients using different brand printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix I found was to change the image print type under print quality from Vector to Raster. (<strong>See images below</strong>) This allowed me to print snips that were larger than a single A4 or A3 sheet. This has been tested using about 6 different drivers
 from both Ricoh and Oki devices and seems to work across the board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone</p>

<br />This is the version you’re trying to download correct? I’m trying to find a direct download link, but as you may know, it’s a little difficult. I can find various download paths, but it all leads to the latest version (15.8) 
<br />
<br />I’ll keep digging on this end!

            I would recommend that you should cross post this request to MSDN Visual Studio forum. That forums is frequented by Visual Studio experts and somebody there might help you to provide the downloan link for VS 15.7.

            Since you are talking about the primary alias, I assume you have already found how to manage your Microsoft account online.&nbsp; According the the text above changing which is the primary account, all your devices should actually display the primary one.&nbsp;
 Since that is not happening for you, I would suggest that there are few possibilities.&nbsp; One is just time, it might take time for it to reflect down to the devices, but the most likely is that you need to reboot the machine and try logging in with the new primary
 email address.<br />

            If you are trying to do what I think. I read that you can change primary aliases in Outlook only twice in one week. My "people" section would not populate yesterday. I thought it was because I changed primary alias, so I changed it back. Same issue. Later
 that evening it populated, and has been fine ever since. Now I can't change my alias back to see if the "people" thing was a Microsoft issue, or because I changed aliases the first time.

            <p>I am in a similar situation - I changed my primary alias for my Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 I removed the old alias and added the new one (the old alias is still on the account, but secondary), however the old alias remains in my e-mail, calendar &amp; contacts list with no option to remove.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried adding the new alias to the e-mail list thinking it would release the other for deletion, but it fails to authenticate ("We don't recognize this user ID or password"), even though I was able to add it as a Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>System updated to 11082 overnight, be was seeing the same behavior before. System is domain joined and my domain account is a local admin.
</p>

</p><p>FYI, I am a former 9 year MS veteran and was a Win8 Ranger back in the day, so not my first rodeo.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi Scanners, Thanks for the reply. I Don't know. I have 3 email addresses for myself in my contacts. One that is my primary, and one that is&nbsp;my secondary send only alias. I just now out of curiosity went to the one which is not an alias. Clicked on
 it and from the top of the screen I clicked delete&nbsp;contact. It deleted no problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I read, and from my experience, it seems you can only&nbsp;make changes to aliases twice in one week. While I was troubleshooting my account, it stopped&nbsp;responding to my attempts to change aliases. I waited a week (making numerous attempts within that
 week) and then it let me make the change.&nbsp;I wouldn't think that would affect deleting contacts. Maybe it won't let you delete a contact that is also one of&nbsp;your aliases. I haven't tried that. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi,  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try another mouse to compare.  
<br />
<br />Try uninstalling the mouse in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, open Mouse, from Driver tab choose Roll Back if available, if not Uninstall, then restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 back to previous build, also tried almost every option in startup settings.&nbsp;

<h2>            What is 10gb OEM &#39;Image&#39; partition &#40;&#43; how to delete&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,<br />
I've recently been doing prep to dual boot linux on my system, backing everything up, freeing space, etc.<br />
<br />
In the process, I've noticed this fairly large OEM partition on my machine simply labelled 'Image', the purpose of which I'm not 100% sure. I believe it's an image that shipped with my PC from Dell, which allows resetting the whole system to factory settings.
 I would really like to reclaim the space, but would prefer to backup stuff if it serves any appreciable purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I delete this partition?</li><li>If I just create a system recovery disk, is there even any point to having it?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7688c492-9e75-4991-9edc-619bb4f961b4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7688c492-9e75-4991-9edc-619bb4f961b4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all on a Dell laptop, Windows 10 - Home Edition.<br />
<br />
Cheers in advance folks</p>

                    I hope you &nbsp;are well. I was trying to stop Microsoft application protection services (which was using 70% of my CPU) when I stopped all services and now I can't sign Into the laptop let alone access &nbsp;safe mode. I do have a restore point so if I can access
 safe mode I can probably work around comfortably. Your help and advice on what I can do to resolve this will mean a lot to me. &nbsp;Thank you in advance

            Start your laptop, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, immediately press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker Won&#39;t Publish Movie</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've spent hours creating a first year video in Windows Movie Maker for my son's birthday tomorrow. I can't publish it to the computer or to a DVD. I'm on a 32-bit Vista Home Premium SP2 system. I've imported AVI and MPG video from a FLIP camera and a Sony
 Digital Video camera. I've also incorporated JPG photos and audio (from iTunes and Amazon MP3). The total play time (in storyboard) is just over 15 minutes. I am using transitions. I have plenty of hard drive space, almost 30GB free. I have successfully used
 my DVD burner in the past...and have even successfully created a Windows Movie Maker Movie and burned it to a DVD in the past...but that "movie" contained only one video and then just a bunch of pictures.<br />
<br />
First I tried publishing my new project to the computer but it never finished. I left it over night and it was still stuck at 20% (or so) in the morning. Next I tried publishing to DVD which opens Windows DVD maker. Again it never finishes...it gets stuck anywhere
 from 1.2% to 68.4% with each try...though it has slowly increased in percentage with each try.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried unchecking all of the filters under Tools-&gt;Options and actually got a DVD to burn but all of the .AVI videos were black. Which filters do I need to leave on for .AVI files to continue to work? I also replaced all music files from iTunes with WMA format
 music and am trying another burn. Now it's stuck again at 67.5% and I'm guessing it won't ever finish.
<br />
<br />
What do I do to get this thing published? I'm so bummed and frustrated...I have hours invested in this thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

===================================<br />
Sounds like your project is too complex...and <br />
it's also possible that one or more of your source <br />
files is not fully compatible with Movie Maker. <br />
Sometimes it can help if you remove transitions.<br />
<br />
Many formats are reportedly compatible with<br />
Movie Maker but the most reliable choices are:<br />
<br />
Photos - bmp<br />
Video -&nbsp;&nbsp; wmv or dv-avi<br />
Music -&nbsp;&nbsp; wmv, wma, wav<br />

<h2>            Arcade and Games on Demand Question&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So none of the games Ive downloaded on the 360 will transfer over to the Xbox One. So, what exactly is the game library going to look like at launch? There are literally thousands of games available to download on 360. If none of them are compatible then
 the library for ONE is pretty much empty, starting from scratch? Will these games eventually get ported, like arcade classics?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to play 360 games then keep playing them on your 360, why must you get rid of it? None will port as it is old tech.</p>

<p>Some Xbox One launch window titles include Ryse, Killer Instinct, Destiny, Titanfall, NBA 2K14, FIFA 14, Need For Speed Rivals, NBA Live 14, Skylanders Swap Force,Just Dance 2014, Wolfenstein: The New Order, &nbsp;Dead Rising 3, Battlefield 4, CoD: Ghosts, Forza

<p>You just named full games. Im talking about the arcade type games. Will ONE have an arcade section like the 360? If so, It would be bare empty since none of the thousands of arcade games now will work on it. My question is will older games like NBA Jam,
 etc eventually get re-worked for the ONE or is Arcade dead for the Xbox ONE?</p>

<p>No games will transfer to the Xbox One as it is a totally different machine. There will be a section like the Xbox 360 Arcade as MS makes a lot of money with it. It will be renamed though.</p>

<p>On your console go to Account Management and double check the e-mail address you are using. You need to enter the e-mail associated with the account you are trying to log in with along with the password for it.

            Hi, GeorgeWhite6 
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode  to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

            Hi George,
<br />
<br />Most likely that update has caused a device driver incompatibility, that is all . . .
<br />
<br />To diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>
