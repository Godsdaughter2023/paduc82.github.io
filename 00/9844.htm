    <title>Office URI Schemes not working on some IE installations - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office URI Schemes not working on some IE installations</h2>
                    Documentation for office URI scheme: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn906146.aspx<br />
<br />
The URI scheme that I am trying to access<br />
<br />
`ms-excel:ofe|u|http://res.cloudinary.com/deep-impact-ag/raw/upload/v1500018958/Swiss_Prime_Site_Excel_tbexa4.xltx`<br />
<br />
I am using IE 11 on both computers. One uses `Windows Server 2012 R2` (where it doesn't work) and the other uses `Windows 10` where it works.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Could someone tell me where should I be looking for a possible solution?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

    <title>Deleting a page in MS Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deleting a page in MS Word</h2>
                    <p>I have a document in MS Word 2007. The designer did two first pages in the same document. The marketing manager wants us to remove the 2nd one. The first page has a full page graphic and a section break under the header. The 2nd page has a page break and
 a header and a footer graphic. When I delete the contents on the 2nd page the header and the footer info are removed from my two following pages (which are the first numbered pages). They even lose their numbering. How can I delete this second page and retain
 the formatting of the following pages? </p>

            Go to the Header and Footer on the first numbered page and click on the Link to Previous button in the Navigation section of the Header &amp; Footer Tools&gt;Design tab of the ribbon to unlink the header and footer on that Section of your document from the header
 and footer in the previous Section so that you can remove the header and footer from that Section without it affection the following Section.

<p>Thanks, Doug. I have done what you said, but whenever I delete that second page it still removes the numbering and footers from the page that came after it (and yes I unlinked the third page from the 2nd). Let me explain the doc further to see if you can
 pinpoint the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first page is an image with some text running in the middle of it. There is a header and a footer. There is a SECTION BREAK (Next Page) here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second page has as a different header and footer and a page break at the top, but it contains text below that page break in a text box.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third page starts the regular numbered section. The header and footer here are the same on all pages moving forward.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This 2nd page was an alternate cover page and whenever I delete it the header and footer remain and the third page disappears.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The header/footers are labeled as such:</p>
<p>Page 1: First Page Header -Section 1-</p>
<p>Page 2: First Page header - Section 2 -</p>
<p>Page 3 &amp; 4:&nbsp; Header - Section 2 -<br />
<br />
The idea was to make 1 doc with Page 1, 3 and 4. And another doc with Page 2, 3, 4. So the sales team could choose which cover they wanted for the doc they were creating.
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help!</p>

    <title>Questions regarding Outlook Web App, Remote Desktop, Remote Web Access - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Questions regarding Outlook Web App, Remote Desktop, Remote Web Access and VPN Access</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to ask a series of questions regarding Outlook Web App, Remote Desktop, Remote Web Access and VPN access and was hoping whether you could help me. Below are my questions to ask you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook Web App -&nbsp;What do I need to configure&nbsp;in order to get my Exchange account to work&nbsp;with the OWA app on my iPhone? Is Office 360 required on the server that hosts Outlook Web App in our organisation? When I configure the settings and connect I get
 the following message&nbsp;"couldn't connect -&nbsp; We couldn't connect&nbsp;to the server. Check your information and make sure it's correct." I can connect with other devices using Outlook Web App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remote&nbsp;Desktop - What do I need to configure in order&nbsp;to&nbsp;connect to my computer at work using Remote Desktop on my Windows Phone? When I configure the settings and connect I get the following message "Connection error - We couldn't connect to the remote
 PC. Make sure the PC is turned on and connected to the network, and that remote access is enabled. Inquiring minds may find this error code helpful:&nbsp;0x204" I can connect with other devices using Remote Desktop. There are currently no RD Server settings in
 the Remote Desktop app on the Windows Phone and the only way I'm to connect to my PC at work is via Remote Desktop and not to be confused with the one by Microsoft, however the app is on a trial basis and times out every 5 minutes and can only be used once
 every hour unless I purchased the app for £2.99 off the App Store but would ideally like to use the Microsoft Remote Desktop app though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remote Web Access - What do I need to configure in order to get Remote Web Access on my Windows Phone using a URL? When I log in using a URL I get the&nbsp;following message "There is a problem with this Web page. Please contact the person who manages the server"
 I can connect with other devices using Remote&nbsp;Web Access.&nbsp;Also how do you enable the background option for Remote Web Access? I know how to do this in Remote Desktop but not in Remote Web Access. Remote Web Access works on PCs regardless being onsite and offsite
 and on my iPhone, the same issue also occurs with my Nokia 5230s regardless of whether I'm using Opera Mobile or Mini or the latest Nokia Browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VPN access - How do you configure VPN access on a Windows Phone using VPN? I cannot find the protocols PPTP, L2TP, SSTP and IPsec in order to configure VPN access on the Windows Phone apart from IKEv2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>RocknRollTim</p>

    <title>Camera not working ONLY in Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> minizv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera not working ONLY in Skype</h2>
                    My wife and myself have 2 new custom built PC's that are identical as far as hardware is concerned and have the same antivirus software installed. We bought 2 cameras, both of which work 100% on my machine. The cameras have built in microphones. A skype
 call between our 2 PC's works but on voice only from my wife's PC (she can see me but I cannot see her, nor is there a small widow with the video image in on my wife's PC). The camera tests out 100% and (when at my wife's PC) I can see myself sitting here
 in MS Camera but not in Skype. I have checked that Skype has firewall access (it has), I have allowed the camera to be used by Skype. It is reported as fully working by the OS (WIN10 Pro).&nbsp; Any ideas? Thanks

            Hi minizv,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an Independent Advisor, here to help the community with issues that they are experiencing.
<br />
<br />If you haven't already done so I'd try to update your drivers before doing anything else.
<br />
<br />Updating Drivers 
<br />1. Search "Device Manager" in the search box, near the Windows Start Button, and select it. 
<br />2. Locate your camera, right click and select "Update Drivers". 
<br />3. Restart your PC. 
<br />
<br />If this does not help, please try the Windows Desktop Version if you are using the App version:-
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />Select the drop down arrow and click 'Get Skype for Windows' instead of 'Get Skype for Windows 10'.

<p>Hi Dan, thanks for this, it worked - sort of!</p>
<p>I changed the version to the generic Windows version as suggested and could not get it to work, even after a re-boot. It was reporting a camera that is not the one I have installed. I then clicked on Video Message and the camera started working. So then
 I tried a video link again and it worked! After that I tried a re-boot and, I am relieved to say, it stll works after the reboot. I used iobit uninstaller to check that I did not have 2 versions of Skype installed. I didn't but the generic Windows installation
 had installed software from Cyberlink that auto started on booting (date and time matched) - it was a cyberlink camera that Skype was reporting. I have uninstalled this and Skype continues to work.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Hi Billy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open your Sway, do you have the option to set it to available to anyone with a link in the Share dropdown?&nbsp; Is this something you're willing to do with this Sway?&nbsp; If so, that should definitely make it work.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I'm looking into why it's
 not authenticating.</p>

<p>Billy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The embed code you shared previously, is that what you put into your Sway or did you take that from the HTML of page that gets displayed?&nbsp; If it's the former, it would help me to debug to see what is ending up in the page.&nbsp; Can you try the following please?</p>
<p>1. View the page where the embedded Sway is failing to sign in</p>
<p>2. Press F12 to open the develop tools</p>
<p>3. On the DOM Explorer tab, find the entry for your Sway:&nbsp; https://sway.com/s/xxxxxxxxxxxx/embed</p>
<p>4. Copy that iframe HTML element and reply with it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 530 won&#39;t connect to Wi-Fi</h2>
                    I bought a Lumia 530 recently and the Wi-Fi worked until today when it started giving me problems. At first it would let me connect to the network but it would disconnect after half a minute or so. Then I'd have to delete the network and connect again
 and it would work for half a minute again before disconnecting. Then it started saying "Your phone won't be able to connect to the internet from this network windows phone" whenever I'd try connecting, I could still connect to the network but there was no
 internet. Now it says "Your phone can't connect to the Wi-Fi network Sitecom2D48BA" and indeed I can't connect to the network at all. It really can't be from the modem since I have a PC connected to it and my brother has a smart phone from a different company
 that has the Wi-Fi working just fine.

<h2>            Excel 16.19 &#40;181020&#41; crashes when opening a specific file</h2>
                    <p>I installed&nbsp;Excel 16.19 (181020) this morning (Insider Fast).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open an important budget file I have been working on for some weeks, Excel crashes immediately. Other Excel files can be opened with this latest version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied the budget file to one of our Windows servers where there is a copy of Excel 2016 for Windows installed. The budget file opens without problem and I have been able to work on it without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't think the file is corrupt. I suspect the latest Mac version of Excel has an issue with some content in the file that was not there in the prior version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the smiley/frowny face to report this.</p>

<p>Hi Ori,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it's possible.</p>
<p>If both of your accounts have Office 365 subscription, it will be much easier.</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1.Open the notebook you want to move in OneNote 2016.</p>
<p>2.Click <span style="font-weight: bold">
File</span> &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">Export</span> &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">
Notebook</span> &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">OneNote Package</span> and Export this notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d2130a6-7361-46eb-8c93-40a058a26558?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d2130a6-7361-46eb-8c93-40a058a26558?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Sign out your account A, and sign in OneNote 2016 with your account B, go
<p>It will alert you that this notebook have to be saved on OneDrive or SharePoint before sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8b9a826-6a86-4a9d-9a7b-dd7dc9b1f3d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8b9a826-6a86-4a9d-9a7b-dd7dc9b1f3d5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Click<span style="font-weight: bold"> OneDrive</span> and browse a location where you want to save this notebook. After the syncing process is finished, then you have already moved this notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I would like to mention, in this way, the changes you have made on this notebook won't sync to account A's notebook. If you want the changes to be synced ,</p>
<p>you can just share this notebook to account B.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75226edb-e53d-4b05-b49d-9c228edc2ed2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75226edb-e53d-4b05-b49d-9c228edc2ed2?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><p>When I use the wizard I end up with just one name&nbsp;on a page and none of their subordinates (even after choosing the option to determine how much of the organisation appears on each page and identifying the section managers)
</p>

    <title>Outlook &#62; Other Web Locations &#62; Recent Folders List - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook &#62; Other Web Locations &#62; Recent Folders List</h2>
                    <p>When writing an e-mail message in Outlook, using Office 365 for Business running under Windows 10:<br />
Under: &nbsp;<em><strong>Attach File </strong></em>&gt; <em><strong>Browse Web Locations </strong>
</em>there is an option for <em><strong>Other Web Locations </strong></em>and a <em>
<strong>Recent Folders </strong></em>list (see screen print below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I recognise these locations as places I have used over the last few weeks, I am unable to figure out why these entries and not other recent places appear on the list, where the list is stored, or most importantly for us how to get an entry to appear
 on the list.&nbsp; Can anyone help?<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response, but as far as I can see this applies to all components
<strong>apart </strong>from Outlook, which is where my problem lies.&nbsp; Or am I missing something?&nbsp; If there is&nbsp;way of getting to this in Outlook, could you please supply some more detail or a screen print?&nbsp; Please note also that this is the "Recent Folders"
 for "Other Web Locations", not just the recent documents for attachments.</p>

<p>Hi AdminFusion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the understanding and time. Based on my test and research, the other location can be a SharePoint site or groups document library that you've accessed before, it is the location that stores recent folder you mentioned. For your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/attach-files-or-insert-pictures-in-outlook-email-messages-bdfafef5-792a-42b1-9a7b-84512d7de7fc?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Attach
 files or insert pictures in Outlook email messages</a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99269b73-48cc-43c6-9b6a-d7c17b72eaa0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99269b73-48cc-43c6-9b6a-d7c17b72eaa0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the recent folder, I have tried to access related folder and the file in it on the website, but there are only files in
<strong>Recent Items list</strong> but not folder in <strong>Other Web Locations &gt; Recent Folders list</strong>. Furthermore, when I open the folder in Other Web Locations &gt; Recent Folders list, it redirects to an local location in pc. Therefore, in order to
 do test with steps closer to yours, would you mind letting me know the steps to access folder(the one appears in the list) of Other Web Locations &gt; Recent Folders? And after opening the folder, what the outcome shows.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0b1c1a4-8008-416c-81c5-ea37cf2c9f7e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0b1c1a4-8008-416c-81c5-ea37cf2c9f7e?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>In addition, since as far as I know, after you access an cloud&nbsp;document in a related website, such as OneDrive for Business or SharePoint for Business site, the cloud document will display as the top recent file as I mentioned above, and the aim to attach
 attachment is to attach a document(local document or cloud&nbsp;document) rather than a folder, Therefore, to help you better, could you please let me know why you need to access recent folders rather than recent items(cloud document)? So that I can give more suitable
 suggestion to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, since the operation might be different in different version of Outlook, please also let me know the version of your Outlook client. Click File &gt; Office Account &gt; About Outlook.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf0db2ec-4e4a-46e8-b02b-c7a87d588747?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf0db2ec-4e4a-46e8-b02b-c7a87d588747?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><p>If you have anything unclear or further concern, please feel free to let me know, your cooperation is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to post your extensive reply.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You are right that the documents I am accessing are in a web-based external document library.</p>
<p>Since you posted your reply I have succeeded in mapping a network drive to this location (which I was unable to before) which has relieved the immediate urgency of my query.&nbsp; However this is known not to be a reliable means of accessing this location, and
 so it would still be useful I can understand how the Recent Folders list is populated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting from your last question:<br />
</p>
<p><em><strong>Outlook version info:</strong></em><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/187cb443-294b-4392-8e05-2c78e1c6fe88?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/187cb443-294b-4392-8e05-2c78e1c6fe88?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Why I want to access the Recent Folder list and not just Recent Items:</strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the time, documents accessed from this repository do not appear on the "Recent Items" list, and in the event that one does, after a while it will drop off the bottom as more local documents are accessed.&nbsp; It is therefore often not possible to access
 them directly from Recent Items, and hence my interest in Recent Folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open a document through the newly-mapped network drive, then it does appear on the "Recent Items" list, otherwise it does not.&nbsp; But this still does not make the folder appear in the Other Web Locations &gt; Recent Folders list</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Behaviour when accessing document through the Recent Folders list:</strong></em></p>
<p>This is my Recent Folders list now (below)<br />
You'll notice that a new folder has appeared at the top of the list since my initial post last week.<br />
Why this folder has appeared and not others I have accessed, I have no idea - that's what prompted my question :-)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26603ad1-7186-4fc5-8ff7-eade8c811cea?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26603ad1-7186-4fc5-8ff7-eade8c811cea?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the folder, it opens an "Insert File" dialogue, but unlike your own example above, the folder address appears in the Address Bar as a web address, not a local address:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/032d8ce7-025b-440a-8e34-0fee3910433b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/032d8ce7-025b-440a-8e34-0fee3910433b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can then select a File, and get the usual dialogue to share as a link or a copy:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54e119a5-64d5-4a53-980f-a0d257d6c902?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54e119a5-64d5-4a53-980f-a0d257d6c902?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your time and attention, Betty - any further inspiration?</p>

<p><span>Hi AdminFusion,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for taking time to wait for my updates. Based on my researches, the Recent Folders list roams with the mailbox and it comes from your SharePoint site or OneDrive site that you accessed or shared before, and I have consulted the related team,
 about how to figure out which folder shows in the Recent Folders list, it involves the internal processing mechanism of Outlook and its integration with SharePoint, there is no public official document that stated the detailed flow.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, based on your description, I understand you'd like to share documents you accessed recently in fact, you are just worried that you cannot find the online document, based on this demand, I have two workarounds for you, please take a check
 if they can up your need.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Browse Web Locations &gt; Sites</span><span> and select the recent folder there, when it redirects to the local location, click "</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Up arrow</span><span>" option to back
 to the parent directory, and select the folder you would like(access recently).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Open</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Browse Web Locations &gt; OneDrive site</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>·</span><span> Copy the address link in the location box, then paste it in a browser you login to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; · To view the recent folder you have accessed, just need click </span>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; · Click the address of the related document you would like to share to go to related SharePoint site.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/213b5171-9e07-48fe-abdd-7050106aa974?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/213b5171-9e07-48fe-abdd-7050106aa974?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>·</span><span> Then select to share the document.(Copy link or share via Outlook)</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acfe4f0e-5a35-4a4f-89b1-06be1895d538?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acfe4f0e-5a35-4a4f-89b1-06be1895d538?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p><span>The suggestion 2 could be a little complicated, but it could display all online documents you accessed in time, hope the suggestions above are helpful for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Betty</span></p>

<p>hi gregory,</p>
<p>as the admin of office 365, we can find the users’ last logon time to their mailboxes in exchange admin center (it's under&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>admin</strong> in office 365 admin center)&gt;
<strong>recipients</strong>&gt;<strong>mailboxes</strong> as below. based on my test, if the user just access a sharepoint online service like a site, it will also be updated.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0be4aab-1351-4bc2-ad78-2064db72f610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0be4aab-1351-4bc2-ad78-2064db72f610" /></a></p>
<p>but if this user doesn’t have an office 365 mailbox, his last login time will not be visible to the admin.&nbsp;thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>best regards,</p>
<p>april</p>

<p>@April: We don't use Exchange in our implementation, mainly just Sites. &nbsp;As such, there aren't any mailboxes and therefore no last access time for mailboxes.</p>
<p>@John8218: I was looking for a non-programmatic way to find out this information just using the Office 365 UI. &nbsp;If there were an executable utility that was available that provided this functionality that might be an option, though.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Install Netflix and Flixter</h2>
                    Hi, when 'm trying to install Netflix or Flixter on my Lumia 800- 7.8, I get a message saying "your software needs to be updated", although mine has been updated to the latest version i.e. 7.8. Can anyone give me a solution to this. Thanks

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting regarding the issue you are having with those apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the full OS version, as found under Settings -&gt; System -&gt; About?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of those apps are listed on the US marketplace as available for 7.5+ so that is a bit odd if you do have 7.8 installed.&nbsp; The Netflix app was recently updated, but Flixster hasn't been since prior to the 7.8 launch.&nbsp; It's actually possible that Flixster
 doesn't work with 7.8 but you'd need to contact them to find out for sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to try would be to go to Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt; Internet Explorer and tap on Delete History, and then restart your phone by holding the power button for 10 seconds, and then try again.&nbsp; Also, you might try installing the apps off of the windowsphone.com
 website, just make sure it's set to the version of the website for your account's region to make sure you're seeing the correct apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please keep in touch so that we can look into this further for you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Kevin J S</p>

    <title>calculation help in form fields - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sccaatom  say:</h3>
<h2>            calculation help in form fields</h2>
                    <p>I am using word 2010. I created a textbox form field which I bookmarked as hotelcost. I created another textbox which I&nbsp;bookmarked costpernight. I made them both number formats and then I created a textbox and named it hotelsubtotal as the bookmarkname.
 I made this&nbsp;a calculated field &nbsp;and the calculation was (hotelcost)*(costpernight). That worked fine.</p>
<p>I created&nbsp;a second set of text boxes</p>
<p>one was bookmarked as costpermeal</p>
<p>one was bookmarked as mealsperday</p>
<p>and I crested a calculated field&nbsp; called mealsubtotal which was (numberofnights)*(costpermeal)*(mealsperday)&nbsp;</p>
<p>That calculation was also correct</p>
<p>I want to total&nbsp; my expenses now and so I created a final text box</p>
<p>I bookmarked it as total</p>
<p>my calculation was (hotelsubtotal)+(mealsubtotal)</p>
<p>my fields&nbsp;automatically doubled in the total field</p>
<p>I can't see anywhere in the calculation including the parenthesis that is causing this to happen. I tried several examples and it exactly doubles them each time.</p>
<p>What am I doing incorrectly</p>
<p>Please tell me</p>
<p>Thanks for the help</p>

<strong>TravisMire</strong> and <strong>dana695</strong>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that the browser that you are using is causing the issue. I suggest that you clear your browser’s cache and temporary internet files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can find instructions for optimizing your browser on the following link:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your browser's cache.</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, having the most updated version of a supported browser helps in resolving the issue. Please download the latest version of your preferred browser. To know the list of supported
 browsers, please refer to the article below:</span></p>

            Unfortunately, there is no work around for it since your Skype ID becomes linked to the Microsoft Account. Microsoft has not provided a means to close the account separate from MS account itself. You are basically stuck with it. 
<br />
<br />Steps for deleting the account:
<br />
<br />How do I close my Skype account?
<br />
<br />Your Skype account is the same as your Microsoft account. If you close it, you'll no longer be able to sign in to other Microsoft products or services such as Outlook.com, Office Online, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Windows.
<br />
<br />Before you close your Skype account, let's make sure you aren't leaving anything important behind:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to your Skype account.  
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />    Follow the steps in this article (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412</a>) to verify that: 
<br />        Important information such as files and contacts are saved.
<br />        Your Skype Credit balance has been used. Once your account is closed, you can't get it back. 
<br />
<br />        Active subscriptions have been cancelled so you don’t continue to get charged. If you have Auto-recharge enabled and cancel your account without first cancelling your subscription, you will continue to be charged until your account has been permanently closed in 60 days. Learn how to disable Auto-recharge (<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633</a>).
<br />
<br />    Go to our account closure page (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a>). You may be prompted to sign in or verify your password.
<br />
<br />    Make sure you are signed in to the account you want to close and select Next. 
<br />    In the Select a reason drop-down list, choose the reason you're closing the account. 
<br />
<br />    Select Mark account for closure.
<br />
<br />    Your account will be closed in 60 days. We wait 60 days before permanently deleting accounts in case you change your mind or need to access something before it's gone. You can change your mind any time during the 60 days, just sign in (<a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>) to cancel the closure.

    <title>Can&#39;t open in Read Only mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathryneevans  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open in Read Only mode</h2>
                    The attorney I work for prefers to open documents as Read Only when revising them, to ensure he won't lose prior copies of documents.&nbsp; I know a workaround is to open the document regularly and Save As, but he prefers to do it the way he always has, and
 he's the boss.&nbsp; In Word 2010, you do this from the Open File dialog box by selecting the file then choosing "Open Read Only" from the "open" drop down menu in the bottom right of the dialog box.&nbsp; However, some documents have that option greyed out and we cannot
 see a pattern to which ones work this way and which don't.&nbsp; Any ideas why some docs won't open in Read Only mode?

            Would it work just as well for him to use Open as Copy? If he saves that, it will save with a different filename. Or he could use New from Existing in the New dialog to create a new document based on the old one, which would require Save As.

            Thank you for your suggestions. Yes, Open as Copy would work, but that's greyed out as well.&nbsp; For now he's working around, like I said, with an immediate Save As upon opening.&nbsp; He really wants to know why his tried and true Open as Copy/Read Only or at
 least be able to anticipate when it will work and when it won't.&nbsp;

            <p>That is definitely puzzling. I can find only one reference to such a problem online, and that affected all documents (not just some) and involved checking them out from SharePoint. Needless to say, there are plenty of questions about documents that refuse
 to open <strong>except</strong> read-only.</p>
<p>What is the file type: .doc or .docx?</p>

            <p>I checked and it's a .doc.&nbsp; But there are other .doc's that will open as a copy or read only.&nbsp; It's a puzzler.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sporadic puzzler, the worst kind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if it could have anything to do with the fact that the documents that are affected all seem to have come from an outside party using some sort of third party document management system.</p>

            <p>Yes, I think you're onto something there. In fact, when I tested this, I was using a .doc file because that's what I mostly have. But when third-party document management systems become involved, all bets are off.</p>
<p>I think you'd probably better just tell your boss that's the reason and that he'll have to deal with those document differently--unless you can get the sender to explain how to make them work as expected.</p>

    <title>Latest version of Outlook.com not fully functional, Pale Moon browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glenn reimche  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest version of Outlook.com not fully functional, Pale Moon browser</h2>
                    <p>I use Pale Moon X64, which is just Firefox tuned for Windows, and with the latest iteration of Outlook.com, automatic message refreshing is "broken".<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have mail forwarding enabled, and new mail messages are still correctly and immediately forwarded.&nbsp; But they don't automatically appear in my Outlook.com Inbox like they used to.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hitting the Refresh icon sometimes refreshes the Inbox.&nbsp; Sometimes that fails with a generic error message.&nbsp; I often have to Reload the whole page just to get new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has worked well for years, until now.&nbsp; Any suggestions welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            <p>It worked as expected in IE on the same Win 8.1 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to test Pale Moon on another system as soon as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as "latest iteration of", I was indeed referring to Outlook.com.&nbsp; The site often says that it has been updated and requests a browser refresh.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the last one, it started complaining that my browser was not up to date.&nbsp; It does not seem to be able to recognize I am not running stock Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple days later there was also a Pale Moon update.&nbsp; Outlook.com still insists I am not running the current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few other things I can try to troubleshoot, like disabling add-ons, but I figured I should ask around first to see if this was a known known.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word Table of Contents issue - How to force all page numbers to be along the right-hand side of the page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I am just finishing my PhD thesis in Word and I am struggling with the table of contents. Whenever a heading is just over the length of the line the page number is not aligned right like all of the other page numbers, as you can see in the screenshot (the grey
 is just from field shading).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How do I make it so the page numbers are always aligned on the right as shown next to the green annotation in the photo below, and not in the position shown next to the red annotation? I.e. how do I force the table of contents to add another line of 'dots'
 and place the page number at the far right so it is aligned with the others without manually altering the text of the table of contents (as this would revert back to the original incorrect position whenever I update the table anyway)?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help!<br />
</p>

<p>The issue is that the tab stop at which the word "Comparison" is aligned is to the right of the word "task" and hence to tab space after the word "task" is aligning the number at that tab stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should increase the hanging indent so that it aligns with the tab stop at which the word "Comparison" is aligned and the text on the second and subsequent lines will be aligned with the C of "Comparison"&nbsp; and then there will be no chance of the first
 word on the last line of text ending to the left of the tab stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the modifications are not being retained, go to the Developer tab of the ribbon and then click on the Document Template item and make sure that the box for "Automatically update document styles" is not checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it would probably be a good idea to modify the TOC # styles in the template itself.</p>

            This support forum is nothing more than disgusting if you think that it is some sort of support...<br />
<br />
It is discussions between the public and nothing more.<br />
<br />
1. The advice is almost always incorrect<br />
2. It is 100% untimely<br />
3. The communications are atrocious<br />
4. The advice is redundant and I find I have to explain the same thing several times.,<br />
5. It i8s completely absurd that I get several different people joining into the discussion for support and have to explain it all over again every time because they are too lazy to read the full post.<br />
6. They are never correct<br />
7. It is a disgusting resource of support,<br />
<br />
We need:<br />
<br />
1. A form of immediate support<br />
2. A form of correct support from people who know the product and know how to resolve<br />
3. People who actually have authority to review the processes and servers on a technical level to be able to provide resolutions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please advise why you gave such a stupid response?<br />

            Ok thanks...<br />
<br />
My email address is ***Email address removed for privacy***<br />
<br />
I have had an email account for about 20 years. I previously closed and account and transferred it to this one... I have had this one for over 10 years...<br />
<br />
Recently there have been several changes to the account that has made it impossible for me to manage it. And when I say impossible I mean "impossible".<br />
<br />
1. I have been forced to provide back up details for your security, either another email address or a phone number. I do not have either.... I do not have either..... I don't know why it is suddenly a requirement... It is completely unfair for us, especially
 when we have built a lot of purpose around this account... I have had to set up another email account just for this purpose which I now have to continually manage.... This is not fair, not just or even right in any way...<br />
<br />
2. I had been forced to change my password. Stating that someone had tried to access my account... I do not believe that... I do not believe that anyone could have worked out my password. I don't beleive anyone would want to access my account... I don't know
 why I would be targetted, and also even on the smallest chance that is true, there is nothing of great importance anyone could obtain from it... I can not remember hundreds of passwords. I should not have to change my password unless I believe it is necessary...
 This is my account, my security... It is now going to be impossible for me to manage.<br />
<br />
3. After 20 years we should not need extra requirements, especially ones that we can not provide... I should not have to get a phone number or another email account just to keep this one.... Not after 20 years... This an an "unreasonable" demand.... It is ridiculous....
<br />
<br />
4. The support for all these problems is little to non-existent....<br />
<br />
Just because you think that security needs to be tightened doesn't mean it does... It is our sensitive information... I have never ever in 20 years had a security leak, and more importantly none that has affected me... These security measures are problematic
 to say the least...<br />
<br />
I can not manage my account like this....<br />
<br />
If you can not resolve it, please advise how I can save all my emails to my account to for future reference after I close this account....<br />
<br />
I have seriously thought of seeking legal assistance in how to fight this, as this can not be right... It will affect my life in a large way as I have built a lot of communications around this account....<br />

            <p>Hi Riley_I,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I understand your concerns and have been investigating if there any alternatives given your situation. I would point out however that the issues you have called out actually relate to Microsoft Account which is in fact managed and developed separately from
 Outlook.com since it is utilized across several Microsoft products including Windows 8, Windows Phone, SkyDrive, XBOX e.t.c. My remit extends&nbsp;to Outlook.com Mail and Calendar specifically. That being said we do work closely&nbsp;with the Microsoft Account&nbsp;team.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The requirement as I understand was added by the Microsoft Account team largely&nbsp;for two measures;&nbsp;to assist incase you forget your password and secondly to combat account hijacking as it makes the process difficult for hijackers to take over an account.
 Without a secondary method of validation situations could occur where customers would find it difficult or even impossible to validate their original ownership. So whilst I acknowledge there is definitely some additional administrative overhead on the part
 of the customer the intention is entirely to provide additional protection.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The effort of setting up a second account on Outlook.com should be minimal. I believe you can set each account to be the backup for the other. You mention that you will have to continually manage it, I would like to understand more what it is you feel requires
 continual management. Once set up there should be very little management of the account required.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One thing that was pointed out to me (I'm not sure if it was clear or not at setup) was that&nbsp;when using a&nbsp;phone number it does not need to be a cell phone, it can be a landline since we have voice validation too. The phone also does not have to specifically
 belong to you, just one you have access to should you be required to validate your details.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I understand your difficulty regarding the password change, I was also faced with this recently too and was required to change my password everywhere. Whilst it is an inconvenience when this happens it should only be triggered when some activity is detected
 that might be cause for concern, there is no timed forced change unless you specifically enable that option under the account settings. If it is asking you the change the password frequently I would strongly advise keeping the maximum of security enabled on
 the account to ensure you are fully protected.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Without direct influence over this area the best I can offer is to relay your feedback to my counterparts on the Accounts team so that they can take&nbsp;this into consideration when planning.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope there is some way in which we can find a resolution to your problem, should you decide to back up your email from the Outlook.com site the best recommendation I can make would be to use a desktop client and download the mail from Outlook.com. Outlook
 for example will then allow you to save the mail as a personal folders or archive to your hard drive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Being a long term customer I believe you must hold high value on the content of your mailbox and as such I hope you can understand that the recent changes on the accounts side are aimed purely at protecting your content to ensure you keep your data yours.
 I never thought my account would be hijacked until one of my secondary accounts was taken over one day and cleaned out (my take from this was you never believe it will happen to you until it does). One of our top priorities is to always ensure that you are
 protected to the best of yours and&nbsp;our ability.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will definitely pass on your concerns to the relevant people in the accounts team. From the Outlook.com Mail and Calendar perspective the advice above is the best solution we are able to provide currently.</p>

            1. If you read my message you would clearly understand that this email account should be for me to manage. Not you... If I think my password needs changing I would change it... If I don't think it needs changing I won't. After 20 years, you just can't
 take over and make it harder for me. Managing so many passwords on the internet is difficult. It is this that is the problem. This is exactly why people forget their passwords... And if I have a hijacking problem I will review it myself and deal with it myself
 accordingly....<br />
<br />
2. Why would I want a second Outlook account when this one is terrible and unmanageable? You are changing restrictions willy nilly, what is next, you will demand my bank details to keep my account? In order for me to keep this account it has just forced me
 to change my password, and with that it forced me to enter my backup email address so it can send a sec<br />
<br />
Oh why am I having to explain myself...<br />
<br />
This is unreasonable.....<br />
<br />
I am not going to read through your unreasobable essay trying to defend these inappropriate practices.. Please advise me in a smaller reply how I can transfer all my emails and contact out of outlook (previously hotmail).<br />
<br />
Your product is decent however the services and support are atrocious.<br />

            <p>Before I use that as a "last resort" I want to make sure I can't resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly you mentioned:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I am one of the lead engineers working on Outlook.com. "</p>
<p>"I believe I meet the criteria you have called out above and would be happy to try assist."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I explained in great detail why the restrictions placed were unreasonable...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And with further review I will add this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The restriction came at the time a spam email attacked my account. This spam email came into my inbox due to faults from the technical side. I presume due to the change from Hotmail to Outlook as it coincided with that change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this was a technical problem, because I placed the problem on this forum and someone replied stating this and resolved it straight after....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attack came from a sent spam email, not someone hacking for my password....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this technical fault was a fault from Hotmail, not myself..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And thus Hotmails failure is continuing to be problematic for me...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This plus the fact that my account is for me to manage should be explanation enough for me to get my old password back.. Changing my password was forced upon me due to a Hotmail fault, and now it won't let me change it back stating that you don't allow us
 to repeat any pervious passwords...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please resolve so that I can get back to that previous password...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is absolutely ridiculous that you forced me to change it and can not change it back because of your own technical faults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't recognise my anger, I will clearly point out that as a Business Analyst myself, I do not know how you can justify this situation... A user of 20 years, and you are almost forcing me to cancel due to your technical faults....</p>
