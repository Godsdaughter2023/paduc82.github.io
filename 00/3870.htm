<h2>            header and footer disappear when copy&#47;pasting from document with section breaks</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Urgent need of help please! My organization is trying to create a global template for everyone to use.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When someone copy/pastes from a document with section breaks into the template, the template's header and footer disappears on certain pages.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to tell the global template NOT to transfer over breaks from a copy/paste? Or is it possible to lock the header and footer fullproof to the point that copy/pasting breaks wont alter it?<br />
<br />
Essentially need a full-proof header footer for a template that wont EVER disappear, even from pasting line breaks.

            There is a huge difference between pasting line or page breaks and pasting section breaks. Among other things, in Word, line and page breaks are contained within paragraphs. On the other hand, paragraphs are contained within sections. Section formatting
 controls headers/footers, margins and columns. Pagination can be changed with a section break.<br />
<br />
You can use paste special and paste only text with no formatting. This will not paste the section breaks and headers/footers. You could also do the paste section-by-section avoiding pasting the section breaks. That would preserve formatting not contained in
 the section break.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you can go into the document after you paste and delete the section breaks.<br />

<h2>            Windows Defender is OFF, I can&#39;t turn it ON</h2>
                    Hello and HELP, When I try to turn it ON I receive a error message : "This program is blocked by group policy.For more information contact your system administrator. (Error Code: 0x800704ec)"<br />
I uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus ans I continue with the same problem. <br />
I went to services and the status was clear so I change it to "Start" and I receive a error message:"The Windows Defender on Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs." also
 I change the "Startup"&nbsp; from "Manual" to "Automatic" and I did a computer restart having as a result the same issue.<br />
Like I said before right now I'm not running or have install any anti-virus software.<br />
Thanks.<br />
B.T.W: My OS is Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit.

<h2>            &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; N8 is the most embarassing phone of the decade &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>My faith in Nokia, Sony Erricsson and essentially European phones made me resisted other makes for a long time. After reading and listening to other people about the better smartphones out there, I still resisted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This month, I got rid of my Sony Erricsson X2&nbsp; Xperia and bought the new Nokia N8.</p>
<p>I had nothing but endless crashes.&nbsp; Browsing became too much trouble and streaming videos will eventually freeze the phone up most of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the shop and service center and the hardware is suppose to be not at fault.</p>
<p>Am I suppose to keep this phone and wait for a new software until when?!!!!!</p>
<p>Lately I decided to sit down for a few hours and gave in to a group of colleagues in my office. I tried the HTC Legend, HTC Wildfire and HTC Desire.&nbsp; After opening other applications and watching streaming videos at the same time, I was astonished that none
 of these phones crash. All the videos automatically open up as fullscreen unlike my N8. The back button on the HTC always came out confidently. Swipeing the phones are obviously superior to my N8 slowness. In short, these HTCs are overwhelmingly superior.&nbsp;
 I shook my head and wondered what has happened to Nokia and it's former glory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe a software update could be the answer to my N8's problemssssssssssssssssss and thousands of people like me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>sounds like a faulty phone mine doesnt have them problems mate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>faulty phones do happend but your problems are not firmware related trust me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to me it sounds like you wish to follow the htc trend in your office , the n8 is superior to htc phones in many ways , battery life , camera , mass memory , fm transmitter , usb2go , hdmi out , 2 methods of charging , better 3d-gfx capabillities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>everyoneis different and has different needs but there is no way id swap my n8 for a htc desire/desire hd / desire z / htc wildfire etc etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>android is overated in my eyes and needs a 1ghz processor and loads of ram to run it when the n8 does all the things a htc phone does and more and runs for longer too on half the hardware power</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i really dont see the big thing with android yeah its an ok o/s but its still very inmature with not very efficent coding that has been overated by the media and been taken to by the masses claiming its the best thing since sliced bread :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you made a mistake and bought the wrong phone sell the n8 and buy a different brand mate or swap it with someone or if its faulty take it back but one things for sure your problems arent firmware related as it isnt a common issue</p>

<p>Hi, I'm sorry for your bad experience with the n8, but over all the phone has gotten pretty good critics.&nbsp; Even though it isn't an excuse, this device is brand new and fw updates will come. - It will make the n8 even better. Usually new phones regardless
 of brand, seems to have different issues. Like I wrote, it's not an excuse, but it applies to every brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HTC Desire is now pretty much bullet proof as it has been out for quite a while and has gotten several updates. - Still there are a few bad user expereiences due to the tiny amount of phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you take a look at the HTC Desire HD, it has different types of problems. One of them is the famous INIT - issue which is a system bug which causes the cpu to run at a 100% over time. - This results in extreme battery drain and the phone freezes and lags.
 HTC will fix that with fw updates, like any other brand would do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S suffers from lag and gps issues. Lag mostly due to the RFS&nbsp; system, but also the fact that android seems to work better with the Snapdragon compared to the Samsungs ARM cpu. There are also some issues caused by poor memory management.
 The gps issue seemes to be a bit hardware and a bit software. - And unlike Nokia, Samsung are bad when it comes to updating. - Just like SE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many users who are very satisfied with the N8, and hopefully you will be too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have both the HTC desire and the Samsung Galaxy S i do participate on forums about&nbsp; those devices, and I experience just the same there as you are experiencing with your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Random shutdowns, freezes, call interuppted, gps don't work, cameras crashing etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People will also not experience every bug or issue as people uses their phones differently. There are issues which simpley can be fixed by uninstalling a bad written 3rd party app, changing sim card if it's old or change memory card. But of course there
 are issues which is directly caused by bugs in the fw and with the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I totally uderstand your frustration and maybe the right thing for u is to eventually get your money back and buy another brand, but the failrate is pretty much the same all over no matter brand. But going for a device which has been out for almost a year
 or more would probably give you less issues than jumping on something that has just been released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I where u, I would hold on to the N8 a bit longer. I'm pretty sure that it won't take too long before the n8 gets a fw update which fixes a lot of things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After my own experience with the n97, I've decided never to buy anything that's totally new, but wait at least a few weeks to see some reviews made by end users with the final release device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had plenty of Nokias, Apple, Samsungs, some htc's etc and except from the n97, Nokia has failed me the least. I remember the biggest pain next to that phone, and that was a HTC diamond 2 which I paid a load of money for. - It has to be the worst device
 I've ever had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Either you stick with it some more times, send it back for repair and hopefully get it fixed or replaced, or you get it back with the same faults and (it depends on your country's customer code) can get your money back and buy something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I totally understand that you feel that you've been let down, but I disagree that the N8 is the most embarassing phone of the decade. - It sure isn't.&nbsp; There are people who thinks just the same of HTC Desire, Samsung GS, Iphone 3gs, Iphone 4, Nokia N900,
 Nokia n97, Nexus one or whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I suggest you do next time youre looking for a phone, is what I've started to do: Set up a list with features you need. Then arrange them from top to bottom, where top is the feature you want most... (you get it). Then you start using google or check
 out the homepages for different brands and read their devices spec-lists. Then find the ones you would like to know more. - Get on youtube and watch some unboxing videos and reviews, and the pick out a number of 3-5 phones which seems to fit your needs. -
 Finally you visit stores and try the different phones to see them in real life. - This is what I've decided to do from now on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish you all the best whatever you choose to do, but be ware that no matter brand, there is a equal chance that you get a faulty device, or will experience annoying bugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw. Two of my firends has the HTC wildfire. One of the phones works pretty nice, but the other one does wierd things like canceliing calls whenever it likes to and camera does not work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not just Nokia! And to end this, two of my classmates has the Iphone 4. - And yes, their phones suffers from bad reception. Really bad reception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers mate!</p>

<h2>            Transferspreadsheet not importing currency values</h2>
                    
<p>help!&nbsp; again!&nbsp;</p>
<p>my Transferspreadsheet functions are working, except for one little issue.&nbsp; this must be something i am doing completely wrong!&nbsp; i have to get three ranges separately, they are not continuous. so i just transfer into three temp tables, then do insert and
 update queries to get it into the predefined table.</p>
<p>first range is just fine, one column of alph and one of text.&nbsp; the next two ranges, i get nothing, they are all currency.&nbsp; i am at loss.&nbsp; i do not get any errors, the tables are created with the correct number of rows, just empty.&nbsp; if i look at the temp
 tables, which are just created with the transferspreadsheet method, the fields are defined as currency and not required or indexed.</p>
<p>just empy rows!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>any ideas?!??! first one below gets values, the rest get empty rows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'get data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sNameandRange = sWorkSheetName(i) &amp; "!" &amp; "B26:C" &amp; x<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'import the spreadsheet data into the temp table<br />

<h2>            Outlook new interface</h2>
                    <p>I just switched to the new Outlook Ribbon and while I like very much I noted something weird that I am not sure if it is a bug or by design:</p>
<p>When I open Outlook the program shows Outlook Today but after I click, for example on the Inbox icon I am unable to go back to Outlook Today page; clicking on the line showing the account which should bring back Outlook Today does not do anything. Switching
 back to the "classic" interface the issue is not present and clicking on the account open as expected Outlook Today.</p>

<p>Yes, it is the Outlook which is part of the Office Suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I do know that there is not a classic view; I used the word classic, and with double commas, to differentiate it from the new GUI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is exactly the problem that I am reporting: selecting the mail account folder shows Outlook Today if I am in the standard Outlook GUI, if I am in the new "Coming soon" one it does not work.</p>

            I tried the new interface (coming soon). When I click on calendars, I get no calendar data. The screen view stays as if I was viewing emails. If I go to files lists, I can click on calendars as see my monthly data, or other views. If I switch back and
 turn off coming soon, calendars returns and works as normal.&nbsp;

<h3> dgar1113  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 15.21.1 and EndNote</h2>
                    <p>The upgrade to Word 15.21.1 caused EndNote Cite While You Write to fail. Whenever I hit the "EndNote X7" tab now, Word immediately crashes. This happens on two different Macs and in different Word files, so it is not specific to either Mac or to a single
 file. Both Macs run the latest version of "El Capitan". Prior to version 15.21.1, there was no problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Support at Thompson Reuters suggested I downgrade to an earlier version of Word as a workaround. Can anyone tell me where the downgrade to previous version files are found?</p>

            <p>You can do this if you've been running Time Machine. Here are the steps for Office 2011, the same concepts apply to 2016:&nbsp;<a href="https://machow2.com/how-to-roll-back-an-office-update-on-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Roll Back a Mac Office Update</a></p>

uninstall</a>&nbsp;then reinstall, then download inidividual updaters (i.e. Google&nbsp;<strong>download Office 15.19 updater</strong>)&nbsp;and install them manually, stopping at 15.20 (15.21.0 does not seem to be available).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using Office 365, I'm pretty sure you're stuck. I don't know of any way to access earlier versions.</p>

            Thanks very much, John. I was able to downgrade to Word 15.20 using Time Machine even though I am using Office 365. It immediately solved to problem in both Macs. Something in Word 15.21.1 caused the problem, evidently. Here's hoping that the next release
 fixes this.

            <p>No offense :-) but you've got the cart before the horse. The main application program [i.e., Word] will continue to undergo updates, revisions, etc. It's up to the 3rd party developers [e.g., Thomson Reuters] who produce the add-ins to keep up. They are
 provided (usually) with adequate lead time by major developers such as Microsoft in order to make the necessary updates to their products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite frankly, IMHO, the suggestion from Thomson Reuters to "downgrade" was wholly irresponsible. What they told you, in effect, is "We haven't been able to get our product right yet." :-)</p>

<h2>            Cortana</h2>
                    <p>I saw all the buzz about Cortana on this site. Well, I took a look at almost all the questions and answers, but I am still hazy about this thing- the Microsoft team says that Cortana is available on all phones with OS 8.1. So does that mean all phones starting
 right with Lumia 520 with OS 8.1 will come with Cortana?</p>
<p>Also please tell me whether Cortana is being released in India, and if yes,&nbsp;then when?</p>

            <p>Howdy Shashwat Kumar,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Support forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OS version requirements differ depending on the region so as long as you have a Windows Phone running an OS version that meets the requirements and has the correct settings, you should see Cortana in the app list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana is available in India in an "alpha" state which means some functionality and polish may not be present. You can actually find information on what is available where, the requirements for them, and how to ensure you have the correct settings here:

            Hi maximetromp, try resetting your PC from within the Windows Recovery Environment, it is often more successful and no running program will stop it form there . . .
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>Hi all, got my brand new Lumia 535 today and only just got some music on it. tried listening to it through my heaphones only to discover that they cut-out after about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>My headset it a Tritton Kunai Titanfall edition - I know it is not the headphones as they work on my Acer E15-511,&nbsp;my Xbox 360&nbsp;and my old Lumia 620.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this problem and/or know how to fix it?</p>

<p>Hi REJANAMIT,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I need to explain that:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Limited Access permission level is unusual. It enables a user or group to browse to a site page or library to access a specific content item. Typically, the user was given access to a single item in a list or library, but does not have permission to open
 or edit any other items in the library. The Limited Access permission level includes all the permissions that the user must have to access the required item.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You cannot assign Limited Access permission level directly to a user or group. Instead, you assign appropriate permission to the single item, and then SharePoint automatically assigns Limited Access to other required locations.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In this situation, if the site admin gives the user a specific permission(e.g. Full Control, Edit, Contribute, Read, View Only) for other required locations, it would override the Limited Access permission.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Moreover, if the site owners has limited access permission for the site and has no permission for a library , you may let the global admin grant the owners Full Control permissions for the library. Then the owners can manage the files of the library. To do
 that:<br />
Open the library&gt;Under LIBRARY button, click Library Settings&gt; Under Permissions and Management, click Permissions for this document library&gt;Click Grant Permissions, input the users' email addresses and select Full Control permission, and then click Share.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If anything is misunderstood, you may share the site owners' permissions for the site and the library with us for further investigation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.To check the owner's permissions for the site: Go to the site, and click the gear on the upper right corner&gt;Site settings&gt;Under Users and Permissions, click Site permissions&gt;Under PERMISSIONS, click Check Permissions&gt; Input the user's name and click Check
 Now.<br />
2.To check the owner's permissions for the library: Open the library&gt;Under LIBRARY button, click Library Settings&gt; Under Permissions and Management, click Permissions for this document library&gt;Under PERMISSIONS, click Check Permissions&gt; Input the user's name
 and click Check Now.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: To upload screenshots, you can click Use rich formatting in the forum and then click the icon of Insert/Edit Media.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks,<br />
Felix</p>

    <title>OneNote 2010 Cache Maintenance &#40;Garbage Collection&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tjh-nyc  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2010 Cache Maintenance &#40;Garbage Collection&#41;</h2>
                    I'm trying to understand a bit about how OneNote 2010 maintains its cache. I understand that garbage collection runs only when the workstation has been idle for a specified time (configurable in Options &gt; Save &amp; Backup) or when the user forces a manual
 operation by clicking "Optimize all Files Now" (found in the same dialog). I'm assuming that garbage collection does the following:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Compacts the OneNoteOfflineCache.onecache file to reclaim space used by deleted content and now-closed notebooks<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Removes any unused files from the OneNoteOfflineCache_Files directory<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; But does <span style="font-style: italic">NOT</span> touch anything in the Backup directory, not even backups of closed notebooks<br />
<br />
In other words, the user is responsible for maintaining the Backup directory. I see a potential problem here in an environment where a large number of notebooks are opened and closed on a frequent basis; the backups will tend to pile up. So if the workstation
 is being backed up by some other reliable process, perhaps it's a good practice to turn off OneNote's own backups?<br />
<br />
Or, perhaps a script could be scheduled to delete backups older than a certain number of days? But this would I think delete backups of notebooks that were still open but had not changed; ON seems to create a backup only if there has been a change to the notebook.<br />
<br />
If anyone has addressed this issue, I'd be grateful for your comments.<br />

            You could write an addin that you can use to close notebooks and use your code to call CloseNotebook and then delete any backups at that point.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But I usually just leave the default settings in place and let the backups build up.&nbsp; I don't close notebooks very often, though, since there is always some data in each notebook I eventually am going to need again...<br />

            <p>Thank you for your prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is this:</p>
<p>When I first installed the preview (a few days ago) it had what you state. I had it set for FAST.&nbsp; It then automatically installed an update the next AM and that damaged my display system&nbsp;(I have other posts about that).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I rolled the update back and since then I do not have the option in "Advanced options" to address Fast v. Slow.&nbsp; That is completely gone. Also there is no mention of updates to the preview at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition the display problem remains.&nbsp; I can only use two of my four monitors on this AMD 7800 adapter with 6 DP outputs now.&nbsp; I have reinstalled the AMD software and that does not help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note that I have 6 Network adapters listed.&nbsp; One is the Intel Ethernet adapter, Two are Bluetooth,&nbsp; Two are VMware Virtual, and one is Blackberry VPN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if I should try to re-install the preview again.&nbsp; Would it still keep my 70 or so installed applications or would it wipe the whole thing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>The issue being referred to is Known and applies to AMD GPU's, the issue causes Edge (Spartan) to crash.</p>
<p>Gabe also posted on Twitter that AMD has released new drivers.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is a fix for the AMD GPU issue or not.</p>

<h2>            Please verify your account to help us stop spammers.</h2>
                    Just signed up to outlook and have tried to reply back to an email without success. Takes me to a different screen where you are supposed to see an image and put in your phone number to confirm you are not a spammer. First of all there is no image and
 secondly you can't even put in your phone number. I am using a Macbook pro and running Yosemite. Any ideas what to do, otherwise I will just have to close account and use another provider.

            <p>Hi Jestina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply but unfortunately this hasn't helped me. I am running on a mac computer and I think Outlook has a problem on the new operating system? I am receiving email but can't send out a reply because Outlook is not allowing me to verify my account.
 There is no image and I can't type in my phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately Outlook has lost my confidence at the first hurdle and you shouldn't have these issues. I have now switched to a gmail account which is working perfectly with no issues sending or receiving email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its great to have security but it looks like Outlook has a bit of work to do! Sorry but for this reason, I have deleted my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the clarification.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I now understand you mean to create a “This computer only” Task. As I know, there isn’t an option to make an email become a Task by default. We need to customize a
<strong>Quick Step</strong> to achieve that. So please confirm some information below for our better understanding:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Where did you download the Outlook 2016 client?</span></p>
<p><span>2. The detailed version of your Outlook 2016 such as Outlook 2016 16.0.6001.1078. To get it: Click
<strong>File</strong> &gt;<strong> Office Account</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. The detailed steps about how you customize the Quick Step to make an email become a Task.</span></p>

            <p>Barry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you but "NO." &nbsp;My problem specifically has to do with email certificates of people sending me email. &nbsp;I cannot send them encrypted email because Outlook recognizes a problem with their certificate. &nbsp;Particularly it see the email as all lower case and
 the certificate agent entered the email address common name in all CAPS. &nbsp;According to RFC-822, this should not matter but Outlook is case sensitive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, I realize the article I referenced deals with Outlook installed on Windows systems and I am needing the same solution for a MAC environment.</p>
<p>

<h2>            No pdf preview in outlook mail</h2>
                    I lost the ability to preview my pdf attachments since I got Windows 10 home. I do have outlook mail (hotmail) account and when I use Firefox there is no pdf preview available of attachments. I do have Adobe Acrobat Reader DC but there is no way to make
 outlook mail show the content of pdf file. Clicking, right clicking and choosing preview makes no difference - no preview at all. I do not have the same problem with office or excel files. How can I fix it

            <p>Consumer adoption rates will probably be high due to the Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Business adoption rates will be very slow, but that's normal for any new OS version, but I think in this case it will have businesses sticking with Windows 7 like they did with XP until either Microsoft once again creates a desktop-centric OS with none of
 the consumer nonsense that Windows 10 is stuffed to the gills with "a few minutes ago".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again they may want to hedge their bets for a post-Microsoft future since Microsoft shows NO signs of being the least bit interested in creating a business friendly OS for the past 3 years - judging from their actions, not from their marketing brochures.</p>

<p>IBM&nbsp;basically shelved&nbsp;OS/2, but before they did that,&nbsp;Serenity Systems did&nbsp;acquire&nbsp;a license to re-market OS/2 as eComStation.&nbsp;Serenity Systems has&nbsp;since made numerous improvements to the OS/2 code base&nbsp;thus giving it much better support on modern hardware.
 I'm sure IBM could easily&nbsp;do the same if they wanted to. In the meantime, it may not hurt to have another look see&nbsp;and download the demo at:</p>

            <p>Continued…</p>
<p><em>Next we heard in the background a loud OH SHOOT! with a Canadian British accent, followed by a flash and a new image on the big screen.</em><br />
<em>“Cheers boys and girls” said Lefty to his mates raising his glass of Molson Golden. “Another round here,” he yelled to the barmaid.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The words no sooner left his mouth when in walk four guys up to the bar wearing Guy Fawkes masks.<br />
The checked for surveillance cameras, but Hwrx had already turned them off when he was in the bars router, before lifting the masks and it turns out to be Hula_Baloo, CrazyKats , FredWilson_905, and Techie007L. Lefty told them the story of the three guys walking
 into a bar,…the fourth one ducked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They had heard about our banishment dilemma, missed us in the forums, and Michigan Mary had told them of our plans for going up north They figured that a Houters would be the first place to look.<br />
The wanted to see how we were holding up in all this and also at the same time check out colakid to find out what his “deal” really is. We told them the story of the day and we all had a few Molson’s and laughed at everyone’s role in the adventure and resulting
 melee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Colakid regaled us with the story of his ankle bracelet and of his adventures in the Canadian houscow, and with the RCMP, the chase and almost being trampled by horses and being kicked and splattered by horse dung during the event. He told us about being
 held in jail on the group W bench, and of all of the police reports with the thirty seven eight-by-ten color glossy photographs with circles&nbsp; and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each was and all of that explanation came complete
 with full orchestration and three part harmony. He really cracked us up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later they pooled their money and talked the new arrivals into going over to the RCMP headquarters, sans masks, and bail out the jailed protesters as it was in part their fault that they were there. After a few beers it seemed like a good idea. They all
 met up back at the Houters and had a grand old time, talking about politics, computers, cars, baseball, women and music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Guy Fawkes guys had also managed to get colakid released from house arrest, by claiming to be his uncles. We got our bail money back, and he could leave town for now and come back and pay the fine later, after he sold some more cedar mulch to raise the
 money. The Guy Fawkes group said that they would love to stay and participate in the mischief and mayhem that would result in our extended exile, but they were headed cross country to Burning Man in August and had many stops along the way to make. They for
 sure wanted to catch a Blue Bombers game in Winnipeg, take a boat cruise on the Red River, check out the much acclaimed largest buffalo monument in Jamestown, the Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota near the town of Berne, the rumored home
 town of once famous Rocky Raccoon, on the way to the left coast. We parted and wished each other happy trails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as it turned out, colakid was vacationing in Montreal at the time, and practicing his French, (fenêtres suce) so we gave him a ride the three hours or so back to Kingston which was on our way back to Lake of the Woods. We got him to his home town, enrolled
 him in a local twelve step program (All Addictions Anonymous), spoke with his mother, and wished him well. Then we were on our way the 1200 miles back to where we planned to rent a couple of cabins and spend the rest of the month fishing for walleyes, reading,
 boating, taking in the sites, and hiking the local trails. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd8ec19a-65e2-4bc7-be3e-059b89a37140" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Lefty was reading No Place to Hide, and the others books like “Programming Windows Store Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript”, “Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction”, “Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware
 and Software (Developer Best Practices)”, “Unreasonable Men: Theodore Roosevelt and the Republican Rebels Who Created Progressive Politics” “Tom Clancy Full Force and Effect” and “Fifty Shades of Grey”. They occasionally watched movies, Ferris Buellers Day
 Off, Citizen Four, Deadwood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They hacked a Hughes satellite connection to get the news of the outside world, without the NSA participating. They had already turned off all their cells phones and put them in the refrigerator in the cabin, and shut off the GPS in the van. Online they
 had discovered an fundraising effort on their behalf had raised $20k on fundly.com to expense their month long exile, so they were set for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They would catch some nice Walleyes, Perch, and filet them. They would fry up some bacon and onions over the campfire in a cast iron pan and put that in a slice of bread for an appetizer while frying the fish in the bacon and onion grease in the pan. They
 would go to town to stock up on Molson, bread, milk, eggs, cereal, night crawlers, leeches, and fudge striped cookies.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They rented a 21 foot pontoon house boat and would cruise the lake and around the islands sometimes stopping for shore lunch. The lake was over 70 miles long and wide, making it the sixth largest freshwater lake after the five Great Lakes, the cabin owner
 had told them. They would be careful to stay away from the American side of the lake but would see large numbers of American white pelicans many nesting pairs of bald eagles. The boat had a grill on it so they would grill up some burgers, brats and hot dogs
 for meals. Sometimes some sweet corn as well.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f06eac7-3eea-4785-adfd-8d3d6fd4d7ac" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They usually fished from 6 to 10 am and from 6 to 10 pm, as these we good quiet times without recreational boats and jet skis on the lake. When the bait shop in town was closed they could buy night crawlers and leeches, Lefty’s Walleye bait of choice, from
 the vending machine outside of it. If they put the caught fish on a stringer in the water, the Muskies would come and eat them, so the fish needed to stay in a cooler with the beer. At night they would sometimes catch a ballgame on the radio while fishing.<br />
They would stay in touch with their families over this time by sending encrypted text messages via a laptop modem and acoustic coupler from the pay phone outside the bait shop. They would also occasionally send PGP encrypted emails via the TOR network and the
 satellite connection but thought it to be a bit risky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They would see an occasional drone get too close to the cabins, Lefty would blast out of the sky with his shotgun. They used the drone cameras to setup a video surveillance system around the cabins<br />
They bought their fuel at the local marina, being careful to always pay cash. The marina also sold dry goods, beverages, and snacks with a gift shop of trinkets with Lake of the Woods on them and t-shirts with sayings like “If a man speaks and there is no woman
 around to here, is he still wrong?”</p>
<p>
</p><p>They did some tourist stuff, viewing the rocks and cliffs around Lake of the Woods that were dotted with 5000 year old rock paintings made of berry juice and sap painted by various aboriginal groups. These are considered sacred sites, to be treated with
 great respect, and an offering needed to be made when visited, like tobacco or some other meaningful item. We left a Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit DVD disc.<br />

<p>
</p><p>They visited the Railway Museum that takes you back to the time of the steam engine in the form of the fully restored 4008 steam locomotive. The Tomahawk Lighthouse built in the 1900’s, and the Kay-Nah-Chi-Wah-Nung Historical Center, a 7000 year trip back
 in time including burial mounds and interpretative center.</p>

</p><p>Within a week or so NC received an email via the TOR network with a public PGP key and asking for his. So they exchanged keys and before long an encrypted email arrived talking about how he had heard about our banishment and exile and how this word has spread
 far and wide across the internets.<br />
The email was from the Brad Wardell - President/CEO of Stardock and he had a proposal for NC and his team of exiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He was interested in funding a skunk works project, to produce software packages to fix Windows 10 with Start10 an upgrade and expansion of their existing Start8 product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start8 he explained, returned the familiar start menu to the Windows 8 operating system. The program allows users to switch between three menu styles and allows them to customize the menu such as by changing the icon, the color, or the items which are displayed
 on its right side. Start8 also added other improvements to the Windows 8 desktop such as disabling the charms bar, hot corners and booting directly to the desktop instead of to the start screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with their limited Internet access, the group could see that the initial launch of Win10 had been a disaster, and unknowingly updated and bricked millions of computer’s worldwide. Users felt tricked into installing and damaging their computers and betrayed
 by all the advertising. The press had been brutal with horrid press reports of this disaster dropping MS stock price into the single digits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The press reviews read like the following, <em>Vista, win8 and now this. It is looking like three strikes for the company with a near monopoly 1.2 billion user market. The company’s software store is filled with low quality and poor performing apps, which
 seemingly underwent no vetting process at all. The OneDrive is unreliable in availability, and dubious in security. The voice assistant Cortana misunderstands language at an alarming rate to the point of being unusable, and has very few abilities at this point.
 The Skype app is of lower quality than the existing available software. There is also a continued nagging throughout operation of this OS about logging in with a Microsoft account.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The press even got technical, <em>the new OS is devoid of metaphor, the interactive elements do not have any visual treatment that indicates they are "buttons. The UI simply assumes the user knows that certain parts of the UI will react to interaction, and
 certain parts will not. It is devoid of other contextual clues to inform the user of which is which. Clicking or tapping on the Internet Explorer icon for example within a large tile in the Start Screen will launch Internet Explorer. This tile is devoid of&nbsp;
 beveling, texture, gradients, or anything else that might make it look like a real-world object.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Brad Wardell shared his vision for the new product, they had developed a Start10 beta product in house, but he was looking for something more. No one else was to know about this, and we would be working directly for him. In his view the new OS had been dumbed
 down for first time users and the code dumbed down for first time developers. This left experienced users and developers with another downgrade from Windows 7, just like MS had done with Win8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>“I don't think flat minimalism is the right answer. You can have minimalist skeuomorphism and still make something look like a real-world button so that the user immediately knows it's to be interacted with. They can be designed in a minimalist manner, and
 so you end up with a minimalist skeuomorphic design.” He also said that he didn’t think that removing configuration and customization from the user is a valid marketing or technical choice, and his company has been in business doing the opposite for some 20
 years now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He wanted to know if he could fly up from his headquarters in Plymouth, MI to their cabins on his float plane and have a meeting with the group. They setup the meeting for the following week, and he fleshed out the details further then.</p>

    <title>Snap to not working in Publisher 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephpadavano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snap to not working in Publisher 2013</h2>
                    I have Publisher 2013 as part of Office on my Lenovo Yoga 3 11 running Windows 10.&nbsp; I am unable to snap objects to anything. I don't even get the pink alignment guides when two objects align as one is being moved. Objects won't snap to margins, guides,
 ruler marks, or each other.&nbsp; I have checked and unchecked and rechecked the "Align To" boxes in the ribbon under Page Design.&nbsp; I have also added the "Snap to Ruler Marks" command to the Quick Access bar and checked and unchecked that.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; I have also
 tried a Quick Repair to Office, again with no luck.&nbsp; The snap to and guides work fine in Powerpoint, but not in Publisher.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

            I followed the instructions and started Publisher in Safe mode.&nbsp; There were no add-ins, so none to enable/disable.&nbsp; I closed, restarted normally, and unfortunately there is no change.

            <p>I don't get the same 'snap to' effect with Pub 2013 that I did with Pub 2007 and older. Try going to View &gt; check Boundaries. Zoom in to 100% scale on the page. Now drag and move your objects around and you will likely see the pink lines as you drag objects
 into alignment with other objects. The object no longer just snaps to alignment with the other object boundary.</p>

    <title>QAT shortcuts stopped running macros from closed workbooks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tsdn2  say:</h3>
<h2>            QAT shortcuts stopped running macros from closed workbooks</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of shortcut buttons on my Quick Access Toolbar in Excel that are linked to macros in various workbooks.</p>
<p>Up until 2-3 days ago, these buttons worked OK (i.e. called the macro procedure they were linked to) regardless of whether the workbook that the macro is in was open or closed.</p>
<p>Now however, it seems that the buttons only work when the workbook with the macro is currently open.</p>
<p>If the workbook is closed, this error message pops up: "Cannot run the macro "&lt;workbook path&gt;!&lt;macro name&gt;. The macro may not be available in this workbook or all macros may be disabled."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Trust Center Settings / Macro Settings I have the "Disable all macros with notification" options selected, but that was always the case. Furthermore, if I change it to "Enable all macros" it does not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I observe the same problem when I place my macro shortcut on Excel's Ribbon. However, I cannot verify whether it was working OK before as I always kept my macro shortcuts on QAT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reproduce the issue:</p>
<p>1. Open new workbook.</p>
<p>2. In VB editor (F11), add new module with a short procedure, i.e.:</p>
<p>Sub SayHi()</p>
<p>MsgBox "Hi!"</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>3. Save the workbook as a macro-enabled type (".xlsm")</p>
<p>4. Create a shortcut to "SayHi" macro on QAT.</p>
<p>5. Press the shortcut button (it should work OK, i.e. a pop-up message saying "Hi!" should appear)</p>
<p>6. Close the workbook and press the shortcut button again (here the error message pops up)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using:</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel for Office 365 MSO (16.0.11727.20036) 64-bit</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise 10.0.17763 Build 17763</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are number of people in my team with the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Proposal&#58; Should Microsoft buy RemixOS&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjcastaneda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Proposal&#58; Should Microsoft buy RemixOS&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I love my 640, it runs fast, charges fast, the battery lasts long time, it rarely freezes, the camera is decent, the price was GREAT (could not get a matching Android and much less iPhone for the price I got this one for)...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>List goes on, however, it is no secret that Windows Phone's problem isn't the phone itself, nor the OS, but the ridiculous and abismal lack of apps (and good apps). The list of lacking apps is too great to name here, but notable apps would be Amazon Prime,
 Pokémon Go, and Snapchat, to name a few. And many existing apps, such as Evernote, the Bible app,&nbsp;and Facebook Messenger, absolutely suck.</p>
<p>The UWP idea is a great one, but not many developers are taking opportunity of this and when I write to the developers they always say they don't have a big market and it's not worth making a WP app...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, instead of acting insane and trying to fix an unfixable problem... what if Microsoft buys Jide, the company behind Remix OS. Remix OS (ROS) is geared to be used like a computer, a lot of emphasis on Office (and games). Couldn't Microsoft create a phone
 version of ROS, and just like Amazon and Fire OS, have their own "Windows Store" with access to millions of Android-compatible apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would fix SO much trouble! We would continue to be buying Microsoft devices and not having to go back to dreadful android devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please? Will you buy Remix OS or come up with a feasible solution to the app problem?</p>
