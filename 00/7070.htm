            The 6700 has an ambient light sensor so the keypad won't light up unless it's actually dark. I'm sure your problem is actually more complicated but it's worth eliminating the obvious things first.

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. These options are independent and can be executed in any sequence. Do let me know if these don't work for you. If not, I will provide further troubleshooting steps to you to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />4. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />5. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>

<h2>            One drive - the user name or password for OneDrive - customer name isn&#39;t correct.  Please try again</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone seen this message?&nbsp; It didn't appear until recently.&nbsp; A sampling of the &gt;1000 users shows every workstation has this issue.</p>
<p>We already have done the following steps:</p>
<p>Clear cached credentials</p>
<p>Run a Office repair</p>
<p>Create a new Windows profile</p>
<p>Reinstall Office</p>
<p>
Across the top of the document is a yellow bar that says - Upload failed You are required to sign in to upload your changes to this location. Have seen it in both Word and Excel.<br />
<br />
They click Sign In and enter their email and password and then it saves.
</p><p>
</p><p>We opened an incident and MSFT gave us a powershell script to run under the users' profile as a workaround.&nbsp; I think the script signs out and signs back in again.&nbsp; The script has to run again after reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office apps are stable. We just can’t access OneDrive directly from the app. I click sign in, enter my e-mail and password and it tells me that my creds are incorrect. Same for Word and PowerPoint. We have observed this behavior on every computer and
 user that we sampled. We can access OneDrive directly and files are synchronizing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow the cache credentials being used by the office applications is getting corrupted or is not being used properly.&nbsp; By using the powershell script to sign out and sign back in, it allows the OneDrive to work.&nbsp; Upon reboot, it reverts back to the same
 issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was all working wonderfully prior to this week.&nbsp; We have tested using Word 1810 (latest version) without a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this issue?</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Let's try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode: Right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar and select Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. Type in taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe to terminate any OneDrive processes and hit Enter. 
<br />Then type in either %SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10 or %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10 and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />After that Go to RegEdit on this path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include OneDrive numeric version 
<br />and from the Account, folders directory remove all the folders inside 
<br />
<br />After that restart the pc and install One Drive latest version from this link:

<p>Hi, I have a HTC Touch Dual running Microsoft Mobile 6, connected to my exchange server,&nbsp;a pop3 e-mail account and my hotmail account. The problem is that&nbsp;the device&nbsp;displays "notification" at the bottom right hand side of the screen(where calendar
 is normally displayed) as well as "abc" in the title bar at the top next to start even when I've checked and read all messages (if there are messages then it does display them). When I tap on any of the two it opens a blank notification. Does anyone have any
 ideas why this hapens or how to get rid of it.</p>

<p>No fix, but I have the same device, same problem and I've been able to identify some workarounds.&nbsp; Although it seems innocuous, the notification does not clear, so you won't see any of the notifications that are queued up behind it.&nbsp; The problem is somehow
 related to how the device handles the lock.&nbsp; Two ways to clear it that I've discovered are to either go to Settings-Personal and click on Lock, then Menu-Cancel, or create a new or reply message (doesn't matter whether it is SMS or Exchange), then cancel.&nbsp;
 Magically, the blank notification is cleared (until the next time your device locks).&nbsp; I've also heard that changing the input method clears it, but I've not tried that - seems less convenient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sure hope that HTC comes up with a fix for it soon as it is super annoying!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone knows more about this, please add your knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Problems with images when converting Publisher file to PDF</h2>
                    <p>When I try to export my publisher file to a PDF ready for commercial printing, it shows all the images I have edited in some way in a variation of their original form. For example, if I have put a shadow round the image, it displays it in the PDF with a
 white outline, then a crude pixelated form of the shadow. If I have cropped an image then given it a soft edge, the original shape of the image appears in white around it.</p>
<p>I did a very similar brochure last year with none of these problems.</p>

            <p>You might want to try compressing your images before you create your PDF. This will eliminate many of the artifacts from editing your images within Publisher. Be sure to have copies of the original picture as this will permanently alter the embedded images.</p>

    <title>Shared Computer Activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gbmichael28  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared Computer Activation</h2>
                    <p>We use Office 365 ProPlus (Apps Only). &nbsp;We have a collection of Shared Computers that have office on them. &nbsp;Our Doctors move from site to site. &nbsp;They are continually being asked for activation. &nbsp;Since we are not using Office 365 Services, we have assigned
 a license to each of the shared computer. &nbsp;That license is only on that computer. &nbsp;We activate it. &nbsp;The token files appear in the directory. &nbsp;I know the shared activation is present (it is in the registry, and the configuration.xml file we used for install
 set it). &nbsp;It also shows that it is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, the next day our doctor shows up, logs in, and is prompted to activate. &nbsp;All of the activation data is missing, and it is as if a new copy of office was installed. &nbsp;I thought the entire point of shared activation was to allow Multiple users
 to share a computer. &nbsp;We have far more users than computers (50% of the Doctors are off at any given time). &nbsp;It isn't practical to pre-activate 60-70 doctors on 32 computers (since we can't have their passwords due to privacy laws and what they can access
 with their id's).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So am I missing the point of shared activation? &nbsp;Reading the help and support info, I don't think so. &nbsp;I read that activation windows may re-appear, but it is listed specific criteria when that might happen. &nbsp;This isn't the case here. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I keep activation from constantly re-appearing everytime a new user logs into the machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to get a computer activated so that it no longer prompts the users to activate? &nbsp;Or at least has the credentials saved so that they can just click the activate button when it appears?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to hearing your answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, I have a VtaskPro program that will open an app (Excel), open the activation window, populate the username and password, and activate. &nbsp;It does a database lookup to match the computer name to the record in a SQL database with the username and
 password used to activate the workstation. &nbsp;I am hoping I don't need to use that if we can fix this. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Greg,<br />
<br />
Normally, after Office installed, user can activate Office in the first time he sign in with his work account. Then Office will
<strong>keep activate for some time</strong> even the user sign out his account.<br />
<strong>Shared Computer Activation</strong> will be enabled during the installation of Office 365 ProPlus using the Office Deployment Tool. Once enabled, Office installs without being activated. When a user signs in to a computer with Office installed via Share
 Computer Activation, Office will check to see if the user has Office 365 ProPlus
<strong>license</strong> and <strong>temporary activate</strong> Office 365 ProPlus
<strong>until that user logs out</strong>. If a second user<strong> signs in to the same computer</strong>, the activation does not persist from the first user and
<strong>process is repeated</strong>, the second user need to sign in to activate Office again.<br />
<br />
It’s important to<strong> note </strong>that user must use their <strong>own license</strong>&nbsp;to use Office 365. It's
<strong>not legal</strong> to let users use the Office suite which is activated with others' Office 365 account. So deploying Office 365 ProPlus using shared computer activation need to activate each time, then they can connect to the users own files and customization
 settings.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For your reference:<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda

            <p>Thank you for the information Linda.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It&nbsp;stinks.&nbsp; But what are you going to do.&nbsp; I guess we misunderstood the app only license agreement.&nbsp; We knew with Apps and Services you needed a license for every user.&nbsp; When you read the shared activation pre-sales document, it describes to a tee our scenario
 (except with Nurses instead of doctors).&nbsp; I don't remember (but I can be wrong) there being a mention of requiring a license per user in that fashion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like we are going to make some changes and purchase more licenses.&nbsp; Or more likely, we'll shelve all of these licenses until next year and just not renew.&nbsp; Except Outlook, we can do everything we want with LibreOffice for free.&nbsp; It was only for Ourlook
 that we even wanted this, but thought it would be a nice benefit&nbsp;to offer the use of office on the once or twice a year our doctors would use it.&nbsp; Otherwise it's a giant waste of money.&nbsp; We don't use the services, just the programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The OWA Client for our
 In House Exchange 2016 is nice, but we use Public Folders extensively, and the newer OWA does a horrendous job with public folders (Making you select them as favorites one at a time, and making it so you cannot even create a tree structure you can open or
 close to get it out of the way).&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Shared mailboxes not showing emails from specific senders, but are there on OWA</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a really odd problem, across 2 different tenants. We have a number of shared mailboxes which we have across various employees, this is done through providing full mailbox permissions in Exchange so the mailbox automatically adds itself into the users
 desktop Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has worked well for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've now found on a couple of these mailbox an issue where emails from a specific sender do not show up in desktop Outlook. The only way to know they exist is the unread message indicator has a number but Outlook doesn't have any to show. However if we
 go into OWA and it shows there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one mailbox it is all emails from one internal user, on another mailbox it is emails from one external customer. There doesn't seem to be anything unusual or fancy about emails from these senders. The internal user is set up the same as everyone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you forward the problem email out from OWA to a regular user mailbox it shows up fine in the user mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue affects all people accessing the shared mailbox through Outlook. Creating a new Outlook profile does not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is obviously a major issue as a business we cannot afford to 'lose' emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in touch with 365 support technicians, but no success so far. I don't know whether to try and get this escalated as the issue is undermining the trust in Outlook desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Stephen.</p>

    <title>6086 Vista Bluetooth Blues... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sodthrower  say:</h3>
<h2>            6086 Vista Bluetooth Blues...</h2>
                    Can seem to get Nokia PC suite v7.0.8.2 to connect to 6086. I have a Compaq V6000 series laptop with an IOgear Bluetooth USB 2.0 adapter.<br />
<br />
In Vista from the WIDCOMM My Bluetooth Places, I have been able to pair the phone to the PC, and it shows "Connected (COM5)" in Vista, then when I go to Nokia PC Suite and try and connect to a bluetooth phone(my 6086 which has blue tooth on and discoverable)
 I get the error message, "Cannot use the connection type. Check that all the the needed hardware, software and drivers are available."<br />
<br />
Any body have any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            two things to make sure of with vista:<br />
1- that you are logged in as administrator.<br />
2- WIDCOMM Bluetooth stack, driver version 6.x, is installed, if not update your drivers.

            You rock and hit it dead on...:D<br />
<br />
Something screwed up with my Nokia registration and I had to register a 2nd time just to reply...<br />
<br />
1. I was logged in as Admin so this wasn't it<br />
2. The drivers revision was the problem...I had v5.x and you were correct about needing 6.x<br />
<br />
Interesting part was finding them...<br />
My USB bluetooth supplier (IOGear) did not have them but by looking at the installed drivers I could see that a Broadcom chipset was being used...I found the new drivers (v6.0.1.6200) at Broadcom :<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.broadcom.com/products/bluetooth_update.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.broadcom.com/products/bluetooth_update.php</a><br />
<br />
followed the installation instructions<br />
- had to uninstall old drivers 1st, then install new ones<br />
- re-pair my 6086<br />
<br />
and everything instantly worked!<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for the advice...I had to come back and pass on the steps to success in the hopes of helping someone else.<br />

<h2>            Framerate Dropping</h2>
                    I have been trying to watch videos and play some games, but when I do the Graphics frame rate drops to nearly 1 frame per 10 seconds, to the point were the sounds choppyrobotic (don't know the proper term) but no internet browser helps the issue, so im
 wandering if its something Windows is causing<br />
<br />
P.S. im not sure if this is in the right area, but its the closest thing to my issue

<p>We apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have mentioned that your computer is 5 to 8 years old. in order to isolate if Graphic card is not causing the issue, I suggest you to connect the different latest Graphic card to your computer which is compatible
 with Windows 10 Technical Preview, and check if the issue persist.</p>

It's an older (5-7yr old) Dell Dimension&nbsp;computer with an AMD Processor 2.1GHz, 3G ram, no external video card (to my knowledge).&nbsp; Graphics drivers up to date. Video playback worked fine on previous OS.

    <title>N96 For World Travel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodeire---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N96 For World Travel</h2>
                    Hi, I have bought an N96 as im going travilling for a year and find the gps, camera and over package the best i could find.<br />
However i just read on the N96 specs that there are 3 models of the N96.<br />
<br />
# N96-1 (RM-247, Global) WCDMA2100/900 (HSDPA) / EGSM900, GSM850/1800/1900 MHz (EGPRS)<br />
# N96-3 (RM-472, Americas) – WCDMA1900/850 (HSDPA) / EGSM900, GSM850/1800/1900 MHz (EGPRS)<br />
# N96 (RM-297, PR China) - EGSM900, GSM850/1800/1900 MHz (EGPRS)<br />
# Automatic switching between bands and modes<br />
<br />
I think i have an N96-1, but how do i check? Also is the N96-1 compatabile with the every countries gsm and 3G networks?

            Basically there are two frequency ranges used for 3G. One is used in parts of Australia, in North America and parts of South America (the N96-3 covers this lot). The other is used everywhere else (except China, where there is no 3G anyway) and is covered
 by the N96-1.<br />

<h2>            6230i delete &#47; erase all data on the phone</h2>
                    Hello everybody,<br />
I would like to know or you can recommend me a method to erase / delete all my data on my phone. This is a device from my firm and get it already from someone else, who use this phone before and I must also delete the informations from the forerunner - that
 was not nice for me to must see all the pictures, contact, SMS, calendar or music (partly private stuff). That's because I look for some simple but effective (I do not want to do this item by item, or go to some service point and loose my time for this) way
 to delete all the entries so that the phone have only this in memory as on the day when it was buy.<br />
<br />
I try *#7780# but it brings nothing great, only the setting going reset.<br />
<br />
Please help<br />
<br />

            On old models like the 6230i there is no quick easy way to wipe it. As mentioned above only nokia care points can totally wipe it. The flashing equipment you will need to try the "dubious" methods will cost a lot more than what the phone is worth.<br />
<br />
All you can do is restore the factory settings then manually delete any left over personal info. It doesn't take long, just go through each menu and see if anything personal is left over. Information deleted from the phones memory cannot be recovered.<br />
<br />
Also if you have changed the security code you will have to set it back to the default code which is 12345.<br />

<h2>            Why won&#39;t outlook.com automatically refresh my inbox&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7, Firefox 18.0.1 (updated to most recent release).&nbsp; I tried to upgrade to the new outlook because I like the interface, but there is a big problem that caused me to move back to hotmail (at least for as long as I can).&nbsp; My incoming
 mail is not automatically recognized by outlook.com and I have to manually update the inbox to see new messages.&nbsp; I can't be spending all my time clicking over to the email window refreshing, so I can't use the new outlook until this issue if fixed.&nbsp; I did
 try clearing my cache but that did not work.&nbsp; I have not tested it on a different browser but firfox is listed as a supported browser by MS so I see no reason why I should have to switch in order to use this feature.&nbsp; Any ideas why it might be like this?

            That is strange, I am using Outlook.com on Firefox 18.01 and it automaitcally refreshes the inbox and changes the page/tab title to show the number of new messages in brackets. Try creating a new profile in Firefox to rule out any settings or add-ons.<br />

            Dan_hill your response made me realize that perhaps my adblock extension was somehow causing the problem.&nbsp; It didn't occur to me that add service and incoming mail may somehow be linked.&nbsp; After a little tinkering I realized that there was an item being
 blocked (@@||ads1.msads.net/adbar/products/091912_12/*) that was preventing the mail from properly updating.&nbsp; I added an exception for this item and now everything works as it should.&nbsp; For anyone else who runs into the problem I would recommend disabling script
 blocking add ons and tinkering with ad block add ons to resolve this problem.<br />

            <p>It's shame. I have the same problem and now understood that Microsoft browsers don't work well.</p>
<p>I did a test with IE11, MEdge and Google Chrom. I loaded outlook.com in all of them, sent email by my windows phone and the only browser refreshed automatically inbox and received the email few second later&nbsp;was Chrom. Browsing history in all browsers&nbsp;has
 been cleaned before the test. Please give me a solution, except using Google Chrom.</p>

            I too have had this problem, since maybe January 2015. I also use IE 11 and if I am in Outlook and an email is sent, it doesn't show unless I refresh the page or double click on the in-box. I tried Andreo's suggestion to Cindy, about 'optimizing the browser',
 but it didn't work. Any help for this? I haven't seen anything that solved this problem. I am&nbsp; accessing outlook from my home or work&nbsp;pc and neither one has been successful!

            I'm having a similar problem. Only my phone makes noise when I get an email. However, it's also the only one that isn't refreshing automatically. I don't think there's been an update because everything looks and acts the same as before.&nbsp;

 that there was an item being blocked (@@||ads1.msads.net/adbar/products/091912_12/*) that was preventing the mail from properly updating.&nbsp; I added an exception for this item and now everything works as it should.&nbsp; For anyone else who runs into the problem

<p>I&nbsp;had&nbsp;Microsoft office trial installed to my computer. It was due for renewal. I&nbsp;bought microsoft word Home and Student and intall it online since Monday 11/1/2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Installment did not go through, I&nbsp;called microsoft to see what could be the problem.&nbsp;The
 person whom I spoke to let me know that my computer had a lot of viruses and this was prevented the microsoft word to install.&nbsp;&nbsp; He charge me $169.99 to clean it up. He took over my computer from where he was located at and was on there 6:30am - 1:30 pm 11/2/2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Later that day he told me that somebody else will talk to me later who is more experience in that field. He gave me a case # 201011021499511.&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited until about 2 to 3 hours and no one called me back. I then call back and spoke to some else and he was
 working on it and had me on hold for about 1/2 hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; When he finally came back and told me that&nbsp; another person will be talking to me about installing it for me. That person was a lady who &nbsp;call me and went over everything with me regarding payment for the
 product and then&nbsp;tell me that another person will call me who is much higher withing the next 24 to 48 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far no one call me yet and I desperately want to finish what I am typing up on microsoft word.&nbsp;&nbsp; My grand-daughter was doing a project on microsoft
 word.&nbsp;&nbsp; She couldn't get to complete her project when the computer came off.&nbsp;&nbsp; She went to school without the&nbsp;homework and she got ding for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; She explain that the computer went off while she was working.&nbsp;&nbsp; So they decided to give her another day.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
 computer is still not fix.&nbsp; Today makes 3 days just waiting for the microsoft word to install.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyway to put a stop to this waiting? or can I just get my refund back?</p>

<div>As this is with Microsoft I can't provide any help getting that product installed but if your g-daughter really needs a word processor you can download and run the free Open Office from<a href="http://www.openoffice.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.openoffice.org</a>
 and use that to finish her reports.&nbsp; That word processor (Writer) will read, edit and write to Office files.&nbsp; Just make sure that she doesn't use the default save but conducts a Save As to a Word document.</div>

    <title>Why does Windows Host Processes cause my gaming PC to freeze seconds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> notinky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows Host Processes cause my gaming PC to freeze seconds after opening any Office program&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For 4 weeks or so, my Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming laptop with i7-7700HQ 2.80GHZ CPU and 16GB installed memory has been freezing every 45 minutes or so.&nbsp; I made sure my Windows and Office were up to date (Win 10, v.1803 &amp; Offce 365 Home), checked for malware
 (none, ran Dell's optimizer tool and updated all my drivers.&nbsp; I observed in the Task Manager that CTF Loader would randomly attempt to use 12 - 16 GB of memory, and since I don't use alternative text input (except in VR Home) I disabled CTF Loader.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That change seemed to allow me to work with Adobe software for longer periods, but Office, browsers, and VR all continued to crash.&nbsp; After further research, I have taken the following additional steps, and now VR , browsers, and Adobe software run fine,
 but opening any Microsoft Office program immediately causes Windows Host Processes to request more and more memory until the computer freezes (within 1 minute):</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting Windows Malware processes to weekly instead of automatic did not stop the issue.</li><li>Opening Office software in safe mode does not prevent the issue.</li><li>sfc scan shows no integrity issues.</li><li>A Clean Boot of the PC does not prevent the issue.</li></ul>
<p>I cannot even keep Office open long enough to check for another Office update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>After photographing the process details, I noted the file responsible for excessing CPU usage was taskhostw.exe, which can be part of a digital currency mining Trojan.&nbsp; The file appeared to be saved in the legitimate location and an additional malware scan
 did not reveal a problem, so I'm unsure if my file was a virus; however, I decided to Reset the computer and be done with it.&nbsp; A few hours later Resetting the computer appears to have eliminated the problem.</p>

<h2>            Data on a USB stick still accessible after removal of USB stick&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Data on a USB stick still accessible after removal of USB stick!<br />
Windows Vista 32-bit, Windows 8, Excel 2007</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a workbook on my pc, which accesses data stored in two separate workbooks, one on the main pc, and one on a USB stick. The formats and layouts of the data are the same, but the data (text) is different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data is accessed (for viewing, or editing and re-saving, of any selected item) without opening the data workbooks, i.e. by using a VLOOKUP + drive letter + filename.xlsx + sheet number + row number, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After removing the USB stick, obviously if I&nbsp;try to open the USB workbook I would&nbsp;get an error message, and if I'd tried via a Hyperlink I would have got a "Cannot open the specified file" error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I can still cycle through (read) all the USB data. I even tried closing and re-opening the pc workbook. I have not opened or downloaded the USB workbook. And there is no Drive F, G, H, or whatever to Look Up.
<strong>So how is this possible?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS I've copied both sets of formulas to a blank area of a sheet and as you cycle through the numbers you can still see both sets of information : the common item number, the common row number, the two respective titles, the two respective character counts,
 the two respective sets of data, etc.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand your issue, I would like to know on which Windows version this issue occurs (Windows Vista or Windows 8)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure there are no instances of Excel running in Task Manager.</p>
<p>Right click on the <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Taskbar</span> and go to
Excel.exe</span> process is running in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Process</span> tab. If running, right click on it and then click
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, then you may try restarting the computer and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also ensure there are no files present in the <span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Startup</font></span> folder.</p>
<p>Let us clear all the files present in the following locations:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\XLStart</p>
<p>C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note:</font></span> Take a backup of files before deleting the files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestion provided is helpful.</p>

<p>There is only one instance of "XLSTART" - the one in the Office12 file folder (nothing under Roaming).</p>

<p>I had noticed that the pc workbook file has increased in size from 298K to 401K since 5 days ago and put it down to adding/changing some&nbsp;VBA, but now I'm wondering if the usb workbook (156K) or its data, has somehow been embedded in the main workbook. Or
 if there's a 'ghost' H Drive somewhere. (I wouldn't have a clue how or if this could happen - I'm only a 'recreational' user and ageing rapidly!</p>

<p>FWIW I had a problem with the usb stick from a while ago, and all the folders 'disappeared'. They are still there, but you have to type the folder names in the search window, to see their files. Strangely though, you CAN see all the folders listed when the
 usb is plugged into the TV's usb socket.</p>
