<br />
I put MS Office 2010 on my pc, but didn't activate it because I wasn't ready to start a new learning curve (from my MS Office 2003). Now, I want to activate my MS Office 2010, but
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">cannot find the packaging or disc for the PRODUCT KEY</span>.

<p>Hello Ruwim.B,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello Charles Cavicchio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the Skype for Windows 10, you're signed in when the computer starts and even if the app itself isn't running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to set your expectation, Skype for Windows 10 has two parts: the visible app and in a background process called skypehost.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The background process keeps on running even if you exit the Skype app. With these, you will still be notified about incoming messages or calls. If you're on call, the call will continue even if you exit the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you prefer not be signed in automatically on Skype for Windows 10, you can sign out from within the app and you will not be automatically sign in after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps us. Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Office 2013 Language change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisa-s.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 Language change</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have following situation:</p>
<p>A couple of month ago I bought office 2013(Home and student).</p>
<p>During the download I made the mistake to pick Spanish as language (I really don't speak a word Spanish).</p>
<p>So I had a working Office but didn't understand anything. I got help from the Microsoft online support and a nice guy helped me to change the language in English. (I just have no idea how he did it.)</p>
<p>Now I had to reinstall my PC and all the files, downloads and stuff was deleted. (What is fine, because I had a backup, just not for ofice0.</p>
<p>Now I figured out, that I just can reinstall my Office. </p>
<p>The actual problem is, that I would have to reinstall it in Spanish again.</p>
<p>Now when I do this, how can I change the language of my Office programs into English?</p>
<p>Thanks for helping.</p>

            OK, since you have the local install it should be a little easier. <br />
<br />
You will have to download the chinese installation file from the following link, then uninstall current one using Method 1, then boot the computer 2 times before starting the install using the Chinese installation file.<br />

<p>Method 1 in this tip does a more thorough job that the "normal" uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 2 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete
 everything. It leaves configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries.</p>

<p>You should not put a formula in the cells of column D that refer to the same cells. That will be a circular reference with unexpected results.</p>
<p>Try this macro instead:</p>
<p>Sub leo()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; first_row = 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; last_row = Range("B" &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = first_row To last_row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Cells(i, "N") = "X" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(i, "D") = Cells(i, "D") * 0.75<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(i, "D") = Cells(i, "D") * 0.5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />
End Sub</p>

<h2>            Persistent OneDrive sign-in and upload problems - please help</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm trying to use OneDrive on Windows 8.1 and experiencing - like many others, as far as I can see - constant issues with regarding sign-in and sync. I'm using OneDrive with MS Office 2013, and almost all the relevant files are MS Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following problems crop up several times a day during normal use:</p>
<ul>
<li>When saving MS Word documents to my OneDrive folder, I get an error message reading 'Upload failed, sign in required'. When I click to sign-in, the document then saves and uploads, but the next time I try and save this or any other file the same thing happens
 again.</li><li>When opening MS Word documents from my OneDrive folder, I get a note in the bottom-right corner that this is an 'offline copy' because Word 'could not contact the server'. When I click the option to 're-open this document from the server', the document
 closes and then re-opens from the server without any problems - though the next time I try and open a file, exactly the same thing happens again</li><li>Seemingly because of all these sign-in and server sync problems, files in my OneDrive folder quickly become littered with exclamation marks warning of sync problems - most of them usually need to be re-opened and re-saved, and sometimes I have to open them
 on another device to check what versions are on the server, what versions are on my local computer, and which changes need to be kept.</li><li>The problem is definitely not with my internet connection - this occurs when I am online and all other web-based processes are running smoothly</li></ul>
<p>All of this is making OneDrive basically unworkable. I experienced some of these problems when I first started using OneDrive on Windows 8, but back then they were easily solved by right-clicking the icon and de-selecting '<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Use
 Office to sync files faster and work on files with other people at the same time'. With Windows 8.1, that option has disappeared. So far, I've tried the following and none have helped:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Running the OneDrive troubleshooter (which involved a full reset of OneDrive)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Deleting my stored Web and Windows credentials for 'login.live.com', 'MicrosoftAccount' and 'MicrosoftOffice15' (which have now been automatically recreated)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Navigating online to my Microsoft Account page to check if there was a problem with my sign-in details (there isn't)</span></li></ul>
<p>Would be grateful for suggestions, as this is now really damaging my productivity and if it goes on I will have to move over to Dropbox or even Google Docs. Many thanks in advance</p>

    <title>Ruler for OneNote 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ruler for OneNote 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a brand new Surface Pro that was a replacement for an old one with a blown pixel. I resubscribed to Office 365 as I use OneNote for work all the time (I'm a physics lecturer), however my new version of 2016 office doesn't have the ruler feature
 in OneNote! Which I used all the time on my old Surface. Apparently the office 365 is up to date so is there any reason why the ruler feature has disappeared in 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>OneNote 2016 </strong>never had a ruler.</p>
<p>You obviously confuse <strong>OneNote 2016 </strong>with the builtin app&nbsp;<strong>OneNote for Windows</strong> (simply called
<strong>OneNote, </strong>the one without the <strong>File </strong>menu) which has the ruler.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />

    <title>Word 2010&#58; Set numbering value without the paragraph style - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anywhere.i.roam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010&#58; Set numbering value without the paragraph style changing</h2>
                    In Word 2010 when I use the "Set numbering value" feature it (automatically and&nbsp;undesirably) changes the formatting/style applied to the paragraph. I don't want to change the formatting/style of my paragraph, I only want to change the numbering value which
 is why I clicked "Set numbering value" and not "set style" / "set font". I don't understand why Word makes simple things so hard.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I change the numbering level and reapply my formatting, it changes the numbering level back to the wrong value. I.e. I cannot get the desired result of the &nbsp;style/formatting I specified and the number value I specified.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The list is a 3rd level list, it's value is 5.1.2 that I want to change it to 5.1.1. This is being used as a continued heading, there is an item that is taking up more than one page that has a heading at the beginning and I'd like to repeat a heading on
 each subsequent page. The first page has "5.1.1 Heading", the second page has &nbsp;"5.1.2. Heading (continued)" that I want to be "5.1.1 Heading (continued)" and I want to formatting to remain unchanged so that it matches the preceding (and subsequent) headings
 (i.e. I want all the headings to have consistent sytle/formatting). I just that "5.1.2" to become a "5.1.1". After this item I will have more items that will be "5.1.2 Heading2", and if the second item takes up more than one page it will have repeated headings
 "5.1.2 Heading2 (continued)" and so on. Basically I want to have repeated numbers/items in my list, and I am trying to use Set numbering value to achieve that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it makes a difference these headings are within tables. I find that tables in Word seem to (unnecessarily) complicate things.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
&lt;Begin Rant&gt;<br />
<div>But I am finding that everything in Word has unspecified and undesired side-effects, nothing does what it states it does, it does several other things regardless of what you want. Nothing is simple and just does what you expect.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm constantly searching the Internet and reading about Words features to try to solve things that I'd expect to be simple due to these automatic side-effects. I like the idea of styles, they have benefits over just using formatting, especially to maintain
 consistency, however Word needs to stop overriding the user and changing things, it needs to give preference to what it was told to do, not what it thinks might be good. It's not helping, it's making things unintuitive and taking lots of time to fix things
 because it's doing the wrong thing - what the user does not want and did not tell it to do.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Things should be simple, Word should do what the user expects, what the user told it to do.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yes, I do not understand Words features or functionality sufficiently to achieve my desired goals. I do want to understand Word better so that I can use it, but it is frustratingly complicated to achieve simple things. I feel that it is overly complicated,
 and not easy to use, and not intuitive, and not easy to get the desired result. This is 10th generator or so of Word. I'd expect the UI to be down pat by now. Instead we get all the buttons moved around and the colouring of the&nbsp;tool bars&nbsp;changed, we need to
 learn where all the buttons and options are again, we get additional ways to specify lists that seem to not work or interact well - we don't get a word processor that can do what you want and that is easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to predict what
 it will do when you click an option / use a feature.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I click change numbering value, I expect the numbering value to change - and only the numbering value to change. I do not expect the user applied style to be&nbsp;overridden&nbsp;automatically.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I click apply style I do not expect the numbering value that had been user-overridden&nbsp;to be automatically reset to defaults. I expect the user-specified numbering value to remain and only the format of the text to change.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&lt;End Rant&gt;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd appreciate any help with this issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<div>If I'm&nbsp;interpreting&nbsp;things correctly, my method of accomplishing this is to <i>
bookmark</i>&nbsp;the text following the number sequence. Just the text, not the <i>auto-number</i>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<i>paragraph mark</i>&nbsp;(¶) or you will carry the original formatting with it. Let's call that bookmark
<i>Num511</i>.<br />
<br />
Now go to where you want the <i>5.1.1 Heading2 (continued)</i>&nbsp;and tap <i>Ctrl+F9</i>&nbsp;to insert a set of&nbsp;<i>field braces</i>&nbsp;then type
<i>REF Num511 \n</i> and move outside the <i>field braces</i>&nbsp;to the right. Put in a
<i>&lt;space&gt;</i>&nbsp;or two and tap <i>Ctrl+F9</i>&nbsp;again. Type <i>REF Nun511</i>&nbsp;then move outside the field braces to the right and type
<i>(continued)</i>. The result should look like this (with formatting marks showing,<br />
<br />
<b>{</b>·REF·Num511·\n·<b>}</b>··<b>{</b>·REF·Num511·<b>}</b>··<i>(continued)</i>¶<br />
<br />
A quick <i>Ctrl+A</i>&nbsp;(i.e. <i>Select All</i>) and then <i>F9</i>&nbsp;(i.e. <i>Update Fields</i>) and you should have,</div>
<div>5.1.1 Heading2 (continued)</div>
<div>... in the format of your choice. The bonus is that this will update numbering if
<i>5.1.1</i>&nbsp;changes for some unforeseen reason.</div>

<h2>            Account Inaccessible - I am unable to access my account</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to access my account. &nbsp;A messsage stating I am signed in with Office365 which cannot be accessed with outlook.com appears each time I attempt to log in appears. I have not had any issues logging on through this method before. When I click the
 'trouble signing in' tab it only wants to reset my password, which isn't the issue. It then says 'Please click here to sign out of your Office 365 account, then use another Microsoft account to sign in to Outlook.com (for example, your hotmail.com, live.com,
 or msn.com account).' I have tried&nbsp;following this, but no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told to post on here by Microsoft support, as they gave me other links but they did not work - I am no longer at Uni, but my address is an chi.ac.uk account. When directed to another site, I needed a username - but as I am no longer a student I do
 not have one/cannot access the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has only been an issue for 4 days and the e-mail has worked since I left Uni (in 2010).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be gratefully received!</p>

<h2>            TOC from Multiple Documents using RD Fields</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Word gurus,</p>
<p>I am helping a fellow colleague, who has multiple Word documents, and we are creating a TOC in a separate file.&nbsp; We have inserted the RD fields to the external documents, but the TOC document also has some styles that need including.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the data comes in but the other external document info (from the RD fields) appears BEFORE the other headings in the TOC document ... which need to appear first.</p>
<p>Any ideas why this might be happening OR how to overcome it please?</p>

<p>Hi Janine</p>
<p>Have you tried inserting the RD fields AFTER the content in the "container document" that should come first in the TOC? That has usually worked for me.</p>

<br />Now run the following command as many times as needed to remove all of the license keys you noted from the previous step. 
<br />
<br />
<br />cscript ospp.vbs /unpkey:&lt;last five characters of product key&gt; 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 4: Restart the Computer

            <p>I think Word might be trying to recover a document that was damaged, and the recovery file is also damaged. Then a new damaged recovery file is made, and Word crashes that one, too.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There was a similar question that was answered, but I can't find it now. The cure was to break the cycle so that Word would not try to open the damaged document when it opens. You might try holding the SHIFT key down as you click on the Word icon in your
 dock to launch Word.</p>

    <title>Being Charged Double Subscription Fees STILLL &#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#35;spiritualgangsta&#35;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Being Charged Double Subscription Fees STILLL &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
i found no use for my office 365 business subscription i'd purchased last year (via monthly payment arrangements) and so phoned in to get assistance in switching to a more appropriate version of office to better suit my needs.<br />
<br />
I'd become a cyber hacking victom and couldn't use any of my own gadgets anymore (replaced handfuls of laptops and mobile phones trying to beat them them but they always found me). Anyhow, your sales rep and i figured id be better off with an online version,
 whereby i could login to all my apps from ANY DEVICE which was definitely the better way to go for me.<br />
<br />
BUT SHE DIDN'T CANCEL MY OLD BUSINESS VERSION ON THE DAY OF THE SALES ORDER FOR THE SWITCH OF VERSIONS - NOR HAS ANYONE ORGANISED IT FOR ME SINCE - AND THAT WAS MARCH / APRIL EARLIER THIS YEAR - AND I'VE EFFIECTIVELY BEEN PAYING FOR BOTH MONTHLY FEESMONTH ON
 MONTH EVER SINCE.<br />
<br />
Now, as a distraught cyber hacking victom that i became, i did away wit all my old emails etc as i didn't know where the cause was coming from, or how to stop them, and made that evidently clear to microsoft representatives several times - when explaining i
 couldn't risk logging in there myself again to organise the cancellation - and each time they'd then digest my situaiton and agree they'll sort it out.<br />
<br />
a) i rang up and organised for a switch of products, so firstly, i shouldn't even need to have to do that - agreed?&nbsp; and
<br />
b) i couldn't log in there, even if i did want to risk it, as I didn't have the apps installed on my devices anymore, nor could i even remember what my login details were, as I never even got to use it (hackers kept getting into my devices and corrupting them
 to smidgens) so the installed software I would have to keep losing - redownloading - reinstalling - yarda yarda so eventually gave up<br />
<br />
going for the suggested online versions were definitely the wayyy better way to go in my circumstances - thank you (*thumbs up*)<br />
<br />
however - i can't understand, why i have to spend hours, trying to locate microsft contact information to handle this unfinished service request, nor havae to repeatedly make contact every 6 weeks or so...&nbsp; &nbsp;can't respond to ANY of the emails i recieve from
 you guys (so rude btw - how come you can bombard me with emails, but i can't email you once?&nbsp; no-fair guys - c'mponnow?)&nbsp; &nbsp;(*wink*)<br />
<br />
and what's even worse now, to boot - i spoke to someone who told me that (after listening to my 10min background on the siutaiton) that i 'definitely had a virus/hacker issue that could be seen immediately from there end - but basically told me to fork out
 $149 to have it removed - and can't do nothing for you mam - and literally - hung up on me when i asked them to send me an email explainging how the siutaiton had suddenly turned on me - to pay microsoft?&nbsp; when microsoft should be paying me (several months
 worth of monthly subscription fee payments / reimbursed)?<br />
<br />
I also rang back, got another guy, and no word of a lie - hung up on me too, when making the 'sale' on that very call, was evidently clear that i was kinda stalling (through not understanding this sudden turn of events/change of information) and i have literally
 - run out of ideas on what else i can do with this dead end situation now guys.<br />
<br />
So apologies, but i've had no choice but to try and hope for some helful response from someone finally, by sharing my problem weith the community - see if that helps microsoft notice my 'helpless' situaiton any.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line is - I switched products - you guys didn't finalise the changes on your back end - and furthe rmore, i won't touch any old logins I've had between March 2016 to March 2017 - so CANNOT risk logging in to cancel myself - really am relying on you guys
 to cover me on this one pls microsoft team?&nbsp; &nbsp; and escuse me, but can someone please explain how im now getting hung up on, because i,m unsure about spending $149 to clear a potential virus (that they weren't to fussed on relaying me the specifics about mind
 you) but when in fact i want to get rid of that microsft software that they're trying to con me in to spending money to regain it's health for?&nbsp; &nbsp;(*scratches head*)<br />
<br />
Mind you, all through this, i'm being unfarily continuously charged the additional $20per month ontop of my other, whilst this all still lingers and lags along until someone finally pushes the button for me.<br />
<br />
C'mon Microsft - help pls?<br />

    <title>Mail merge and international postal codes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakeguy55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail merge and international postal codes</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem that based on the many thousands of search results (including here) is still a common problem. It seems like it should be fairly straightforward but a solution seems to be amazingly difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet of addresses with international postal codes. Most are US, but we also have UK, Canada, France, etc.. Column is formatted as "Special/Zip Code" which appears to keep the leading zero for US codes, and doesn't seem to affect the other
 international codes (eg: Canada codes still show as alphanumeric "X#X #X#"). However, when doing the mail merge, the leading zeros on US codes are dropped, and all the other international codes come across as "0".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the many solutions on the net.&nbsp; Tried setting up to use a DDE connection, which results in an error on connect if XLS, or no change if using OLE and xlsx.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried cutting and pasting to a text format, but I haven't found the magic incantation to use to result in a text paste that preserves both the leading zeros and the international alphanumberics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone solved this problem recently? (Found many, many, supposed solutions that were all in the 2010-2012 range but none of those seem to work either). If so, I'd really appreciate some help/clues. I've already spent far too much time on this!</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Anything that worked in Word 97 would likely work in Word 2016. Mailmerge is old technology.
<br />
<br />
Two thoughts: </p>
<ol>
<li>You will need to modify field code in Word for format, at least for the leading 0 problem.
</li><li>The same format likely will not work for both kinds, so you will need an IF field to display the proper format. If you are willing to work with me on that, please post a sample data file. This may take a couple of days of back and forth work.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
If you want, save a sample workbook with the data on OneDrive or Dropbox and paste a link here. Remove any confidential or sensitive information first. I or someone else can take a look at it.
<br />

<p>The underlying problem here is that your data source has what are interpreted as mixed data types in the zip-code field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, Word 2002 &amp; later use the OLE DB provider to get merge data from an Excel workbook. Because the OLE DB provider is designed to return data in a way that is compatible with Access and other relational database packages, it requires a specific
 the data type for each column. The first 8 records are used for that (the 8 can be changed in the Windows Registry, but it’s not advisable to do so). Records that don’t conform to the determined data type are liable to not be handled correctly. To complicate
 matters, there are two text data types: "text" (up to 255 characters) and "memo" (can be longer than that).<br />
<br />
Some common mailmerge issues arising out of this include:<br />
• Numbers but not text or dates being output for some records; and<br />
• Text data being truncated at 255 characters.<br />
<br />
Ideally, one would ensure each field has only one data type. Workarounds include:<br />
• Inserting a dummy first record containing data in the format that is not being output correctly; or<br />
• Reordering the data so the first record has content in the format that is not otherwise being output correctly.<br />
In your case, the solution would be to ensure the first record's zip/postal code is non-numeric.<br />

<p>Paul has probably described the issue well.&nbsp; I do have mixed data types. It appears that my only solutions are to either separate the different data types, or pursue some conditional merge code as Charles suggests.&nbsp; I'll probably do both as I'm under a time
 constraint and need to get out some letters. But since this is something we need to do frequently, with data that changes frequently, I'd prefer an automated solution that won't require a lot of manual manipulation each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the bigger picture.&nbsp; The information starts from a Google Contacts list of addresses. I use the built-in export function to extract to a CSV file. I then use this CSV source as the input to my mail merge. I usually save as an xlsx file first, but

<p>
</p><p>That it is old does not mean it isn't good. Things that worked in earlier versions still work in Office 2019. Things that were problems probably still are; the workarounds still work.</p>
<p>1. If fields are case-sensitive. Testing for "" does not involve that, but other tests can.
<br />
2. The { } braces cannot be typed, they must be inserted by Word, usually using Ctrl+F9.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is going to involve some massaging of data. I think you would want to have two columns, one for a code to tell which type of postal code you are dealing with and the second to hold the code itself. The alternative would be to have one column for each
 type of postal code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any of the codes other than US have leading zeros that cause problems?</p>
<p>Are all of your US codes 5-digit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion for the code column (pCodeType):</p>
<p>Most frequent type = 0</p>
<p>Next most frequent = 1</p>
<p>Next most frequent = 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could (1) use letters instead of numbers but then you run into the case-sensitive problem, (2) have your most frequent type simply be blank and test for "" instead of a number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will likely have to hand code that. Still easier than more columns, though, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assume that 0 = US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ IF "{ Mergefield pCodeType }" = 0 "{ Mergefield PostalCode \# "00000"}" "{ Mergefield PostalCode }" }</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pay attention to Paul's warning about mixed data types.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will not be able to employ field coding to work around the issue - even with the 'helper' column Charles suggests. The only way to do so without creating columns for the different data types is to ensure an alpha or alpha-numeric string appears as the
 first record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Charles' description of mailmerge as 'old' technology is also unhelpful. The issue has nothing to do with its age and everything to do with your use of mixed data types in a context that has to work with just one data type. The workaround I've described
 informs Word that the data type is text, which results in the data being output just as it was input.</p>

<p>Thank you Paul.&nbsp; I will test your suggested method at some point.&nbsp; In the meantime I sorted the spreadsheet to separate the US from non-US codes, and formatted separately for each. The steps were not as numerous as I feared, and this may be my easiest, most
 straight-forward solution.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With no blanks in range A2:A50, try this formula to count unique items in column A</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(1/COUNTIF($A$2:$A$50,$A$2:$A$50))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Peggy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your account numbers are in say Column A, try this formula:</p>
<p>=SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(A:A,A:A)&gt;0,1,0))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This checks if each value exists at least once and assigns a value of 1, then adds them up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Jeffrey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand you want to use the search function in Exchange Admin Center to search according to the suffix of their email address. It is not feasible to search according to the
<strong>domain</strong> of the contact for the time being.</p>
<p>We can search via the full content of a field or the beginning of the Display Name. For example, under Advanced Search and more options&gt; Company, we need to match the company attribute. You can edit the company attribute when edit the contact&gt; organization&gt;
 company.</p>
<p>Given the situation, I suggest that you <a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Submit feedback</a> to our related team. Many features have been designed or upgraded based on customers’ constructive comments.</p>
<p>Your understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>i would need some help to create vba code that will add new sheet with name base on values listed on column A of Sheet 3(so always have at least 3 sheets)</p>
<p>1- created new sheet with sheet names from sheet3, a2 to a10</p>
<p>2- if the sheet name already existed then skip create new sheet with that name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3- loop through each cells on A2 to A10 of sheet 3 then if that value match with cell in column C of sheet 2 and copy entire row to that match new created sheet. For example
</p>
<p>sheet3.range("a2")= "my example"</p>
<p>sheeet2.range("c5")= "my example"</p>
<p>copy entire row 5 to new sheet "my example"</p>
<p>i was able to create new sheets but don't know how to verify the sheet name. Please give me some hints or advise.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Annoying problem with Nokia E72&#39;s themes</h2>
                    
<p>I am gonna go mad!!! Why the hell ABSOLUTELY ALL of the new themes I download for my Nokia E72 do not support the
<u>Office</u> and <u>Applications</u> icons in the main menu??? No matter what theme I apply to the phone, these two icons don't change!!! This seems to be some problem with FP2, because these icons weren't changeable too on my old FP2 phone - C5-00... Is there
 some kind of a fix for this???</p>

<p>Themes you may have tried are of third party so you might not get help on that but my recommendation to you is to contact the party from you has downloaded themes from. It’s dependent on creator of theme what he has created or for what phone he has created.
 I am also using themes for my e72 they are ok most of the major icons are compatible according to theme.</p>

            Office 2019 is different from Office 2019. Office 2019 is a frozen feature set, which Office 365 introduces a completely new user experience. Microsoft is rolling it out over a period of a few weeks. I just recently got it myself. 
<br />
<br />Here is a guide:

            Hi BJT
<br />
<br />Office 2019 is a one-time purchase, once you purchase that, it is yours for life
<br />
<br />Office 365 is a subscription product and will be updated constantly, where Office 2019 will not.
<br />
<br />If you are running Office 365, you already have all the functionality that is included in Office 2019
