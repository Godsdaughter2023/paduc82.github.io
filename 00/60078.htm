<h2>            Could Xbox one offer an HDR to SDR converter feature&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, It would be cool, to have an HDR to SDR converter, I don't know if it has to be done through hardware or software tho. But there is this french guy who has been trying his Samsung&nbsp; UHD Blu-ray that got this feature,&nbsp;and he has been trying on numerous LCD panel, HDR compliant one, non HDR compliant, and even 1080 screen, and he said that, with LCD screen with local dimming, he was able to obtain great result in contrast. I still don't know how much it could add to input lag, and I guess it will be less if it's hardware made, but that will be definitely a great feature for the ones not ready to invest yet in 4k, especially how complicated is this niche, with things like hdmi 2.0 and&nbsp;2.1 coming.&nbsp;</p><p>The most stupid one being&nbsp;HDCP 2.2 compliance,&nbsp;blocking you&nbsp;from viewing UHD&nbsp;content, if both (transmitter/receiver)&nbsp;your device arent&nbsp;HDCP 2.2 compliant,&nbsp;almost forcing average buyer getting&nbsp;product from hacker on peer to pe

<h2>            80070571</h2>
                    
<p>Get this code when trying to recover my profile on xbox live. My gamertag has randomly disapeared off my xbox since yesterday and when trying to recover it I am greeted with this message: "Sorry, Xbox Live profiles cannot be downloaded right now. Try again
 later" then the numbers&nbsp;80070571.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My hard drive says all my data belongs to "Corrupted profile"</p>
<p>I also have a second account and the data for that one is not corrupt as it says the gamertag underneath it.</p>
<p>Anyway to fix this or can i get the email for support?</p>

<p>Hey Gib, sorry to hear about your profile! Okay, first off, we'll want to delete that corrupted profile. With that complete, try downloading the profile again, as it should work at that point. If it doesn't download, please try connecting directly to your
 modem with an Ethernet cable, to see if that allows you to download your profile. :-)

 on the game, I couldn't access the expansion so I would like to know how to refund the expansion and get my money back?</p>

            You have 14 days for reimbursement, as long as you have played less than 2 hours. This is for base games. For the DLC I think you do not have this option

            <p>Thank you for getting back to me with your questions about the challenges I am having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I access outlook through the web; Google or MSN.</p>
<p>I don't believe it is Outlook Office.</p>
<p>I have Windows Live 12. &nbsp;There is an update available, however I have tried several times to install it and it tells me, there is something in my system, which is preventing installation.</p>
<p>I am able to open Hotmail and Cogeco email accounts, through my existing Windows Live 12, however, I cannot open, many of the emails and certainly cannot reply to any at all.</p>
<p>Currently, it seems, emails, which come into my Hotmail email, do show up on my Outlook email....after a little time goes by.</p>
<p>Currently, with my Cogeco email, I am having to move them to my Hotmail Inbox, where they eventually show up in Outlook.</p>
<p>Once my emails are in Outlook, I can access them and reply etc.</p>

<h2>            New HP Stream 32GB Hard drive &#40;How to dedicate external hard drive for everything except OS&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently purchased an HP stream and within about an hour have filled up my hard drive. So, I purchased an external hard drive, however am having difficulty with saving anything to it. I wiped the computer and brought it back to its original state and
 would like to designate the external drive to basically hold everything from this point forward. I've read many responses about transferring files from my internal drive to the external, however, there's nothing to move over at this point. I just want to change
 the path basically from here on out to my external drive as opposed to my internal. Can someone please help me understand this process?

            Okay, so in this case, if you go to the Settings charm&gt;Change PC Settings&gt;PC and devices&gt;Devices, you'll find a section called Default Save locations. You can change the default save locations to the external drive here, but unfortunately, apps need to
 be installed in the internal drive. There's no option to move them.<br />

                    I have Game Pass. I installed Hellblade. When I start up the game it asked me to change the brightness like most games do but it does not let me do anything. I really wanted to play this. Why is it not working? Why can I not play this game?

<p>im sorry to report this on my favorite game of the series i love resident evil but they re are some that take advantage</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here are their gamer tags</p>
<p><strong>[Mod removed]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mod removed]</strong></p>
<p>i noticed jumps in the game play online amongst the players they were using being nearly invincible even to the most powerful weapons also when being hit by them either through melee or gun fire i would see a jummp in the game and i could no longer pick
 up objects to restore my health, gain ammo and pick up anything impiticular. there were others that were doing the same but i didnt get the chance to find out their gamer tags so there are others doing this and ruining the game for others even other players
 noticed this as well and when playing with them and i reassured them in bringing this to xbox. it really sucks that people take enjoyment out of games by cheating and cant play fair. i pretty much expeirienced this before in a game i played online before.
 i hope this gets taken care of and other people speak out like i did as well.</p>

<h2>            skype cannot connect to webcam video but can connect to webcam audio</h2>
                    <p>upgraded to windows 10 more than a year ago.</p>
<p>use Logitech hd c920 webcam.</p>
<p>camera was working well until 7/3/2017. I could use webcam audio, but with the video setting I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't start video. try closing other programs that might be using your webcam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is NO PROGRAM using the webcam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried everything mentioned on the internet to solve this problem at no avail.</p>
<p>here is my suspicion:</p>
<p>Window 10 has camera app. I wonder if this app takes over the webcam.</p>
<p>reason. when i open the app, I can see the webcam video.</p>
<p>I will try to remove the camera app and see if it could make the webcam work with skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any solution out there? Help appreciated.</p>

<div>To install screensaver with .exe extension , right click on the screensaver and click on install.</div>
<div>Its done,now you can set this as your screensaver from properties&gt;screensaver tab and clicking ok.</div>
<div><br />
<div>IF STILL NOT ABLE TO INSTALL THEN YOU CAN GIVE ME THE DOWNLOAD LINK(OR WEBSITE FROM WHICH YOU DOWNLOADED THIS) FOR THAT SCREENSAVER TO ME. I WILL DOWNLOAD IT AND TEST IT ON MY PC AND GIVE YOU THE REQUIRED INSTRUCTIONS.</div>

            I had the same thing happen. I noticed no one responded to you, and I'm not really sure what the deal is with this, but I notice I have several duplicate DCOM entries.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if it's just since installing the Creators Update or what. However, it stands to reason that if they both point to the same RuntimeBroker.exe (C:\Windows\System32\RuntimeBroker.exe), this isn't a problem to worry about. If you start having DCOM
 errors (Event 10016 in your Event Log), then you may just have to apply any registry permissions fixes to the new DCOM entry.<br />
<br />
The new ones are
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppID\{15c20b67-12e7-4bb6-92bb-7aff07997402}</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{2593f8b9-4eaf-457c-b68a-50f6b8ea6b54}</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old/original are</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppID\{9CA88EE3-ACB7-47c8-AFC4-AB702511C276}</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{D63B10C5-BB46-4990-A94F-E40B9D520160}</p>
<p>
I doubt this is very helpful to you, but I don't like seeing someone's request go without any response at all.</p>

<h3> daveelliott1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 hang up at 75&#37;</h2>
                    Help.<br />
<br />
Every time i leave my PC for an hour or more i come back to it as a blank screen with no cursor and i have to hard reset it.<br />
When it starts up it comes back to a windows 10 update stuck at 75% that never moves anywhere.<br />
I have to hard reset it and it recovers previous version.<br />
<br />
It's taking me half an hour to get my PC started everyday yet my settings tell me windows 10 is up to date!<br />
<br />
How do i stop this?&nbsp;

<div>Hi, I had the same problem as you with the computer freezing at 75% and again at 81%. My computer is over 7 years old. After some thread searching I found this:<br />
Quote:<br />
I was having a similar problem, and after multiple attempts (over 7 times) trying different solutions like disabling virus protection, disabling startup programs, running update database corruption repair, etc. My computer never got past 81% before freezing
 and not updating.</div>
<div>I stumbled across a forum talking about problems with&nbsp; Anatel&nbsp; PCI-E Wlan cards (wi-fi) and old drivers that would hang up their computers and after removing the card (not just disabling) their machines would update and run fine. Since I was running my
 machine through an Ethernet connection, connected to an access point, I could remove the Anatel card in my computer and still have an internet connection. I tried it, and my computer a Gateway FX6860 updated to Windows 10 Fall Creators version without any
 problems. </div>
<div>Check to see if you have an Anatel wifi card and remove it and replace it with something newer or an Ethernet or usb connection to the internet and try the update. this worked for me."</div>
<div>I took out the Anatel wi-fi card and tried the upload again. IT WORKED</div>

<p>
</p><div>
<p>Had my windows 1709 upgrade&nbsp; failing at 45% many times&nbsp; (also failing at 75% and 81% if upgrading via ISO disc (had black screen at about 75% then rebooting recovered the install but it then crashed at 75% or 81% (spinning circle on screen froze)) and I
 eventually found through forum posts it was caused by the Wi-Fi card plugged into my PC. I unplugged the Wi-Fi card (when PC was powered down) and it upgraded ok on the next upgrade attempt.</p>

 on email servers, get installation files and there is always the possibility of something going wrong) . As it turned out if I had of done a clean install it might not of worked or I might have had to do it again on the next big windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It would be useful in future to have a sticky (static) post in this forum with possible reasons&nbsp; why windows 10 might not update as I had to do quite a bit of searching to find the solution to why my windows 10 wasn't updating (a
 couple of days after something has been posted you need to go through newer posts to find the forum post that might be of use and the search facility cannot seem to order posts by date created/last post as far as I can see). Also it might be useful to have
 a page on the site with known/reported hardware &amp; programs that causes Windows update to fail (I have also now suggested the above in the site feedback)</p>

Hi, I had the same problem as you with the computer freezing at 75% and again at 81%. My computer is over 7 years old. After some thread searching I found this:<br />

<div>
<p>"I was having a similar problem, and after multiple attempts (over 7 times) trying different solutions like disabling virus protection, disabling startup programs, running update database corruption repair, etc. My computer never got past 81% before freezing
 and not updating.<br />
<br />
I stumbled across a forum talking about problems with&nbsp; Anatel&nbsp; PCI-E Wlan cards (Wi-Fi) and old drivers that would hang up their computers and after removing the card (not just disabling) their machines would update and run fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I was running my machine through an Ethernet connection, connected to an access point, I could remove the
<strong>Anatel card in my computer and still have an internet connection</strong>. I tried it, and my computer a Gateway FX6860 updated to Windows 10 Fall Creators version without any problems.
</p>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check to see if you have an Anatel wifi card and remove it and replace it with something newer or an Ethernet or usb connection to the internet and try the update. This worked for me."<br />
...................................<br />
I took out the Anatel wi-fi card and tried the upload again. </div>
<div>
<p>IT WORKED.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Bobroth1951 </strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>And it worked for me three times.</div>

<p>Exact same issue, except I have 3 "HP Spectre Pro x360 G2" laptops that are all failing the same way at the same point. The root cause was Trend Micro (corporate) and I think specifically it was the process that blocked changes for key settings. As soon
 as I ripped it out using RevoUninstaller in Safe Mode the&nbsp;KB4284835 installed in about 2 minutes, computer rebooted, all was fine. Before this I tried everything including removing the Wi-Fi card (which actually caused the freeze to occur that much faster).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will talk to the IT and let them know that no one gets viruses anymore, it's all about malware and ransomware that traditional antiviruses do not even pick up. Just slows down the computer while doing nothing. If an AV is all that people need, just use
 Windows Defender, it's actually pretty damn good. If you want something really robust, do the Malwarebytes paid version with active scanning and web blocking. Everything else is pointless in this day and age.</p>

<h2>            XBOX ERROR CODE E102</h2>
                    Calling the call center has not been of any use. The person tried to explain me the same steps which I have already done during last 2-months. Later the person tried to convince me for a service order. Service order is nothing but a trap with intention
 to keep asking SGD 190 for every trouble.&nbsp; Without seeing the&nbsp;problem/issue, the fees is pre-decided !! &nbsp;I am 100% of the opinion that XBOX s/w trouble is mainly to earn SGD190 from every client after its warranty is over ...... its a smart professional system
 to Rob customer after warranty is over.... FURTHER MORE...I got a Warning&gt;&gt;&gt; If&nbsp;any one else touching the XBOX to rectify the trouble, the console will be banned.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only support steps available for this error are shown at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution</a> </p>
<p>If all fails then I'm afraid there are no other steps to try.</p>
<p>you will either need to set up a repair or contact Xbox Support like mentioned on that troubleshooting page. When contacting Xbox Support use either the Phone option or the Microsoft Support Chat option on http://support.xbox.com/contact-us
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume what they wanted to say with the warning is, that any repair done outside of the Microsoft Repair centers will result in the warranty to be voided, but also any option to have the console repaired in the future. Plus depending on what is done it
 can be considered as a modified (console which will result in the console being banned</p>

<p><br />
I have to ask. <br />
Are you certain you do not have any anti-virus (AV) program installed ? <br />
No Norton, AVG, Windows Security Essentials etc etc ? None ?<br />
<br />
You do not go and install Windows Defender. It comes with the system, its part of the operating system. It cannot be uninstalled either.<br />
<br />
Now, question: <br />
What exactly do you mean " Windows Defender is gone " ?<br />
What makes you believe that it is gone ?<br />
You had a message that said so ? If yes, post that message.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that you were notified that Windows Defender is NOT turned on ?<br />
If yes, here is one of the ways to turn it back on.....<br />
<br />
Start button &gt; search box, type&nbsp; services&nbsp; &gt; press Enter key &gt; you'll be prompted by uac &gt; scroll all the way down and locate Windows Defender.....<br />
Under Status heading, it should say .............. Started<br />
under Startup type, it should say.................. Automatic<br />
If that is NOT , RIGHT click on Windows Defender &gt; click Properties &gt; on the new window, make the changes...<br />
Status&nbsp;&nbsp;to Start<br />
Startup Type to Automatic <br />
Click OK when done.</p>

                    When ever i open game bar in a game the microphone is defaulted to be off while recording. So when i turn on the option to turn on mic while recording that option turns back off on its own. I tried uninstalling and installing back game bar but that didn't
 work. I'm also having this problem with broadcasting games audio only.

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/49b72bb7-a2f2-4c55-bf2c-08e6832a042f" title="hilarypring"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">hilarypring</span></a><span>
 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Audio distortions, delays, hangs, freezes, and other call quality issues are usually caused by an Internet connection issue. When Skype detects a weak connection (works both ways), the system will automatically reduce the call quality to prevent the entire
 call from dropping.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try changing your connection and see if this happens. Close any application that may be using your bandwidth especially video streaming apps, file transfers and downloads. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1417/how-much-bandwidth-does-skype-need?q=bandwidth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support link</a></strong> for the recommended upload and download speeds for optimal Skype call experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            event viewer - application error</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I am using win 7 OS. I am new to the event viewer function (under control panel/admin tools) and recently
 had a few peaks into this to see what it shows. I was a bit alarmed when I see an application error concerning my mcafee AV software. I copy below &nbsp;what it said. I find this a bit strange as I got no warning from my laptop or mcafee in the systems intray.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Q1: Is this typical? &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Q2:¨This error &nbsp;occurred 48 hours ago and the error was not listed again today. Can I assume the error has
 resolved itself? Or do I need to further investigate and how?</span></span></p>

            <p>It's been a while since I've worked with McAfee, but I believe those DLL's are part of the update process. What probably happened (and don't take this as gospel) was that when it went to look for definition updates, either there was a temporary lag and it couldn't get out to the internet immediately, or McAfee's servers were temporarily unavailable. If you don't see the log entry any more, then I wouldn't worry about it.</p><p>The reason you didn't see a pop-up about it was that it MTL resolved itself before the error time-out period expired. In other words, it may have a 60 second delay before the error message pops up, and it resolved the connection/update within that time frame, so no pop-up.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>

            <p>I guess it would depend on what the errors are. Are you seeing any problems with your system, as in slow-downs, freezes, etc? Any BSOD?</p><p>If they really bother you (and if it were me, it would, but that's part of my OC :-)&nbsp; ), then you can research them in Google or Bing or whatever search engine you prefer. Open the event, then highlight the first line in the "General" view, press CTRL+Insert, then paste that into your search engine. Usually, the first results will bring up either a TechNet or Answers forum link, if it's a common enough problem.</p><p>Or, when you have the event open, click on the Copy button in the lower left and paste that into a post here. For example:</p><p>Log Name:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System<br />Source:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog<br />Date:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7/13/2012 12:26:14 PM<br />Event ID:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 104<br />Task Category: Log clear<br />Level:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />Keywords:<

            <p>Are these red X errors, or yellow ! warnings that you're seeing? I would say that it's not normal to see errors that frequently, but not unusual to see warnings frequently.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>
