<p>
</p><p>I'm glad to assist you with your issue about the font size when printing emails. Please be informed that there is no option to change the font size when printing. The size of the font depends on the&nbsp;what the&nbsp;sender used when sending the email.</p>

<h2>            C&#58; Drive Tools.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've currently been experiencing issues on my pc with it freezing on me at random. I've pinpointed the problem to be associated with my hard drive. My discussion is pertaining to the C' Drive tools associated with Windows 10. Why isn't this able to detect
 bad sectors and repair them? I've ran this tool a few times and each time the information returns no problems found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone ahead and download an app called HD Tune Pro v5.7 - This tool has found a bad sector with my hard drive. Which makes sense obviously with the pc freezing on me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question to the windows community is why isn't my own operating system able to detect this problem with a bad hard drive (or in the process of going bad).</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I've also ran chkdsk C: /f as well.</p>

            Windows marks bad sectors as unreadable and no longer uses them, so that's not the cause of your freezing problem. In addition, the S.M.A.R.T. utility built into virtually every hard drive will alert you (unless you've chosen to suppress notifications)&nbsp;when
 the number of unreadable blocks becomes high.

            Having a bad hard drive can cause a computer to freeze. To say "that's not the cause" is not entirely accurate.

<p>The OP didn't identify "bad hard drive" (whatever that means) as the problem; they identified "bad sectors."</p>

</p><p>If a sector has a logical problem, the operating system can fix that. If the hard drive has a physical problem, there's nothing an operating system can do about it, other than marking the sector unusable.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Putting the methods in Windows to test all hard drives would extremely bloat the OS. And keeping up with all the&nbsp;drive changes and new&nbsp;drives would be an impossible task for the OS. So Windows contains a methods that will detect and correct many yet not all
 hard drive issues.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 Browser Choice</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Windows 8 Ultrabook. When I start it up, the Browser Choice runs. If I select Explorer (again) it confirms I have the latest version and nothing else.</p>
<p>If I shut the Ultrabook down and re-start it, the Browser Choice runs again.</p>
<p>How do I stop the Browser Choice from running?</p>

    <title>Problem with geforce 610 video card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigdon3212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with geforce 610 video card</h2>
                    <p>I had a GeForce 7900S gpu installed. When I tried to upgrade to Win 10, it said that updated drivers were not available...I checked and agree......soooooo, I went and purchased&nbsp; an inexpensive card that was supposed to word with Win 10. I purchased an GeForce
 GT610.</p>
<p>Installed the card, updated the latest drivers dated 8/13/2015. </p>
<p>When I attempt to install Win 10 it still shows a video card compatibility issue and still shows the GeForce 7900S as the problem.</p>
<p>I cleaned out the old drivers and re-installed the GT610 drivers again...Win 10 still shows the campatibility issue with the 7900s.</p>
<p>The 7900s is not even installed.</p>
<p>Any ideas ????</p>

            HI TJ, 
<br />
<br />Is that folder on your C Drive, just named Recovery?
<br />
<br />That folder is not a Windows system folder, it is generally created by Manufacturers backup software, are you running a Dell, if not, what is the Manufacturer of your system?

<p>Yes, it's a Dell convertible tablet. Tree Size Free says Recovery contains one folder called Customizations, and it contains one file called Apps.ppkg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to move the folder, but it says that System owns it, and even though I am an administrator, I can't seem to do anything to move it or delete it.</p>

            Hi TJ, I would say that folder is belonging to Dell backup and recovery software
<br />
<br />See if you can re-direct Dell backup and recovery to backup onto your D Drive, you should then be able to delete that folder from your C Drive . ..

<h2>            Strange icon appears on the taskbar for a second at least once a day</h2>
                    <p>Periodically, a strange icon pops up on the taskbar for me. It's a sun-like icon with an orange background.I only managed to get a screenshot when it was already fading out, it's bright orange.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3d39de4-2bad-4e85-9c6f-4cddf98b517b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3d39de4-2bad-4e85-9c6f-4cddf98b517b?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
Does anyone recognise this? Is this some kind of capture software or other malware? It doesn't seem to coincide with a specific device or activity, it just appears out of nowhere (when it appears, the taskbar becomes visible from fullscreen as well)</p>
<p>

<h2>            Xbox One, brand new, fails to read some game discs and wont play a DVD</h2>
                    
<p>So, 2 week old Xbox One, fine apart from the Microsoft hack on 25th Dec. Turned it on yesterday and....wont now play 3 of the 5 games installed (installed from Disc NOT download). Tried the DVD player and ... wont play that either.</p>
<p>Spent an hour with XBox Support in a live chat, did restarts, power cycles, cleared cache, was told to uninstall games and reinstall - guess what, still the same ! Was guanranteed by Microsoft support that the reinstall would sort it but NO.</p>
<p>Strange that the drive will read two of the five games I have.....*** knows.</p>
<p>Anyone any ideas.....Xbox support just points to 'send in for repair'. Really, even though it reads two games but *** all else.</p>
<p>PS4</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>When your console is not working then troubleshoot yourself and if it fails call them, up and say right off the bat, " I would like a Advanced Replacment for my XBOX ONE please" "what's wrong" they ask. You list the problems and they ask if you have troubleshooted
 already and just say yes. I never deal with their troubleshooting I just do it myself and tell them to send me a new console and they do without sitting on the phone for 1-2hours with them wasting your time giving you the run around.</p>

<h2>            Trying to Buy Gears of War PC but not old Enough</h2>
                    
<p>So, even though my account has been okay with buying mature products and things along this line, it will not let me buy Gears of War for my pc. Usually, on my xbox 360, it will not let me download videos or beta's that are mature rated because I put my age
 as 16. It at least lets me buy things rated mature. I have another account I could buy it on, but I have no points on that account. I already have points and ready to buy on this. I need help, I want to buy Gears of War 1 on my PC. It won't work. Any way I
 could transfer my points to my other account? or make this okay on this account.</p>

<p>The reason is as you have stated I believe, if you have parental controls turned onto your pc, you are not old enough to play gears of war. Recently games have had a mandatory age restriction, whereas before, at least in my country the age restriction was
 a warning rather than you have to be this age, unlike movies where it was enforced by the law.</p>

<p>Hey Thermal,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Xbox determines the age of a account based on the legal age of the region that it is associated with. Downloading certain material would require the user to have reached the age limit to their region as an adult. If by chance your account is of the legal
 age limit to be considered an adult you can promote it by following these directions:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>To promote a child account to an adult account<br />
&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to Xbox LIVE by using the account that you want to change. </li><li>Go to&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>, and then select&nbsp;<b>Account</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Promote Child Account</b>. </li></ul>
<p><br />
Bare in mind if you live in the US you need to be 18 to download or promote your account.

<p>so, I am aware how I am not 17, but on the Xbox marketplace it will at least let me purchase things. It won't let me try demo's and stuff, but anything that deals w/ money or microsoft points, it will let me have. Why is it not like that on the PC?</p>

<br />
<div>For both of you parallel port guys, Vista intercepts any command sent directly to hardware and blocks it.&nbsp; From within Vista there is no way to directly access the port in the way you are requesting.&nbsp; And as qBasic is a DOS based program
 it will always try to access devices at the hardware level which Vista will block.&nbsp; Remember Vista doesn't have any DOS in it, only a DOS emulator which will not allow direct hardware addressing.</div>

            you mean there is no way to access to parallel port to program with it to control a led?for example we can use USERPORT software to access to ports with programming in qbasic on windows xp is not any program to use ports in vista like user port?and we
 can not work with qbasic even in dosbox to control parallel port? why it is like that?please answer to me

<p>Check the physical connections to the drive (easier if a desktop). It sounds like there may a problem with the power connection.</p>

<h2>            XBOX UI&#47;Content Language Mixed even though it has been set to english.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>We have found a bug in the new dashboard update that has been sent out. There are a lot of threads with feedback and unhappy customers, which have been pointed to the feedback forum.</p>
<p>I feel that the forum admins/staff do not understand or took the time to understand the problem. The issue is that we are all based in countries that have different languages. Sweden, Norway, New Mexico etc etc. Because of this the console seems to not care,
 that we chose ENGLISH as our language of preference.</p>
<p>And gives us the dashboard, with a mixture of languages. In my case dutch and English. Now I have taken the time to collect all the different threads I could find, where people are having the same issues. Could you please get this fixed! This is not supposed
 to be in the feedback forum. This IS a BUG, and makes my console very hard to use!</p>
<p>There was feedback given about this issue by me and other people during BETA testing as well, and that feedback was ignored.</p>
<p>When we choose our language as English I want all dashboard items to be one language in English, I do not care if the ad's are in another language.</p>
<p>But my menu's and movie content should be in English, or at least give me the option to disable subtitles.</p>
<p>Please fix this issue!</p>

<p>Yes, for heaven´s sake, change this nonsense already. I can´t use my console in neither my preferred language, which is English, nor in my native language, which is German. All my Xbox is giving me is dutch or french. I understand both a little but I don´t
 want them on my dashboard. It was already bad enough to have it forced on me in the store or, of all things, on the billing pages.</p>
<p>I have completely switched over to my PS3 and cancelled the next renewal of my Live account. If this doesn´t get fixed, my money will go to Sony in the future.</p>
<p>This is simply unacceptable.</p>

<p>I completely forgot about the billing pages, also not having the ability to choose English. That is also a huge problem for me. I do not understand why they just do not let people choose the language that they want. And just display that. It feels like such
 a half finished product, and if they have it on the billing page, they will have the same problem on the zune and windows phones. And the problem most probably exists on the windows 8 store as well.</p>

<p>The thing is, if they introduce English as a choice for the billing people will just need to set this to English and everything will be ok again (as far as I understand how it works now).</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure why there is no option to choose any language (which they support) for billing language.</p>
<p>Although it is not the case with me, there are plenty of people living abroad (for studies or PhD or work or whatever) and not all of them are speaking the language of the country they live in.</p>
<p>Also, why not let people CHOOSE which language they want to use instead of forcing them to use the ones of the country they live in.</p>

<p>Didn't work. It's in English when I go offline, but as soon as the console goes online (even before I've signed in to Xbox Live), it's back to the dual-language fever dream. And yes, I tried clearing the cache, resetting system info (didn't get any confirmation,
 but it quit out of the system info screen whenever I entered a code), rebooting the console, etc.</p>
<p>Also, I'm curious as to why Microsoft apparently doesn't care enough about its localisation to even get someone who actually speaks the language in question to do it (Norwegian product information bears the taint of Google Translate, several of the new translated
 menu options are nonsense), yet still force users to accept it if they want to keep using Xbox Live. Seems like an odd decision to me.</p>

<p><strong>1. Clear system cache - </strong>Done</p>
<p><strong>2. Reset System Info to Default - </strong>Done<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><br />
I have done all of the above, and still the same issue. To me this points to a software bug, not just on the console, but also on windows 8 xbox apps, the xbox billing website etc etc.</p>
<p>Because I have a live account registered in the Netherlands (Because I stay here and work here as a Expat) Microsoft assumes I speak dutch. Which means my http://live.xbox.com profile shows all my content in dutch, the billing site is in dutch... Etc etc
 There is no option on the website for me to set my language to English!?. I could deal with that, but now the console is behaving in exactly the same way!! I raised this issue on the closed beta as well and nobody listened.
</p>
<p>I think the problem is slightly more complicated than clearing your cache, or setting things back to default. (Which sounds to me like the generic solution of "did you try and turn it off and on again"). If you check the threads in my first post you would
 see that there are a lot of people that are struggling with the exact same issue.</p>
<p>So any other suggestions on fixing it ?</p>

<p>After a long discussion with Microsoft support, and explaining our problem. It seems there are some legal reasons, which makes them think they can only server content in the national language for the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some back and fort i was given the following feedback link. As explained by the support tech, (bless her heart because its not her fault this happened, and i was a bit harsh). We should give as much feedback regarding this issue as we can. Because
 if it stays this way I can definitely see them lose a lot of clients.</p>
<p>This is the feedback link</p>

Privacy Statement
You are now chatting with 'Support'.
Support: Thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support.  One moment please while I look over your information, and while I do so, how are you doing today?
me: Good and you Support :)
me: hoping i can get in contact with the right people
Support: Doing good as well.  Thanks for asking.  And thank you for your patience.  So basically you found a bug related to language settings, correct?
me: Correct, my language settings are completely ignored on the console
me: i get a mixed dashboard with dutch and english
me: even though i have set my account to language to english
me: and my locale to united kingdom
me: which i did to make sure games show up in english
me: also, on a side note i cant set my live.xbox.com website language to english as well as the billing website is also hardcoded to dutch
me: But this was a error from the begining
Support: That actually is normal behavior.  When signed in to Xbox Live, the language settings used are from the profile region, not the language and locale on the console.  The language and locale settings apply offline.
me: Then why do we have the option on the console to chose our language
me: /
me: ?
me: it makes no sense to give the option and then ignore it
Support: The language setting is for offline accounts that wouldn't have any country associated with them.
me: plus how does that help people that stay in different countries ?
me: Still even if people stay in different countries they should be able to choose any language
me: not everyone in a country speaks french for instance. As is the case with people staying in belgium they get a mixture of dutch and french on their consoles
Support: Also the console language settings only affect the dashboard, not games.  Games would have their own language settings that can be set within the game.
me: The biggest issue for me at the moment is the fact that my dashboard is half english and half dutch, and i have no way to set it to all english
me: because the assumption is made for me, that because i am in the netherlands that i speak dutch
me: For instance
me: let me give an example if i buy a phone
me: and i go to germany
me: would it be good for the phone to default to german
me: because i am now online from germany ?
Support: With our items the language is based on the region on your account.  There are certain restrictions that we do have to follow when delivering content online in other countries, which includes the language it is provided in.
me: how could the language be restriction ? I mean i understand certain content, like adverts and videos etc etc. because you have people paying for that content that is fine. But my dashboard menu options being in dutch and english. Is that a restriction?
Support: When we offer service in a country we have to be able to provide service in the languages that are legally recognized in that country.  That is what we do, so in the Netherlands that would be Dutch.
me: Having mixed menu options in diffrent language's at the same time is defnitly not because that menu option had to be served in a diffrent language because of a restriction. For instance options on my menu has changed to instellingen. System has changed into Systeem, etc etc. I doubt you have restrictions around basic menu options.
me: The legal asspects your talking about would be eula etc etc. Where only the dutch version is valid in the court of law
me: Menu options would not fall under that law.
Support: We do indeed have such a restriction.  We cannot even provide service in a new country without first translating all the options into the legally recognized national language.  Otherwise our customers would be unable to navigate the system.
me: Well thats the thing, all the menu options are not translated. As you can see from my screen shots. Half of them are translated. Also do you not cater for people staying in other countries. That speak different languages ?
me: For instance in belguim you have a mixture of french and dutch
me: so which one is legaly binding there ?
Support: Those are the languages that are provided in Belgium.  And in the US it is only English.  In Canada we provide English and French.
me: Then why mix dutch and french on the same dashboard its not just dutch or just french. Its dutch and french mixed. Also why not give people the option to choose what language they want. You can specify that only the countries language in my case "Dutch" Servers as a legaly binding contract in the case of the eula
me: could this please be moved to the development team
me: because either give me a full dutch dashboard
me: or a full english dashboard
me: or let me choose what language i want to use
me: but a mixed dashboard is just sloppy
Support: Can you give an example of an item that shows up in English?  It may be possible it is a specific name that there isn't a translation for.  For instance some of the game and service names don't have a translation and in many languages will come up with the English name since there isn't a name in that language.
me: https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mqp9nMsyMGI/UJZXvR1VY4I/AAAAAAAABaA/J7lhuaKj-qc/s640/IMG_9058.JPG
me: if you look at the image you should be able to see
me: what shows up in dutch
me: and what shows up in english
me: seriously
me: i just want my dashboard back in english
me: or the option to choose english
Support: For security reasons I cannot view an image outside of a Microsoft page.
me: Account is showing up n english
me: home/social/privacy are some of the menu items showing up in english
me: Like i said and heard all over from people they want to be able to choose their language no matter where they stay.
me: There are alot of threads that popped up about people complaining about this
Support: I would recommend then suggesting this to our feedback link because as it stands now, the option does not exist.
Support: Feedback
me: Thank you Support
me: I will give my feedback through there
me: sorry for the long disscusion but its been a real pain.
me: trying to figure out
me: why we are getting mixed content
me: i appriciate your help
me: as always the xbox is a great console and i really love it. I really dont want to not buy a new console when its released because of, one trivial option not being available
Support: You're welcome, wish I could give more than that, but definitely feel free to provide that to others since the more suggestions we get the more likely such a feature will indeed be added.
me: Sorry if i came accross rude, that was not the case i know its not your fault
Support: Though some of those options that were showing in English, I put in Bing Translate and it couldn't translate them, so it may well be some items don't have a translation into Dutch as well.
me: I will definitly give people the feedback link as well
me: Thank you at least that explains the mixed content
me: so the gist of the problem would be no translation
me: for certain words
me: and that makes sens
me: sense
me: as for getting the dashboard back in english
me: we will do that via the feedback link
me: thank you :)
me: Have a great evening!
me: or morning
me: depending were you are chatting from
Support: Yes, or at least a translation that we aren't aware of, or something that can be translated and fit.  I know translation is a tricky beast indeed.
Support: Thanks for contacting Xbox Customer Support and have a great day!

me: thats correct

<p>To an extent MS Support is right: legally, they should be providing the product in the language of the region (which is why, for example, user manuals, EULAs, etc. need to be translated as well).</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>BUT, this does <strong>not</strong> mean that they are not allowed to serve English as a language as well... As long as the customer is able to set the language to his/her own language when he/she would feel that would be needed, that is fine.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>So, please give us back the option to chose.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>And if you are really that concerned about the legal implications (which you really shouldn't as long as you have the region language available as well): it was already set to English before, so if there would be any legal violation, it already was violated
 for several years in the past...</p>

<p>If there really were a legal requirement, then they'd have to translate all the help forums and pages as well. Yes, maybe the eula would have to be in your local language, but the console's menu should at all times be user-configurable. Making these decisions
 for all users is patronising and insulting. And in my opinion, bad business as well!!</p>

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Your purchased games should be in Store Settings (three dots at top right of Store app) &gt; My Library or Purchased apps.  Install from there. 
<br />
<br />If the app isn't Premium try resetting in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Solitaire &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.  There should be a way to contact their Support in the same location.  
<br />
<br />If not try re-registering the app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If the store is dysfunctional then I'll give you everything possible to repair the store.  Even if you've tried a step please do it over in this sequence:
<br /> 
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br /> 
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account because of the serious and persistent problem with corrupted accounts.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Buying from the Windows 8 Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i spiritus i  say:</h3>
<h2>            Buying from the Windows 8 Store</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm really here and at the end of my tether. I have been on the phone back and forth for about 3 hours between various departments, none of which could help me. I'm calling from the UK too, so it's even more difficult.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm having issues buying apps/games from the Windows 8 Store. I have payment methods assigned to my account and can buy/rent films using these methods without any issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I try to buy a game from the App Store or when trying to buy in game DLC (Disney Fairies - 2nd piece of DLC), I am asked to add a payment method as I do not have one associated with my account. I follow the steps and click the add button. I then can
 see the list of my cards and the option to add more if I like. No matter what I select, I receive the following message:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We can't authorize the payment method. Please make sure the information is correct, or use another payment method. If you continue to get this message, please contact your financial institution. Error details 30225-GOVJFQAAAAAAAAAA-78df542c-9d3b-4476-a08d-a4dae9f5ddce
<br />
<br />
I have checked with my financial institution and have been assured there are no blocks etc on my account (plus I can buy movies and pay for items via the Xbox Dashbaord &amp; my Windows Phone no problem at all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have noticed that I have some how managed to get a TT &amp; US account associated to my GB account, could this be causing some kind of conflict?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have also came off the online chat to a very rude individual. I love all Microsoft products. I've got W8, A Surface RT, 360, WP8 and will be getting a X1 but I'm getting really annoyed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Support for older Crystal Reports component in Windows 7 64-bit OS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> senthil kumar chandramohan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Support for older Crystal Reports component in Windows 7 64-bit OS</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have a VB6 application that makes use of older Crystal Reports (v4/5) component. When I run the application in a Windows 7 (64-bit) machine, it throws an error message that says:</p>
<p><strong>"Failed to load control 'CrystalReport' from crystl32.tlb. Your version of crystl32.tlb&nbsp; may be outdated. Make sure you are using the version of the control that was provided with your application. Error No: 372"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I managed to register this component (OCX)&nbsp;using "regsvr32"&nbsp;successfully, but I still face this issue when I run the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it caused because of incompatibility (32-bit vs 64-bit)? Any ideas? Please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Senthil C</p>

<h2>            How to install Windows 8.1 Enterprise on Ultrabook which came with basic Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'm not the first one with this question but anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got 2000EUR expensive Ultrabook recently, and what's interesting it came with Windows 8.1. Just standard basic Windows 8.1, not Pro or Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously I needed to upgrade it with larger SSD 1Tb and install Windows 8.1 Enterprise as I need Hyper-V and other Enterprise version functionality on day to day bases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was surprised that I can't do so as SLIC is reverting Windows 8.1 back to basics!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">So my question is</span> - <strong>How can I can Windows 8.1 Enterprise 64Bit on to very expensive Ultrabook which came with Windows 8.1?!?!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Kon</p>

            <p><strong>OK, I found some work around however I'm not happy about it and I would like
<p>
</p><p><strong>P.S. If you have solution or already got answer from Microsoft please post it here!!!</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Here is work around which others in the same situation may try and hopefully it will help -&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I found an option in the Windows 8 install process that provided me with a workaround to allow me to finally install my copy of Windows 8 Enterprise, rather than having to stick with Windows 8 Standard OEM.
</p>
<p>This “option” involves the ei.cfg file that Microsoft removed from Windows 8 install media. It was a configuration file that allowed you to specify which version of Windows you wanted to install. You cannot simply modify the Windows 8 install ISO and add
 the ei.cfg file, as mentioned before, the DVD will not boot. </p>
<p>The "option" I found, is that during the install process, Windows 8 install still does a cursory check on all accessible drives for the ei.cfg file, even though they intentionally removed it from all of their install media. The cursory check Windows 8 install
 does, also includes USB drives that are attached. I had a custom ei.cfg on my thumb drive, which Windows picked up, which finally allowed me to select my OS version!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; Here's what you'll need:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 8 installation DVD (unmodified), retail, or a burned copy from an ISO downloaded from Microsoft</li><li>Windows 8 installation ISO</li><li>Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">free, from Microsoft</a></li><li>USB thumb drive, large enough for the Windows 8 installation DVD (4GB is fine)</li></ul>
<p><br />
1. Burn a copy of the Windows 8 install DVD (assuming you purchased a key, and didn't buy the retail DVD) using your favorite image burning tool. I prefer Nero or ImgBurn.<br />
2. Open the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool, select the Microsoft Windows 8 installation ISO as your source file, hit Next, and then select USB device. Select your thumb drive and then "Begin Copying"<br />
3. Once your "bootable" thumb drive is ready, open it in Explorer and navigate to the "sources" directory.<br />
4. Using notepad, create a new Text file. Name it ei.cfg. The contents should be as follows:</p>
<p><strong><em>[Channel]</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>volume</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>[VL]</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>1</em></strong></p>
<p>5. Save the file and exit.&nbsp;<br />
6. Insert the Windows 8 installation DVD, as well as the Windows 8 installation USB drive you just created (with the added ei.cfg).<br />
7. Reboot. Your notebook will boot from DVD and take you to the Windows 8 install interface. Hit "Install Now".<br />
8. You'll now be presented with the choice of what version of OS to install. Remove the DVD. When you select the version and hit next, installation will occur from the USB!<br />
9. Enjoy being able to use the OS you paid for, on the machine you also paid for that didn't want you to install anything other than what it came with.</p>

    <title>Message from webpage. TypeError&#58; Unable to get property - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacksonrapos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Message from webpage. TypeError&#58; Unable to get property &#39;trim&#39; of undefined or null reference.</h2>
                    Even though it says message from webpage, it seems this message appears even when I am simply starting up my laptop. I do not know why this has been happening though it has been happening for about a total of four months. The reason I say total is for
 about fifteen days this problem halted but now it has returned. I have also noticed that this problem is linked with video lag, and videos that are more blurred but only for moments at a time (It has happened repeatedly in one video if longer then four minutes).
 It also appears on non-webpage products that I am using, it also happens in a pair of two to three messages. Troubleshooting does not appear to work as I have tried it and I has not helped. Is there anyone willing to help me?

            I did not have it uninstalled, thank you for your help. Hopefully this will stop the problem, as it interferes with not only my video usage but as well as interrupts my typing and writing of papers.

    <title>&#34;No Sound Card Was Found&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelsey o&#39;banion  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;No Sound Card Was Found&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today my computer was fine. I was playing a game, my speakers were working, everything was hunky-dory.</p>
<p>About three hours ago I went to watch YouTube and surprise! My audio wasn't working. I tried using my headphones at first, then my speakers. Neither worked. I looked to the bottom of my screen to see a red X above the audio icon. I right click and see this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4eab44b7-77e4-4bc8-b440-2b26a4c02a8b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4eab44b7-77e4-4bc8-b440-2b26a4c02a8b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>So of course I go to Google. Everything I looked at says to update my driver. I tried going to Device Manager&gt;Sound, Video and Game Controllers, which is where the audio driver would usually be found. But lo and behold, the only things that show up are my
 bluetooth headset and earbuds:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83c7b235-e08a-4857-b327-a397457036c7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83c7b235-e08a-4857-b327-a397457036c7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>And again in the playback devices, the driver or speakers could not be found:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f26d1172-6932-4952-92dd-c136bb84738b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f26d1172-6932-4952-92dd-c136bb84738b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I went online to find the audio driver for my specific computer (Acer Aspire A515-51) and found I needed a Realtek audio driver (version&nbsp;6.0.1.8451). I downloaded the driver, installed it, and restarted my computer. Nothing happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran&nbsp;dxdiag.exe and went into the Sound tab. In the window at the bottom it said "No sound card was found. If one is expected, you should install a sound driver provided by the hardware manufacturer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this laptop for not quite a year. I haven't installed any updates recently; I am using Windows 10 version 1803. I need an answer. What happened to my audio driver and how can I fix it????</p>

<h2>            slow loading, get black screen after password entered, must reboot several times</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a laptop with windows 10.&nbsp; When booting up, after entering my password the screen goes black with only the cursor showing. Have to reboot 4 to 5 times and re-enter password before Microsoft will load. Geek Squad rep said there was a problem
 with a Microsoft update that is causing this to occur? Is there a Microsoft "fix" for this problem yet?</p>

            Hi  LorettaHayden ,

What is the make and model of your computer?

Are you connected to the Internet when this happens? 
If so, I recommend you disconnect from it then try again.

Are you able to reach the sign in screen?

It sounds like its trying to install updates on sign in. 

Give this a try at the sign in screen:
Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
Click Troubleshoot
Click Reset this PC

Remain disconnected from the Internet while this happens. 

See if you are able to complete the setup, then follow the instructions to setup and configure your computer.

I recommend, when setting it, use a Local Account first, you can always switch to a Microsoft Account after reaching the desktop.
