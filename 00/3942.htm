            Am so happy today because the world has become mine, i never believed my wife will ever come back to me anymore, because she said that she rather die than coming back to me again, my wife whose name is Jasmine, left me with three kids, i feel so unhappy
 and bad not because she left me but because she left me and follow my best friend, i never knew friends were this, the person who i called my best friend maked my wife to divorced and abandoned our children in my hands, how does this happen? my friend visited
 a white witch doctor, and casted a spell on my wife and the mind of my wife turned against me and this make her to give me a letter of divorcement which makes me feel bad, including the kids they feel bad that their mum has left them, i tried all i could to
 have her back but she refuses and say that she rather die than coming back to me, call me all sought of names, and started dating the person who i called my best friend, this make me feel so bad and thinks badly, to be frank with my words i wanted to shoot
 this guy to dead but my minds won't allow me, the children does not eat anymore neither goes to school, they always ask me "Dad when will mum come back to us?" i keep telling them very soon, this makes me to consult help in getting ex lover back when i found
 many testimonies about a man called Dr. Olubam, this was surprising hearing this, i read alot of testimonies concerning him, more than 1000 testimonies about him from different people, this gives me courage and zeal to feel that my wife "Jasmine" will come
 back again to me, i called Dr. Olubam and explain everything to him, we also talks on email and other social websites, i entered his website what i saw about him was really great and wonderful, he told me never to worry about anything, that i has met the right
 person and everything is going to be fine since i have contacted him, he ask for my picture and the picture of my wife, which i sent to him, he told me to gives him some hours, after some hours really he mailed me back and requested for some things which i
 sent to him, he told me after three days my wife is going to pack all her belongings and come back to me, i thought it was just a words of jokes, i lock up and decided to excercise patience till three days time, according to what Dr said, the next day which
 was the third day, my wife really came back with her belongings and kneeled before me and the kids, she ask for forgiveness with tears and we all forgive her and accept her back, now we are now living full well happy and smiles in our face all through and
 for the person i called my friend who betrayed me, dr returned the spell which he casted on my wife to come back to him, and this happen after the three days time as i am speaking with you now the guy is now mad in the street, all gives thanks to Dr. Olubam
 for what he has done for me and our kids, may the good lord continue to bless him forever till he is called, i will loved to leave doctors information here online because someone might find help from him too..<br />

<h2>            DST Outlook 2007 and Windows Mobile</h2>
                    Well, my DST updater got me with the right time when I got up this morning. BUT now all the appointments in my Outlook 2007 are one hour later than when they actually are.&nbsp; For instance, 4pm appointments are listed at 5pm.&nbsp; Then 7am appointments are now
 listed at 8am.&nbsp; It is the same on my mobile device (samsung saga).&nbsp; So the only way to fix this on my computer is to turn off the auto update on my computer for time and then manually turn off DST.<br />
Please help.

If you run Outlook on the PC as well, then after installing the DST update for your PDAs and PCs, you should download and run the

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to see what you see in the About Excel dialog. Unless you provide that information, I can only take guesses about what version is actually installed on your Mac. Telling me AutoUpdate installed updates doesn't tell
 me <em>which</em> update AutoUpdate has put onto your particular Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you have installed Excel version 15.36 or later, the next thing to check is whether you have an add-in that loads automatically when Excel opens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Tools menu and choose Add-ins. Uncheck all checked add-ins to deactivate them, and then quit Excel and see if you still get the error message. If the message is gone, then active add-ins one at a time until you figure out which one is causing the
 error.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER has on this<br />
machines including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
If no joy something maybe blocking it.<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />

IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />

<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />

                    <p>Is there a Wildcard code for "Bookmark"?</p>
<p>I wish to navigate through a document from bookmark to bookmark by using the Select Browse Object and the Next function below it. For this to work I need to have a code in the Find box first.</p>

            <p>It would be nice if there were a code or browse object for this, but I don't believe there is. It's not listed under

            <p>thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>nothing major really, just having to add bookmarks which occur in one document to multiple others, and just thought that could be an easier method.<br />
But what I have done is assigned a keyboard shortcut to open the Bookmark window, have the bookmarks&nbsp;in location order, and so (with the keyboard)&nbsp;I can quickly select each bookmark in order, and goto the location, and with the other document Sync'd, it is
 working&nbsp;quite quickly :)</p>
<p>Just a one off exercise, so no fancy macro required ;-)</p>

            Okay. This could be a feature request. At least when user-created bookmarks are displayed, there ought to be some easy way to find them. Bookmarks created by Word are always elusive, even in the Bookmark dialog.

    <title>I&#39;m finally ready to admit that Zune&#47;Xbox&#47;Groove Music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cori g  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m finally ready to admit that Zune&#47;Xbox&#47;Groove Music won&#39;t get better &#42;snip&#42;</h2>
                    <p>...at least not under the current leadership.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Microsoft for music stretching back several years.&nbsp; I had the original Zune mp3 player, then the Zune HD (still works).&nbsp; I've stuck with Zune through Windows Phone 7 and now as Groove on Windows 10/mobile.&nbsp; I've watched each iteration of
 "Microsoft Music" get worse.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The original Zune software, while dated, is still pretty amazing.&nbsp; Even today it's still leaps and bounds better than other music software.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's&nbsp;counting the desktop software&nbsp;and WP7/8 versions.&nbsp; Then something with horribly wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly two years
 ago, December 2013,&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;released a standalone&nbsp;Xbox Music app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reasons that are well documented, the standalone Xbox Music app was nothing short of terrible.&nbsp; I don't think most people thought much of it&nbsp;because it wasn't the default music app yet.&nbsp; Then, for what we can only assume was an act of madness, that terrible
 standalone app became the default player on Windows Phone&nbsp;8.1.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been bad ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, that includes the Windows 8 version of Xbox Music as well.&nbsp; All versions of Xbox Music have slowly tried to dig their way out of a hole and have not made any headway.&nbsp; I know Joe Belfiore made a big push to improve Xbox Music but ultimately the app
 is still just flat out bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here we are with Groove Music and Windows 10/Mobile.&nbsp; Let me start by saying that I just finished a fresh install of Windows 10
<em>yesterday.</em>&nbsp; So I add some music to the Music folder and it loads in Groove music just fine.&nbsp; I add some more music... it doesn't show up in Groove.&nbsp; Twice now I've had to close the app and restart it just to sync my music.&nbsp; So here's a new problem
 - <em>in addition to</em> - all the previous problems.&nbsp; <em>At least</em> Xbox Music properly added my music to the collection.&nbsp; And let's add to this the annoyance of switching between Groove and the Windows Store whenever I want to actually buy a song.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm seriously flabbergasted at how Groove Music is actually worse.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also using Groove/W10 mobile&nbsp;on my Lumia 1520.&nbsp; I know it's supposedly in "early" form but I have little faith that Groove will get significantly better.&nbsp; Everything from Zune to now is exactly why I have little faith.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So back to my first sentence...&nbsp; This is Microsoft, one of the biggest (and sometimes one of the best) software companies in the world.&nbsp; They're&nbsp;producing such amazing software&nbsp;with Windows 10, Xbox One, Hololens and many other things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why can't Microsoft produce a functional music app?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it's because they can't.&nbsp; I think someone at Microsoft has deemed Groove music of little importance.&nbsp; They're more than happy to toss some fresh paint on it, spin a brand new name, and sell you another sub - but actually fixing the app is at
 the bottom of the list.&nbsp; It must be.&nbsp; That's the only way to make sense of a music app sucking for this long.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clear that&nbsp;significant enhancements won't happen until Satya finally says, "<em>Hey man, we should prioritize fixing our music service."</em> But I have a feeling that he, like the rest of the decision makers at Microsoft, don't care.&nbsp;

            <p>I'm in a similar historical situation. Let me address a couple of your points from what I've seen now and over the years.</p>
<p>1. A default music player can be changed with one click. Even in Windows 10. Use whatever you want.</p>
<p>2. Zune and Zune software still works. I use it. You can, too.</p>
<p>3. You can use Zune player with the entire Groove online collection. Uses the old WMP10 DRM, which is different from Groove DRM (or Xbox Music DRM), so you can't play anything you downloaded in Zune in Groove. However, anything downloaded in Zune plays in
 Zune and Windows Media Player. </p>
<p>4. Apparently there is no more "cloud match". I used it without issue, but apparently there were many issues with this. Microsoft has not answered my direct questions on the status of "cloud match" but it appears dead.</p>
<p>5. It seems syncing of "owned music" as well as streaming of that is now accomplished by actually uploading your owned library to OneDrive..
</p>
<p>6. I have been a Microsoft guy forever. One thing Microsoft is historically terrible at is documenting
<em>anything.</em></p>
<p>They made some major changes to music and failed to tell anyone why. Or how they envision the new system to be an improvement (I'm sure they think this internally). If there is one single thing Apple does exceptionally well and Microsoft does exceptionally
 bad, it is "selling" a products features. This involves explaining those features. Do you hear this Microsoft? Words can't describe how poorly you have done this forever. I believe it is well known in Redmond, too. They are aware that for many years, 95% of
 the feature requests in Office were for features that were already there. Nobody knew! True.</p>
<p>7. The people who are good enough to provide some official help from Microsoft are not the head honchos and are probably operating under some kind of limited gag rule. If they are working on a fix or feature emphatically asked for here, they may not be able
 to say. Maybe it won't work. Maybe it creates other issues. Who knows. It may never happen, may not happen soon or any number of reasons making a statement about an upcoming feature would be worse than saying nothing.
</p>
<p>8. Somewhat off the subject, but my personal opinion is the <em>entire </em>blowback on Windows 8 was due to Microsoft's total failure to provide any documentation at all. Not even a tutorial on something like how to close a window. Nothing. This sounds
 similar to Groove, eh? </p>
<p>9. Microsoft would do well to remember that the Apple revolution started with the iPod. Then iTunes. Music can be a big deal.
</p>
<p>10. That's enough for now. </p>

            <p>I actually keep the Zune .exe on my external hard drive in case I decide to install it again.&nbsp; In fact, I did the Zune /Xbox Music DRM juggle for over a year.&nbsp; I'd download a song on my PC using Zune and then I'd have to do the same on my phone using Xbox
 Music.&nbsp; It wasn't like the good old days with my Lumia 900.&nbsp; Back then I could download a ton of stuff through Zune, connect my phone via USB, and let Zune sync everything automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I feel forced to micromanage my&nbsp;collection because I never know
 when Xbox Music/Groove is going to mess something up.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't keep the juggle up though.&nbsp; I often use my phone as an mp3 player and eventually it seemed like an unnecessary complication to juggle the various DRM.&nbsp; I thought it would be simple to stick with one service.&nbsp; I know there's the phone companion
 app which is supposed to make syncing between PC and phone easy, but it was terrible the last time I used it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought maybe I could get away with going OneDrive only but even that is&nbsp;flawed.&nbsp; Groove on my PC can see the music I have stored on OneDrive.&nbsp; However, Groove on my phone can't.&nbsp; I know, Groove on mobile is still in&nbsp;the "early" stages, but even Xbox Music
 could find music on OneDrive.&nbsp; One would naturally assume that the features that worked before would continue to work.&nbsp; To add insult to injury, neither my playlists have synced from PC to phone, nor the songs that I added to my streaming collection.&nbsp;

            <p>I understand the situation well, as I'm in the same one. I have to download 2 versions of the same songs to satisfy Groove (phone and PC) and my Zune HD. I know Microsoft pays the record labels different amounts for downloaded tracks and streamed tracks.
 I wonder if they calculate how much extra (if any) they pay to download two of everything for people like us. If it is significant, I also wonder when they will just decide to eliminate Zune support for downloads altogether. As you know, they did that already
 for apps and video. You can't "buy" anything on Zune anymore. I can only stream new stuff on WiFi or sync new stuff via the Zune software. We're one small step from removing Zune from the subscription stuff totally.

            Agreed. It's so frustrating how they clearly are retarded when is comes to this, and if history has anything to show, they won't learn their lesson until everyone complains and Microsoft starts to lose a lot of money to Sony. Zune was, and is, the best
 as far as a music player goes. The only thing outdated about it is its ui, which isn't that bad to begin with

            A year later, what are your thoughts on Groove's updates and updates and updates? Right direction? They just added meta data editing for Fast Ring Insiders. Seems they are building something great. *fingers crossed* They just need that passion to continue
 from top down and bottom up.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, you are unable to sign in Skype for Business client in a wireless router.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check if the problem is related to the network or the Skype for Business desktop application, please try using a network cable to connect your computer to the network and then check if the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please try the Office 365 Skype setup for manual configuration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the<span>&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;</span>icon in the upper-right,<span>&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong></span>, then<span>&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong></span>.</li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;<strong>Personal</strong>&nbsp;</span>and the<span>&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;</span>button.</li><li>Enter<span>&nbsp;<strong>sipdir.online.lync.com:443</strong>&nbsp;</span>as the Internal and External server under<span>&nbsp;<strong>Manual configuration</strong></span>.</li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;</span>twice and try to sign-in again.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please tell us the detailed version of the Skype for Business client. If you see any error message, please also give us some screenshots for further analyze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

            <p>The 520 is among the phones that is since the A.U release no longer supported.</p>
<p>This has been mentioned at the feedback hub a while ago and also on many websites.</p>
<p>The older and unsupported will after the A.U release no longer be able to update to windows 10 mobile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And it doesn't matter if you try through insider or other wise, it will never update/upgrade to windows 10 mobile.</p>
<p>The few that are running windows 10 mobile insider builds are unsupported older builds basically. They are lucky that MSFT even has released a new build for those devices.</p>
<p>But that build is only available on the old devices that were a part of the insider program and are still on windows 10 mobile</p>

    <title>Proofing exception and spell checking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alevargas321  say:</h3>
<h2>            Proofing exception and spell checking</h2>
                    <p>Every time I create a new document in Word, it is automatically added under "Proofing Exception" despite the fact that I did not select the box "All New Documents". As seen from the screenshot, I tried renaming the document so it wouldn't be a proofing exception
 but that didn't work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As well when I go under Review &gt; Language &gt; Set proofing Language, the "Do Not Check Spelling or Grammar" is selected so I uncheck the box. But even as I am in the middle of typing the box gets checked, as I can tell from the misspelled words that stop getting
 underlined. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier, I had been working on a macro-enabled document and before I opened that document the spellcheck was fine so I believe it may have to do with that. I tried saving the Normal template as NOT macro-enabled but that didn't work since in my files it
 still shows it is macro-enabled. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>

            Open the Normal template again and make sure that "Do not check" is not enabled and Hide Spelling/Grammar Errors is not turned on. Turning off "Detect language automatically" will also help. Then press the Spacebar and Backspace (to "dirty" the file so
 it will be saved) and save it. Then try again with a new document.

<p>
</p><p>By its nature, the normal template must be macro-enabled .dotm.</p>
<p>You cannot save a different document or template as your normal.dotm. If you try to do this with Word closed, you will get a partially-functioning or non-functioning Word program.</p>

<p>Every time I create a new document in Word, it is automatically added under "Proofing Exception" despite the fact that I did not select the box "All New Documents". As seen from the screenshot, I tried renaming the document so it wouldn't be a proofing exception
 but that didn't work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As well when I go under Review &gt; Language &gt; Set proofing Language, the "Do Not Check Spelling or Grammar" is selected so I uncheck the box. But even as I am in the middle of typing the box gets checked, as I can tell from the misspelled words that stop getting

    <title>Battery calibration issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffery tang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery calibration issue</h2>
                    <div>My Lumia 920 just now low battery, then I not go for recharge, after that it shut down as expected.</div>
<div>Then I go switch on again, amazingly it still got 70% battery life.</div>
<div>My question is why the phone battery calibration act weirdly?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First full charge can last for 4 days above</div>
<div>Second full charge 2 days above</div>
<div>Third full charge 1 day above</div>
<div>It will keep decreasing...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example this is the battery</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>0 - battery space</div>
<div>1 - 0% battery state</div>
<div>2 - 100% battery state</div>
<div>? - hidden battery power</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1000000002 - on first full charge</div>
<div>?????10002 - on second full charge</div>
<div>???????102 - on third full charge</div>
<div>1000000002 - 70% battery available after it auto shut down due to low battery and turned on</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seems that once you recharge your battery, The 0% battery state will reset at the time you recharge.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there anyway to fix that dynamic (1) so that we not need to calibrate the battery frequently?</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in the forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case I would recommend to bring&nbsp;your phone to the shop. </p>
<p>Replacement of&nbsp;the battery is probably the only way to resolve it. </p>

            <p>I think it is probably some app in the phone. Before you head to repair, you should probably think about any app that you might have installed since this battery drain pattern started showing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I once had an issue where the battery would just drain crazy after installing the preview version of Skype.

            I didn't install Skype. Sometimes I leave it unused for a day, the difference between battery percentage are really unusual. According to my experience, an hour of standby time will use 2% of the battery power if leave it unused by these setting:
<div><br />
<div>Data Network disabled</div>
<div>WiFi only turn on while in use</div>
<div>WeChat background task running</div>

<div>I didn't install much app into my phone, since the phone itself already has those built-in features which are far more enough for me to explore.</div>

            <p>I was only using Skype as an example. Apps can have some serious battery consumption, sometimes, unintentionally. Side Note - the latest version of Skype does not have any adverse effect on battery life :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming back to your issue, all I can think of is for you to do a complete phone reset and see how it takes. I see that you have a 920 but I will anyway share my battery life times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use my 510 sparingly - half an hour of speaking per day, occasional email and browsing - phone lasts 4 to&nbsp;5 days on a single charge.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>820 used regularly - graphically intense gaming, constant browsing, FB and app usage and with WiFi on, about 8 to 15 hours. 920 has a bigger battery but it also has to drive a more powerful screen, which takes the edge off the better battery unfortunately.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, a note about Battery calibration. I don't believe&nbsp;our phone batteries need to be calibrated. Why&nbsp;I am saying this is that I randomly keep connecting my phone to a power source disconnecting&nbsp;as&nbsp;the 820 is primarily used as a developer phone.&nbsp;It hasn't
 had any negative impact on battery life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I done hard reset, send for warranty, use for few recharge cycles and only charge when it reach critical, the problem still persist.
<div><br />
<div>This morning 8.00am I recharge my phone with 6% battery left, I checked my phone battery every half an hour, 28% at 8.30am 48% at 9.00am and get full charge after 9.30am, that's really weird.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I left it untouched for 12 hours, the battery reading is 58%.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So my final solution, is it safe to restart my phone every time I get a full charge to achieve 4 days battery life?</div>

            <p>Looks like I missed it when you posted in June. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not facing any of the battery issues that you are reporting. I don't follow any pattern with my phone charging. I just plug it in when I feel like. It could be half full, quarter full or 3/4th full.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On those days when I let it run its course, I get 24 hours on light usages (just phone calls and some basic browsing) or 8 hours (2 hours of gaming, 2 - 3 hours of reading, constant app usage and IM chatting).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot put a pin, as to why, your phone is behaving this way man. </p>

                    Before this evening my computer worked well. &nbsp;Then Microsoft updated and now I have non-functioning computer. &nbsp;So much for working this evening. &nbsp;It looks like the repair is to go and get a mouse so that requires a trip to a store and a purchase. &nbsp;I really
 have a problem with Microsoft creating difficulties that they then don't solve. &nbsp;As I scroll through, preview users have been complaining about this for awhile. &nbsp;So, why isn't there a fix, or better yet why didn't they undo their "update". &nbsp;I'm just a user
 of the technology with no other knowledge so I can't surmise what is going on in techy-land. &nbsp;All I can do is type my angry complaint in hopes that someone out there will listen.

<p>SOLVED:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the Synaptics driver from Programs and Features then rebooted.</p>
<p>No more DCP Watchdog Violation BSOD and mouse&nbsp;pad&nbsp;is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:</p>
<p>This machine originally migrated to Win 10 from an 8.1 install and Synaptics driver&nbsp;had been&nbsp;installed under 8.1.</p>
<p>No previous build, anyway, suffered from this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Errata Corrige: USB ports were functioning. (It's been&nbsp;my mistake plugging the wrong cable.... :-( ) (xoxo)</p>

            <p>The issue is not completely solved and there's a lot of bugs annoying the correct/smooth operational flow.</p>
<p>For example UI0detect.exe process related to search functions of Cortana/Start is&nbsp;set to&nbsp;Manual and doesn't start, even&nbsp;if I force it.</p>
<p>No Search, white Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even Update notifies me constantly that a Restart is scheduled but I don't have any evidence on MUI Update and Recovery page.</p>
<p>If I restart manually, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the Synaptics Driver, once uninstalled as I wrote in my previous comments, Windows 10 forced me to update to the new driver...</p>
<p>This locked my mouse pad and&nbsp;activated again the BSOD&nbsp;DCP Watchdog Violation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along this, there's the well-known problem with the Intel Wi-Fi Link AGN 4965 compatibility&nbsp;and the related event ID 5010 flooding my event viewer&nbsp;with the classic wake-up problems of the board if machine&nbsp;is waking-up from stand-by mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last is a certified bug with no future solution since Intel didn't plan an update for these old boards (as for 3945 ABG). I had the same Wi-Fi problems on another PC with Win 8 and 10, later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on the other LAN machines of mine, on which I'm testing Win 10, I never experienced such a kind of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This buggy Notebook is the only one where the 10 install was an upgrade from 8.1.</p>
<p>And many of the issue I described are present in 8.1 forum and never on this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think I will try to recover/reinstall the OS (since the previous installed build, 9926,&nbsp;has ever worked fine).</p>

            <p>Ok....</p>
<p>Now everything's clear.</p>
<p>To avoid BSOD DCP_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION (in my case instantaneous as I put a finger on my touchpad), I have to uninstall the Synaptics Program/Driver installed automatically by Win 10 TP (10074 in my case.</p>
<p>Anyway is then reinstalled at any reboot.</p>
<p>No way to avoid this.</p>
<p>Here there are some shots:</p>

    <title>Set alerts for excel and word documents , Safari Browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set alerts for excel and word documents , Safari Browser</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all</p>
<p>I started work for a new company who gave me a mac and office 365 subscription for business.</p>
<p>What I would like to do is to be able to create shared documents in word and excel, and then set alerts for any changes on the collaborative documents.</p>
<p>EG.</p>
<p>I add new information to an excel sheet and the people who it is shared with receive an email / update that there has been added information and vice versa.</p>
<p>I have been through several posts and can not find a definitive answer, and am still looking for how find and to restore the alerts ribbon. Possibly return it to "classic View"?</p>
<p>I'm using a Mac and safari browser, and am a user but not an admin.</p>
<p>Could someone help please as surely alerts are still available.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Martin.</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>Yes, we need to return to classic view to set the alerts.</p>
<p>To set an alert on a document, select the file then click the Files tab, click Alert Me -&gt; Set alert on this document.</p>
<p>Note: if you don’t see the Files tab, click the gear on the upper right corner and then turn on Ribbon.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p><span>Please make backup before applying this type of reset, since it will restore the phone’s settings to factory default as well as erasing all the data in the phone memory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><u><strong>1st option</strong></u></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Soft Reset (when you CAN still use the phone's touchscreen)</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to use the touchscreen dialer to enter these codes:</li><li><span>*<strong>#7780# if you want to restore factory settings only and it will NOT delete data.</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>*#7370# if you want to reformat your phone and delete all the data in it.</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span>Press Select.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Voila, your phone is back to normal.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Congratulations.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><u><strong>Last option</strong></u></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Hard Reset (if you CANNOT use anymore the phone's touchscreen)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><br />
</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>You need to use the phone's buttons and your 4 fingers to do this trick.&nbsp;<i>😉</i></li><li>Switch off the phone. (Remove the battery if you cannot turn it off)</li><li>Press the buttons: GREEN + RED + CAMERA + ON simultaneously (DO NOT LET GO OF THE BUTTONS) until you see the “Select Country” option after the Nokia's Handshake Welcome Logo appear.<i>😲</i></li><li>Choose your country, enter the date and time.</li><li>Voila, your phone is back to normal.</li><li>Congratulations.</li></ol>
<div><strong>Note:</strong></div>
<div>If you were asked for a code, just type: 12345 (unless you change it)</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;&gt; If none of these help you, try reinstalling software from the SOFTWARE UPDATES section of the latest Nokia Suite. If still problem persists, contact a Nokia service centre but you will need to pay a small fees at the service center if your phone is
 not covered by warranty.</div>

    <title>Operating Budget using Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fdl_400  say:</h3>
<h2>            Operating Budget using Access</h2>
                    <p>I am needing to find a way to use the data from&nbsp;a few&nbsp;excel documents to create reports for the amount to budget for each fiscal year and have no idea about how to do so. It seems logical that Access would somehow work for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One Excel file has data concerning device rotation. For instance every&nbsp;5 years,&nbsp;the&nbsp;staff workstations will be&nbsp;replaced, every 7 years the routers will be replaced,...</p>
<p>Another Excel&nbsp;doc contains data about service contract renewals . For instance, every year the HVAC maintenance agreement will auto-renew. Every 3 years the website will auto-renew, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <pre>Yes you could do it by importing the spreadsheets into Access.
But, you probably can do it Excel too, using "advanced" features like
- Get and Transform
- Excel Tables
- Pivot Tables
- Business Intelligence
all culminating in "Dashboards"
The scope of your question is certainly "bigger than a bread box", and way beyond the kind of help we can provide here. 
Here are some links to articles and webinar recordings showing some of the things you can do with excel
The best advice I can give you is "break the problem down into small steps".  Solve the small steps/problems and then you can build up to the bigger overall picture.
Other than that, start by getting familiar with "get and transform" and "data cleansing" so you can merge all of your spreadsheets. After that 
Consider taking one or more of the courses being shilled in these webinars. Many of them are offered by Excel MVPs, experts in Excel who have been recognized by MS as such. You can trust them. Most of the courses give you subsequent access to the experts so you can ask specific questions about your problem.   
@ Get &amp; Transform in Excel 2016 Intro -   https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-Transform-in-Excel-2016-881c63c6-37c5-4ca2-b616-59e18d75b4de 
Excel 2016 includes a powerful new set of features called Get &amp; Transform, which provides fast, easy data gathering and shaping capabilities. Get &amp; Transform enables you to connect, combine, and refine data sources to meet your analysis needs. These features are also used in Power BI, and in the Power Query Add-In available for previous versions of Excel. Links to more info about using the feature. 
@ Getting Started with Get &amp; Transform in Excel 2016 https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Getting-Started-with-Get-Transform-in-Excel-2016-a8310388-2a12-438c-9d29-c6d29cb8df6a 
With Get &amp; Transform in Excel 2016, you can search for data sources, make connections, and then shape that data (for example remove a column, change a data type, or merge tables) in ways that meet your needs. Once you’ve shaped your data, you can share your findings or use your query to create reports.

It was great to see the excitement around Power Query and PowerPivot, but this meant there were lots of questions about these tools, so I’ll attempt to answer them here.

In this video we finally help Andy put the dashboard together.  This dashboard will help communicate our findings and tell a story about the performance of our business.  
The great part about using pivot tables and pivot charts is that they are very easy to update.  When next month rolls around, we simply paste the new data to the bottom of our source data sheet, update the source range, and hit the Refresh button.  It will only take a few minutes a month to maintain. 
This video is packed with tips for working with Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.  Here are some of the topics covered.
    The Report Filters area explained.
    Group dates into months and years to create a summary trend report and chart.
    Group amounts to create a distribution chart (histogram).  
    Resize all charts to be the same size.
    Prevent charts from resizing when column widths and row heights are changed.
    Add slicers to make the dashboard interactive.

<h3> ninoes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2003 Email Address Change</h2>
                    
<p>I have started working for someone who has Microsoft Outlook 2003 and she wants me to change the current email address name (which includes the previous girl who worked there's name one it) to read my name, example*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp;
 I have gone into the email change area but can't seem to change the address so the name reads my name rather than hers.&nbsp; Is this possible or do I need to set up a new account?&nbsp; I am worried about deleting hers and then not being able to receive emails from
 her clients.&nbsp; Or is there a way I can set up a new account and post a message to anyone emailing the old address to say that the email has changed.&nbsp; Thanks</p>
