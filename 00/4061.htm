<h2>            PDF conversion</h2>
                    I am having trouble when converting a Word document to a PDF with Office 365 for Mac. In particular, the font Noteworthy changes to Arial or similar. How can I stop this happening?

<p><span>Hi ShoHay,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tested again with all these three fonts in the same Office and OS version but no issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems these fonts are all the pre-designed fonts in Office but not any third-party fonts.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It’s also strange the issue happens to multiple fonts in safe boot.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try the following steps to repair the font book and check if the issue persists,
</span></p>
<p><span>1. Quit all Office applications.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Go to your Font Book application &gt; click File &gt; Validate Font.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If step 2 doesn't work, please click File &gt;&nbsp;Restore Standard Fonts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you re-install the Office to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Rena&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Under <b>Send\Receive Groups</b> window click on<b>Edit</b>. </span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Check the option <b>Include the Selected Option in this Group,</b>under
<b>Folder Options</b> highlight<b>Inbox</b> under MAPI account and check the option<b>Download Headers Only.</b>
</span></li><li><span>Click Ok and check if Outlook downloads the emails. </span></li></ul>

<h2>            Unknown Hard Error - Explorer.exe System Warning - Windows 10 Technical Preview</h2>
                    <p>After being forced to download and install an update with Windows 10, I am getting the Explorer.exe System Warning Hard Error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked up some directions on how to fix this on the forum and I found this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows + R&nbsp;</strong>and type&nbsp;<strong>regedit.exe</strong></li><li>Navigate to this location:&nbsp;<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows</strong></li><li>In the&nbsp;<em>left</em>&nbsp;pane of this registry location, take the ownership of&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;key.</li><li>Now highlight the&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;key in the left pane and in the right pane look for the registry string (REG_SZ) named&nbsp;<strong>Load.</strong></li><li>The Value data of this registry is the root cause of this issue. Right click over Load and select&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>. Close the Registry Editor and reboot the machine.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is with this, when I go to the location in regedit.exe, I don't see a&nbsp;<strong>Load</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also my network card has been disabled and it seems there are a numerous amount of problems. I am not able to open the start menu at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can run checkdisk in admin mode from Windows Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can revert back to my old Windows OS from this error?</p>

<h2>            iOS Mobile integration not working on lock screen</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the most recent Skype for Business and iOS as of this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I'm having is although I can receive calls with mobile integration when my iPhone is unlocked, I never see calls come in when the phone is locked (no visual or audio indications).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked through iOS settings to see if somehow it's silenced, but can't for the life of me find anything that may be causing this issue. I've also tried deleting the app (along with the settings) and reinstalling and re-entering my credentials, but that
 didn't resolve the issue either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone experience this before? Any possible fixes would be a great help!</p>

<p><span>Hi HokiePhotog,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Still believe that this is an operating system issue. We could try a few more things:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Update your iOS to the latest version. There were a few similar cases in which this approach resolved the issue. Update steps – Settings&gt;General&gt; Software update.</span></li><li>
<span>There is a possibility that you are facing Network issue. In that case, reset network settings. General&gt; Reset&gt; Reset network settings.</span></li><li>
<span>Try to toggle off notifications for Skype for business, close the apps and toggle it on again. Although it sounds simple, this approach could help you to fix the issue. Settings&gt; Notifications&gt; Skype for Business. Try this both with
 Allow notifications and Show on lock screen.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If neither of these approaches fix the issue, please feedback me with the results and version of iOS and Skype for Business you have.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>

<h2>            I keep getting logged out of Yammer and can&#39;t see conversations</h2>
                    <p>This morning when I tried to check some of the groups I've joined, Yammer indicates there are new messages, but if I try to look at the new conversions, I just get a message asking to 'click here to reload' and to 'contact support if the problem persists'.
 On recent attempts, Yammer then logs me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone indicate what the problem is and what is needed to fix it?</p>

                    I know I can play it through the AUX input, but that's not what I'm talking about. &nbsp;I bought a head unit that was supposed to be Zune compatible but I cannot get it to work (it just keeps saying "Reading...Reading...Reading"). &nbsp;Crutchfield and the stereo
 manufacturer haven't been able to figure it out either. &nbsp;I read the reviews for the unit and some people are able have had no problems getting it to work which raises several questions...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you have been able to get it to work, please reply with answers to the following queries:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Any limitations you've noticed?</div>
<div>- How long does it take to recognize your Zune?</div>
<div>- What brand and model number of head unit are you using?</div>
<div>- What kind of Zune does it work with?</div>
<div>- What firmware is the Zune using?</div>
<div>- How many songs and folders are on your Zune?</div>
<div>- Was all your music purchased through Zune, a third-party, or a mix of multiple sources?&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Did you buy any special equipment or download any software to make it work?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sorry for all the questions, but I have a 64GB ZuneHD that I love, love, love and I would love nothing more than to be able to control it through the head unit in my vehicle. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Greetings MarioSmith1296,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Answers Forum. I understand that your Zune player is not being recognized&nbsp;by your Crutchfield stereo system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For best assistance can you provide the make and model of the head unit you are using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although, there supplies will be limited a this point you may want to check out the
<a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=zune+car+pack&amp;FORM=AWRE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Zune Car Pack </a>
accessory. Although this isn't necessarily the same process you are wanting to use, this might provide you with an alternate option to get your Zune device working with you car stereo system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, you may want to try posting on the <a href="http://www.crutchfield.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Crutchfield website</a> forums to see the other users you mentioned in your post have suggestions or if there is additional setup that needs to be done with the Crutchfield head unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this information helps to address this issue. As always if you have any additional questions or concerns please feel free to reply and we will be happy to assist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim P.</p>

<p>Ok, if this error is related to a Windows Defender update and you are running Norton, then you need to get rid of that WD update.&nbsp; I am also a Norton user and have seen the stubborn WD update.&nbsp; Keep in mind if Norton is not recognized or even deleted briefly,
 WD is in the wings and wants to kick in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the fix to remove an unwanted WD update -</p>
<p>Go to Microsoft and download wushowhide.diagcab.&nbsp; Run and it should detect the unwanted WD update and allow you to fix.&nbsp; Now call for new updates and see if the WD is gone.&nbsp; Been there and done that.</p>

            <p>Yes it is possible, it simply is no longer as easy as it was.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Because all Office 2013/365 is only offered as a CTR installation you can no longer simply do a "customize" installation.&nbsp; However, MS recently announced a new feature called "App Exclusion". It is actually intended for corporate settings, but you may be
 able to use it at home<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<div>
<strong>“App Exclusion” during Office 365 Install is coming - “Customize” install for Office 365/2013</strong>
<p>Actually there is a NEW complex technique you can use to limit the CTR applications installed. It is called "App Exclusion"<br />
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><br />
</p>
<p>Jeremy Chapman<br />
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><br />
</p>
<p>At SPC we announced and demo'd the upcoming feature to allow application exclusion/selection in Office 365 ProPlus. It's no longer an "all or nothing" installation after the update is released to the Office Deployment Tool for Click-to-Run in the May timeframe.<br />

<strong>Going beyond the browser - deploying native Office desktop apps in 60 seconds or less</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><br />
</p>
<p>To see this&nbsp; app exclusion capability in action, go to 57:30 mins in.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong>NOTE</strong>: When you do this most of the installation is “common code”. Each individual application has only 300-500MB of separate files. That is all you save by excluding an app.

<span>Microsoft Office 2013</span></a> components from the Internet. Click-to-Run leverages the Office 365 Web-based installer to facilitate the download and installation process. By default, the installation includes the full user interface, with automatic
 updates enabled. In many enterprises, however, IT needs greater control over Click-and-Run installations than is offered out of the box. That’s where the new Office Deployment Tool comes in.</p>
<p>The tool lets administrators <strong>customize Click-to-Run deployments to control how users install Office 2013</strong> products. Administrators can download Office source files to a network share so users don’t have to download the product over the Internet.
 They can also configure which products and languages can be installed, how installations should be logged, whether Office components should be regularly updated and numerous other settings.</p>
<p>The Office Deployment Tool supports three deployment modes: a download mode to set up a local installation source, a configure mode to

<h3> amwebb  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 on Windows 7 64-bit results in white screen</h2>
                    I upgraded to Explorer 11 from 9. At first, 11 worked fine. After a few times of restarting 11, I get a white screen. I have re-installed 11 probably 10 times and I still get a white screen. When I click on tools, everything is grayed out except for File,
 Safety and Compatibility View Settings. I have opened internet options by using windows key + R and reset my settings, I have checked "Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering". Nothing helps.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am a developer and I need IE11 for my application to debug some other crazy issue that is only happening in this browser. The other developers on my team have the exact same PC as me and they can run 11 just fine. I can upgrade from 9 to 10 without any
 problems. This is extremely frustrating and I am very disappointed in 11. Does anybody have any suggestions? I have searched this issue and I see that people have had the exact same problems with older versions of IE, but Microsoft does not provide any good
 answers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am developing a C# application in Visual Studio 2012. When 11 did work, it seemed to die after running the VS debugger a few times.&nbsp;</div>

            I tried everything to get 11 to work in Windows 7. My department has upgraded to 8.1 and now I am able to run 11. There is still no good solution for users on Windows 7 and Microsoft needs to address this rather than just giving a standard textbook answer
 that doesn't work. I came across forums where users were having this same problem in IE9 and IE10 and the steps to fix it were the same as yours, so this issue hasn't been properly addressed. My company, just like others, spends a lot of money on Microsoft
 licenses every year. This is unacceptable. Fix it Microsoft.

    <title>On prem exchange but shared mailbox in the cloud &#40;a sharepoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katherineprouty  say:</h3>
<h2>            On prem exchange but shared mailbox in the cloud &#40;a sharepoint site mailbox&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>We have 2010 on prem exchange, which we want to keep now for various reasons. I added a site mailbox and it isn't provisioning, probably due to the fact that we haven't issued our users exchange online licenses because we already have on prem licenses? (This
 is the error message:</p>
<p>X-ClientId: CCCW - DUYP - EKMT - AD2TXNXXG<br />

Date: 2/16/2016 7:51:45 PM )</p>
<p>I could issue an exchange license to the users of this particular site, but would that mess up the on premise exchange functionality? (We synch with AD for all of our access.)</p>
<p>Also, if we created a shared mailbox in the cloud, what would that do? Nothing?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Hi Katherine,</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to confirm if you mean an Exchange 2010-based hybrid deployment. I suppose so because “#hybrid” is included in the tags under your post.</p>
<p>In an Exchange Online environment, only a licensed Exchange user can see and use a site mailbox. For your situation, please be aware you cannot just assign an Exchange Online license to a user who already owns an Exchange on-premises mailbox. By default,
 one user can only has one mailbox, either at on-premises or cloud side.</p>
<p>As to the shared mailbox, if you create it from the online side, on-premises Exchange users cannot see or use it. You can create a shared mailbox at Exchange on-premises and move it to online side, so users from both sides can see this shared mailbox and
 send emails to it. <span><strong>However, cross-premises mailbox permission is not supported, therefore, a user from one side cannot access or send as a shared mailbox which is located at the other side.</strong></span></p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Allen, yes, we have a hybrid deployment. Exchange and AD on site and Office 365 E2 license in the cloud. So, in our case, the SharePoint site mailboxes that you can deploy as an app on the site won't work at all... and if we create shared mailboxes on prem
 and move them into the cloud, we wouldn't be able to use it at all because of cross-premise permission problems, even through office 365. Do I have this right?</p>

<p>Hi Katherine,<br />
<br />
You’re right about the site mailbox. As to the shared mailbox, I’d like to share that
<strong>Microsoft has just updated the relevant official documents today, and the cross-premises mailbox permission should be supported since today</strong>. I have modified my last post in order to avoid any misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
In an Exchange hybrid deployment, you can create an on-premises shared mailbox and move it to the cloud side, and users from both sides can use this shared mailbox with the correct permissions.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>I really want to tease this out, and I'm doing this because I would like to have SharePoint in the solution somehow... so I really appreciate the time you are taking to answer this. Can we then put a "link" on the SharePoint site to the shared mailbox, it
 would open up in Microsoft Online, and people with the shared permissions would be able to access the shared mailbox that way, provided that they have the right permissions? And you don't need Exchange 2013 for this? 2010 would do? (And I just realized why
 you emphasized Hybrid.&nbsp;We don't have an EXCHANGE hybrid solution. Everything is on prem currently. We would like to have some mailboxes in the cloud. &nbsp;Our Office 365 installation is hybrid, some parts entirely in the cloud and other parts on prem.)</p>

<p>Hi Katherine,<br />
<br />
Please be aware that <strong>the hybrid deployment is a must if you want to have any integration between Exchange Online mailboxes and Exchange on-premises mailboxes</strong>. Without a fully-functioned Exchange hybrid deployment, your online organization and
 on-premises organization will always be separate.<br />
<br />
Additionally, as far as I know, even with an Exchange hybrid deployment, your requirement about SharePoint cannot be met either. But you may consider using a shared mailbox as a workaround.
<strong>Anyway, a hybrid deployment is required</strong>.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            I am having the same problem and am ready to snap! I need to open up my pictures and order them ASAP from Walmart and they are all saved on my email. I am so disappointed with Outlook, this is totally unacceptable!!! I've also sent them a request to help
 me and have received nothing!<br />

<p>I have also been experiencing this same issue for approximately two months now.&nbsp; My husband and I both have Hotmail accounts that have been migrated to Outlook.&nbsp; My husband first noticed the issue on his account and then a few weeks later I had the issue.&nbsp;
 To answer the questions above:</p>
<ul>
<li>This does not happen when using a different computer, such as my work laptop nor is this happening on my smartphone.</li><li>Yes, other Outlook accounts experience the same issue only on my desktop.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 with IE 10 which seems to be supported by Outlook.</li><li>If I use Google Chrome I am able to open my emails. &nbsp;I prefer to use IE and am required to use IE for work.</li><li>My husband and I can both access our emails from our smart phones and it works fine.</li></ul>
<p>Please help as this problem has been an inconvenience for us.&nbsp; Although we can access our email from our smart phones when I need to print something from my email I log onto my desktop and currently I am unable to do this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>P.S. I had to use Google Chrome to send this message. &nbsp;When I tried to submit the response in IE it did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Use Recordset to find files and copy to another location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julionazario1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use Recordset to find files and copy to another location</h2>
                    <p>I'd like to add a function to my Access database that would find .pdf files using a recordset for&nbsp;the name and copy the file to a designated folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can write the code for the recordset and to select the location where to save the files but I have no idea how to start writing the code to search the subfolders within a "root" folder that won't change for the PDF files in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be grateful if someone can point my in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I'm assuming I'll be running a loop through the recordset and adding a "rootfolder" and "filename"&nbsp;as Strings;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where:</p>
<p>
</p><p>rootfolder = "C:\..."</p>
<p>filename = "*.pdf" (for wildcard)</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up going a different route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of having access try to find the file(s), which might take a long time through my connection to the network drive and since all the folders and files follow a pre determined naming convention I made it so that Access can deduce the exact location
 and name of the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then loop through a recordset that contains the exact map to the files and copies&nbsp;them to the location I selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This method I believe is more reliable and much faster than looking through folders and subfolders to maybe find what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did come across some issue where maybe the name is incorrect, so I added an If to the code to get things moving, next I want to add a print of the files it could not find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case this might help someone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code to select where to copy the files:</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">On my android tablet and android, I downloaded the Outlook app.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It shows different folders.<span>&nbsp; </span>First ther is an inbox folder followed by a trash folder. That trash folder has a long list of about 70 subfolders and sub-subfolders that are not the same as any that are on my laptop, nor do they contain any
 content.&nbsp; They look like folders I deleted long ago – some were likely deleted years ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Then, below all those trash subfolders, I find folders I care about - sent items and the current/correct list of folders that are on my laptop.&nbsp; They
 all have full current/correct content.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">So, the question is why are those old subfolders of the trash folder appearing on by tablet?&nbsp; They were deleted long ago.&nbsp; And more importantly, how
 can I get rid of them.&nbsp; It’s a nuisance to have to scroll down 70 long-discarded folders to get to the “real” folders that I use regularly.</span></p>

            If your mobile device and Outlook 2016 are both connected to the same mailbox, then you should also see the folders as subfolders of Deleted Items in Outlook 2016. There should be a "&gt;" to the left of Deleted Items that, when clicked, shows you all of those deleted subfolders. Is that not the case?

<p>Yow - thank you.&nbsp; The deleted items folder under favorites didn't have that little &gt; next to it, so I never thought to look for subfolders.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;with your recommendation, I discovered that lower down, not under favorites, the same deleted items folder was
 there with the &gt; and it had nearly all of those deleted folders.&nbsp; I've deleted them from the laptop and they are now gone from the android devices.&nbsp; So, thank you!!.&nbsp; One has to wonder why the Microsoft Outlook help people couldn't &nbsp;have told me that.&nbsp; BUT...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One set of those long-ago-deleted folders still persists on my android devices, in the same place as the others were located,&nbsp;even though I don't see it on my laptop under deleted items.&nbsp; Any other suggestions for&nbsp; where to look?</p>

    <title>Multiple Account Aliases with Outlook.com Premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grubsy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Account Aliases with Outlook.com Premium</h2>
                    <p>Currently using the basic cPanel email I just have one mailbox setup with 13 forwarders all to this mailbox. I am also able to send emails as any of these forwarded addresses too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I achieve something similar with Outlook.com Premium? Or maybe something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Mailbox 1:</strong></p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Mailbox 2:</strong></p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Mailbox 3:</strong></p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can probably remove a few of the addresses under mailbox 3.</p>

            you can set up the same number of aliases with your domain as you can a regular outlook.com account (which is 10 last time i read it), you can also have 5 different email accounts.&nbsp; Aliases and having separate accounts are different things.&nbsp; But yeah,
 it sounds like this product isn't best for you.

            You can have five custom addresses altogether. Each custom address can be the alias of a single mailbox. Those mailboxes can have as many other aliases not in your custom domain as their mail services allow. For Outlook.com mailboxes, that's nine additional
 aliases, for a total of 10: one custom domain alias and nine regular aliases. If you sent the custom domain invitation to a Google address, then that mailbox can have one custom domain alias and however many other aliases Google allows a mailbox to have.

<h2>            How can i recover and stop the fraudulent use of my microsoft acct&#47;email- &#42;&#42;&#42; Email address is removed for privacy &#42;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    Good evening my name is Carmen Wimbush and I've encountered a great deal of issues when trying to access my email account. i created this email(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) years ago in michigan mainly to create resumes and get alerts for employment(indeed.com,monster).
 i had no issues until june which has caused a great deal of password resets and unauthorized changes in personal info. it was created in my name Carmen Wimbush but was changed to my moms name Joyce Merritt. My security ? was also removed along with phone number.
 I also never authorized a desktop,surface,windows phone, or xbox live. Ive only used my mobile device to gain access to my accounts. Along with this because of this my facebook account was compromised, i cant fulfill some financial obligations and my skype
 accounts cannot be accessed. Ive exhausted other routes to recover my account, I could really use your help.

<strong>To report spam or unsolicited emails:</strong><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></em><br />
<em>* Non-MIcrosoft customers should address an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Depending on the originating
 mail domain: hotmail, msn,live, or Outlook.com). Attach a copy of the spam email to this email and send it. If we do not receive a copy of the email as an attachment our ability to take action against the spamming account is severely impacted.</em><br />
<em>* We ask for a full copy of the email so that we have conclusive evidence showing from which Windows Live Hotmail account the SPAM was sent. It is possible that the email address
 was spoofed, and we don't want to mistakenly close a non-spamming account.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>To report abuse:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>
abuse</strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">about harassment, impersonation, child exploitation, child pornography etc, received</span>
<strong>
from a outlook.com account</strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">should send their complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with all the relevant&nbsp;information (abuse@hotmail, or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</span></em><br />
<em>*
<strong>If you are being threatened please call your local law enforcement.</strong></em><br />
<em>*</em>
<em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you wish to report abuse against a non Microsoft account, please send the complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** , where xxxxxx.com is the text that appears after the "@" symbol
 in the sender's e-mail address. For example, if the unwanted email came from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then report the email message to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. You can also use the site http://abuse.net to identify the correct abuse reporting address.</span><br />
</em><br />
<strong><em><span style="color: rgba(235, 0, 115, 1)">* In addition to these ways of reporting Spam you can also click the "Report Spam," button in your email program.</span></em></strong></span></span>

<h2>            Sync &#39;Sent&#34; folders between Mobile &#38; Desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've got the Outlook 365 Desktop client on my PC and the Outlook Android app on my phone and am connecting them both to my Comcast email account. I can download and send mails from both just fine, but when I send something from my phone it doesn't show up
 in the sent folder on my desktop, and vice versa.&nbsp; And if I send a mail directly from the Comcast web client (xfinity), then it doesn't show up in either Outlook sent folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a PITA, as I often need to resend or&nbsp;refer back to mails I sent earlier.&nbsp;I thought it was possible to have this level of synchronization with IMAP, but it's not working.... Suggestions?</p>

                    <p>I started the process of getting a personalized email address as described in the support.office.com&nbsp; articles.&nbsp; The premium dashboard had the option "personalized email address" and I started there as instructed.&nbsp; Bought the domain from GoDaddy.&nbsp; It took
 me back to the outlook premium dashboard and I entered the address info.&nbsp; Now what? &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I went to the FAQs and tried to follow similar issues, the premium dashboard option is no longer showing this option.&nbsp; There is
<strong>nothing </strong>showing under the settings/premium/features option. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What now ?? Suggestions?</p>

<p>Thank you for the responses.&nbsp; The support.office.com for 365 is the one that I used to set up and then to troubleshoot.&nbsp; I read through again but there aren't any options for me to continue or choose under the premium /feature tab.&nbsp; If you notice on the
 instructions article, the features tab shows a storage&nbsp; section; a subscription section and a personalized email address section. &nbsp; None of those options are appearing now.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; logged out, restarted my computer, etc.&nbsp; I am at a loss ---- but now with
 a new domain :(.</p>

            Hi JBC87,
<br />
<br />Have you reached out to Godaddy Support? 
<br />GoDaddy info on setting up workspace on Office 365.
<br /><a href="https://ca.godaddy.com/help/set-up-my-workspace-email-domain-with-a-new-office-365-account-19130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ca.godaddy.com/help/set-up-my-workspace...</a>

<br />Note: It can take up to 48 hours to switch over your email. You'll continue to receive email at your Workspace email until the switch is complete.
<br />At the bottom of the page there is a phone number for GoDaddy support
<br />You may want to reach out to them for further support. There is also a chat but looks like it is not available right now.

<br />I believe the following instructions can bring the solution to this problem in configuring your custom email address in Office 365.
<br />
<br />The information was taken directly from GoDaddy's website.
<br />
<br />Office 365: How to Create DNS Records with a Domain in a Different GoDaddy Account
<br />
<br />Congratulations on your recent purchase of the best productivity tool, GoDaddy's Microsoft:registered: Office 365. Since you are hosting your domain name in another GoDaddy account, we have created a simple step-by-step process for activating your email.
<br />
<br />However, first, we'll teach you how to access your domain's DNS so you can update your DNS records.
<br />
<br />If you manage your DNS with a third-party provider, you must manage your updates on it. At first, it may take 24-36 hours for your DNS update to take effect.
<br />
<br />To enter your DNS settings
<br />Sign in to the "Account Manager" for your domain.
<br />Click Domains.
<br />Next to the account you want to use, click Manage.
<br />Select the DNS File Area tab, click Add Record, and then type the following records:
<br />TXT Records - Select TXT (text), type the information we send to you by email, click Save, and then click Save Changes.
<br />CNAME - Select CNAME (alias), enter the information we sent to you by email, click Save, and then click Save Changes.
<br />MX Records - Select MX (Mail Exchanger), enter the information we send to you by email, click Save, and then click Save Changes.
<br />SRV records - Select SRV (service), type the information that we sent to you by email, click Save, and then click Save Changes.
<br />To request that GoDaddy verify your DNS settings
<br />Sign in to the "Account Manager" of Office 365 from your_NAME.
<br />Click Office 365 Email and Productivity, and then click Manage next to the plan that you want to use.
<br />Click I updated these settings. Confirm.
<br />Ready! Now, just click Check Mail Now to start using your newest and best productivity friend.
<br />
<br />There are still other instructions on the site in question, to access it just click on the following link:

            To use the Internet over the mobile network, make sure you have:<br />
<br />
1: A subscription/plan from your network operator that allows packet data (GPRS Internet access)<br />
<br />
2: You have the correct settings (Access Point) for Internet access from your operator on your phone<br />
<br />
3: You have configured applications (like the browser) to use the Internet access point.<br />
<br />
If that's not enough, explain step by step what you are attempting to do, and what happens, exactly (with complete error messages as displayed on your phone when you try, if any).

            As to your wallpaper problem, please explain what "cannot utilise" means? What did you try to do, exactly? What happened?<br />
<br />
In general, you set the wallpaper in the Gallery (highlight one in the "carousel" view, hit "Options", choose "Use image" and select "Set as wallpaper". Or you can go to the "Themes" app and choose the "Wallpaper" option there, select "Image" and then choose
 the picture you want.

<h2>            How to create list of worksheets for set of Excel files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to create Query on a set of Excel files (more than 1ths) that are supposed to have the same structure (sheets and the structure within the sheet). It seems that some of them do not, so I was wondering is there an easy way to create list of worksheet
 names for set of Excel files (e.g. Soruce.Name and worksheet name) in order to easy identify files that should be excluded?&nbsp;</p>

            You can use the VBA code as attached in Excel File. Open the Excel &gt; ALT+F8 to display Macro Window &gt; Run WorkbooksCompare Macro &gt; It will ask you to select a folder &gt; It will generate a report showing Workbook, Worksheet and Field Name.

<h2>            Deleted database</h2>
                    Yesterday I accidentally deleted the folder Microsoft User Data which includes the database file with all the user info to run out look I then proceeded to empty the trash can. I spent some time looking of means to recover the files BUT this morning the
 bin was restored and I have moved the complete folder out to a separate drive.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is now how to get &nbsp;the data back into Outlook to import I need a .olm file &nbsp;and when I used the utility it said the data need to be rebuilt and then failed and that crashed Outlook. I have managed to get out look to run but with no accounts
 or other data.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So,is there a way to get deleted information back into outlook.</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this situation is tough. But you can try to run your time machine (if it's setup)&nbsp;to possible retrieve the files.</p>

            Ah,yes. I was deleting dross before starting time machine for the first time when I had the accident! I &nbsp;have read that time machine does not save the Outlook data in the community information.

            You can replace the current Microsoft User Data folder with the recovered folder, if you believe the recovered folder contains all the files.&nbsp;

            Thanks for this. 



But the mystery continues, with outlook closed (but in the dock),  in finder I went - Go - folder - ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/ and moved all files and folders below this to trash. Then from an external HHD I dragged the content of the Microsoft User Data folder previously recovered from the trash into the now empty folder in Documents.  



I then started Outlook which took about 20 seconds to start and it was still in the state with files and emails before I started the procedure. Strangely the date and time stamps on the files and folders remained as of the 25th and yet in outlook there are messages of today the 27th. 



From this I should make clear that I had assumed a lll was lost and begun again entering accounts and pulling down messages that I retain on the mail server for 10 days. So, where the **** is the data stored? 



To be fair this is now curiosity. One other significant factor is that The machine is iMac purchase February this year and I accepted an upd

            The&nbsp;Microsoft Database daemon stores which&nbsp;Identity to open. It's only supposed to look in the&nbsp;Microsoft User Data folder but it often follows an&nbsp;Identity to the trash. We need to make&nbsp;Outlook look for the correct&nbsp;Identity.
<div><br />
<div>1) Delete the&nbsp;Microsoft Database daemon in your User's preferences folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>/Users/YOU/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.outlook.databasedaemon.plist</div>
<div><br />
<div>Log out/In under the&nbsp;Apple in the&nbsp;Menu bar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) In the Finder, name the Main&nbsp;Identity in the&nbsp;Microsoft User Data folder that was recovered from the Trash to "Recovered Trash Identity". (this allows you to correctly identify the&nbsp;Identity in the next step.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) Open the&nbsp;Database Utility by holding the Option key when launching&nbsp;Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Do you see the&nbsp;Identity&nbsp;"Recovered Trash Identity".</span></li><li><span>If yes, then you can rename it then select as Default.</span></li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Open&nbsp;Outlook and you should be back in the correct&nbsp;Identity.</div>

            Well thanks Diane, this is sounding like you have a real knowledge base. I haven't tried it yet as time is against me but I will post a response when I have. It may be that my fumbling about may have spoiled things. I really wish we had managed to make
 contact at the beginning of my saga.

            <p>I have the same problem. &nbsp;I've tried to follow Diane's helpful instruction to fix the problem but not having much luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've retrieved the Microsoft User Date Folder from the Trash and put it back in Documents. &nbsp;However when I try to go /Users/YOU (mike I assume)/Library/Preferences I can't find Library. See screenshot.</p>

            <p>I have to say that I gave up and resorted reloading old .pst files after removing and reloading Office. I have &nbsp;Outlook data going back many years and I have lost the data from the period of owning the IMac. I have an external backup volume but the outlook
 files are not supported under time machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw the mac and thought how great, now I think of the old story of the dog walking on it's back legs - how clever that is but it doesn't do it very well. Now I find I cannot run Sage Accountant in a manner where it is happy.</p>
