<h2>            System Restore - Claiming restore point is 60&#43; days old but the date shows as 1&#47;07&#47;2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My girlfriends laptop is running windows 8 , this morning it's been having a problem where a few programs (Chrome, Spotify to name a few) close immediately after starting them up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading a few things online and a few failed attempts at fixing it, someone suggested using system restore. However when we go on system restore and select a restore point (1/07/2016) the next page comes up with a warning saying that this restore point
 is over 60 days old (date today is 08/07/2016 so obviously not true)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>should we be wary? or ignore the caution? also any help with the issue of the programs closing immediately would be great.</p>

            Hello,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>With the issue description, I understand that you experiencing issue with few application and it doesn’t work properly also you have some query regarding system restore. I will certainly help you to fix the problem and answer your query.</p>
<p>
There can&nbsp;be a possibility that&nbsp;computer date is set in (MM-DD-YYYY) format. If that is the case the selected restore point (01/07/2016) is really 60+ old days on present date. I would advise you to check the date format and ensure that it's in the preferred
 format.
</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If his computer is set on (DD-MM-YYYY) format and the selected restore point still shows 60+ days, advise you to select the recommended restore point as&nbsp;I&nbsp;have suggested below.
<p>
</p></div>
<div>To answer your query I would suggest you to choose restore your system to a previous state you can use the recommended restore point or you can choose a different one. The Recommended restore option will restore your system to the most recent restore point.
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If you select the second option, Choose a different restore point after you press the Next button, you will see a list of available restore points. Select the one you prefer and press the Next button once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you are asked to confirm your restore point. Click the Finish button and System Restore will restart your computer to apply the necessary changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps, if you need any further assistance please write us back we will be glad to assist you.<br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 System Update, cannot launch Gears of War 2 </h2>
                    
<p>As of tonight, July 30 2015, my Xbox 360 updated to new system update (2.0.17449.0).</p>
<p><br />
When launching Gears of War 2, it will play both Epic Games logo animation and Microsoft game's logo animation before
<strong>black screening</strong> and <strong>system will lock up</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried multiple times relaunching the game with the same results. I also cleaned disk and no changes.</p>

<p>I was playing this game two nights ago, July 28, with no issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If anyone else is having this issue, please do tell. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dianna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes this would apply for Windows 8 as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1: <strong>Turn off sticky keys.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can turn off sticky keys on Windows 8 by following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+R</strong> key on the keyboard</li><li>Type <strong>control panel</strong> in the run box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Ease of Access Center then</strong> </li><li>Click on <strong>Make the keyboard easier to use</strong></li><li>Under <strong>make it easier to type</strong> click on <strong>set up sticky keys</strong>
</li><li>Then you will see option to <strong>turn off sticky key when two keys are pressed at once</strong></li></ol>
<p>Hope this information helps and let us know the status of the issue we will be glad to help you further.</p>

<h2>            windows 7 firewall not using domain profile</h2>
                    <p>Network setup is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Server 2008 Standard with fixed IP address of nnn.nnn.nnn.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;DHCP is not activated or in use (Don't have a clue why)</p>
<p>Workstation is Win 7 Pro with fixed IP of nnn.nnn.nnn.15 and was previously joined to the domain successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Gateway/router is at nnn.nnn.nnn.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I boot the Win 7 machine and can successfully login to the domain (using cached credentials maybe?) and I can ping the server. However, the firewall on the workstation is using the private networks profile, when it should be using the domain profile. Attempted
 to run gpupdate /force and get error that it can't contact domain controller. I checked the local policy settings on the workstation, and they're all set to not configured, as I expect they should be. How do I get this workstation firewall to use the domain
 profile?</p>

<p>&nbsp;Got if fixed. Seems DHCP was configured to have the DNS setting on the workstation point to a DNS server on the Internet. After changing it to point to the DNS server on the domain server, that fixed that problems, and a few more issues I hadn't got to
 yet. This problem resolved. Now to move on to my Hyper-V issues. (sigh)</p>

            Hi Guber, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />If the controller is working with other games then it's definitely an issue with Gears of War 4, and so the first step I'd recommend is reinstalling the game. This can often fix problems like this.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you might need to check out the Xbox for Windows 10 support page to see if it's a known issue. It looks like GOW4 should support 360 controllers with wireless adapters, according to this page:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-titles/gears-of-war-4-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-title...</a>
<br />
<br />If you've got a Play'n'Charge kit, you could plug it in and see if that works.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, let me know how you go! Thanks!

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help but it's still not working… I've tried uninstalling the game, restoring default settings and nothing, same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said I've playing another games with the same controller with no problems at all.</p>

<p>So I am going to Japan again this summer (leaving this weekend actually) and so I might buy a couple Xbox 360 games IF it is possible to play region-free Japanese games without trouble on a US console (no conflict with LIVE connection, accurate achievements,

<p>Not all games are region free, so you will need to verify whether the game you will be purchasing is a region free game or not. &nbsp;

<p>I would suggest checking out a few sites online to see if the game you want is region free. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Usually japanese games dont play on a us console, we are ntsc based so if a japanese disc has pal any where on it, that would be a no go. NTSC and PAL are different region based games and can be applied to consoles or discs.

            I can only guess. But I assume "WEP" means the Entertainment Pack for Vista, and "Taipei" means the correspondent Mahjongg version. You don't have to install this on Windows 7, it's included. If you've a Professional version (or Enterprise), you must enable
 the games first by going to Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows features on and off &gt; check the "Games" box. If that's not the case, simply go to Games &gt; Mahjong Titans, and begin playing.

            Thanks Sanmartin, but the version that comes with Windows 7 doesn't appear to have numbered games - the old one that dad has been playing (which I think is from the original Windows Entertainment Pack from back in the '90's) allows him to type in the number
 of the game he wishes to play - he is now up to 52000 odd&nbsp;and he really, really wants to play through to&nbsp;that last game.

            Media Info Exporter can export individual playlists too. For this, click&nbsp;<strong>Playlists
</strong>in WMP's left sidebar, right-click the playlist that you want to export, and select&nbsp;<strong>Send To</strong> -&nbsp;
<strong>Media Info Exporter</strong> .

<h2>            Option to turn off Predictive Text</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 8 year old and I play Minecraft and I secretly use it as an education tool ( as well as being a lot of fun ) especially with respect to mental maths and coding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the predictive text is limiting my ability to encourage self spelling. Essentially as soon as my lad sees the word he wants he chooses it rather than completing the spelling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am asking, as a parent who loves playing games with my son on our xbox:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please give me the ability to turn off predictive text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>

    <title>HOW CAN I TRANSFER MY MUSIC ON USB FLASHDRIVE TO WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jusho  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOW CAN I TRANSFER MY MUSIC ON USB FLASHDRIVE TO WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER LIBRARY for subsequent CD burn</h2>
                    I&nbsp;just bought a wonderful Yamaha keyboard with&nbsp;a USB plug feature&nbsp;that allows me to record my music onto a flashdrive and take it to the computer for subsequent cd burn.<br />
I downloaded Windows Media Player 11 yesterday- &amp; when I plug the FD into the computer, the music plays- and I have hit the "add to library" options -but when I take the FD out of the computer, the song goes with it. The only "rip instructions" are for a CD,
 not a flash drive.<br />
I am an elderly&nbsp;good musician but quite a dummy in techincal details- I'm not even sure how to "save" something- My granddaughter told me I might need to save it in another location &amp; then "pull it into WMP for burn"&nbsp; ??<br />
<br />
so if anyone out there would tell me if I can do this in WMP &amp; give me some step by step details on how to accomplish what I'm trying to do, I will be quite grateful..&nbsp; My family &amp; friends would like to have a CD of my music &amp; I would love to be able to do
 it before I get too old to make it happen..&nbsp; LOL<br />
Judy<br />

<h2>            How do I back up my save games from the windows store.</h2>
                    Most of the games I play on my PC, have a save game file in documents which I periodically copy and save to a usb stick so I don't loose progress if my system needs restoring. I have got some games from windows store and have been unable to find the save
 game files for any of them, as a lot of them ask for in game purchases, you can understand my trepidation for resisting any purchases. I was hoping somebody would be able to point me to the location of the save files, as they must exist, many thanks for your
 help.<br />

<p>Your settings and apps in the modern interface are automatically backed up if you use a Microsoft account. That means,<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">if you install apps while in a Microsoft Account, it is already saved to your account. In case of a restore,
 you just have to reinstall the apps by going to the "<strong>Your apps</strong>" section in Windows store.</span>

            Hi Daemon,<br />
<br />
You might want to look at this folder and see if you are able to find the app's saved folder for the games:<br />
<b>C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Local\Packages\B3B9BB81.56264F78B4FFF_swksbykwsp6kr\RoamingState\</b> where YOURUSER is your Windows user name.<br />

    <title>Problems with activating 8.1&#47;10. Help me find the real key out of - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with activating 8.1&#47;10. Help me find the real key out of three&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hia all! I'm here to ask about some activation problems with windows 8.1/10, but i have some other questions too. Let's begin with the activation issues, here’s some backstory..</span></p>
<p><span>..last year we got laptops from our university, all HP ProBooks. These lappys had Windows 8.1 Professional installed on them, but we had no keys or anything. After a little research we came to know that keys are not provided with preinstalled devices
 and instead a sticker with the windows logo was the proof of authenticity. And to our relief they were there. But still, for some reason we couldn’t activate our windows, some of us asked about this here and from HP and we were told to ask to our university’s
 IT dept. We did the same and got activated for 6 months (this indicates that our copies are volume licensed and activated through KMS).</span></p>
<p><span>All was well but after 6 months no-one bothered to go to the IT dept again and everyone used AutoKMS. Me too. Again cool..</span></p>
<p><span>..Back to present</span></p>
<p><span>The question that do I actually have a valid key hidden somewhere in the BIOS/EFI pestered me, so I started to trawl the web for key finders and found one named “ProduKey” and a Vbscript. Now the story gets a twist, I ran both the things and got THREE
 keys!! Most probably only one of them is legit, because I know, (and admit) that I used AutoKMS.</span></p>
<p><span>The names of the Keys are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Windows (BIOS OEM Key) … I think this one is legit</span></li><li><span>Windows 8.1 Pro … and this one’s probably the KMS one</span></li><li><span>The third Key shown by the VBscript doesn’t have any name and apparently isn’t used anywhere.</span></li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f4b2131-cd47-4e12-94e4-bf3c6c6bd3b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f4b2131-cd47-4e12-94e4-bf3c6c6bd3b8" /></a></p>
<p><span>And now I got Windows 10, I downloaded it using the media creation tool and installed it on a *separate new partition* to try it first before the actual upgrade. I read on the internet that with the new build of 10 we can activate it with any valid
 8/7 key, but I didn’t get the latest build through the media creation tool..? How?</span></p>
<p><span>So my questions are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which of the keys is the legit key?</span></li><li><span>If one of the remaining two keys is an AutoKMS one, then what is the third key doing here? Is it the “legit KMS” one?</span></li><li><span>Can I reactivate my laptop with the legit key (the no 1. key)? Or am I forever bound to reactivate every 6 months?</span></li><li><span>Why did I receive the old build through the media creation tool?</span></li><li><span>Can I “upgrade” my win 8.1 with the bootable offline media?</span></li><li><span>Related to question 4. The old build doesn’t allow us to activate using a key, and I can’t get the new build without activating I think. So I’m stuck in a loop?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Please help me out of this mess. I want a clean and tidy installation. Sorry for the long wall of text.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>Nakul</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've initially set a local account upon installing Windows 8.1 on your device, you can add a new user with a Microsoft account by following the steps provided on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13951/windows-create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Once you're done, check if you encounter the same error. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, <strong>OneDrive </strong>should be pre-installed on your device. If not, follow the steps under Windows 8.1 provided on this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-OneDrive-with-Office-b1c976de-ef52-4d53-950f-d48f2c6427df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back should you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The solutions you offered are already tried and not what I was asking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft account and one-drive application on my PC.</p>
<p>I have been using those for a long time before I re-install Windows8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no update in my guess to connect to the Microsoft service account at this point due to the security update although it didn't matter 1 year ago when I connected my service account with my PC. (Please, re-read my original question which I explained
 details)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want either update patch drive or other ideas&nbsp;which I can detour this problem.</p>
<p>

<p>That is my second account only for the use of trial when I coundn't connect MS account with my main account which is now I am logged.</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using this one for years and all of my data is saved via this e-mail.</p>
<p>Thus I am not willing to create another one. What I want to do is still being connected with this account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as was for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Only difference is that I re-installed Windows8.1. I am sure there is a good solution for this. Thanks.</p>

<p>Add XeroShinobi, he is running a group of people (me included) to get those achievements (well Absergo Employee of the Month more than Role Model) and we could surely use more people. Last time we were missing 2 people. Ahead of the Curve comes naturally
 after a while, Strong Closer well I am still missing that one as well lol</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>The built in shutdown command will display the notification. You may be able to utilize the TSSHUTDN command which can be learned about
 in the link below to see if it provides the same warning:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t help, you will need to try to find a third party solution that can provide this functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly.

<h3> sistersis65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delayed Windows 10 Black Screen</h2>
                    Hi, I'm having a black screen issue 12-13 days after I installed Windows 10. The upgrade went very well, seamless and easy. I really love the ease of using Windows 10 too, zero problems till last night. I booted up my computer (HP model #G62-355DX) and
 all I got was the dreaded black screen. I can hear the computer running, blue light is blinking on the CAPS tab and the wifi tab has a continuous glowing amber light.<br />
<br />
I have read multiple posts and tried each fix I could try without having access to the start menu/settings. So if there is a fix or upgrade I can't access it. Thank you in advance for all your help!

<h2>            IPX Protocol For Windows 7</h2>
                    I have an old game Grand Prix Season 2000 which worked well with the IPX Protocol with Windows XP but since upgrading to Windows 7 there is no IPX. Instead there is the TCP/IP protocol which doesn't work well with the game. Is there a file that I can download
 to have IPX with Windows 7?

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

<p>won't work</p>
<p>anything to bypass the drm is a violation of the terms of use</p>
<p>also they tend to fail at 99% at the final check and no that method will not work most of the time (thats why we have all the 99% threads)</p>

<p>Not really by passing anything for a gain - i have paid for the items so dont see how that warrents a violation</p>
