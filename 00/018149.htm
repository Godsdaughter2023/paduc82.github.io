            How about backing up your phone and try and perform a hard reset by dialling *#7370#. Make sure you back up your data as a hard reset erases all data. Then try reinstalling belle.

<p>Thank you for posting at the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try to remove the&nbsp;app, make sure your computer is fully updated, restart the phone and try again.</p>

            Remove your SD card from your previous phone and connect again. This will resolve the issue.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to look up an external workbook using vlookup in vba.</p>
<p>I have a worksheet with a table of values Sheet1("I4:I500"), and for each value I want to lookup an external workbook wb2.Sheet2.("A1:G600") and see if that value appears in it column A, and then read the relevant value from column G.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I made some changes to the code.&nbsp; Your compiler error was caused by 'wb' not being declared.&nbsp; Fixed that.&nbsp; This code will take the values in column I of the active workbook, compare them to the values in column A of the other workbook and when it finds a
 match, will bring the value from column G of the other workbook into column J next to the matched value in column I.&nbsp; Same as putting a VLOOKUP() formula in column J of this workbook.&nbsp; I changed the name of a couple of variables just to help me keep my head
 straight about it all.&nbsp; I also removed some variables that were not being used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub LookupValues()</p>
<p>&nbsp; Dim colI_Cell As Range<br />
&nbsp; Dim colI_Range As Range<br />
&nbsp; Dim rngLookupRange As Range<br />
&nbsp; Dim rngFound As Range<br />

&nbsp; 'when you do this, Workbook2.xls becomes active<br />

&nbsp; ThisWorkbook.Activate ' leaves no doubt!<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; For Each colI_Cell In colI_Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With rngLookupRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngFound = .Find(What:=colI_Cell.Value, LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not rngFound Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'rngFound points to a cell in col A in other workbook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'we need to bring back value from G into col J in this workbook<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colI_Cell.Offset(0, 1) = rngFound.Offset(0, 7).Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />

<h2>            MSE and Key logger real time protection&#47;detection. </h2>
                    I am using MSE with EMET.My Operating system is Vista home premium 32 bit.I use IE 9 and firefox as my browsers.I want to know if i should use other third party software's like Zemana or spyshelter free for protection against Key-loggers.I was also want
 to know if these two software's are compatible with MSE.I am not so sure if the protection by MSE is only for Internet Explorer or Firefox too?Since i am&nbsp; using Windows firewall how am i supposed to know if any unwanted program is trying to connect and send
 out my private information.Is there any tool from Microsoft that allows me to see if any program is Keylogging and sending out information.Since Kids are always using the computer and downloading stuff how to protect against these type of threats that are
 already installed. Thank you.

<p>MSE provides protection againts viruses, spyware, worms, trojans, rootkits, and malicious scripts.&nbsp;<strong>You should NOT</strong> have any other real-time software installed that provides the same protection.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> georgeconstantinou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Different windows user profiles sharing the same pst</h2>
                    I need to share the same pst for 2 different windows profiles (users).&nbsp; The unique pst is located in C:\AllEmails and was set for both outlook profile.
<br />
<br />
I have set to keep a copy of the new emails in the server.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that when I switch between user profiles, new emails are downloaded twice, although have been previously download in the first profile.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
How can I avoid this?<br />

            That happens because it's the Profile that records what emails have been downloaded, not the pst file. If you are sharing a pst file, disable the "keep messages on the server" - it's not necessary to do that.

            <p>Thanks a lot for the&nbsp;quick answer.</p>
<p>The problem is that a second person uses a web page to see the new messages too.&nbsp; As you realize the first person might download the new e-mails using any one of the profiles on the computer and afterwards the second person to see those emails using the
 web page. So, I need to keep for some days the emails in the mail server.</p>
<p>Of course, if there is any other way, I am open to hear them.</p>
<p>The first person uses 1) a LAN connection in his office and 2) a wireless/VPN connection from home to access his official emails.&nbsp; I have created 2 separated profiles in order no to need to change LAN settings/Internet exporer settings etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other idea?</p>

<h2>            Trouble send and receive emails</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm using WM6 on a Samsung Blackjack. I setup my Yahoo! email account a few days ago with no problems. Now I can't send or receive emails. I didn't do anything differently so I'm confused. I've tried deleting the account and adding it again with no success.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            I had a similar problem with a different type of email, and pressing the reset button on the handheld resolved my issues. It's worth a shot. . .

<h2>            Missing emails in Outlook 2016, but showing online and iphone</h2>
                    <p>
A tranche of emails have gone from my Microsoft inbox and sent mail, but only in Outlook 2016, as&nbsp;<span>the missing emails are still there in Outlook webmail, and also on my iphone
 and ipad. &nbsp; It's involving a</span>&nbsp;date range from May 2016 to the day before yesterday in inbox and Dec 2015 to day before yesterday in sent mail is missing. &nbsp;This happened on 16th Aug and I believe there was some M/soft activity related to the account that
 day as I received an email headed 'Welcome to your new Outlook.com mobile experience' although I'd not taken any direct action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Seeing similar issues raised I have tried the solutions proposed with following results:<br />
</p>
<p>
1. Deleted and recreated the account within Outlook. &nbsp;Note: It would not auto-set up the email account using option of Exchange ActiveSync, and I initially tried IMAP/SMTP instead, using the settings from webmail options, which were refused. &nbsp;I then took the
 mail server setting from a set up on a previous laptop (which has not been connected since last year) this was "col401-m.hotmail.com" but on checking the setting today, it has now updated itself to be "eas.outlook.com" . &nbsp;After recreating the account yesterday
 it synchronised with the server with the exact same result, i.e. missing emails from date range as previously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
2. Tried a different profile: &nbsp;On the same computer, the email account is configured in outlook under a different user profile. &nbsp;This version of the email account in Outlook had not been updated since Feb 2016. Opening up Outlook in that profile, the folders
 synchronised with the server and initially all of the emails that were missing appeared, but they then disappeared, one by one, as if being deleted before my eyes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
I've also checked the obvious, such as whether auto-archive or similar had been triggered, but nothing there. &nbsp; Any ideas? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks Praveen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I've downloaded SARA but it says it doesn't support the domain as I'm operating this on 365 home and it only supports business 365. &nbsp; (I do have a business 365 subscription through my main business domain email - which is not the one playing up - but
 I don't use it in this environment.)</p>
<p>2. Checking online, it shows as Outlook Mail - your message wasn't entirely clear which was the migrated version, but in one of the links you gave, a writer said Outlook Mail indicated the account had migrated. &nbsp; You suggest setting up as Exchange server
 instead, but there does not appear to be any option to do so. &nbsp;In the 'old days' you chose the type of email account as the first stage, but here there is only a choice of letting Outlook auto set-up, which isn't working, as I've already said, or upon that
 failure to choose between IMAP/POP or EAS. &nbsp;Does Outlook restrict the number of Exchange server accounts you're using? &nbsp;I already have an &nbsp;Exchange server set up within Outlook for my primary business email account - does that pose a problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The two links you suggested are indeed experiencing same problem, but looking at the solutions that are suggested, I have already tried, e.g. trying under a different profile, reinstalling etc. &nbsp;The only thing I haven't done is to totally kill the existing
 Outlook profile and start again, as opposed to just removing this email account from the profile, but as I have five or six different email accounts operating under the profile, it's a pain to do that if I don't have to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further suggestions, they would be appreciate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks Praveen, but as I said in my original post, the Auto Account Setup will not configure the Outlook.com account. &nbsp;That is what I tried to use this morning when I first deleted the existing account to try for a fresh start. &nbsp;The auto set up simply
 returns an error message and the only option is manual configuration, where there is only IMAP/POP or EAS as options. &nbsp; &nbsp;Similarly, I've tried doing repair on the account, but it just locks off in a loop as it appears unable to locate the account.&nbsp;

            Specifically, having done it again, the auto account set up says an encrypted connection to the server isn't available. &nbsp;So click OK to try unencrypted and then it returns "we couldn't set up your account automatically. to set it up yourself click next"
 at which point there's the POP/IMAP or EAS options. &nbsp;

            Maggie, I have experienced exactly the same issue with emails missing from Sent folder from 3/12/2014 in Outlook 2016 whilst still visible in Outlook.com and iPhone / ipad.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have just started the process of working with Microsoft to investigate and
 am expecting a contact on Saturday 3/9/2016 having had the issue escalated.&nbsp; However, I wondered if you had any further news / developments ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards.

            Hi Karen, no, nothing else to help. &nbsp;The only way I have got round for now is a bit ridiculous as I removed the mailbox again and reinstalled it, and once the missing messages had downloaded, and before they started to clear again off screen, I captured
 them and copied them to an offline Outlook data file. &nbsp;However, I didn't manage to capture quite all of them from the inbox in one go! &nbsp;I thought I'd wait and see if anyone came up with a solution.... So I'd be very grateful if you could share the outcome
 of your contact, even if it doesn't get solved, just so I know. &nbsp; Thanks. &nbsp;

</p><p>As an aside, I downloaded a free email client (EM Client) to see how that behaved and it worked fine with no emails being lost so it appears to be an Office Outlook specific issue.&nbsp; Ironic that IOS and other third party products work fine but MS Outlook
 doesn't.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Maggie,&nbsp; impatience got the better of me and so I found a way around this matter.&nbsp; I'll still take the call with MS tomorrow but as the issue isn't now visible I suspect it will be a short discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary I selected 10 emails in Outlook.com that were not present in&nbsp;Outlook 2016, marked them as unread, synced Outlook 2016 and 10 unread appeared next to Sent Items.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that was too easy and it was ... looking into the folder the items were
 not visible but clicking on Unread (rather than All) and they appeared.&nbsp; Then going back to All and they were not there again and I also noticed some 'mashing' of email recipient and content across emails ... a right mess.&nbsp; Thankfully a mess only in Outlook
 2016 but still clean in the&nbsp;Outloook.com web client and IPhone / iPad.&nbsp; Approach abandoned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second tactic, which appears to have successfully worked around the issue, was to copy&nbsp;the same 'missing' 10 emails to a temporary folder, deleted them from Sent Items and then moved the copied emails back to Sent Items.&nbsp; I feared the same outcome as with
 the prior unread tactic but the emails appeared, stayed there and looked ok.&nbsp; I then did the same for the remaining missing emails (a few hundred, I didn't count precisely)&nbsp;and they are now all present in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this neither explains why the issue occurred and doesn't fix the root cause&nbsp;but it gave me a workaround without having to spend hours working with MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally if anything does arise tomorrow I'll update further.</p>

<p><span>Your Microsoft account can have only one subscription associated with it. If you use the same Microsoft account to buy or redeem multiple Office 365 subscriptions, you extend the amount of time
 for your subscription, up to a maximum of 5 years. Note that doing so does not increase the number of devices that you can install Office on or increase the amount of online storage that is available with the subscription.</span></p>

    <title>SharePoint for Office 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russ.bettridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint for Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am unemployed at the moment. I just installed Office 2016 last night, and want to be able to create a portfolio which I will link to from my LinkedIn, Facebook, and resume. My primary tool has been Access, though I am just getting started with VBA in Access.
 I know that the former version of Access had an option to turn the database into the beginnings of a SharePoint App (I think that has a new name now, but it is essentially the same idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of SharePoint should I get to go with my Home version of Office 2016? Should I get a different Office product? (This one is a trial 1 month free, so I can change it if that works better) and where do I go to get it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have asked a tech, but I have been unable to get connected to chat this morning. I don't know if they are having problems or if this is a bug that just started up in my stystem.</p>

<p>https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/compare-sharepoint-plans/</p>
<p>I don't know that much about SharePoint, but I am guessing that for purposes of designing an Access database with SharePoint tables Plan 1 would do.</p>

<h2>            &#34;You&#39;ve chosen to save this web page using short file names&#34;</h2>
                    <p><span>Dear Community,</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would really appreciate any advice you can give to a basic Word user.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I have a Word 2007 doc which contains left, top and right frames (pic attached). I want to convert this doc into a web page or whichever file just so I could send a link
 to it to my colleagues who would then open it in internet explorer, not word doc. I already have this doc in Word and really&nbsp;</span><span>don't</span><span>&nbsp;have&nbsp;technical skills to do it any programmes to create
 web page or write codes. I just want to convert it to a web page or&nbsp;</span><span>whatever</span><span>&nbsp;could be opened in IE.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I try to do it by Save As web page I get a message "You've chosen to save this web page using short file names". As much as I understood my file
 name should be in 8.3 format but all my frame/file names are under 8 characters. If I understood it, the system is interpreting that the file name is ‘My drive/desktop/folder name/file name’ which is obviously longer than 8.3 format.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I understand that Word is a no no for creating web pages but I already have this doc fully functional in Word and I would just need that final step (if possible).&nbsp;</span><span>I've</span><span>&nbsp;checked
 many websites and there are no clear explanations if and how to resolve this matter. One site recommended selecting ‘to use&nbsp;longer file names’ via Word Options/Advanced/Web options/Files but that doesn’t work.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any thoughts how this could be resolved I would really appreciate it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks all.</span></p>

<h2>            File Explorer and OneDrive for Business Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Please could someone help. &nbsp; I've upgraded to W10 and everything seemed to be just fine, but about a month ago my OneDrive for business has stopped syncing completely. &nbsp;Whenever I try to look at the sync problems the application just keeps crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, the file explorer is almost becoming unworkable. &nbsp;Whenever I open it the screen states that it's "Working on it..." and then just hangs. &nbsp; I thought this was just for the new Quick Access feature but it does it for This PC, Downloads....pretty
 much everything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically the personal OneDrive seems to be just fine. &nbsp;If only I could have kept this when I "upgraded" to Office 365 pro...&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone can help it would be appreciated as the slowdown in performance is driving me mad!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gareth</p>

<p>hi gareth,</p>
<p>to troubleshot the issue, can you try the following steps to clear the onedrive for business cache?</p>
<p>1. make sure that you have the most current version of onedrive for business installed:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/update-the-onedrive-for-business-sync-app-49771c73-e7ad-4d26-bff1-50bb12a83817?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update the onedrive for business sync app</a>.</p>
<p>2. stop syncing your current onedrive for business libraries via right clicking on the onedrive for business icon and selecting<strong> stop syncing a folder</strong>. and then exit the onedrive for business sync client.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=79da30a7-d23f-4f51-a30f-c6c9d88f8418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d79da30a7-d23f-4f51-a30f-c6c9d88f8418" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6375ef2e-56f4-4dde-9fbe-a0e90468c3bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6375ef2e-56f4-4dde-9fbe-a0e90468c3bc" /></a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; <br />
<strong>3.</strong> if the application keeps crashing when you stop syncing a folder or exit, please end the onedrive for business process via<strong> task manager &gt; processes &gt; onedrive for business &gt; end task</strong>.
<br />
4. use the<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> “fix it” tool
</a>to clear the cache, then delete or rename the current “onedrive for business” folder.<br />
5. go to your onedrive for business library in the browser and re-sync it.</p>
<p>in addition, to fix onedrive for business sync problem, please refer to : <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-onedrive-for-business-sync-problems-e12c6a8b-4bbe-4391-9c23-1a52b55a1967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-onedrive-for-business-sync-problems-e12c6a8b-4bbe-4391-9c23-1a52b55a1967</a></p>
<p>if the issue persists, can you confirm the following details?</p>
<p>1. how many files do you sync with onedrive for business? <br />
2. can you share with us a screenshot about “whenever i open it the screen states that it's "working on it..." and then just hangs”?</p>
<p>to upload images, please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> when replying to the post, then click the
<strong>insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>

<h2>            Can I retreive my windows phone contacts&#63;</h2>
                    Bought a new computer with windows 7 and windows live mail. Already had hotmail account for my Nokia 710. Logged&nbsp;into the account and received all my phone contacts in the mail account. Not understanding the programs I deleted the contacts. Not knowing
 it was on the live account instead of my computer I deleted the phone contacts&nbsp;and did a export/import from my old outlook express address folder. My&nbsp;contacts for email are now in the live account.&nbsp;Now I only have my address folder in my phone. I set up another
 account for my phone.&nbsp;How can I restore my phone contacts?

            If you visit Hotmail Conacts, there's a restore deleted contacts option. They are only permanently deleted after 30 days.<br />

<h2>            Search not showing emails sent to me</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for a particular email sent to me sometime in the last two years. I have tried searching all and narrowing down to the two years. The email was one with an important attachment but it does not come up anywhere. When I search by name and with
 the full email, for some reason it only shows me the messages I sent out and not any of the emails that were sent to me. The only times I can see what the other person emailed me, is if I click an email with my reply and scroll down to see everything else
 before that however this email was not one I replied to so I cannot find it under my responses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not under the sent folder when searching, I made sure to check the inbox and have also tried searching "from: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and have added the filter "to me" and searched the email and nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix it??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Katy,<br />
<br />
Instant Search helps you to quickly find items in Outlook. Regarding your concern, do you search the email online through Outlook.com or do you use the Outlook app? Also, can you tell us other troubleshooting steps that you have tried so far?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use the app normally. I searched online on outlook.com. Most of what i tried included narrowing down dates, searching by name and the full email address, switching to only inbox messages (when i did this absolutely no messages would come up even
 though I’ve never deleted emails from this person before), and I manually went through my emails on my inbox and theres absolutely nothing from the person im looking for. I have this issue on a separate outlook email that I use as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unsure if maybe thats something that happens after ive had the emails for too long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer won&#39;t load any pages after recent OS upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded an older PC of mine from Win 7 to Win 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; I did install all Microsoft/Windows updates, and for the browsers, installed newest versions of Java and enabled, and Flash Player and enabled.&nbsp; I was sure to remove older versions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Internet Explorer will not load any pages in either the desktop or immersive modes.&nbsp; I use Bing as my homepage and if I hit the 'home' button, the screen turns grey at the top as if the page is loading, but no text, no images nothing.&nbsp; I am a moderately
 advanced user and went through the community troubleshooting as well as using the built in trouble shooter in Windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Steps I have taken:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Built in troubleshooter, followed instruction, no errors found.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Disable/Enable all plug-ins and restart...no effect.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Disable/Enable Internet Explorer in "Turn Windows Features On/Off" function of Control Panel.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; Made double sure all updates are completed, and obsolete versions of all updates/plug-ins removed</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; Ran "Malwarebytes" and found no unusual errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Community information with this inquiry, other browsers work fine with all plugins and load pages fine.&nbsp; Firewall settings are stock and my internet works fine.&nbsp; I need I.E. to work because it is a browser that works with my employment and helps arrange
 data from all my Microsoft devices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help the Community can give.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for any efforts.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; No 3rd party anti-virus.&nbsp; Just Win Defender</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; No third party firewall or anti-malware</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Yes, it is a Vaio laptop.&nbsp; Shipped in 2010 with Norton.&nbsp; I upgraded from that to Norton 360 in 2011 for a year.&nbsp; Then realized it wasn't really doing anything except using CPU cycles.&nbsp; Did a full uninstall, and removed registry information after uninstall
 in 2012.&nbsp; </p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Norton Free trial was preinstalled upon purchase of the laptop.&nbsp; (Please see above answer 4)</p>

</p><p>It has been now 3 days that we can't connect Excel (but also Word and PPT) to our Office account. When prompted to enter our email and PW (which still function on Excel online and Office.com), the window loads forever but nothing happens. When we close this
 window, we invariably receive a message (in French so I translate it): "Impossible to open file. Please connect with an account authorized to open this file"</p>
<p>
</p><p>We haven't changed anything except doing many uninstall of office (including files in the library) and reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot</p>

<p>Hi Stephan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may be caused by the version of your Office applications. As I couldn't reproduce the same issue on our side wit the latest version of the Office applications, you may try updating your Office applications to the latest version to fix it. You
 may refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Download and install the latest version of the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 AutoUpdate tool</a>;</p>
<p>2. Open any Office application &gt; click Help in the top menu &gt; select Check for Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still couldn't open the file in your Office applications, please check if this is related to the permission of the files. For example, you may create a Excel workbook in your own OneDrive for Business website and see if you could open it with the
 Office applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I'd like to confirm if you share your Mac with other colleagues. If so, this may be related to the cache files of other accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my above information couldn't help, I'd appreciate it if you could provide us the following information for further assistance:</p>
<p>1. Please click Excel in the top menu &gt; About Excel &gt; capture a screenshot of the detailed version information;</p>
<p>2. Please also take a screenshot of the error message so that we may check it for you;</p>
<p>3. Does this files store in the same SharePoint site? If so, do you have the same issue when opening files on other sites?</p>
<p>4. Does the site owners encounter the same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your long answer. Please find my answer below</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download and install the latest version of the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft AutoUpdate tool</a>;<strong>&nbsp;DONE</strong></p>
<p>2. Open any Office application &gt; click Help in the top menu &gt; select Check for Updates.<strong>&nbsp;ALL OF THEM UP-TO-DATE (however, I have tried (by desperation) to download an older version but as the latest version was already present, it might not
 have functioned. The problem was anyway already present before)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still couldn't open the file in your Office applications, please check if this is related to the permission of the files. For example, you may create a Excel workbook in your own OneDrive for Business website and see if you could open it
 with the Office applications.<strong>&nbsp;I can transfer an excel file from my finder to OneDrive online. I can then open it with Excel online but if I try to open it with Excel from OneDrive Online, it is still the same problem (I can't connect to my account
 on Excel). Basically, OneDrive Online and Excel Online function well. It is Excel (and other Office Softwares) on my Mac that doesn't work properly. I can't activate them nor connect to my account</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I'd like to confirm if you share your Mac with other colleagues. If so, this may be related to the cache files of other accounts.&nbsp;<strong>I don't but I have shared some files with a colleague and have therefore tried to connect with
 her account: no success (the same for her, it doesn't function anymore).&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If my above information couldn't help, I'd appreciate it if you could provide us the following information for further assistance:</p>
<p>1. Please click Excel in the top menu &gt; About Excel &gt; capture a screenshot of the detailed version information;&nbsp;<strong>Done but no possiblity to join an attachment below, please specify how to do it</strong></p>
<p>2. Please also take a screenshot of the error message so that we may check it for you;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Same problem</strong></p>
<p>3. Does this files store in the same SharePoint site? <strong>No idea what Share Point is (is it for PC?)&nbsp;</strong>If so, do you have the same issue when opening files on other sites?<strong> Impossible to open it on 3 different computers in 2 different
 countries</strong></p>
<p><span>4. Does the site owners encounter the same issue?</span>
<strong>All of us</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some&nbsp;other points:</strong></p>
<p><strong>-I have to say that it used to function for months&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Our file seems to be soon to big 4.72 MB</strong></p>
<p><strong>-another Mac is on Yosemite and Excel 16.16 but it is the same problem</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thanks a lot. I feel a bit despaired</strong></p>

<p>Hi Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, It still doesn't function. I have read other questions mentioning the same issue. It seems that since March 9, many other people have the same problem on Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried putting the 3 UBF folders you mentioned to the desktop but also restarting the computer and finally putting all of them to trash (including 2 others for OneDrive) but it remained the same.
</p>
<p>I also had the possibility to log out of my account (see printscreen), which I tried but no changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference with some days ago is that once I try to activate the account, I can enter my email address, it then loads without end (like before) but when I close the activation window, it doesn't tell me anymore that the account is not authorized.</p>
<p>I am joining some printscreen but I guess that the problem comes form Microsoft, not from my computers. It is also incredible because I can't use Office programs anymore (read only features) and I can't even buy them (even if I already bought them) as it
 is impossible for existing account. Basically, I have paid for Office and cannot use it (except on read only). Not good for such a big company as Microsoft.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7b6b04d-79a3-4297-9df6-1204a949751e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7b6b04d-79a3-4297-9df6-1204a949751e?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2c5706d-fe83-490a-8016-6b4f07e722a3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2c5706d-fe83-490a-8016-6b4f07e722a3?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e44ada9-5fd5-4ead-82e7-c55c13fe7d8b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e44ada9-5fd5-4ead-82e7-c55c13fe7d8b?upload=true" /></a>

<p>Hi Stephan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since removing the credentials couldn't work, it may be related to your license or the number of computers you have activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that you can activate Office 365 on five difference computers. You may go to the My Installs page in your Office 365 portal to check how many installs you have used. If you have already used 5 installs, you may select a computer that you don't
 want to use and click "Deactivate" to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, you may also go to the Subscriptions page to check if "The latest desktop version of Office" is still listed there. If not, I'd recommend contacting your subscription admin for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if there is any update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Joyce, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, the error message "<strong>is stored in an unsupported server location</strong>" may arise if the application you're using launch/open Microsoft Word needs to be updated. The other way is opening a file using different device to check if the issue
 is the file you are trying to open to your device or the application where you are tying to open it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, check if you are using the latest version of Microsoft Word for your device. Kindly ensure as well that your operating system is updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Send screen clip to current page</h2>
                    In the options settings under "send to OneNote" there is no option to send screen clippings to the current page. I don't want every clip to go to a new page, I want it on the page I'm working on. Is there a way to make this happen or any plans to incorporate
 this? Going back to Evernote otherwise, don't want to deal with the clutter this creates and the additional steps needed to consolidate the information.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen Clippings is sent to the current page by default, so you can choose the page where you want to send the clippings. We would like to know more about this concern so we can address it accurately:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>

<p>Hello William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would just like to confirm, was the Office suite already installed on the computer when you purchased it, or did you purchase it separately?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Office suite was purchased separately, did you purchase a physical copy (dvd/disc), or a digital copy (purchased through the Microsoft website or code given by the store where you purchased the computer)?</p>

    <title>Office 365 manifest size limit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robinspek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 manifest size limit</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
While trying use the office365 admin portal to upload an add-in for our organization we encountered the following problem: On the final step of the dialog, an error message appears claiming the following:&nbsp;<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R0HQy.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click</a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
With devtools open I can see that the failing request contains the following error message: "FailedWriteToExchange". This is strange, since uploading the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/blob/master/Word/manifest/CitationSample.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contoso
 Citations add-in maninfest</a>&nbsp;works just fine.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
The manifests will work properly if it is sideloaded in Word Desktop (office365), and all XSD checks pass.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
With a little bit of trial and error it seems that there is a limit to how large the manifest-files can be. I tested different versions of the Contoso manifest by padding them with gibberish resource strings until the upload failed. When the manifest size exceeded
 about 36400 bytes, the upload failed. Does anyone know about this size limit? Is there a way to work around it?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi Robin,<br />
<br />
I'd like to make a summary about this case, so other community members who come across this thread will easily find the information<br />
<br />
Issue Description:<br />
================<br />
Some large Add-in manifest file can't be uploaded successfully in Office 365 admin center.<br />
<br />
Assessment:<br />
============<br />
The backend team have checked the issue and acknowledged it is the size of the xml file causing the issue. The problem is related to the Exchange service that we use to store the manifest file. The related teams are working together now to get it fixed. But
 it may take some time to change the code, check in the code, test and deploy to the production environment. We will update here once the issue is resolved.
<br />
<br />
If you have any other questions, feel free to post a new thread and we will keep assisting your from there.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards,<br />
Sky <br />

<p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you are still unable to install the Windows 10 Insider Preview successfully, we recommend that you reset your update components. Resetting the update components is a little tedious, moreover, this will allow you to resolve the issue in installing the
 update. Kindly refer to the link below for the instructions. </p>
