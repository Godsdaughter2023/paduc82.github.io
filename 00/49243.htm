            <p>Is the modem compatible with Windows 7? <br />
<br />
Off-topic, Why would you buy a dial up modem instead of subscribing to high speed internet? Just asking.
<br />
<br />
Dial up is slow and pretty useless. <br />

<h2>            How do I disable my built-in keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    I spilled water on it and now its useless. I'm using an external keyboard (USB). I tried disabling the built-in keyboard through
<b>Device Manager</b>, it asked me to restart, which I did but its installed back again the next boot up. I've looked up other solutions to just disable it in
<b>Device Manager</b>, which was impossible as the option is grayed out. I've also tried editing something in<i>&nbsp;</i><b>Group Policy Editor</b>&nbsp;that I enable the option called
<i><u><b>Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs</b></u></i>&nbsp;and entered the built-in keyboard's device ID. This stinks as it also disables my TouchPad and 3 of my light indicators for no reason (the Wi-Fi, NumLock and CapsLock indicators)
 and now everywhere I go, I have to bring my USB keyboard <u>AND</u> my mouse, it's very troublesome. It also look very awkward if I were to just use a laptop and yet I have to bring so many things. Is there any way to disable it? I prefer not to take the built-in
 keyboard plug out...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option to disable the built-in keyboard. Since the keyboard has malfunctioned, I would recommend you to contact ASUS Support for better assistance.

            I recommend you take it to a professional PC repair shop and let them inspect and diagnose the issue on site. As far as what we know, there is some significant damage, but anything else would be speculative.

            Andre is right, take it to a professional as we have not much to work on . . .
<br />
<br />Possibilities:
<br />Fan is working a lot - the heat sink has probably dislodged from the processor
<br />
<br />Battery is draining because the fan is working a lot . . .

            <p>The inbuilt tools Windows 10 require a system image to be saved to a clean external disk (e.g. USB Stick) which is normal for any operating system. It cannot be stored with other files on an external drive and cannot be a 'simple' copy of your Hard Disc(s)
 contents, so it seems that either you haven't created a system image correctly, or you've used some third party software that you haven't mentioned.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Refer these methods.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span>Clean boot-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></b><span>It’s a process wherein you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p>
<b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>

    <title>Desktop Location to Network Drive - Icons Dissapear At Least Once A - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop Location to Network Drive - Icons Dissapear At Least Once A Week</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue with a profile user for the past few weeks. Here is an overview of what the issue is and the fixes I've applied already:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- After login, desktop icons are not showing, only the Recycle Bin. The desktop location is set to a network drive folder. My Documents and Favorites location are also in the same drive folder but the issue does not reproduce in these ones, only with the
 Desktop.</p>
<p>- It happens once a week, Tuesday or Wednesday. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time rebooting the PC did the work. </p>
<p>The second time the issue happened the day after the Exchange Server was updated. Rebooting the PC did the work. However, I do not think it caused the issue.</p>
<p>The third time rebooting did not help at all. I deleted the user profile and rebuild it.
</p>
<p>The forth time I found a quicker but Temporary Fix. This time I noticed my Documents and Favorites folder which point to the same shared folder did not have the same issue. So I restore the default location of the Desktop, and change it back to the shared
 folder in the network drive. And there they were all icons again!</p>
<p>The fifth time I did the same as the forth time, but also deleted an old user folder for an old account that the user had. I thought maybe the system was getting confused.</p>
<p>The sixth time, Restoring the default location of the desktop did not work. I proceeded to delete the Desktop folder, re created it and changed the location to the shared folder again. After Refreshing the Desktop, the icons were there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have researched the issue and cannot find a permanent fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I was aware that storing the desktop locally would fix it, but it is not feasible. The desktop is pointing to another location for a reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, this issue I resolved it by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Running All windows updates and patches.</p>
<p>- Then deleted the user profile from an admin account.</p>

            Hi John, 
<br />
<br />bottom left hand corner, look for the windows symbol (start) - when that menu pops up, type "device manager" and you should be able to open it from there. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

            Hi John
<br />
<br />Right your Start Button - that is bottom left of your screen, with a flag on it
<br />
<br />you will see Device Manager
<br />
<br />
<br />Alternatively
<br />
<br />On your keyboard, press the Windows Key + X and you will see Device Manager

            Hmmm, so it plays sounds, but when you’re trying to make a recording (let’s say by speaking) it’s telling you the driver isn’t installed. 
<br />
<br />Let’s try these couple things:
<br />
<br />Let's click start, and type troubleshoot, and then launch the troubleshooter. Select "playing audio" and see if windows can fix the problem. 
<br />
<br />If this doesn’t fix the sound issue. Click start, and type “device manager” - find “sound” and expand it. Right click on high def audio driver, and uninstall. Reboot, and see if you have sound.
<br />
<br />Next, What’s the make and model of your PC? Click start, and type “system” and open system information. Next to system model you should see the model we need. I’ll see if we have any updated drivers for your model.

    <title>Changing win 7 ultimate to home premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdh99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing win 7 ultimate to home premium</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
I have 2 computers A and B both having Win 7.<br />
A has Ultimate, B has Home premium (both being upgrades from XP).<br />
B has 32GB ram but is blocked from using &gt;16GB because Home Premium will not allow it, whereas A has 8GB ram and should never require more than 16GB.<br />
I wish to swap the OS's so that B can use all the ram.<br />
Upgrading B from Home Premium to Ultimate should be straightforward and&nbsp;must stay on Win 7 for some of the Applications.
</p>
<p>BUT:</p>
<p>Q1) How does one change A from Ultimate to Home Prem without wiping all the OS from A &amp; reinstalling the OS from scratch, since I assume that "upgrading to Home premium" from a higher spec of OS is not allowed since all the higher spec of features would
 already be installed &amp; enabled ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2) Would the situation for A be any simpler if I upgraded to Win 8 Pro from Ultimate instead or would the licence for Ultimate prevent it being used on B without it still being wiped from A ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q3) How does one release a license key from 1 computer to prevent it being blocked by microsoft when reused on B</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully a simple solution is possible.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It would be simpler and would still relinquish the Ultimate license because the base qualifying license was always Windows XP which originally upgraded from.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q3) How does one release a license key from 1 computer to prevent it being blocked by microsoft when reused on B</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Well, you could do the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Click Start, type: CMD<br />
Right click CMD<br />
Click Run as administrator<br />
At the command prompt, type: slmgr.vbs -upk</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hit Enter, this will uninstall the product key from the computer and set it back to trial mode, you are now free to use it on another computer. If you encounter any problems, try activating by telephone:<br />
Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully a simple solution is possible.<br />

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to Q1 above, I have tried the downgrader but this does not work as described when downgrading Win 7 from Ultimate to Home Premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the steps in&nbsp;the "Downgrader" link:</p>
<p>All the steps to the "Upgrade"&nbsp;step are followed as described and are OK,</p>
<p>When I select "Upgrade", the message&nbsp;&nbsp;"<font color="#1370ab">Windows 7 Ultimate cannot be upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium"</font>&nbsp; is still given and Windows will not proceed with the installation, only the "Custom" option to reinstall is then
 possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any other way of downgrading without reinstalling the windows and having to reinstall all the apps &amp; settings again ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
        </p>

<h2>            No Mic setting on the Skype for Mac version 8.24.0.2</h2>
                    <p>Nobody can hear me. I am guessing that Microsoft don't even bother to answer queries here, judging by the other threads, so I have to ask the 'community'. I have no mic setting when I open up the audio and video setting window, so I cannot even identify
 and set the mic. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Elba- Thank you for the support link. Unfortunatly, the info is for an older version of MacOS Skype.&nbsp; Audio &amp; Video Settings have been seperated from the other settings and look nothing like the picture or steps in the article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with #LewisEvans1 - The Microphone settings are not part of the lastest MacOS Skype update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what Audio &amp; Video Settings looked like in the previous version of MacOS Skype: Skype
<strong>version 8.23.0.10 - Calling version 2018.22.0-1.13</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/854c8241-b8de-4f48-bf60-d23bb9849af4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/854c8241-b8de-4f48-bf60-d23bb9849af4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And, this is what Audio &amp; Video Settings looks like in the current version of MacOS Skype:
<strong>Skype version 8.24.0.2 - Calling version 2018.24.0-1.6</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bccc3d6c-d6ad-468c-80ea-715beff559c7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bccc3d6c-d6ad-468c-80ea-715beff559c7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly, the microphone setting is missing. The usability has been reduced and is somewhat challenged (Buggy!).

<p>Microsoft don't help on this issue. What you need to do is revert to a previous version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go here: https://go.skype.com/classic.skype. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have downloaded it. Make sure you delete the new crappy version before installing it. Nothing will be lost. I did it, and it's fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing you must do is go into the preferences and prevent it from updating automatically.</p>

<h2>            Voice Messaging and Speech-To-Text&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I searched the forums for voice message, and the last thread I saw tagged with XBox One was in February... so where is the voice message option when messaging a friend? For the life of me I cannot find it.</p>
<p>Also, what is the command to get the XBox One to type out your message (speech-to-text). I've gotten really accustomed to Cortana on my windows phone typing out everything I speak, so I think I'm safe in assuming the XBox One can do that as well?</p>
<p><br />
I just got mine on Wednesday, so I feel a little dumb asking these questions here, but I just cant find these options on the console.</p>

<br />
<ol>
<li><u>Can I use this image to create a bootable USB to reinstall my OS ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Ans:</u> Yes and No. Install Windows, all your favourie applications, do all your tweekings. Do all system maintenance works like Disk clean up, De fragmentation etc using your favorite
 system Maintenance software. Now only go for your image backup and creation of Recovery CD. No bootable device can be made with this backup. In fact you do not need one. Booting your doing with the Recovery CD.<br />
</li><li><u>How many ways ????. Ans:</u> I do not think there are any other ways you can use this image. I once, only once, copied this image to a 3rd HD, and tried to re-install from that. It was successful. But never after that.</li><li><u>How to recover ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ans: </u>With your Recovery CD in the tray-CD drive, and CD drive as the first boot device-restart your computer. You can go back to your original backed up state in about half an hour with all your applications.</li><li><b>Do not keep your backup image on another partition on the same Physical hard disk. Do it on another external hard drive or get a 64 GB USB 3.0 Pendrive and back it up there</b><u><br />

<h2>            print screen always worked before, but now I press it and try to paste in Word, paste grayed out</h2>
                    I am using Windows XP SP 3 and Office Word 2003, as is my friend .<br />
<br />
I have many times used the Print Screen key to copy a snapshot of the screen to the Windows clipboard. Also, I have asked my friend, who is less computer literate than I, to use this feature to paste the snapshot into a blank Word document and e-mail it to
 me as an attachment so I can see her screen and help her over the phone, many times. But yesterday, she said she tried this and the Paste command in Word was grayed out. Not even a read-only document causes this behavior. You can paste and type all you want
 in such a document, you just can't save it, although you can do a Save As. What could cause this problem, and how can she fix it?<br />

            No it most emphatically does not help. What it shows is that you did not read my question, just the title. Either that or you sincerely believe that even when the Paste command on the Edit menu in Word is grayed out, you can still do a Paste by using the
 keyboard shortcut Ctrl-V. By the way my friend tried both Print Screen and Alt - Print Screen and the result was the same. When the Paste command is grayed out, it usually means the Clipboard is empty so there is nothing to paste; either that or the cursor
 is in a place that cannot accept a paste. Either way, it means the Paste command is disabled. If it is disabled it is disabled, whether you use the Edit menu, the toolbar, or the keyboard shortcut.<br />

            If the MS Answers forums would prompt for some system information when a new question is asked, I would not have to resort to guessing.<br />
<br />
If you have Advanced System Care installed, it can cause the problem you describe.<br />
<br />
If you are using Advanced System Care, you need to take a look at the Toolbox, Smart RAM, Settings and UNcheck the box that says:<br />
<br />
Clean clipboard<br />
<br />
Reboot to be sure the changes "stick" and see how things look.<br />

            Thank you for your response. I gave in detail the version of Windows and of Word we use; I thought that would be enough. I have never heard of Advanced System Care, so as far as I know we don't have it installed. I cannot find it on the All Programs menu,
 including the System Tools and Administrative Tools submenus, and entering Advanced System Care in the Help and Support window search box did not return anything that seemed relevant. But thanks anyway.<br />

            Thanks again for responding. Yes, that did occur to me. That is what I was going to ask her to do the next time she tries to do the screen capture. In the meantime I told her that the only thing I could think of that might help was to reboot. That's my
 catch-all solution for software behaving badly (especially Windows) without any apparent reasonable explanation, and it frequently works. Since then she has rebooted several times I'm sure.<br />
<br />
BTW the program that was running (the active, foreground window) at the time was Quicken. And yes, she has done screenshots successfully of Quicken windows, so I don't think the problem is with Quicken.<br />

            That's all I can think of at the moment, so I hope you are able to figure it out and if you do, let us know the resolution.&nbsp; I forgot to mention to be sure that the screen you want to capture is "active" but you already thought of that.&nbsp; You might also
 test if other captures work besides capturing from Quicken.<br />
<br />
In case you didn't already know, PrintScrn captures the entire screen and Alt-PrintScrn just captures the active window.<br />
<br />
If it seems confined to MS Word, there is a separate forum for Office where somebody might have some other ideas:<br />

            Thanks again. Yes, I was aware of the difference in function between PrintScrn and Alt-PrintScrn. But I'm not sure what you mean by making sure the screen is "active". I thought PrintScrn (as opposed to Alt-PrintScrn) just copied all the pixels in the
 screen memory no matter where they came from. And trying to capture other screens besides Quicken makes sense as a test, but the goal is to capture the Quicken screen. Another test would be to see if the Word doc was capable of accepting any paste at all,
 by copying something other than a screen or window, or if it was capable of accepting anything, by trying to type into it.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the link to the Office forum.<br />

            Fine. Anyway, I finally was able to get my friend to try the screen print again today, and this time it worked. So that leaves unanswered why it didn't work the last time. I have a hunch, but that's all it is. My hunch is that she had Word open with no
 document open in it. She denies this, but when I asked her if the whole client area (which I very carefully defined) was gray, she said she didn't remember.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your help.<br />

    <title>B button on controller not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superbeast321  say:</h3>
<h2>            B button on controller not working</h2>
                    
<p>The b button on my controller mysteriously stopped working and I have no idea why, it's not sticky and there have been no problems in the past, it just simply stopped working. I set it down on my table and went to sleep, woke up the next day and decided
 to play. Turned on my xbox turned on my controller, and started up battlefield 4. I got into a game and started playing when I realized I could not crouch,". Went into my options to make sure they were fine, and realized I couldn't even back out of my settings,
 I then Realized my b button had simply stopped working, when I tried to play other games and had the same problem, but right now i have no money for a new controller, so I need a refund on my controller, considering Microsoft thinks plain gen1 controllers
 should be about the same price as a brand new game title.</p>

<p>That is a shame.</p>
<p>I've never had any trouble with controllers on any system until the XBox ONE.</p>
<p>Day 1 controller got analogue drift, just out of the year's warranty you get with electronic goods in the UK.</p>
<p>My wife's controller bought the same day developed a Faulty DPad.</p>
<p>The left bumper fell out... (yes FELL OUT) of my Elite Controller?!?!?! (thankfully this is within warranty and a replacement new one has been ordered for me by the retailer that sold it).</p>
<p>Depending on how long you've had the controller and where you live you may be able to go to the retailer that sold it and have it exchanged or refunded.</p>
<p>Before you do that though you might want to simply try making sure you have fresh batteries, hard resetting the console by holding down the Power button on the console. &nbsp;Updating your controller with the latest controller updates (yes they have controller
 updates as well as console updates if you weren't aware).</p>
<p>Finally, a disclaimer... you could know all of this stuff already. &nbsp;Some of the stuff like saying "Hey, check your batteries are new" sounds obvious but sometimes it's easy to forget the obvious because it's simply obvious and you think it can't be that.</p>
<p>All suggestions genuinely offered to try and help you. &nbsp;Let us know how you get on.</p>

<p>xxxtony80xxx I would guess you have a broken bumper button, mine did the same as Az's in the post above yours, it was a month old Elite and it just stopped responding, then when I looked at it the whole button was loose. It seems a very common problem where
 the plastic underneath holding the button snaps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This all started by me calling a norton number because they had charge my credit card for a renewal and i have been using MSE for sometime with no problems. I told this fellow(who i thought was a Norton rep)&nbsp;i dont even use the same card the charge was made
 to so i dont know how it happened and he went on to say i have a virus and thats how it probably happened and that MSE is not protecting me like it should? Anyhow he used the control program to get on my computer and show me i had active viruses and that i
 needed his help to take care of it also said i had foreign user accounts using my computer and probably accessing my finacial info and talked me into a 1yr sub for $150. I can get my momey bachk (supposedly) in next 30 days if i am not happy. Anybody know
 anything about these people? please help with any usefull info. Also i call Norton today to get my money back and they say they are not affiliated with Albion</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If they contacted you it probably is part of a SCAM, especially if they did not make it<br />
very clear who they were. <br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 update download failed with error 80244019 &#47; dt000</h2>
                    <p>Whilst my Win 8.1 HP Laptop auto-download for the Win 10 upgrade was in progress, message said an unknown error occurred and to look-up: "WindowsUpdate_80244019 or&nbsp;WindowsUpdate_dt000". Suggestion was to boot-up in safe mode and scan the laptop for viruses,
 but McAfee would not scan in safe mode - scan run in normal mode show no viruses present.</p>

            <p>Just to finish the story of my failed Win 10 download, if anyone is interested ... the commands described above did repair the two corrupt files and Windows 10 downloaded ok, BUT the Win 8.1 "update" screen kept saying "cannot access updates ... restart
 the PC" (or words to that effect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent a lot of time trying to sort this out and didn't dare upgrade to Win 10 with a potential issue hanging over the PC. Eventually ran of time &amp; patience after a couple of days and succumbed to a clean Windows 8.1 re-install. The' get Win 10 app' appeared
 in the task bar after installing the many updates to Win 8.1 - day or so later Win 10 downloaded and upgraded this morning. Everything went smoothly during the install and experienced&nbsp;no issues so far with Win 10 - my desktop PC upgrade to Win 10 resulted
 in problems with networking/homegroup and Outlook (see below*).</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Note: after upgrading my desktop PC on 29/7/2015, couldn't "send" e-mails - sorted that with advice from this forum (corrupted file again!) using following: &nbsp;Right click windows start in bottom/left of taskbar and select&nbsp;<span>"Command
 Prompt (Run as administrator)" from list, then enter:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"sfc /scannow" without quotes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10 seems good though takes a while to find everything of course. Didn't like the "white" explorer window title bars - terrible as the window blends into the background. Solution
 to have user defined coloured title bar obtained from: &nbsp;</span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_personal/the-white-window-title-bars-have-got-to-go/9017595d-cdfd-4357-86b4-4da1399ecc82</p>

<p><span>Hi imnewtothis,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you get any error message when you try to rip the songs from the scratched CDs?</span></p>
<p><span>You may try cleaning the CDs with with a disc cleaning kit or by gently wiping the silver side of the disc from the center outward with a dry, soft,
 lint-free, cotton cloth and then try ripping it and check if it helps.<br />
<em>Note: Do not use a paper cloth, and do not use a circular motion to clean the disc. These can scratch the disc.</em></span></p>
<p><span>If you are still not able to rip the songs from the scratched CDs then, you may want to use third party CD ripping software’s and check if it helps.
 Use your favorite search engine to find the software.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Disclaimer:</span></em></strong><em><span><br />
