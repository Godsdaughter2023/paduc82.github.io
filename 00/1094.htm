            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />The first thing that i would try in your case is change the account password trough the web browser and see if there you can send and reply to messages without issues.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't solve the issue may an add-in could be causing the problem.
<br />
<br />Try opening Outlook in safe mode.
<br />
<br />Windows + R, then type outlook.exe /safe
<br />
<br />If that worked, disable the suspicious add-ins that you think might be causing the problem.
<br />
<br />Disable the addins
<br />

<br />
<br />If that doesn't work.
<br />
<br />Create another Outlook profile, add the account and try again (This won't erase anything).
<br />
<br />Go to Windows Control Panel &gt; Mail &gt; Show Profiles &gt; Add.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work perform an Office repair.

<h2>            no software updates for nokia 5235</h2>
                    
<p>hello this ranjit from india a shamed/embarrased user of &nbsp; nokia 5235</p>
<p>This is a big disappointment for nokia 5235 owners. there have been absolutely no software updates for the phone like as if the phone never existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whereas the lower end phones(both in features as well as price) like nokia 5233 and nokia 5230 have been getting timely software updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is nokia fooling us like this ???</strong> ( first it was the memory issue : i got only 70 mb phone memory out of which only 12 mb is free after downloading apps whereas in other countries it is said to have 256 or 512 mb!!!!!!!!! ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is one serious question i really truly feel like asking.</p>
<p>ARE THE GUYS AT NOKIA OUT OF THEIR MINDS ????!!!!!!!</p>
<p>DO THEY WANT TO LOSE THEIR EXISTING CUSTOMERS AS WELL ???</p>
<p>ANYWAYS&nbsp; their sales are declining.</p>
<p>i dont see nokia going anywhere in the future if it keeps putting out half-baked products like these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>one more thing before i end,</p>
<p>I bought this phone solely on the looks, and not because of the features(3g or no 3g I just dont care).</p>
<p>i realise i made a mistake by getting this model or rather this brand.</p>
<p>NOKIA IS OVER FOR ME. I'LL NEVER BUY A NOKIA AGAIN !!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> threepeakshigh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016  Tables Names</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Attempting to change the table names which excel has given by default, I have in doing so accidentally created a second name rather than renaming the table, now this second name is linked to the original name and upon choosing this name it then displays
 the original name only.</p>
<p>For instance the original name was&nbsp; AUG_1025 and I wanted AUG_19 which I created separately and is now inextricably linked to the original name.</p>
<p>I cannot now rename the table with AUG_19 as it is a duplicate name and I&nbsp; cannot see a way to delete the AUG_19, I presume that there must be a way to do this?</p>

    <title>Lumia 2520 Power Keyboard Battery Level - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sven johannsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 2520 Power Keyboard Battery Level</h2>
                    
<p>Apologies to those of you who are still waiting/looking for one of these. Got my free one this week. For those that do have one, I guess you have noticed that the Battery icon in the system tray on the desktop lets you see both the tablet and the keyboard
 power status, Charged, percentage, not charging, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My tablet gets to 100% just fine. The keyboard has never seen above 87%, and at that point actually says 'not charging'. I can drain it some, and plug it back in and it will show the keyboard charging, but it hasn't got above 85-87% and then says it has
 quit. What do you guys see? Normal? Problem?</p>

<p>My Lumia 2520 with Nokia Power Keyboard shows Battery #1: Fully charged (100%) and Battery #2: 0% available (plugged in, charging). However, even after more than 8 hours plugged in and showing "charging", Battery #2 never shows more than 0%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tablet was a used gift,but the keyboard is new, ordered online from Verizon. It has done this from the first time using the tablet with the new keyboard. As far as I know, the tablet never had a keyboard attached until now. All keyboard functions appear
 to work properly and all tablet functions appear to work properly. I used the tablet with the keyboard for several hours unplugged and the Battery #1 disharged to about 80%. When I plugged it in, Battery #1 charged up to 100% and then it showed Battery #2
 plugged in and charging, but never changed from 0% available on Battery #2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the Power button and +Volume button technique with no change. It does go throught the stages of showing 0%, not charging on both batteries and then after resetting it goes back to showing the same issue of never showing an increase in Battery
 #2charge % beyond 0%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia telephone tech support had me go through that same exercise with no fix. I also refreshed Windows to see if a driver was corrupt with no joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the nearby Verizon, AT&amp;T or Microsoft stores have the Nokia Porwe Keyboard in stock so I ordered another keyboard from Verizon and if it works then will get a refund on this one that isn't working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has any other ideas on how to get the keyboard battery to show that it is charged beyond 0% then please let me know so I won't be returning a good keyboard thinking it is defective.</p>

<p>Mine finally straightened itself out, most of the time. I have had an occaision or two when the tablet wasn't quite seated perfectly. Surprisingly hard to tell, but then it didn't work at all.&nbsp;Occaisionaly I get that the keyboard only shows up to 80%, plugged
 in, not charging, when the tablet is full. This is honestly not my favorite peripheral. In the keyboard it makes tablet use very awkward, and the angle is a bit steep when in laptop mode, IMHO. The two added USBs on the back should really be 3.0, especially
 since the USB 3.0 on the tablet is such a pain to use. Nice cover for the protection, but not sure the added time&nbsp;of the battery really makes up for the annoyances, inconsistency, weight, angle, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got mine free with the initial program, so am certainly
 not upset, just not sure I would have been real happy had I paid for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do hope your issue gets resolved. Does sound like a bad unit, if it never comes off 0.</p>

            The 2nd keyboard from Verizon did the same thing. I took the tablet and the keyboards to a Verizon store. They didn't have any keyboards to test on my tablet, but they put my 2 keyboards on their tablet and both showed 100% charged. So my tablet charged
 the keyboard, but didn't show it.<br />
<br />
Based on this I contacted Nokia. We went through a few tests and and they agreed there was a problem with my tablet. They sent me a postage paid shipping box. I sent my tablet to them and they sent it back. It now works like it should, shows both batteries
 and both batteries will charge to 100%.<br />
<br />
Verizon have me a full refund on the 2nd keyboard and a $10 bill credit for my trouble. So I'm satisfied. Except I wish I knew what Nokia did to fix it in case it does it again after the warranty expires.<br />

<p>Well, My original unit just sort of fixed itself, as I posted. Over time the back of the keyboard, where the battery bulge and guts are started separating. I contacted Nokia support and arranged a warranty exchange, so I'm on my second keyboard. This one
 seems to be working fine, and I had even forgotten about the issue until the email notified me of the the new post in the thread. Can't really help about 'fixing' the problem, since the first just sort of fixed itself, and the second seems OK. I still like
 the Lumia and use it every day. I'm on it right now. The keyboard isn't it's highlight though, IMHO. I am interested to see what MS, who is now responsible for it, does with it concerning Win 10. Guess it depends first on what they do with 'their own' RT devices.</p>

            <p>Experience with the same issues . . . sent in for warranty replacement and still the warranty replacement keyboard behaves the same.&nbsp; Not happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How should we charge the power keyboard?</p>

            <p>The only way to charge the keyboard is to stick the Lumia into it and charge the Lumia. No other option. In my experience it charges the Lumia first (Battery #1) and then the keyboard (Battery #2). It seems the keyboard doesn't even start until the tablet
 is full. It appears to discharge in reverse, keyboard first, then tablet. You can only see the two batteries on the battery icon in the system tray on the desktop. You only see one battery if the keyboard isn't attached of course. The overall charge seen with
 the tray icon and with the charms seems to be some strange average or combined percentage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine takes a couple of hours from almost dead to full charge on both the tablet and keyboard.&nbsp; I have been trying to be better about&nbsp;charging it up, and using it unplugged. It is better for the batteries to exercise them, rather than to run on AC all the
 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know what to tell you about getting it to work, other than making sure it is connected solidly. Do the USB ports in the back work? Did you just recently do the warranty exchange? I'm sort of surprised that still exists. Could try again. You probably
 read the whole thread, so you know my first just fixed itself, and the second just worked. Still working BTW. On it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hate to say it, but I think this is sort of an orphan device. I am not even especially hopeful it will be included in what MS intends to do for their own RT devices. Mine still does it's job admirably, and gets the updates RTs get, but I'm kind of resigned
 to using it till it dies, and finding something else at that point. I'm thinking Surface 3 with LTE. (Or maybe 4 by that time)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks.&nbsp; Still wondering if there is another step we're missing.&nbsp; Even when not docked the tablet was offering a reading for battery #2 (not plugged in; not charging).&nbsp; Were we somehow supposed to reset the tablet before docking and charging?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The warranty replacement keyboard behaves the same.&nbsp; Issues are the same. When not connected to the AC adapter, the keyboard drains the tablet battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps there is a restore point/update setting that made them suddenly incompatible.&nbsp; ?!?</p>

            <p>I'm on mine right now. When I pull the tablet from the keyboard, the battery popup says Battery #2: Not present. When I put it back the percentage is again displayed. No other action, reset, restart, nothing. Just remove and replace while running. I get
 the same sort of sound you get when attaching or&nbsp;removing a USB device on regular PCs, so&nbsp;the tablet recognizes the change.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Left mine off AC last night and this morning the tablet says 100%, and the keyboard has dropped from almost full to almost empty while I have been using the pair. So mine does what I think is normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if it is some issue with some keyboards. They seemed to have a strange life, hard to find, variable reports of issues. I'm pretty **** about keeping things updated, so everything that has been offered has been installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can really offer is 'good luck'. Sorry.</p>

<h2>            Help transferring contacts to the 6680.</h2>
                    I've just bought a second hand 6680.<br />
I want to transfer my contact list from my PDA via Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, when I do this... I HAVE to accept the incoming alert for EVERY contact.<br />
<br />
That's not the worst part.<br />
The contact is received as a text message.<br />
I have to open up the text message and request to save the contact and then delete the message.<br />
<br />
Erm... why is it like this!!?<br />
Did Motoroal have a hand in making the interface for this phone?<br />
<br />
With other phones... you can just have the phone accept all incoming contacts and no other action is needed.<br />
<br />
There must be a quick way?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

            If the 6680 and PDA are both either locked to the same network or unlocked to any network you can try this:<br />
<br />
Put a SIM card in the PDA and copy all your contacts to it (sorry, I can't tell your step-by-step how to do this because I don't know your PDA!). Next, put the SIM card in your 6680 and go Contacts &gt; Options &gt; SIM contacts &gt; SIM directory &gt; Options &gt; Mark/Unmark
 &gt; Mark all &gt; Options &gt; Copy to Contacts.<br />
<br />
Phew. :p

            the pda i've got is a pda: not a phone.<br />
ther phones, like sony eircsson and samsung (with some not obvious settings changes) all allow the transfer in one go.<br />
<br />
the 6680 is still a relatively new phone.<br />
i find the usability is very poor compared to other nokia's and sony ericsson's.

If you o into bluetooth and press left on the pad you get a list of all the phones able to connect. Scroll down to the PDA name and press options then in the new pop up scroll to set as authorised.
<br />
I know this doesn't help with the opening and saving of text business cards but it will mean it can accept all the messages without having to manually press accept each time.

Well I backed up my phone memory a few weeks ago on the PC suite and I also backed up onto my memory card but when I reset the phone and restored from card it hasn't restored my contact so I'm really unhappy. Just about to see if PC suite has backed up my contacts
 as asked. Wish me luck.

            Hello outlookissue1
<br />
<br />Thanks fro sharing your issue with Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />If you can add new account in Outlook you have to do:
<br />
<br />Fille&gt; Information &gt; Setting Account  &gt; Mail &gt; Profile.
<br />
<br />You have to add new account and then delete old account.
<br />
<br />If you have issue to do that procedure then I suggest to  create a new profile and then set up new account, when profile has done delete the other one.
<br />

<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes.

<br />I switched to another outlook account, and I would like to set the new one as the primary account, and delete the old one in the Microsoft Office 365 - Outlook
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />If I understand the question correctly, you want to use a new email account in Outlook as the "default" email account - correct? If yes............
<br />
<br />There are two ways to go about that
<br />
<br />Option #1
<br />
<br />- Add the new email account to the Outlook profile first
<br />- Set the newly added account as the "default email account" 
<br />(go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; email tab --&gt; set the email account as the default)
<br />- set the data file for the newly added email account as the "default data file" for the profile (this is where the default contact/calendar folders will be stored)
<br />(go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab --&gt; highlight the data file for the newly added account --&gt; set it as the "default"
<br />- return to the Email tab and remove the old account
<br />
<br />*** note, if you have contact/calendar data that you want to save, be sure to export that data to a PST file before removing the email account if it's an Exchange or IMAP account. If the old account is configured as a POP3 account, the data file for the account will remain and appear in the Outlook Navigation Pane)
<br />
<br />Option #2
<br />
<br />- With Outlook closed, open the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app and add a new profile 
<br />(click on &lt;Show Profiles&gt; --&gt; &lt;Add&gt;)
<br />- configure the new email account
<br />- be sure to set the newly created profile as the default for the next time Outlook is opened (there is no need to delete the old profile at this point)
<br />
<br />*** similar note as for Option #1, be sure you have any data backed up that you want to retain in the new email account.

<p>Thank you for both replies. Though, my problem is to delete the only and primary (basic) account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way I have found to solve the problem at the end is to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- add a new data file, which named "My Outlook Data File" as default</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab --&gt; Add --&gt; OK)</p>
<p>- return to the Email tab and delete the primary account</p>
<p>- add the new account, which would be set as default automatically</p>
<p>- return to the Data Files tab and remove the former "My Outlook Data File"</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. to remove the "My Outlook Data File" completely, deleting from the folder directory "Outlook Files" is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope these answers would help anyone who have problems with the outlook account setting.</p>

    <title>Office 365 Client Submission - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian wb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Client Submission</h2>
                    <p>I've having a problem setting up SMTP Client Submission to an Office 365 mailbox - can anyone advise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an externally hosted&nbsp;learning platform&nbsp;which caters for everyone employed by our organisation, and also for some external users. I'm wanting to&nbsp; allow this platform to send email alerts, password resets etc. to users, but&nbsp;without getting a whole load
 of bounced emails, spoof warnings etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks as if Office 365 Client Submission via SMTP is the right choice to achieve this, and so I've configured the learning platform accordingly, using a licensed Office 365 mailbox in the format "learningplatform @ ourcompanydomain.com" - but it doesn't
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything in the log suggests that the&nbsp;client (the platform) and server (Office 365) talk to one another happily, except that right towards the end of the process, the server throws an error:<br />
SERVER -&gt; CLIENT: 550 5.7.60 SMTP; Client does not have permissions to send as this sender [DB6PR06MB3064.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So the question is</strong>: In Office 365 (presumably Exchange admin?) what is the process to set 'Send As' permissions on the "learningplatform @ ourcompanydomain.com"&nbsp;mailbox, bearing in mind that the identifier for the external platform is an
 IP address or CNAME?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly our IT team don't have experience in setting up Client Submission&nbsp;so I need to be able to give them clear instruction on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can help...</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Erick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We now have Outlook Client&nbsp;Submission (almost) working successfully). The key to it was adding the IP address of our external client to our internal SPF record.&nbsp;I'm assuming that this was a restriction applied by our own mail server, and therefore not as
 a result of the process itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have however found another issue, with&nbsp;a transport rule we set up to make sure we have copies of outgoing messages. The rule is "the sender is this person &gt; add recipients to the bcc box". This works fine for normal emails, eg password resets, but when
 the mail is a calendar notification, this goes straight to the deleted folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within OWA,&nbsp;the setting "delete notifications about forwarded events" is unchecked, and I also unchecked "delete invitations and responses that have been updated".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other settings either in OWA or Exchange&nbsp;that might be causing&nbsp;this behaviour? We use 365 with Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ian</p>

    <title>MS Office 2016 -- PKC License - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Office 2016 -- PKC License</h2>
                    <p>Good day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask a few questions,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Does Office 2016 PKC allow for replacement on a separate computer? As I am aware the primary device has got to be rid of the software, I'd like to know whether under such conditions one would still be able to maintain a valid license as long as it concerns
 1 PC at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Since, as far as I am aware, the two major distributions Office 2016 Home comes under prove PKC and Digital Download, is it true they do not contain the retainers of earlier versions such as 2007 and 2010? In the case of the prior two, it were possible
 to attain other more favorable variations such as FPP, reasoning out a limitation for PKC, namely-- preventing the users to move the license to a different machine under any conditions. What I'd like to know is whether that still applies in Office 2016, as
 reading these terms-- <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Office/2016HomeAndStudent/Useterms_Retail_Office_2016HomeAndStudent_ENG.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Office/2016HomeAndStudent/Useterms_Retail_Office_2016HomeAndStudent_ENG.htm</a>&nbsp;-- it is quite clearly stated '<strong><span>b.</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;Stand-alone software acquired from a retailer.&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If
 you acquired the software from a retailer as stand-alone software, you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you, but not more than one time every 90 days (except due to hardware failure, in which case you may transfer sooner). If you
 transfer the software to another device, that other device becomes the “licensed device.” You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms
 of this agreement. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</span>'</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd want to find out is whether that applies for the PKC, as it wouldn't make much sense that it doesn't since we're provided only two major versions-- PKC and Digital Download.</p>

<h2>            how to recover the removed Entourage without the original installation .dmg</h2>
                    I removed all component of office for Mac 2008 except Entourage after I installed 2011 version. I noticed we can't import Entourage mail to Outlook in 2011. That's why I kept Entourage for the previous campus email. But recently I ACCIDENTLY removed Entourage
 from the Dock.&nbsp;I couldn't find anything about Entourage in Application folder anymore.&nbsp;And I am not able to re-install previous campus office for Mac 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any way I can recover it?&nbsp;

            Entourage should be in the Microsoft Office 2008 folder in Applications. However it uses other files in the folder. If it fails to open, then you'll need to re-install which you can't do if you don't have an installer. Do you have a friend that has it
 installed? If yes, try repairing your data there. I do recoveries for clients if all else fails for you.

    <title>Link to OneNote Page from SharePoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arturonevarez dominguez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Link to OneNote Page from SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>I need to create tasks in SharePoint&nbsp;that contain links to different&nbsp;pages within a OneNote Notebook. The easier way is to use the "Copy Link to Page" option in OneNote, however this creates a link that starts with "onenote:" which is not and accepted format
 for SharePoint. I tried deliting the "onenote:" part, leaving the rest of the link. Unfortunatley this only opens the page if you are the person who created the link, if someone else tries, it only opens the notebook but not the page.</p>
<p>The only workarround that I have been able to find is to create a new outlook task within the&nbsp;target OneNote Notebook. This creates an outlook task with a .one link file attached. You can than use this file as a link from anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix the issue with the links generated from the "Copy Link to Page" or another way to create&nbsp;a .one link file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Arturo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the <strong>reasons why you were unable to open several links</strong> of your
<strong>OneNote</strong> notebooks using your <strong>tasks </strong>in <strong>SharePoint
</strong>is because the <strong>SharePoint component that is supposed to be included in your Office tools is not installed</strong>. To better assist you, we need the answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which <strong>version of Windows</strong> are you using?</li><li>Are you working with <strong>computers </strong><strong>connected to a domain</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

            PowerPoint's graphics capabilities are pale compared to PhotoShop. Since you need a PhotoShop effect, it would be best to do the graphic in PhotoShop then import the final result to PowerPoint.<br />

<h2>            E-50 &#38;quot&#59;Select Access Point&#38;quot&#59; prompt</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought 7 Nokia E-50s a while back along with bluetooth GPS units.&nbsp; I volunteer at my local Air Cadet Sqn and we wanted to use the units for tracking groups out walking, sending co-ords to the internet for viewing ona laptop, a great safety tool!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few different bits of software to use for this GPSTrackLive has proven to be the best, I have had the same issue with all of the tools I have tried though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have found, if the phone looses signal for a certain length of time, it of course looses its Internet connection, it will then come up with a prompt on the screen to re-connect to the Internet.&nbsp; This makes the phone useless to me, as they are wrapped
 up in the cadets bags, so the message sits there and the tracking stops.&nbsp; I have attached an image of the message for reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any hack/workaround/fix for this?&nbsp; Or will I have to buy different phones to continue with this project?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for any suggestions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martin</p>

<p>They are being used as GPS tracking for cadets walking in the hills, so yes, potentially very remote locations and areas af no signal, possibly for and hour or more.&nbsp; I see this when just walking locally though, so must only take a short period of no signal
 before this message pops up</p>

<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has come round to the time of year to use these "trackers" again.&nbsp; I have made the change suggested by hadimassa﻿.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unofrtunatly, I am having problems still.&nbsp; The popup message asking for an access point to connect to, only came up on one phone though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest, are still happily running the software, have full signal/battery, but have stopped sending updates via the data connection, I have no idea why.&nbsp; This is across all 7 phones though.&nbsp; There is a 9 hour span between the first one stopping and the
 last one stopping, all phones were next to each other on a table over night</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, back at square one, if anyone has any suggestions to find the route cause?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, I have 7 E50s for sale :-)&nbsp; This project was worth a try, but hasn't worked out in the end</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            It isn't possible for windows phone 8 to have WMP, but you can get Windows Media Player on Windows 8.1, simply click/slide from the right and search windows media player.

<p>Please, please, please Nokia.....please fix your files on your server. &nbsp;This issue has been around since early July.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All product codes that have the v.300 firmware upgrade for the E71-2 NAM model have a missing file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file missing is rm346_300.21.012_prd.c00 from your sever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NSU cannot update as it cannot find that file. It detects that a new firmware is available, but then when trying to update, it will fail trying to download it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please fix this ASAP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MY PHONE FAILS TO RECEIVE 3G AND I SUPPOSE I NEED A FIRMWARE UPGRADE.</p>
<p>SO I CAME TO FIND THIS SERVICE BUT....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS IS RATHER FRUSTRATING.</p>
<p>I HAVE THE SAME SITUATION.</p>
<p>THE SOFTWARE UPDATER PROGRAM REFUSES TO DOWNLOAD DUE TO SEVERAL REASONS LIKE, FIREWALL OR</p>
<p>SLOW CONNECTION.</p>
<p>BOTH CASES ARE NOT VALID. I DID EVEN TURN OFF FIREWALL, AND MY SPEED IS 1GB.</p>
<p>I UPDATED THE NOKIA SOFTWARE UPDATER PROGRAM AND ALSO PC SUITE AND DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOKIA SHOULD FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS AND INFORM US IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TYPE RM-357 MODEL E71-2 CODE 0569371</p>

<p>Painfully i remember why i swiched an iphone 3G...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Software struggles with nokia are incredible here you have a company that makes to my personal opinion the best hardware finishing,&nbsp; but lack the inovative and compeating software to mach the machine. Have any one thought about S60 before the purchase...
 in my case looks like a ferrari outside but with an 4 cylinder inside...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) PC Sync is terrible, takes over my machine like a gorilla at the zoo goes nutz...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Software updater... i have tried for the past 48 hours on and off to make it work i still have no progress to report. Wich brings me to say i HATE my iphone 3G " S " looks generic and simple. BUT works in ways that nokia still dreaming of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) I will miss the sexyness of the my E71. FOR SALE ON EBAY !&nbsp;</p>

<p><font>I love Nokia. I have been loyal customer for many years. All this years I was trying to ignore the above mentioned facts. No this time. After the lock of customer service from Nokia. After I paid
 almost 500 USD for the E71 it is about to say Bye, bye Nokia. <span>&nbsp;</span>All will be determent after Tuesday when I have appointment in Nokia service center in Torino, Italy. I have been tried to fix my phone already a week. I finally made contact with
 them Saturday when they told me to come on Tuesday because they not working on Monday. For Christ Sake is this Nokia thing or just the famous Italian laziness?

<p>Same deal here. Come on Nokia. A firmware update isn't that hard. If it's not ready, fine. But don't push it out to users and waste their time trying to do the upgrade if it isn't readily downloadable. I've tried two different computers, three different
 internet connections (all good) the firewall turned off altogether and a couple of the anecdotal trouble-shooting tips suggested on this and other forums. The 300 update is not downloadable. Please do sort this out. I don't mind waiting for a functional, complete
 and downloadable update, but I do mind wasting my time with an update that doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that this problem seems pretty well identified, it is also frustrating that there has been no communication from Nokia either acknowledging the problem or giving a timeframe for solving it.</p>

            I don’t know. When prompt to update the firmware from PC Nokia Suite it was showing v300… something. Anyway here is the continuation of my journey to repair my phone; I go to the Nokia service center here at Torin finally after what I have been told they
 open the phone and by the serial number they inform me that my warranty is not valid for Europe because my phone was purchased in USA. It was a little strange for me because I purchase my phone from a legal Nokia store in USA. However regardless I take it
 as a fact and understanding that maybe because is a different continent. Well than I offer to pay for the repair service. And than I was shocked from the other fact that they can’t repair my phone even if I pay on my own. My phone was thrown back on me and
 the lady at the counter simply yelled “Next”. Quietly I take the phone number of headquarters of Nokia in Finland. Same day I call and spoke with someone from customer relation department in Finland. She was nice and try to convinc

<h2>            OneNote 2010 &#47; cannot change default template</h2>
                    Running Office 2010 on a Windows 7 64-bit install. &nbsp;I recently updated a couple of my standard templates for 2012. &nbsp;However, when I go into my various sections, I cannot reset the default templates to my new 2012 template. &nbsp;It's available in the pulldown
 (as are many others), but regardless of which template I select to change to, the default stays at the current template.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This has worked fine until recently, so I'm a little baffled. &nbsp;Any ideas?</div>
