            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's get this done by following the methods below for troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Uninstall and reinstall the graphics driver. By doing this, right click the start button and choose Device Manager. Go to Display adapters and right click on Intel HD Graphics and select uninstall then restart your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to perform a two-button shutdown. To do this, press and hold the Volume-up button and the Power button on your Surface at the same time for 15 seconds and then release. Just continue holding down the buttons for 15 seconds once you see the Surface logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we suggest that you contact our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Support</a> team for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Discoloration at bottom of laptop&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asha mari hipolito  say:</h3>
<h2>            Discoloration at bottom of laptop&#63;</h2>
                    So I got my surface laptop maybe a month or so ago and I recently noticed a patch of discoloration on the metal bottom. I tried to clean it with microfiber cloth and some cleaning solution but it does not do anything. Help please?

            If it is an brownish/yellowish color that creeps around the edges, it is because they used a type of adhesive that changes color when it warms up.&nbsp; Get it replaced ASAP.

            No it's a lighter burgundy sort of thing. Kind of like if the color just lightened in one corner.

            It might be a little difficult to see because of the lighting but I was concerned because it doesn't come off while it might look like a smudge.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ea220fd-1461-47c9-b416-6e5fdc8d183b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ea220fd-1461-47c9-b416-6e5fdc8d183b" /></a>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same issue. Mine is cobalt blue colour. I only bought it about a month and I can notice the discolouration. I went into JB hifi where I bought it and they cannot help anything. I paid expensive price to get a good brand and good appearance
 of the laptop but how come the surface colour has been changed just in one month. Is that possible ?</p>

<h2>            Old or Defunct Private Networks In Win 10 Registry detected by AVG as trusted. How do I remove them without damage&#63;</h2>

<p><strong>AVG DETECTS ENTRIES IN WINDOWS OS REGISTRY AS TRUSTED WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN EXIST<br />
<br />
Here's what's happened since Upgrading from Win 10 (version 1803) to Win 10 (version 1809)
<br />
<br />
It's been 10 days and no further a word from AVG Senior Level 2</strong></p>
<p>FIRST REPORTED 12:32 PM on 1/8/2019. I was promised this would be fix but it still isn't.<br />
I was contacted by AVG remote team and my&nbsp;case is STILL under investigation by a level 2 technician and it's now&nbsp;<strong>1/20/2019<br />
</strong>The problem is that before 01/04/2019 AVG and even Windows 10 (Ver1803) did not detect that there were more than ONE Private Network and ONE Public Network (VPN). AVG claimed that 6 other Network Profiles were available networks close by (eg. neighboring
 homes with routers or Networks) BUT THIS ENTIRELY UNTRUE. I even showed AVG Technicians during a Remote Session and since then I have had no further help to resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
I know where all the entries are in the system Registry and I am advised to NOT REMOVE those entries because if I do then this will cause Windows to fail. True or False?<br />
<br />
What have I done so far to resolve this issue,;<br />
<br />
1. Continue to update AVG in Community Support<br />
<br />
2. Attempted to resolve the issue via Remote Session with a Microsoft Technician concluding that a full MS Windows 10 upgrade from ver 1803 to 1809. Now with Window 10 Upgrade completed and all updates succeeded I should not see those Old/Defunct/Obsolete Networks
 anywhere in the system BUT instead are still being detected as Private (trusted) Networks which I then have to manually change to 'Public' each time Windows restarts: This not what I had expected!<br />
<br />
There are 6 trusted networks inside my Computer and none of them are mine or my neighbor's, So, how do I resolve this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp; I have matched the Key to the Profile Name as: = Network Profile: "NAME" to make it easier to follow.&nbsp;</p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

I hope this helps...btw: I didn't show the actual Private Network Name I currently use for this machine and I am sticking my head out by just showing these entries in here.<br />

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community. This is TechTime305, and I'm here to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that AVG is detecting these files that are not supposed to exist? Try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Press the Windows key and search "Run", once you get to the Run box, type "winver" and tell me the Version and OS Build of your computer.</p>
<p>2) Run Disk Cleanup by pressing the Windows key and searching "Disk Cleanup" and remove the junk files.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity looked in my registry here.</p>
<p>All of the items titled Direct- are my cell phones, except one which says ROKU in the name, which I dont have but have seen it occasionally if I leave a wifi scanner running for a while.&nbsp; So it belongs to one of my neighbors - maybe I tried to connect to
 it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the others contain my Computer name within the names &amp; hotspots I've created on my laptop &amp; windows store app names I've installed in the past for VPN's &amp; saved sms phone numbers I've maybe used Skype with or one of the microsoft store apps that
 connect to android with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I can justify all of them in my mind on my laptop and there are 21 total. &nbsp; I have 1 network with 2 wifi network connections in my home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So best guess is you have connected to each and everyone of them at sometime in the past, even if it was a failed connection.</p>
<p>If I wanted to rid those I'd probably right click and save as&nbsp; filename.reg for each one to a folder before deleting it.&nbsp; Or export the whole 'profiles' key before picking the ones I wanted to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or just leave them to stay forever - you have connected to them sometime in the past so you must have deemed them to be safe. &nbsp; Actually windows will clean up the registry from time to time so if those age out, maybe they'll disappear in time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I will try this.<br />
<br />
Just so a member of MS Team knows (you)....I am the person who posted this but for some reason I am not able to login to participate, all my attempts have failed even though I have a saved file offline with my MS password and login credentials. I even tried
 to rest but I did not get the code in an email as promised. And, AVG has not come back to me about this.&nbsp; This all started when AVG updated updated around Jan 4-8 ...before then those old network profile were not found by AVG.&nbsp;<br />

MY Answer:<br />
<br />
NO CHANGE, ALL ARE STILL THERE!! and AVG still persist in detecting them as Network Profiles<br />
<br />
As you can see below (screenshot)...FYI: I have redacted to NOT show my PC's actual Network name (black) and MAC, the Local Area Connection is fine as well Network and of course VPN, BUT the others just keep showing up and at random intervals I have seen change
 from 'Public' to 'Private' and this means I have to manually change back to 'Public'.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think of this. AVG are ignoring my requests atm and I will chat with them again shortly.<br />
<br />
I have also UPGRADED WINDOWS OS as you can see by my answer to Question 1.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            Thanks Mike,<br />
<br />
Yes to your statement "<span>So best guess is you have connected to each and everyone of them at sometime in the past, even if it was a failed connection."<br />
<br />
This is most likely the case, I do have the Roku but it is inside my Network so it will not show up in my Firewall as a Network Profile, in fact, all profiles, PC's and other devices connected to my Private Network are protected 'Private' inside my Private
 Network, so none of those are an issue.<br />
<br />
I do not recognize the ones which start with 'Direct' ...I would know ....I keep a txt file as a record of everything I myself or anyone attempts or succeeds a Network connection.<br />
<br />
When AVG Firewall alerts me to a Network Profile change form Public to Private and it's one of those I don't recognize eg. 'Direct-' for example,&nbsp; then I have good reason for concern.<br />
<br />
The question is, if backup the registry and then I delete those registry entries, will that likely impact adversely Windows functionality?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

Thanks...but according to Microsoft Support when I spoke to them yesterday, they told me that, "it is illegal for me to delete them and that they (MS) are not permitted to delete registry entries" ...I continued to draw their attention to my issue citing also
 that they have an obligation to service my request for assistance for a remote service to fix the issue, then the phone went dead, THEY HUNG UP ON ME!!<br />
<br />
I pay MS to secure my system and I have a paid up account to use all MS products and since I am a paying customer I expect to get what I pay for each month.<br />
<br />
I am also informed (legally and independent of MS) that under the new Assistance and Access Bill passed by the Australian government that it is unlawful for me to edit any software (even if I own it) to hide or attempt to hide any network connection, profile
 or application which connects any network with the internet or not.<br />
<br />
So what now?<br />
<br />
Do I just delete and hope I don't get caught or leave them there so it can be easier for a hacker or even the government's defunct&nbsp; Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), police (dirty cops are out there) or any "authorized agency" under the new law to infiltrate
 my network?<br />
<br />
Very angry that Microsoft Technician can hang up on a customer ....it's like saying "fees changed for NO SERVICE" !!<br />
<br />
But I do appreciate your support Mike ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Animated cursor no longer works.</h2>
                    So i am currently using windows 10 and i used the same trick for windows 7 to use animated cursors (custom cursors) and I've been using them for a couple of months now but for some reason recently they just don't work correctly anymore they work but they
 play the animation for 1-3 seconds and then stop for awhile and they go back to playing the animation for a few more seconds and it just keeps repeating this process. I want them to work again, the only thing i can think of that made this happen is that i
 used a program called bionix wallpaper editor, it lets you use .gif pictures as backgrounds but the program only downloaded as a .exe program so nothing was installed but it altered my background with .gif files i choose but after i added a gif background
 and choose an animated cursor it seemed to mess with them and now they're all broken/wonky. I've looked everywhere and i all get is "oh my busy cursor stopped working" which doesn't really have much to do with animated cursors and mos

<strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Type “<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>” without the quotes and hit
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>After the scan, restart the computer and check for the issue.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong><span>I recommend&nbsp;you to install all the pending updates on your device and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Steps:</span></strong></p>

            I did all this and it did not work so I rolled back the driver .. right now the animated cursor is working but I lost the scroll function... maybe a setting in the old driver setting will check but that is what I had to do.

            This is one of the known issues I am seeing with the update as Recovery partition should be hidden and is accidentally assigned a drive letter.<br />Right-click Start&gt;Command Prompt(admin) <br />Type in the following: <br />diskpart <br />list volume <br />select volume 3 <br />Replace 3 with the number of the volume which is assigned a drive letter. (In hundreds of MBs) <br />remove letter="G" <br /><br /><br />Don't worry, removing a drive letter would not cause any harm to your device.

<p>This absolutely is a bug!! And it's been there for a long time. Not sure if MS wants to fix it. Instead of entering a "*", I normally do a broader search (say, for all my photos) then refine by clicking the dropdown arrow. But unfortunately it's not working.
 Very disappointing!!!</p>

<h3> mel3m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 administrator email address had typo so need to delete it and use an existing MS ID email</h2>
                    <p>Just setting up a new device and was trying to set up the administrator email and password with current email MS ID related email but the email address entered had a typo and for some reason it now wont allow me to correct this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps asking me to verify the incorrect email, which I can never do as the email address it keeps trying to send the code to does not exist as its a typo of the correct email. When I try to correct it with the the typo correction option, it tells me that
 the email address I have corrected it to is not available...because it already exists as an MS ID...which of course it does, its mine and thats the one I want to change it to!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read the threads of others about creating a local ID then changing it from there but I have tried this and it wont allow me to set up a local ID as it keeps me asking to verify the current incorrect email address which as I have said I cant never
 do blah blah see all above!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Just need this thing to forget the non-existent email which is current thinks is the administrator sign in and use my existing MS ID, which works fine and logged into here with etc. I repeat please dont anyone suggest oh just verify that incorrect
 as that email is non-existent and never can or will exist do that can not be part of any solution...anything else and am all ears people!</p>

            I already have a Microsoft Account. I also have an initial attempt that has a TYPO. I am being asked to fix it, but there is no way to delete it. All the page does is ask for my Pass Word. Since the e mail address is incorrect there is no pass word. I
 would just like to delete it. Why is that so damn difficult? I don't want a new device. I am ready to go back to Windows 8.&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 loses microphone boost option after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>So I upgraded yesterday. Everything seems to be working just fine except the microphone. I no longer have any microphone boost option, and it makes using Cortana and Skype quite annoying. The option is missing for both the internal microphone array and any
 headset microphone I plug in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked out Device Manager and found that both the speakers and microphone array are the only components with "Device not migrated" events in their log. Not sure if this is related at all but it's the only abnormality I've seen so far.</p>

            <p>Hi all,&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is actually by design and intended, the reason is as follows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We added a new audio and mic driver for Windows 10 that is optimized for Cortana scenarios.&nbsp; Surface Pro 3 has dual mics and we took advantage of both mics with a mic array.&nbsp; Essentially the device decides the best way to listen to you based on&nbsp;your proximity
 to the device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The mic volume is now set to +20db.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it is an array we can't have two different microsphone gains,&nbsp; they have to be the same.
</p>

<h3> nadineespinosa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Windows 10 version 1803 update</h2>
                    <p>Since the automatic installation of Windows 10 version 1803 update, I've encountered the following problems:</p>
<p>1. Low Disk Space - You are running out of disk space on Local Disk (D:).</p>
<p>2. The pick your seat diagram on www.Fandango.com will not display using any of the following browsers: Microsoft Edge&nbsp;42.17134.1.0; Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.48.17134.0; and Google Chrome 66.0.3359.181.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the update installed 5/9/2018, I never had a D drive. The constant "low disk space" message is annoying.&nbsp; The version 1803 update created a 450 MB partition that never previously existed, and then filled it with 388 MB of Other of which there are
 no folders, 13.8 MB system files, and 32.0 KB documents of which there are no folders. The update's created partition left only 47.1 MB free on local disk D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whereas there is 857 GB free on drive C, so there is plenty of storage space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a Dell XPS 15 9560 with an Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80 GHz quad core processor, 32.0 GB RAM, and 1TB solid state drive operating on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When will Microsoft be providing users a fix for the problems reported above? I've read other Community postings on the Microsoft website, and many are reporting the low disk space issue.</p>

            Hey Nadine,
<br />
<br />I'll yield the second question for other people to answer, but I can help you with the low disk space notifications. Microsoft has acknowledged this issue and provided a workaround:
<br />
<br />This is a recovery partition brought into view in 1803. You cannot remove, but only you must remove its mapping of its respective drive letter, which is D. Once you do this, it brings it back to its intended visibility, being hidden and out of sight. Once you do this, you won't be pestered with low disk space notifications anymore. You will need to remove the drive letter and mount point in DiskPart in order to do this.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together to go into Run. Type in the following: diskpart
<br />
<br />Enter the following in the new DiskPart window:
<br />
<br />select volume D
<br />remove letter=D
<br />
<br />Does not work after a reboot? Try entering this instead in an administrator session of Command Prompt: mountvol D: /D
<br />

            It looks to me that Fandango is a game that you play.&nbsp; Just don't use those browsers when you want to go there.&nbsp; Try Avant Browser and check the different renderings to see one that will work.

            Hi Nadine.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For ten days you can roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />There is an issue where Version 1803 adds a drive letter to the Recovery partition that should be hidden because it's only used for bootable repair tools that in previous edition of Windows were on C drive.   Then it reports that it is full.  
<br />
<br />Since the partition is to meant to be hidden it can't have drive letter removed in Disk Mgmt like other partitions.  You can wait for a solution to be pushed through Windows Update or follow these steps:  
<br />
<br /> 1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove. For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “D”, note the volume number for Drive D.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter.
<br />
<br />select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4. In the example above, if the volume number for drive G is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />remove letter=&lt;drive letter&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;drive letter&gt;, substitute the drive letter you want to remove. In this example, you would type: remove letter=G
<br />
<br />7. Close the Command Prompt window.
<br />
<br />Update the Flash player for all browsers:  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Nadine, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume D
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=D
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC

            Hi Greg - Updating or enabling the Adobe Flash Player under each browser has not resolved the issue with the Fandango website. I have now even installed Mozilla Firefox 60.0.1, and still no luck. May try my other desktop PC since it's several years older.

<p>Per suggestion, I did contact Fandango Help live chat. Regrettably, other than the comment that Google Chrome is the preferred browser for their website the technical advice was not of any assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I was able to get a great suggestion from my employer's Information Technology support desk. The suggestion that worked was to ensure the Java Plug-In add-ins from Oracle were enabled in the browsers, plus download the most recent version of Java.
 Success! The pick you seat diagram on the Fandango website now appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, the Windows 10 version 1803 update had disabled the Java add-ins in the browsers. Now, at least, I know to check for that in the future if encountering similar difficulties following a Windows update.</p>

            <p>Have you already tried a Hard reboot, removing any battery if it's a laptop, or simply unplugging the power?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Durring the startup can you press F11 or F8 to get to the advance boot options, after that you can select repair your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this menu you should be given a few options.</p>

</p><p>I would suggest doing a system restore and restore to an earlier configuration before the updates.</p>

It says I'm banned from using the communications portion of Xbox live but it doesn't say for how long. First ever violation in 10 plus years of having the same account. So how do I find out how long the ban is. The enforcement page also doesn't give any info on how long the ban lasts. GT g3n shadow&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft:</p><p>My AUTISTIC son has been banned for a second time on your live platform. He was playing politely with a "friend" when some bullies came in and ruined their fun and he had a meltdown. It's been a week as this is his second offense. First, when is it being turned back on? Secondly, am I paying for this service when it's not in use? And lastly, what do you plan on&nbsp;doing to support those in your community that live with disabilities?

<h2>            Windows Update fails, Error code 641</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows Update for Windows Vista Business no longer works, Error code'WindowsUpdate_00000641'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I attempted to use Windows Update on my Windows Vista Business SP 2, 32-bit Version, and got a 'WindowsUpdate_00000641' error code, with NONE of the updates being applied...&nbsp; Also that very same day, when I tried to update some of my Apple programs,
 these updates also failed to install...&nbsp; When I followed the Apple update instructions to manually install the updates, I got the following error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Windows Installer Service could not be accessed.&nbsp; This can occur if the Windows Installer is not correctly installed.&nbsp; Contact your support personnel for assistance"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I checked the Microsoft Knowledge Base, I first attempted to boot my laptop to a Clean Boot state, and noticed that when I tried to launch the Update program, it both oppened and closed instantly, without performing&nbsp;any update at all...&nbsp; Next, I tried
 using your 'Fix It' program TWICE...&nbsp; TWICE it said the update program components needed to be fixed, and after prforming the same actions TWICE, Window Update STILL does not work...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any information and/or suggestions would be VERY appreciated...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time...</p>

            <div>I have the same problems since the updater is trying to install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 for Windows 7 x64-based System (KB2858725). I also tried to install it directly from the downloaded file, but it shows the same problem and error code: Error
 Code 641 (unknown error).</div>
<div>That's why I think it's not a problem connected with the updating system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here you have my answers:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</div>
<div>It's an Acer Aspire 5755G, bought 18 months ago, approximately;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. What is the&nbsp;<em>full name</em>&nbsp;of your installed anti-virus application or security suite&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party
 firewall (if any)?</div>
<div>I use only ESET Smart Security 7.0.302.28 (it's antivirus and firewall) and it will expire on next January, the 14th.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Has a(nother) Norton application&nbsp;<em>or a McAfee application</em>&nbsp;EVER been installed on the computer?</div>
<div>No, never.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Did a Norton free-trial&nbsp;<em>or a McAfee free-trial</em>&nbsp;[pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</div>
<div>I can't say not, but recently I have installed an SSD and installed again the O.S. from zero, so I can answer negatively to your 4th question.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>5. Are ALL of the following updates listed in&nbsp;<strong>View installed updates</strong>&nbsp;(<em>not</em>&nbsp;Update History)? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) KB2658846, KB2659262, KB2660649, KB2676562, KB2688338 &amp; KB2690533</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) KB2544521&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;<strong>Windows Internet Explorer 9</strong></em>&nbsp;[&lt;=TELL ME WHICH ONE]</p>
<p>Among them I have only:</p>
<p>A) KB2676562 and KB2690533;</p>
<p>B) KB2653956 and KB2621440;</p>
<p>C)&nbsp;KB2654428 only;</p>
<p>D)&nbsp;None of the above: I have Internet Explorer 11 only.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6. If&nbsp;<strong>Windows Vista Service Pack 2&nbsp;(KB948465)</strong>&nbsp;is listed in&nbsp;<strong>View installed updates</strong>, when (exact&nbsp;date) was it<strong>&nbsp;</strong>installed according to&nbsp;<strong>Update History</strong>&nbsp;(this time)? [2]</p>
<p>I have installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit: the service pack code is KB976932, installed on 2013/09/18.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>7. What Java version is currently installed?</p>
<p>Version 7 Update 45.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>8. Is Firefox or any other alternate browser installed besides Chrome?</p>
<p>Yes, I have IE 11.0.2, FireFox 25.0.1 (just updated to 26 while checking the version) and other portable application onto my USB key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>9. Have you ever had occasion to do a Repair Install or&nbsp;a clean install of Windows?</p>
<p>As already said at the previous point #4, yes I did a clean install of Windows 2 months ago.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>10. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic;&nbsp;<strong><em>System Mechanic</em></strong>; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC;
 Advanced System Optimizer; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; CCleaner)?</p>
<p>No, I am not in this habit. I did it in past, using WINASO.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Kindly advice what will be next step.</p>

<h2>            task manager doesnt detect network utilization</h2>
                    although the internet runs on my pc the network utilization bar doesnt show any value to the application/service using it. i have Networx application installed to monitor my internet traffic. i thought maybe it was interfering with the task manager. uninstalled
 it and checked again but no change. my windows edition is a lenovo OEM based windows 8.1. i detected a lot of settings to be switched off during the installation to make virtual router work. also is there any way to completely remove the OEM edition including
 the partitions and install a clean OS. i already have a full licensed version of windows 8.1. this lenovo edition is getting onto my nerves. thanks

</p><p>You will just boot from your DVD, or USB, and use the Setup to create or delete partitions prior to installing Windows.&nbsp; You probably will need to visit Lenovo for drivers after installation.</p>

            <p>thank you for your reply. but i it is working alright in the performance toolbar and it is a wireless connection. i still cant troubleshoot the problem. i've inset pics for your understanding.</p>
<p>also i've tried resetting my pc from the pc setting since i have the boot cd with me. so i presume there is no need to create a seperate image for the installation. i have tried resetting everything. like all wipe out.
 but there is a OEM partition which i think is saving the lenovo bloatware for re-installation after system reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: my internet speed is 0.5 Mbps and my PC model is lenovo Z50-70. thank you</p>

            yeah tried everything the graph registers reading but the network column shows nothing....i think there is something not activated in the task manager file setting or something is interfering....so i am trying to you know completely reset my system....i
 tried resetting the system through PC settings...where it asks me to insert installation media for the missing boot files. i have a windows 8.1 pro boot CD. i inserted it and reset my PC by selecting the option of wiping everything. the PC spent a night refreshing
 everything. and in the morning i found the PC to be in the state like how it was at the time of purchase i.e all the lenovo bloatware is back. i checked in the disk partitions and found a dedicated OEM partition which i think is the reason the computer is
 restoring everything back. i tried running the setup on the CD directly. after entering the key the next step shows me that 'your already have windows 8.1' but 'you can add features'. no options like keep personal files or keep nothin

            <p>Are you asking how to do a clean install of Windows 8.1, or how to do a repair install of Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure a repair install is even possible if your Setup CD doesn't give you any option to "upgrade" (which would be the repair option).&nbsp; As in a case of upgrading Windows 8.1 to Windows 8.1 (that is typed correctly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Getting back to Task Manager.&nbsp; Can you replace the file Taskmgr.exe found in C:\Windows\System32 with an identical version of it from another Windows 8.1 machine (copy and paste from a friend)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you right-click on Taskmgr.exe and select the "Run As Administrator" option does it work correctly?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>

            I can see processes using network in task manager, but is there any way to see data consumption (not speed but volume) by each processes/ apps during a time period (hours, days, months, etc.), by Windows 8.1 Pro itself or by an app?

    <title>Winsows XP SP3 is stuck in login loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Winsows XP SP3 is stuck in login loop</h2>
                    I was cleaning out some old and unwanted software from my computer and now when I boot the system it comes up to the welcome screen with either administrator or administrator and user logins. &nbsp;I have attempted selecting each one of these but it immediately
 logs back out to the welcome screen. &nbsp;I have attempted booting the computer in safe mode, safe mode with command prompt, and all the other options provided on that page only to end up in the same place. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have now removed the HDD from the computer and connected it as a slave on an older tower so I can see the content of the HDD. &nbsp;When I view the D:\windows\system32 folder searching for the userinit file it seems like its there but upon further investigation
 it appears the files I am seeing are actually from the master not the slave (affected HDD). &nbsp;The files from the D: and D:\windows folders appears to be correct as to what should be on there but once I go into the system32 folder it appears to be the master
 HDD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running Windows XP SP3 and DO NOT have the CDs or recovery material (this computer was purchased used and previous owner had misplaced these).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any information or guidance on how I can fix this so I can reinstall the affected HDD back into it's usual tower and be able to run it again? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to arrange a Windows XP disc and then perform a Check Disk to make sure the computer hard drive isn't having any errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Attach the hard drive to your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Boot from the <strong>Windows XP</strong> disc . (Not : Check the computer manual to change the boot order and set CD/DVD as the first boot device)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. When the <strong>Welcome to Setup screen</strong> starts, press <strong>R</strong> to get into
<strong>Recovery Console.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. You may be prompted to enter the <strong>Administrator password</strong> if it is set. If not, press enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. In the <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type <strong>Chkdsk /r /f</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To exit from recovery mode, type <strong>exit</strong> and hit enter to restart the computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Check Disk will run when the computer restarts. If there are any error detected, then get into recovery mode and run the Check Disk command once again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the computer restarts, check if you are able to login to Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any concerns.</p>

    <title>X360 Should Have Different MAC Addresses for Wifi and Ethernet. Only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the bagelgoat  say:</h3>
<h2>            X360 Should Have Different MAC Addresses for Wifi and Ethernet. Only One Shows Up under Advanced Settings. Where is the other&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Please help. I am adding the X360 MAC address to my router list of approved devices, and only one MAC address shows up, and doesn't even list which it is. When you have two ways of connecting (WiFi and LAN) it reequires two different MAC addys. And even
 when I disconnect the ethernet cable and go wireless the same address shows up. So, how do we find out which is which and where is the other MAC located?! Help!</p>

<p>Hello Parag, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, the error message <strong>Your Internet security settings prevented one or more files from being opened
</strong>arises because the file type that you are trying to launch might be unsafe and there's a possibility that error message connected to your Internet Explorer. We suggest resetting your Internet Explorer security zone settings back to default. To do so,
 we recommend checking the article about <strong>The</strong> <strong>error message when you try to open certain files: "Your Internet security settings prevented one or more files from being opened"
</strong>on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2588679/error-message-when-you-try-to-open-certain-files-in-windows-7-your-int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. The article is about Windows 7, we replicate the issue
 using Windows 8.1 and it has the same steps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done with the workaround from the article, let us know the result.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. The other possible reason causing the error message <strong>
These files can't be opened. Your Internet security settings prevented one or more files from being opened
</strong>is when you set you <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> into high security. We'd like to know, have you tried setting your Internet Explorer into the
<strong>medium</strong>?</p>

<p>Hi Ernie San,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes i have tried to change the settings from high to medium and then click <strong>
ok</strong>. But after that when i again open <strong>Internet Explorer&nbsp;</strong>it shows same as before. Have you seen screenshots which i have sent?&nbsp;</p>
<p>All settings i changed settings of <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> and then i again open it, it shows same as before.</p>
<p>It mean no changes occur in <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>

<p>Your immediate response is highly appreciated. Now, it's shows that there's an error
<span><strong>Resetting user customizations</strong> failed. The error shows that there's a corrupted system file on your browser. The best way to resolve it is by resetting the&nbsp; your Internet Explorer from the
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>. To do so, check the steps below: </span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>CMD</strong> and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li><span>Enter in either command line </span><span><strong>control.exe </strong>
or </span><span><strong>inetcpl.cpl,,6.</strong></span></li><li><span>Reboot your device, to apply the changes.</span></li></ol>

<p>The other troubleshooting steps that we can try is by modifying the <strong>Security Settings</strong> of your Internet Explorer. To do so, here's the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong>.</li><li>Type <span><strong>inetcpl.cpl </strong>and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li>In the <strong>Internet Properties</strong> window, click <strong>Security &gt; Internet &gt; Customer level.</strong></li><li>In the Security Settings window, scroll down to <strong>Downloads &gt; File download</strong>. Click to select
<strong>Enable</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down the list further to <strong>Miscellaneous &gt; Launching applications and unsafe files</strong>. Click to select
<strong>Prompt (recommended)</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK </strong>and then restart your computer to apply the changes.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi A. SOPRANO,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your time posting in Microsoft Private Support and we apologize for the delayed response. It seems like you are getting Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC19.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure that the username/password is correct, make sure there are no spelling mistakes. If the password has been changed recently you have to update Windows Live Mail to use the new password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to ask you to provide the following so I would be able to isolate your issue:</p>
<p>•Are the pop server settings correct?<br />
•Is SSL required?<br />
•Is the required port being blocked by Windows Firewall, or a 3 party firewall?<br />
•Is the port reserved by your ISP for their own mail service?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take your time to try the suggestion and let me know the results at your earliest convenience. If anything is unclear or if there is anything I can do for you, please feel free to let me know.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />
</p>
