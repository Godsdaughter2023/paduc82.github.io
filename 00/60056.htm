    <title>My computer can not identify xfinity wifi hopspot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My computer can not identify xfinity wifi hopspot</h2>
                    So i'm away from home and i've been using Xfinity's hotspot plan to get my internet for my laptop. All of a sudden one morning it says that the network can not be identified. So I thought maybe if you renew my ip it would solve it. That did not work. I
 panicked a little and started looking up tons of videos on Youtube on my phone on how to fix this problem. I found many unidentified network videos but none of them were for hopspots like Xfinity's so they did not work for me. I searched the web and found
 one or two people with the same problem as me but they were not solved. So i'm trying like they did to see if someone will help me figure this problem out. Keep in mind I've tried just about all the normal fixes like the cmd ones and uninstalling my adapter
 to let it install again. Please anything would help and thank you for &nbsp;taking the time to read this.

            <p>Thank you for noticing this.</p>
<ol>
<li>First I open the command prompt as an administrator.</li><li>I type in "ipconfig /release"</li><li>Then the disconnected stuff pops up.</li><li>I then follow that up with "ipconfig /renew" to get the new ip for my computer since so many people using the Xfinity hotspot are using the same ip address.</li><li>After that more information comes up in the cmd but nothing that looks useful.</li><li>I then restart the computer to see if that will work, but it does not for me at least.</li><li>I then go back to step 1 and type in "netsh winsock reset catalog".</li><li>It then says Successfully reset the Winsock Catalog and to restart for it to complete the reset.</li><li>After that before I restart I put in the second part."netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log" It says done a couple of times and to restart to complete it. I also do this for the ipv6.</li><li>"netsh int ipv5 reset reset.log"</li><li>I then finally restart the computer again and then nothing changes with the Xfinity network.</li><li>It still says unident
 work when this network in unidentified trust me. Thanks again for reading this.</li></ol>

            <p>Have you attempted updating your wireless drivers?</p>
<p>If so, I also advise:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Does the network connection appear on other devices running the same operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Is the network connection secured and if so what type of encryption are you using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Have you attempted using Windows 7's built in troubleshooting feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recommend you contact Comcast (the parent company of Xfinity) to see if this problem is related to the network itself and not your machine.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure because the only other computer here at the moment &nbsp;is a windows 8 but it does show up on that computer as well(but can not connect either).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xfinity hotspots are not secured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 7 troubleshooter used to work around 2 years ago but now it does absolutely nothing now. I have tried just to be sure and it did not do anything. I even tested this by disabling my adapter and troubleshooting but it just said it could not identify
 the problem. It used to tell me that the adapter was not enabled but it does not work anymore. Maybe that problem ties in with the network not being identified?</p>

<p>I do an echo sound test and everything works.&nbsp; My microphone shows that it is working when I go into settings and check it.&nbsp; The other person has had their internet and ipad checked and found no problem.&nbsp; I skyped someone else to see if it was my end and

            Hi paulaharris73 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Paula
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Could be an unknown corruption in your Skype installation.
<br />
<br />Try uninstall then reinstall Skype to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.

            Thanks Andre.&nbsp; I uninstalled it and installed it again, not with your link but from the internet for windows 10.&nbsp; The problem continues.&nbsp; Should I uninstall it and install it again from your link?

            Please do reinstall from the link I included with my reply.
<br />
<br />Also...
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturer's website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Recording tab
<br />Right-click your Microphone
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />

<h2>            How do I get rid of compressed zipped folders&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I try to make a new folder it tells me to make a compressed zipped folder and I do not know how to stop that. It started doing this a few days ago and I did not install anything. I would like to go back to making the default new folders instead
 of the compressed zipped folders.

<p><span><span>Disable debugger and that should fix the problem (or find the problem it's finding and repair it - but I'd just disable it).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine
 Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps from a different computer).<br />
<br />
</span></span></span>If that doesn't work, boot into Safe mode with networking (repeatedly clicking the F8 key during bootup until the menu appears).</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>&nbsp;and run Autoruns and click on the Everything Tab and check all the entries for any relating to debugging.&nbsp; If you find one, uncheck the box to stop it from running at startup and click OK.&nbsp; Reboot.&nbsp;
 The problem should go away.</p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp; If the problem goes away then
 it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If
 the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not,&nbsp; post back and we'll try some other options.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>xbox live only for yanks&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crimson chinian  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox live only for yanks&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Why is it every year at e3 big announcments are made, most of which apply to all but then there are always 2-3 that only apply in the states? Now i dont have a problem with our fellow gamers in america and im fully aware microsoft is an american company
 but i believe that we all pay an equal amount for xbox live so services should be made equal, it just seems that xbox try so hard to please there american audience that usualy every other country is left with the crumbs from the table</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I happen to know on other platforms that they do so equally among each country they strive to work as best they can for the consumers in that country but once again we get shafted? How is this might you ask? Well in the past 2 years the only real new thing
 we have had is sky player and im sorry to say but it is the biggest waste of time possible, With very few channels to watch an outrageous pricing plan and only really useful if a) you are into sports and willing to fork out 30 quid a month for it or b) have
 alot of friends who can afford this sum so you can use its functions with friends? So pointless i can go downstairs and use my sky hd box get better quality get all the channels and never have that annoyng message appear saying that this program does not brodcast
 on sky player and its happening alot more than not,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now over the pond they have hulu? and netflix? and now xbox tv? What do we get? youtube..... WOW my phone can play youtube and so can my pc why would i need it on my xbox at all? even if they sorted the problems out with bbc and gave us bbc iplayed id be
 happy but as usual all xbox see over here is big dollar signs and us all penned up with the word mug across our forehead, So why dont we get bbc iplayer you may wonder? WELL reffer to my previous sentence about dollar signs. Bbc is a FREE services to all people
 staying in BRITIAN yet microsoft want to make it gold only, so technically you would be paying for it wich wouldnt sweeten the deal of buying an xbox as there are 2 other formats wich give people just that a free bbc i player plus its on the pc for free...
 So i am left with the conclusion that we are just cash cows to fuel the costs of the states getting everything first and foremost and us being given sub par updates wich do nothing to make my xbox expirence truly better, Even a few new channels on sky player
 would be good but nothing has surfaced and no word of anything since its release, there hasnt even really been an update for it. NOT EVEN KINECT COMPATIBILITY YET THEY HAVE IT FOR NEARLY EVERYTHING ELSE......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is this are we not good enough loyal xbox consumers? Or are we as i said just a cash cow to be milked to fuel others xbox expirence</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well thats my rant let me hear youre views on it...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peace&nbsp;</p>

<p>I agree with you, there needs to be more done to bring the different regions to the same level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is of course that license something in America and it'll cover the whole region but you can't get one license for the region of Europe, you have to get it for each country and that seems to be too much effort.</p>

 also the BBC are trying to find a model where you pay for the iPlayer as well.</p>

<p>Your entire <span>rant</span> post is based on some rather faulty reasoning.[quote user="Crimson Chinian"]So pointless i can go downstairs and use my sky hd box get better quality get all the channels and never have that
 annoyng message appear saying that this program does not brodcast on sky player and its happening alot more than not,[/quote]That's something you need to take up with Sky. Microsoft provide the box, Sky provide the service.</p>
<p>[quote]Now over the pond they have hulu?[/quote]American company, not owned by MS. Not MS's problem, take it up with Hulu.[quote]and netflix?[/quote]Same. [quote]and now xbox tv?[/quote]Actually, we don't know that is not coming to our shores. It was announced
 for multiple territories, but it was not announced what those territories were. let's wait and see.</p>
<p>[quote]What do we get? youtube..... WOW my phone can play youtube and so can my pc why would i need it on my xbox at all?[/quote]Okay, fine. But when you say this...[quote] even if they sorted the problems out with bbc and gave us bbc iplayed id be happy[/quote]Why
 do you need it on your xbox when your PC can play it? There is a huge gap in your logic. Why do you not care about youtube because your PC can play it, when you are unhappy you cannot watch BBC, even though your PC can play it? Your applying dual standards.</p>
<p>[quote]so technically you would be paying for it wich wouldnt sweeten the deal of buying an xbox as there are 2 other formats wich give people just that a free bbc i player plus its on the pc for free.[/quote]Well, that's just not true. You pay for Xbox
 Live already, so getting something additional for the same cost means you are getting it for free. I'd agree it's an incentive for silvers to go gold.</p>
<p>[quote]So i am left with the conclusion that we are just cash cows to fuel the costs of the states getting everything first and foremost and us being given sub par updates wich do nothing to make my xbox expirence truly better,[/quote]The logic you've applied
 to reach that conclusion is flawed, but you are still entitled to hold to that conclusion if you want.</p>
<p>[quote]Even a few new channels on sky player would be good but nothing has surfaced and no word of anything since its release, there hasnt even really been an update for it. NOT EVEN KINECT COMPATIBILITY YET THEY HAVE IT FOR NEARLY EVERYTHING ELSE......[/quote]
 Talk to Sky, it's their application. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[quote]Well thats my rant let me hear youre views on it... [/quote]My view is that your reasons for the rant are questionable, but if you feel that strongly about it, you are always free to go to silver.</p>

<p>O.k with the slim 320gb hdd&nbsp; coming out. how would you transfer from the slim 250gb to the 320gb. the reason i'm asking this because if they release the 320gb by it self I may pick it up because with all the dlc with fallout and with skyrim coming out I'm
 going to need a bigger hd but if I can't transfer from slim hd to slim hd the they will be no point on getting it.

<p><em>I have not seen anything official regarding a slim to slim transfer cable but MS must be developing one, it would not make any sense for them not to.<br />
<br />
But in the meantime you could just move your saves and profile over to the new HDD using a flash drive.<br />
Then re download DLC using your download history. Its not the best solution in the world but until MS release the new transfer cable (again presuming they are making one) its the only option right now.</em></p>

            <p>I got the update from Microsoft Update in May.&nbsp; It said that HP said that I needed it because I did not have a driver for my monitor.&nbsp; I had the original disk copy on the computer but never could get it to install.&nbsp; The new one is the same as the original.&nbsp;
 Niether one will install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The install wizard says "There was a problem installing this hardware....&nbsp; An error occurred during the installation of the device.&nbsp; The driver installation file for this device is missing a necessary entry.&nbsp; This may be because in INF was written for Windows
 95 or later...."</p>
<p>I looked at the HP link you gave me.&nbsp; But didn't find anything relating to this error message.</p>

            <p>No, back in 2006 I just didn't have the time.&nbsp; Then it was stored and seldom used.</p>
<p>In May when I decided to use it again, it looked up the HP site.&nbsp; It said that they had turned it all over to Windows update.&nbsp; That fit with my getting the update from windows update.&nbsp; I didn't question it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The monitor works;&nbsp;there's some flashing when it changes from one screen to another but not real objectionable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main objection is that&nbsp; when I try to play some games on it I get error messages like:&nbsp; "No HAL" or "no hardware accelleration".&nbsp; I believe those are related to there other problem the computer has -- an outdated driver for the mother board.&nbsp; I tried
 to find it on the internet but ran into a company that really was trying to sell me software to update my drivers and a monthly fee and required internet software and so on and so forth.&nbsp; I believe I've gotten rid of all their stuff.&nbsp; Just haven't gotten the
 courage to try again.&nbsp; I thought maybe the monitor would be simplier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the monitor is for XP. And earlier versions of windows.&nbsp; That's why I was confused about the "XP and later" statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No I have not found any more recent drivers for the f2105.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I;m going to work on the driver for the mother board this evening.</p>

            <p>I followed the link and got entwined in printer drivers and went round and round on HP for two hours.&nbsp; I finally go to an articles on updating drivers and softwar witn windows update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP specifes that windows update be used for all except Non-HP printers - go to the manufacturer.&nbsp; HP printers - go to HP.&nbsp; Updates to HP softeware.&nbsp; And, BIOS updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't believe that HP can help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point I don't even think that I need a driver.&nbsp; I think I have a resource conflict.</p>

Hi Norman</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Query - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the original HP driver failed to install years ago, how is system restore going to help installing the driver Windows Update is now offering which is also failing to install?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Thanks for updating the thread. BTW I lost faith in Norton's years ago but then again&nbsp;no anti virus software keeps you safe 100%.

            <p>I fixed the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, the reg delete command was successful but the netcfg command was not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out everyone should probably look in the in <strong>RegEdit</strong> <strong>
UI </strong>itself, and be sure that key is gone - even tho the first command <strong>
reg delete</strong>&nbsp; worked successfully in my case, the key was still present.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After I deleted the key within <strong>RegEdit UI</strong>, I ran the <strong>
netcfg -v -u dni_dne</strong> command it worked.&nbsp; and then my wireless was recognized.&nbsp; just like that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you don't know -</p>
<p>Right click on Start Menu, select Command Window - admin</p>
<p>Type regedit and UI will come up.</p>
<p>Go to HKEY-CLASSES-ROOT and down to CLSID, then again down to key.</p>
<p>Right click and press delete.</p>
<p>
Good luck!</p>

<h2>            WindowsUpdate_trace_log&#34; failed to start with the following error&#58; 0xC0000035</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting this error when I have 2 displays connect with HDMI cables when I try to start up my machine. I have to keep reconfiing the monitors in order for this error log to go away. What is the issue with HDMI monitors being connected to my main monitor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have 3 monitors and my main monitor never gives this error until I connect the other two. I can get it to run smoothly for several weeks until an update occurs and then the unhappy blue page face saying it cannot load. I have to unplug my monitors then
 start all over again getting them to be happy with one another</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to stop this? I need at least 3 monitors to work from</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong><em>WindowsUpdate_trace_log" failed to start with the following error: 0xC0000035</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't imagine what the additional monitors would have to do with this (apart from extra complexity to cause extra logging, etc.)&nbsp; The two seem completely independent to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let's first look at the symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS&gt;net helpmsg (0x35)</p>
<p>The network path was not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what is that file anyway?&nbsp; It makes me think that you have some kind of permanent tracing enabled for WindowsUpdate.&nbsp;&nbsp; WindowsUpdate does log by default but I dont' think it traces by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's something (a PowerShell pipeline) which may help get some status info</p>
<p>
</p><p>wevtutil el | sls "upd" | foreach {echo $($_);wevtutil gli $($_)}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are .etl files so maybe that's not the right thing to look at...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another tool which could be involved...</p>
<p>
</p><p>logman&nbsp; query</p>

</p>
<p>I purchased a password reset software. I have it on a USB drive and am trying to get a past a password on a HP Mini laptop that doesn't have a CD drive so USB is all i can use. We got to the BOOT order menu and I think I selected the correct option to make
 USB priority. But now when the laptop reboots it comes up with "NTLDR is missing Press any key to restart" &nbsp;Can someone help me with this?? I spent $20 on the software and really need it to work for me as it is supposed to do!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you using a dual boot computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sine you changed the boot order to boot from an USB, it is trying to boot from the USB, on the USB all you have is a software not the Windows 7 Operating
 System.</p>
<p>Change the boot order to boot from the hard drive again, unplug the USB and try to boot and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:
</b>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 32 bit and Aero Peek</h2>
                    We have windows 7 32 bit installed - areo peek and the thumbnails do not work. I was told by a technician that it is because the combination of the 32 bit OS and the graphic card installed, my computer would not be able to show those features. Is this
 true?

<p>﻿I could not find anything that indicates whether your ATI Radeon HD 3450 supports aero or not. Maybe run this and hopefully it will indicate if your display adapters will support Aero effects:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/aero_effects_not_working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gp/aero_effects_not_working</a></p>
<p>You might also call Dell to find this out - again, I could not find anything on their website to verify if the ATI Radeon HD 3450 supports aero effects.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think it does not support aero. Sorry to now be of more help. :)<br />

<p>We are actually using Windows 7 Professional the computer lists 2 graphic card adapters; I've listed the stats on those:</p>
<p>Display adapters: Productive Computer Insight PCI GDIHOOK5 Location unknown</p>
<p>ATI Radeon HD 3450 - Dell Optiplex Location PCI bus 1&nbsp; device 0, function 0</p>
<p>I am specifically asking about the Aero Peek feature and the Thumbnail feature. I know that the Aero Theme doesn't matter but the features may.</p>
<p>I am an adjunct instructor at a community college. I teach Windows 7 and those two features do not work on any computer on our campus. I am trying to find out why? I know that there are some features&nbsp; in some applications like Adobe Premier and MS Word that
 do not display as the book says, as well. Our tech dept told me that it was because we have a 32 bit version of OS and the graphic card. But I want to verify this, because if it is something we could fix via some simple change to user accounts, that would
 be great.</p>

</p><p>- Reset Windows to a new install</p>
<p>- Update video drivers</p>
<p>- Unplug monitors</p>
<p>- Clean old drivers out</p>
<p>There are a couple other minor things that I could be missing that I have tried.</p>

This is usually a video driver problem though it can be BIOS, chipset drivers, other<br />
drivers, other software or even hardware. <br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000116&nbsp; &lt;-- read this link<br />

<br />
</span></span></a></p>
==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Don't run Driver Verifier all the time as it can cause instability when there would otherwise be none. And I think this is the case here.<br />
<br />
<div>BugCheck C4, {f5, 0, ffffce8c7b0ccb00, 0}</div>
<div>Probably caused by : win32kbase.sys ( win32kbase!rimOnPnpArrived+254 )</div>
<br />
win32kbase.sys is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault. Further analysis did not help which is unusual with a Driver Verifier initiated BSOD.<br />
<br />
Use ALL the methods in the previously posted troubleshooter and only run Driver Verifier when a unknown cause of a BSOD event needs to be found.<br />

            <p>Well I just got a BSOD this one was the one that has been happening a lot. I'm not very good at reading the minidump file but as far as I can see it is a problem with nvlddmkm.sys which relates to my Nvidia graphics card but it could also be a combination

            <p>I will look through the forums and see if there is anything of use that pertains to my problem and try to see if I can find a fix. On another note, I looked at the bios updates after the version that I have. It doesn't seem like there had been anything really
 implemented other than "System Stability" and is only about 3 months newer than my current version. Would you still suggest going forth and updating the Bios in this case?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I have already checked and updated my Nvidia graphics drivers before and they have been current for this whole process. In addition I ran a memory test and a drive scan and both test came back with no errors detected.</p>

    <title>second hard drive no longer visible in Windows 7 Disk Management, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            second hard drive no longer visible in Windows 7 Disk Management, works in XP</h2>
                    HISTORY: I purchased a new 1TB Western Digital WD10EZEX internal hard drive and tried to add it as a second non-bootable drive on my Windows 7 PC. I went into Disk Management and accepted the defaults in the pop-up window/wizard. I do not recall exactly
 what I saw at this point however it did briefly show up in the bottom half of the Disk Management window, but either before or possibly during formatting, it vanished. After rebooting, it reappeared briefly, but vanished again. Now it stays gone, and I am
 unable to see it at all. <br />
<br />
QUESTION: How do I get the drive to reappear in Disk Management and/or be seen by Windows 7?
<br />
<br />
OTHER NOTES: The drive is installed in a removable drive tray drawer (effectively just an internal drive, as draw is just some connectors with the addition of a fan and an LED), and works fine on a Windows XP computer. After seeing the drive appear in the Windows
 XP computer, I also reformatted it on that PC just in case. The drive bay on the Windows 7 PC worked fine with a different smaller capacity SATA drive in the bay, and no connections were touched other than inserting/removing the drawer that now contains the
 new drive instead. The drive is recognized by the BIOS on the Windows 7 PC. I did notice an unexpected pause during booting while the BIOS said "Auto-Detecting SATA 4...Hard disk" though. Western Digital Data Lifeguard Diagnostics for Windows does not see
 the disk at all on that PC. a bootable CD with SeaTools for DOS, which starts fine when the drive is unplugged, fails to run correctly on that PC when this hard drive is connected.&nbsp; Both applications see the drive fine on the Windows XP PC.&nbsp; As far as I can
 tell, I have all the latest and greatest drivers for my motherboard.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any suggestions on getting this working!<br />

            I am testing the drive with a different SATA and power cable right now.&nbsp; So far it's working fine, but since it seems to be intermittent and even failed right after I posted that I thought I found the answer, I'm going to give it probably a few days of
 tests here before I decide I know what's going on.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It appears that for some reason that particular drive doesn't work while in that particular mobile rack (Kingwin KF-91 mobile rack) when it is in that specific PC (although supposedly it should.)&nbsp; My workaround was to swap the mobile racks between
 two PCs.&nbsp; It's not a final answer since things might stop working if/when the other PC gets upgraded, but works for now.&nbsp; I swapped it back and forth and verified that it repeatedly (or not at all) failed when doing some bulk file copying of a few folders
 in each case.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Things that were not the problem:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn't the SATA cable, nor seating of the SATA cable, replacing the cable did not fix it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn't the power cable, nor seating of the power cable, moving it to another cable, and even to it's own power cable, did not fix it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the rack seems to be part of the problem, it wasn't the rack just by itself, which works fine with that same drive in a different older PC, and previously worked fine in the original PC with several different drives.&nbsp; Kingwin says the KF-91 mobile
 rack should work fine with SATA III (something the failing PC has access to that the working PC does not utilize).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the drive seems to be part of the problem, it wasn't the drive by itself, which works fine when plugged directly into the same cables and connections it failed on when going through the rack.

            I forgot to mention in my previous post that I did update the BIOS, but that did not resolve the issue.&nbsp; I have all the most recent drivers for my motherboard.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If and when I find any additional information on this issue with specifics about why that rack/drive/motherboard combination doesn't work so as to identify the root cause of the problem, I'll try to update this thread with that info, until then I'm running
 ok with the combination of hardware shuffled around between this and a 2nd PC.<br />

<h2>            DDOS attack&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing GTA 5 in a party with friends, when I received a party invite from one of the people (Ayeeoh)&nbsp;in the online session we were playing in. When i joined the party both&nbsp;Ayeeoh and SE Fang were&nbsp;threatening&nbsp;to call the cops and tell them I was going
 to kill everyone in my house in 10 minutes, so that my house would be raided. Shortly after they threatened calling the police they then threaten to ddos my internet if i didn't let them kill me to make up for the times i killed them. I refused and as you
 guessed they ddosed my internet for a good 30 minutes. &nbsp;Luckily just a cop showed up at my front door asking if everyone was alright, not a swat team like they said.</p>
<p>It scares me that people i play with online are able to find out my exact address and everything about me just by my gamertag, and then can shut down all of my internet usage just because i killed them a few times on a game.&nbsp;I've played in the xbox 360 community
 for over 8 years and this is the first time something like this has ever happened to me. I hope something is done about this. I don't have any proof, but hopefully you take some action against these two (Ayeeoh and SE Fang). Hopefully you can listen to past
 party chats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again the two people involved were<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Hiire..</p>

<p>sorry you cannot report users on the forum you have to report them from your console. &nbsp;nobody can find your exact physical address from you unless you actually give it out. &nbsp;if they say they have it they are full of it.</p>

            <p>Greetings Hiire!</p>
<p>As davemcfly85 just explained, you'll need to use the report tool on your dashboard, to file a complaint against any user on Xbox Live that you consider have vioalated&nbsp;the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;Terms of Use, or Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>I would highly reommend you to block communiation and avoid these players, for future be.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, please phone your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and have them know about your situation, and to help you issue you a new unique public IP address. As long as you continue to use the very same public IP address, that they've used to carry out an attack, they can very well continue to keep overwhelm your network, and to prevent valid network traffic to pass through.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I already did, there is no report tool anywhere for ddos, and yes they can find your location ***. It's called getting your ip address and then googling the ip address to find your location. Don't reply to this if you don't know what you're talking about.
 Thanks.</p>

<p>These players need to be banned, they're nothing but bullies using illegal internet programs to knock off anyone who "wrongs" them. It's appalling how xbox can just snub their noses at something like this. I should not have to worry about people DDOSing
 me over a game just because I kill them. This is *** stupid.</p>

<p>It's not "tampering" cause they're not sending the attacks over xbox. They're using programs on a computer to get my ip address from my gamertag. They told me exactly what they were doing and demanded I let them kill me.
